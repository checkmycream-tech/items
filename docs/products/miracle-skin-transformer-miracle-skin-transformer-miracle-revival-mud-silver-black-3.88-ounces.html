            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it will be a miracle for my uneven skin tone, but it was a nice relaxing 15 mins...buying the full size for sure!</li>
            <li>and I was having some mild breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was hoping for too much!!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I have not seen any really positive differences using the &amp;#34;Miracle Revival&amp;#34; but my skin seems to have developed bumps after using it.</li>
            <li>My face felt very smooth and clean and was not dry when I used this.</li>

            <li> Because I use other products from this line, I expected it to be just as perfect...not so much.  </li>
            <li> and I am no where near half ways ways.</li>
            <li> In al the years I have been using facial products, I have never really used a masque, save for those paint on masques we used in the 70s and 80s that you peeled off like a gelatinous sheet.  </li>
            <li> Which I have never gone this long before without getting one.</li>
            <li> My pores definitely are smaller and look less &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; afterwards.  </li>
            <li> You can put it on dry skin or wet.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as I already use there other products (hyroactive cleanser &amp; microderm scrub)</li>
            <li> The mud is dark colored and has a jelly like texture that also feels granular.</li>
            <li> The only down thing to it is it&#x27;s not good to use everyday</li>
            <li> Regardless, this product, after the recommended 15 minute wait, did NOT easily rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I jave a scatter of small pimples on my forehead and they&#x27;re still there.  </li>
            <li> But they are usually sold out.</li>
            <li> Down side is that it&#x27;s expensive, $38 if you buy it at a store.</li>
            <li> This mask assists with getting all the bad stuff out and leaves my skin GLOWING.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Always enjoyed buying this for the 2nd time. My skin show great improvement.</li>
            <li> Best face mask I have ever tried, really truely gives your skin a flawless glow!</li>
            <li> The texture of this mask is amazing. I notice a difference in my skin if I go a couple of weeks without using it. Using weekly is ideal.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I use it when my skin needs a bit more hydration or before an important date.  Makes my skin look really young and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I remember using masks sometimes when I was younger, to clear my pores. More pores were looking clogged and I was having some mild breakouts.  I was hoping this help clear my skin.  The jar is nice and heavy.  The mud is dark colored and has a jelly like texture that also feels granular. So it spreads easier than some clays. You can put it on dry skin or wet. it dries after about 10 minutes.  It also washes off easy.  In that way I really like it. It has no obnoxious smell.  I always break out the next day when I use it or am flaky.  It could be that it brings stuff to the surface. I keep having that experience with this and other mud masks. So I think this might not be teh best way to exfoliate. However, as mud masks go, this is a nice easy one to use.</li>
            <li> This is pretty amazing I love the results. I suggest using it twice a week. This really enhances your complexion.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!! I have fussy skin. This mask assists with getting all the bad stuff out and leaves my skin GLOWING.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mud mask.  I am 53 and my biggest concern is hyper pigmentation caused by sun damage.  I am willing to try anything and love new products.  I used the whole sample, pleasant light smell, and waited 15 mins.  Washed off easily with warm water and the end result was soft supple skin.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it will be a miracle for my uneven skin tone, but it was a nice relaxing 15 mins...buying the full size for sure!</li>
            <li> Really liked the mask. Smells a little funny but it&#x27;s mud after all. Helps to control shine and minimize pores.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It makes your face tingle slightly, which feels as though it&#x27;s doing something good and it actually did improve my skin. I have recently had a case of adult acne and this helped calm down the inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;I routinely use several products of this brand and they are all quite good.</li>
            <li> I love to try new skin care products because I love healthy and fresh looking skin and creating a very natural look without the makeup!  Kohls has some impressive skin products, which is where I originally found this product, and I was not disappointed!  The results are immediate, when you put it on your face your face feels slightly tingly which is nice.  After removing the mask, my face looks much fresher and has a nice glow to it!  My pores definitely are smaller and look less &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; afterwards.  I use this mask 2 times a week but don&#x27;t think it would hurt to use it more times a week!  After using, I like to apply Grassroots Blue Algae cream to slightly moisturize and keep my face looking even more fresh!  Definitely recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mud mask! This is the first mud mask I have ever purchased. I wasn&#x27;t sure if u wanted to spend over $30 on a face product but after receiving a sample in my birchbox I went ahead and took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely helps control my break outs and prevent new ones. A little goes a long way! One jar will last you few months. I have been using this product for 2 months now, twice a week and I am no where near half ways ways. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> No benefit from it.  Initially my skin felt hydrated right after rinsing but then it got about as dry as with any other mud mask.  I jave a scatter of small pimples on my forehead and they&#x27;re still there.  If  it had gotten rid of them or left my skin more hydrated I&#x27;d give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> After using the Miracle Skin Transformer make up/sunscreen I bought this as I thought it would be as good a product as the Miracle Skin Transformer...To be honest, I have not seen any really positive differences using the &amp;#34;Miracle Revival&amp;#34; but my skin seems to have developed bumps after using it. It might be a coincidence and then again it might not agree with me...I do  not know if anyone else had this experience using it...I guess I was hoping for too much!!</li>
            <li> I really love taking care of my skin and this mask definitely does the trick.  I have tried several masks on the market and this is one of my favorites.  It improves the texture and tone of my skin  - the end result is soft, smooth and unclog pores!  Thank you Miracle Skin Transformer!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a ton, but it seems nice so far. Definitely not harsh and my skin does seem especially clean and healthier after use.</li>
            <li> I like this mask. It&#x27;s one of the few skin care products I&#x27;ve used that actually works. I don&#x27;t know if it will lead to long term results, but my skin looks better after I use this mask.</li>
            <li> Because I use other products from this line, I expected it to be just as perfect...not so much.  In al the years I have been using facial products, I have never really used a masque, save for those paint on masques we used in the 70s and 80s that you peeled off like a gelatinous sheet.  I think we did it because it was fun!  Regardless, this product, after the recommended 15 minute wait, did NOT easily rinse off.  It settled into places I did not realize I had, and then left my skin terribly red and irritated.  No, nope, nyet, nada...not for me!</li>
            <li> This mask feels so good and refreshing.  I just love it.  I am 56 going on 21!!</li>
            <li> My face felt very smooth and clean and was not dry when I used this. I felt like it reduced the redness and made the overall appearance better.</li>
            <li> WOW...Glamglow who?? Seriously people, try this mud mask, it BLOWS Glamglow out of the water for sure! You get tons of product at an affordable price! Expensive does not always mean better people. Check out Beautypedia.com, Glamglow actually has alot of skin irritants in it.</li>
            <li> This mud mask changed my skin, I work in the beauty industry and have once in awhile cyst acne. Which is very unfortunate because they don&#x27;t go away so easily. I decided to try this as I already use there other products (hyroactive cleanser &amp; microderm scrub) I use it once a week and as soon as you put it on...you can feel it working. I have been using this for 3 months now and not one cyst! Which I have never gone this long before without getting one. Down side is that it&#x27;s expensive, $38 if you buy it at a store. But they are usually sold out.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating mask. The only down thing to it is it&#x27;s not good to use everyday</li>
