            <li>Like it more than my Lancôme!!!  </li>
            <li>Great, flawless coverage without looking &amp;#34;make-upy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a moisturizer, SPF 40, and beautiful foundation coverage for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Works great does not feel like makeup</li>
            <li>No surprises, love it, best prices here</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is best for people with drier skin and who don&#x27;t mind having to wear another layer of makeup on top of the BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Amazon by far has the best prices on this great item!</li>
            <li>I am delighted.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>

            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>It is cost effective, because&lt;</li>
            <li>It goes on really nicely.</li>
            <li>The medium color was more fair than medium though.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance that is not too strong.</li>
            <li>Great price, quick shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>I prefer my BB Cream to be able to be used on its own instead of always as a foundation for more makeup.</li>
            <li>Makes my problem, aging skin look much better.</li>
            <li>I searched many places including the BB cream website</li>
            <li>I really love the concept of a BB cream.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d expect more from something that claims to be anti-aging, moisturizing and for all skin types.</li>
            <li>I have better results with Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS B &amp; B CREAM</li>
            <li>and I am glad that it worked out for others.</li>
            <li>I did not expect this because use of the product several times before resulted in perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of some of the reviews, but I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I found it to be more of a foundation than what I expect a BB Cream to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was thinner (more liquidy) instead of being a &#x27;cream.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I also had quite a bit of shiny from it, I think it was more oily than I need for my BB Cream to be, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I apply it similar to how I would apply a sunscreen, i get excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed bronzer and blush adhere to my face better when i&#x27;m wearing this bb cream</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t foundation supposed to make you look better?</li>
            <li>The tan color blended better with my fair-to-medium skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrance, so I was happy that this cream did not cause it to break-out, even after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>This is really a great product, I like the citrusy fragrance, and my skin actually is looking better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take along when I&#x27;m on the golf course</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a BB Cream made by L&#x27;oreal and have been fairly pleased with it, but noting that friends who purchased department store (specifically MAC) BB Cream enjoyed a smoother coverage, I decided to try this higher end product.</li>
            <li>It also made my pores look oddly huge --</li>
            <li>Not a chalky texture, but as though I put on makeup that is too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>But since I primarily use BB Cream as a solo natural-looking finish, I probably won&#x27;t order again without being assured that the color is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t fantastic and that she was in her fifties and has age spots because I am 54</li>
            <li>The cream was so light</li>
            <li>I was unsure whether I should order light or medium; I opted for medium and if anything it&#x27;s too light for me.</li>
            <li>BB creams are supposed to offer light coverage while combining the benefits of a moisturizer and sunscreen, which is SPF 40 for this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great alone, but I use it under foundation on work days, for extra coverage.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>When I needed more, I found this vendor via Amazon with a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the plus side, Hydroxatone claims 40 spf and offers good coverage.</li>
            <li>The more I (lightly) rub it in, it begins to just disappear, I believe it is being absorbed by my skin as a sunscreen would be.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this from another vendor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does offer light coverage and some days I do not want to wear a face full of foundation.</li>
            <li>I believe &#x27;light&#x27; must be for really fair skinned people, and I&#x27;m guessing tan would work well for me if I were at all actually tan.</li>
            <li>I see there are many positive reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;This cream has a pleasant smell, and seems to be a bit more tinted then my previous BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so well because it is complete as a sun protector, skin care and foundation.</li>
            <li>I did and received a container 1/2 full.  </li>
            <li>This cream feels cool on the skin, with a matte, rather than dewy, finish.</li>
            <li>I love BB Cream and had been using \\&quot;Skin Miracle\\&quot; BB cream, also in medium, and really liking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice BB cream that gave a smooth, matte finish (as opposed to some that leave skin dewy or satiny) and wore for several hours with no shine breakthrough on my oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>This anti-aging cream has a broad spectrum SPF 40 sunscreen, which is really nice.</li>
            <li>I live in the PNW, but still make sure to always wear sunblock</li>
            <li>The product was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;The texture and color was exactly what was expected; creamy beige with great civerage.</li>
            <li>The cream isn&#x27;t very creamy and sort of pulls at the skin when trying to smooth it in.</li>
            <li>My L&#x27;Oreal BB Cream is \\&quot;Light\\&quot;, but leaves my skin looking more like its natural color.</li>
            <li>The medium is definitely darker than the light, so if you have fair skin, definitely go for Light.  </li>
            <li>and so far she&#x27;s pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Good coverage even on older skin and 40 SPF is a big plus!  </li>
            <li>However, after trying this one, I&#x27;ll continue my search for one that&#x27;s right for</li>
            <li>I would skip this any day and actually put on a full face of makeup or use a better BB cream.</li>
            <li>I really like the high SPF content, which is higher than most BBs.</li>
            <li>It does not provide the coverage they claim, and the \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; they send along had to be expired, it smells old!  </li>
            <li>The texture of this cream was more like a foundation, and it gave enough coverage to skip foundation and just use a setting powder with it.</li>
            <li>I first used this product as a sampler at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking to cover and did not want to happen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did hold my powder on pretty well and the SPF appeared to work.</li>
            <li>It evened out my skin tone, minimizing my pores and hiding minor blemishes better than an over-the-counter BB cream that I tried (Garnier).</li>
            <li>I found I needed less foundation which is nice too.</li>
            <li>It actually settled into the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of other creams out there that smell pleasant, but this one is definitely not one of them in my opinion.</li>
            <li>- indeed - is much lighter than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>very disappoint</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll basically be paying high $&#x27;s for an SPF and that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really did.  </li>
            <li>It did not seem like there was a whole lot in the tube</li>
            <li>I have found this prooduct to work really well on all of those issues.  </li>
            <li>What else can I ask for, really?  </li>
            <li>thanks  glenn&lt;</li>
            <li>The Hydroxatone Anti-Aging BB Cream has SPF 40 and has more coverage than I expected.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly and actually covers some of my skin flaws.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin and was wearing Bare Minerals, but this is my new foundation for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for light, normal to oily complexions that like a little more coverage and need a little more boost in the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; department.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous to be able to replace foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen in one step, especially with something that offers other skin benefits.</li>
            <li>I realize that each company has different color palates, but this can be a problem for people who are ordering online, sight unseen, and are unable to discern which shade will work best for them.</li>
            <li>I will gladly return this product that I had only tried once if I could get my money back!!!!</li>
            <li>The main drawback is that this cream is on the pricey side, but otherwise, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin looked nice when I washed it off, but I felt very pale.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth but no real results.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t offer much about this so early in use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I hear any new news about this product.</li>
            <li>Super dry and no coverage at ALL.  </li>
            <li>The Medium shade was too light for me, and I suspect it contains not just a &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34; but an actual &amp;#34;whitener&amp;#34; as the Asian brands do.</li>
            <li>The cream comes out of a tiny hole, which I appreciated because you do not need much for each application.</li>
            <li>I always combine it with some additional moisturizer since I have super dry skin, but also it will help in spreading it</li>
            <li>Im in my late 40s and like many ladies, have light to medium wrinkles, large pores, uneven tone and some sun damage.  </li>
            <li>Medium works well for my currently really pale olive skin tone, but would be MUCH too light if I were anywhere near tan.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly without a problem and seems to even out my skin tone and slightly minimize pores.</li>
            <li>It smells terrific (slightly citrusy) and I was so pleased with the texture.</li>
            <li>This cream is a little thicker than I&#x27;m used to, so I apply it lightly.</li>
            <li>It comes out very chalky and not the same consistency as the Hydroxatone that I have been using.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a complete package ..</li>
            <li>It felt like I was putting on thick foundation, but it did not offer the benefits of a more fuller coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since BB creams (makeup in general) are really person specific, I would suggest doing a lot of research before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not having white streaks from normal sun screen.</li>
            <li>I love that it includes a broad spectrum SPF 40 sunscreen because that means I can cover more than one base just by applying one product.</li>
            <li>(I typically find \\&quot;light\\&quot; cosmetics to be right for me</li>
            <li>The one complaint I did hear was the tone of the color is too light, it&#x27;s rated \\&quot;medium\\</li>
            <li>It sometimes seems to settle in creases, visually creating wrinkles I never see otherwise; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t notice wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>After its absorbed it does not feel heavy or cake-y, I cant even feel it.  </li>
            <li>is pretty neat (previous was only SPF 20, which for here was</li>
            <li>The cream feels soft and not as thick as it looked at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick as BB&#x27;s go and reminded me of the heavier Asian brands I&#x27;ve tried more than the lighter American versions.</li>

            <li> and so far she&#x27;s pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Good coverage even on older skin and 40 SPF is a big plus!  </li>
            <li> However, after trying this one, I&#x27;ll continue my search for one that&#x27;s right for</li>
            <li> I would skip this any day and actually put on a full face of makeup or use a better BB cream.</li>
            <li> I really like the high SPF content, which is higher than most BBs.</li>
            <li> It does not provide the coverage they claim, and the \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; they send along had to be expired, it smells old!  </li>
            <li> The texture of this cream was more like a foundation, and it gave enough coverage to skip foundation and just use a setting powder with it.</li>
            <li> I first used this product as a sampler at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking to cover and did not want to happen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did hold my powder on pretty well and the SPF appeared to work.</li>
            <li> It evened out my skin tone, minimizing my pores and hiding minor blemishes better than an over-the-counter BB cream that I tried (Garnier).</li>
            <li> I found I needed less foundation which is nice too.</li>
            <li> It actually settled into the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of other creams out there that smell pleasant, but this one is definitely not one of them in my opinion.</li>
            <li> - indeed - is much lighter than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> very disappoint</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll basically be paying high $&#x27;s for an SPF and that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really did.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem like there was a whole lot in the tube</li>
            <li> I have found this prooduct to work really well on all of those issues.  </li>
            <li> What else can I ask for, really?  </li>
            <li> thanks  glenn&lt;</li>
            <li> The Hydroxatone Anti-Aging BB Cream has SPF 40 and has more coverage than I expected.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly and actually covers some of my skin flaws.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and was wearing Bare Minerals, but this is my new foundation for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for light, normal to oily complexions that like a little more coverage and need a little more boost in the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; department.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous to be able to replace foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen in one step, especially with something that offers other skin benefits.</li>
            <li> I realize that each company has different color palates, but this can be a problem for people who are ordering online, sight unseen, and are unable to discern which shade will work best for them.</li>
            <li> I will gladly return this product that I had only tried once if I could get my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> The main drawback is that this cream is on the pricey side, but otherwise, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked nice when I washed it off, but I felt very pale.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth but no real results.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t offer much about this so early in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if I hear any new news about this product.</li>
            <li> Super dry and no coverage at ALL.  </li>
            <li> The Medium shade was too light for me, and I suspect it contains not just a &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34; but an actual &amp;#34;whitener&amp;#34; as the Asian brands do.</li>
            <li> The cream comes out of a tiny hole, which I appreciated because you do not need much for each application.</li>
            <li> I always combine it with some additional moisturizer since I have super dry skin, but also it will help in spreading it</li>
            <li> Im in my late 40s and like many ladies, have light to medium wrinkles, large pores, uneven tone and some sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Medium works well for my currently really pale olive skin tone, but would be MUCH too light if I were anywhere near tan.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and evenly without a problem and seems to even out my skin tone and slightly minimize pores.</li>
            <li> It smells terrific (slightly citrusy) and I was so pleased with the texture.</li>
            <li> This cream is a little thicker than I&#x27;m used to, so I apply it lightly.</li>
            <li> It comes out very chalky and not the same consistency as the Hydroxatone that I have been using.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a complete package ..</li>
            <li> It felt like I was putting on thick foundation, but it did not offer the benefits of a more fuller coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since BB creams (makeup in general) are really person specific, I would suggest doing a lot of research before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not having white streaks from normal sun screen.</li>
            <li> I love that it includes a broad spectrum SPF 40 sunscreen because that means I can cover more than one base just by applying one product.</li>
            <li> (I typically find \\&quot;light\\&quot; cosmetics to be right for me</li>
            <li> The one complaint I did hear was the tone of the color is too light, it&#x27;s rated \\&quot;medium\\</li>
            <li> It sometimes seems to settle in creases, visually creating wrinkles I never see otherwise; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t notice wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> After its absorbed it does not feel heavy or cake-y, I cant even feel it.  </li>
            <li> is pretty neat (previous was only SPF 20, which for here was</li>
            <li> The cream feels soft and not as thick as it looked at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick as BB&#x27;s go and reminded me of the heavier Asian brands I&#x27;ve tried more than the lighter American versions.</li>
            <li> Like others, i was initially turned off by the thick, pancake-like texture of this when first applied.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to test any of the &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually apply this with my large elf face powder brush (that can also be used with wet products).</li>
            <li> Of course the Anti-Aging factor is over the long term</li>
            <li> to thick, very disappointing.can</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> Everything else causes dry flaky patches.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be lightweight enough for me -- I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I think this is because of the thick consistency, perhaps due to the high spf?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, it seems to accentuate any dryness or flakiness - and I have combination rather than dry skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the ladies who find it heavy and greasy just arent massaging it in enough.</li>
            <li> &quot; so understand this might be lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> This made my skin look worse, and feel really gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you initially put this on, it appears a bit chalky but after a few minutes it evens out.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but with my Rosacea I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and will not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money they will charge you.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m darker than \\&quot;fair,\\&quot; about average Caucasian tone</li>
            <li> For the price it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> CVS brand is better than this crap..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s due to poor color match or trouble getting the sunscreen to absorb completely.</li>
            <li> I use this daily b/c I have serious melasma and need to wear sunscreen all the time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my particular container was mismarked with the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I ordered it in medium, but it leaves me looking a little chalky.</li>
            <li> If the shade had been just a little closer to Medium, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like the medium for the times I&#x27;m using self-tanner and need a little darker version.</li>
            <li> It seemed dried out.  </li>
            <li> It also covers up the uneven color of my face, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how heavy this would feeling during the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but you can mix it with other face lotion if needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the cream is like thick paste,changes my face colour to dark brown.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I think yet.</li>
            <li> so not sure I don&#x27;t like it  Pamm maddon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the product I requested.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin drier than usual and accentuates the lines...makes my face looks unnatural and ghostly.  </li>
            <li> usually put on a moisturizer and primer before foundation,</li>
            <li> The BB cream&#x27;s texture made it hard to blend</li>
            <li> and I ended up removing all of it because it was streaky and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could deal with a hard to blend product since it did eventually blend out, but the smell was horrendous.</li>
            <li> A lot less expensive also.</li>
            <li> I realize those are ridiculous things to say about the product, but that is what I got.  </li>
            <li> it looked fake, was heavy , and nothing like it said it was.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of expensive creams and BB creams and CC creams and make up</li>
            <li> This was lousy, expensive and nothing like it was advertised to be.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was like the worst of both worlds: thick and heavy foundation crossed with that gloopy feeling from sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The texture is very thick and quite unpleasant to put on for a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and still looking for the correct product.  </li>
            <li> I do not know what that lady meant when she said it wasn&#x27;t horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No surprises, love it, best prices here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a BB Cream made by L&#x27;oreal and have been fairly pleased with it, but noting that friends who purchased department store (specifically MAC) BB Cream enjoyed a smoother coverage, I decided to try this higher end product. It smells terrific (slightly citrusy) and I was so pleased with the texture. It goes on smoothly and evenly without a problem and seems to even out my skin tone and slightly minimize pores. I love that it includes a broad spectrum SPF 40 sunscreen because that means I can cover more than one base just by applying one product. The only problem seems to be the color. I ordered it in medium, but it leaves me looking a little chalky. Not a chalky texture, but as though I put on makeup that is too light for my skin tone. My L&#x27;Oreal BB Cream is \\&quot;Light\\&quot;, but leaves my skin looking more like its natural color. This \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; colored cream looks nothing at all like the photo they provided for color selection and - indeed - is much lighter than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Light\\&quot;. I realize that each company has different color palates, but this can be a problem for people who are ordering online, sight unseen, and are unable to discern which shade will work best for them. Perhaps my particular container was mismarked with the wrong color. But since I primarily use BB Cream as a solo natural-looking finish, I probably won&#x27;t order again without being assured that the color is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I think yet.I have only been using this for a week.Smells nice.Makes my skin feel smooth but no real results.Too soon.</li>
            <li> Amazon by far has the best prices on this great item! It is cost effective, because&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a moisturizer, SPF 40, and beautiful foundation coverage for all skin types. I am a senior, thus I appreciate its anti aging properties as well.  But, my 30ish daughters use this product too.  The longer you use this cream, the better your skin will be!</li>
            <li> Makes my problem, aging skin look much better.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Great, flawless coverage without looking &amp;#34;make-upy&amp;#34;.  Like it more than my Lancôme!!!  A lot less expensive also.</li>
            <li> Even though the packaging is similar, I don&#x27;t know what this is.....definitely not Hydroxatone (Medium).  It comes out very chalky and not the same consistency as the Hydroxatone that I have been using.  I&#x27;m so disappointed and still looking for the correct product.  How do I go about getting a refund?  I will gladly return this product that I had only tried once if I could get my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping, quality product. I will definately reorder this product again.  I searched many places including the BB cream website</li>
            <li> The product was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;The texture and color was exactly what was expected; creamy beige with great civerage. I would recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I do not know what that lady meant when she said it wasn&#x27;t horrible it wasn&#x27;t fantastic and that she was in her fifties and has age spots because I am 54 I grew up in the sixties on the beach I do have age spots and freckles and this cream is awesome it hides my age spots and it blends my skin perfectly and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of expensive creams and BB creams and CC creams and make up and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> YUCK ........Did not like the cream at all..  Super dry and no coverage at ALL.  Not worth the money and will not recommend this product..  CVS brand is better than this crap.. very disappoint</li>
            <li> its not the same something is different Mine dosent day Hydroxatione  so not sure I don&#x27;t like it  Pamm maddon</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this from another vendor. I liked it so well because it is complete as a sun protector, skin care and foundation. When I needed more, I found this vendor via Amazon with a much more reasonable price. I am delighted.</li>
            <li> Pricey -- but I like the way it looks</li>
            <li> Works great does not feel like makeup</li>
            <li> This was lousy, expensive and nothing like it was advertised to be.  The cream was so light it looked fake, was heavy , and nothing like it said it was.  I used it once and threw it away</li>
            <li> Do not order this product!  I did and received a container 1/2 full.  It does not provide the coverage they claim, and the \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; they send along had to be expired, it smells old!  Definitely not worth the money they will charge you.  You&#x27;ll basically be paying high $&#x27;s for an SPF and that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders as a foundation.  It gives your skin a glow and covers any imperfections you may have,</li>
            <li> I really love the concept of a BB cream. It&#x27;s fabulous to be able to replace foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen in one step, especially with something that offers other skin benefits. However, after trying this one, I&#x27;ll continue my search for one that&#x27;s right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Hydroxatone claims 40 spf and offers good coverage. I like that the finish is relatively matte and not shiny. But on the other hand, it seems to accentuate any dryness or flakiness - and I have combination rather than dry skin. It sometimes seems to settle in creases, visually creating wrinkles I never see otherwise; I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t notice wrinkles yet. I think this is because of the thick consistency, perhaps due to the high spf?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also tend to make me look a bit chalky - I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s due to poor color match or trouble getting the sunscreen to absorb completely. I was unsure whether I should order light or medium; I opted for medium and if anything it&#x27;s too light for me. (I typically find \\&quot;light\\&quot; cosmetics to be right for me but I&#x27;m darker than \\&quot;fair,\\&quot; about average Caucasian tone I&#x27;d say.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;d expect more from something that claims to be anti-aging, moisturizing and for all skin types.</li>
            <li> The cream isn&#x27;t very creamy and sort of pulls at the skin when trying to smooth it in. I have better results with Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS B &amp; B CREAM I STOCK UP ON IT</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I really did.  It did not seem like there was a whole lot in the tube and when I went to apply it, it seemed like sand.  It seemed dried out.  I realize those are ridiculous things to say about the product, but that is what I got.  I gave up on it after two applications.  I see there are many positive reviews and I am glad that it worked out for others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the product I requested.  The packaging is the same, but the consistency is different and cakey.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin drier than usual and accentuates the lines...makes my face looks unnatural and ghostly.  For the price it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but with my Rosacea I have tried everything. This is really a great product, I like the citrusy fragrance, and my skin actually is looking better. A bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> I use this daily b/c I have serious melasma and need to wear sunscreen all the time.  It also covers up the uneven color of my face, which I appreciate.  It&#x27;s thick, but you can mix it with other face lotion if needed.</li>
            <li> All day coverage with sunscreen...it&#x27;s a complete package ..</li>
            <li> This is a nice BB cream that gave a smooth, matte finish (as opposed to some that leave skin dewy or satiny) and wore for several hours with no shine breakthrough on my oily T-zone. It&#x27;s a little thick as BB&#x27;s go and reminded me of the heavier Asian brands I&#x27;ve tried more than the lighter American versions. The Medium shade was too light for me, and I suspect it contains not just a &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34; but an actual &amp;#34;whitener&amp;#34; as the Asian brands do. My skin looked nice when I washed it off, but I felt very pale. It didn&#x27;t clog my pores and didn&#x27;t have a waxy or greasy feel. The texture of this cream was more like a foundation, and it gave enough coverage to skip foundation and just use a setting powder with it. I&#x27;d recommend this for light, normal to oily complexions that like a little more coverage and need a little more boost in the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; department. If the shade had been just a little closer to Medium, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars. The SPF of 40 is a bonus and didn&#x27;t break me out as sunscreens often do.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Good coverage even on older skin and 40 SPF is a big plus!  It was also $10 cheaper than my local supplier and no shipping fee!.</li>
            <li> I first used this product as a sampler at Ulta.  Loved it.  I&#x27;ve sampled it several times thereafter same place.  They were out online and in the store so I thought I would try Amazon.  I got the product and for some reason I did not have the same experience.  It actually settled into the fine lines around my eyes.  Exactly what I was looking to cover and did not want to happen.  I did not expect this because use of the product several times before resulted in perfect coverage. So...I am left confused and BB cream free since I returned it and do not know which to use.  If this expert product did not do well for me...after FINALLY purchasing a tube and not just sampling???? Is there one that will?</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of some of the reviews, but I absolutely love this. I have mature skin and was wearing Bare Minerals, but this is my new foundation for sure.</li>
            <li> BB creams are supposed to offer light coverage while combining the benefits of a moisturizer and sunscreen, which is SPF 40 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does offer light coverage and some days I do not want to wear a face full of foundation. The texture is very thick and quite unpleasant to put on for a BB cream. It felt like I was putting on thick foundation, but it did not offer the benefits of a more fuller coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put on a moisturizer and primer before foundation, but I skipped that with the BB cream. The BB cream&#x27;s texture made it hard to blend and I ended up removing all of it because it was streaky and hard to blend. I didn&#x27;t bother trying to put a moisturizer and primer underneath since it would defeat the purpose of the flexibility of the BB cream to have multiple benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could deal with a hard to blend product since it did eventually blend out, but the smell was horrendous. There are a lot of other creams out there that smell pleasant, but this one is definitely not one of them in my opinion. I would skip this any day and actually put on a full face of makeup or use a better BB cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this BB Cream. I found it to be more of a foundation than what I expect a BB Cream to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was thinner (more liquidy) instead of being a &#x27;cream.&#x27; I also had quite a bit of shiny from it, I think it was more oily than I need for my BB Cream to be, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hold my powder on pretty well and the SPF appeared to work. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to test any of the &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is best for people with drier skin and who don&#x27;t mind having to wear another layer of makeup on top of the BB Cream. I prefer my BB Cream to be able to be used on its own instead of always as a foundation for more makeup.</li>
            <li> Im in my late 40s and like many ladies, have light to medium wrinkles, large pores, uneven tone and some sun damage.  I have found this prooduct to work really well on all of those issues.  I&#x27;m not going to claim that it has corrected any of those issues, but it does improve the appearance of them.  Like others, i was initially turned off by the thick, pancake-like texture of this when first applied.  but then I realized it is an SPF40, and it seems similar in texture and thickness to a sunscreen lotion, so i proceeded to use it.  Glad I did.  I found that if I apply it similar to how I would apply a sunscreen, i get excellent results.  i continue to rub it in as I do a sunscreen, rather than just smoothing it on as I would a foundation.  The more I (lightly) rub it in, it begins to just disappear, I believe it is being absorbed by my skin as a sunscreen would be.  Yet it does even out my skin tone, hide imprefections, and lessen the look of my pores and wrinkles.  And Im gettng an SPF 40 protection.  What else can I ask for, really?  After its absorbed it does not feel heavy or cake-y, I cant even feel it.  Perhaps the ladies who find it heavy and greasy just arent massaging it in enough.</li>
            <li> cream to thick, very disappointing.can i return it.  thanks  glenn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cream is like thick paste,changes my face colour to dark brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year, but as soon as I started using it, I was getting compliments on my skin, and people were asking me what I use on my face.  It&#x27;s great alone, but I use it under foundation on work days, for extra coverage.  The medium is definitely darker than the light, so if you have fair skin, definitely go for Light.  I like the medium for the times I&#x27;m using self-tanner and need a little darker version.</li>
            <li> Love this. I have really dry skin in the winter and this is the only stuff I can use on it. Everything else causes dry flaky patches. I usually apply this with my large elf face powder brush (that can also be used with wet products). It goes on really nicely. I&#x27;ve noticed bronzer and blush adhere to my face better when i&#x27;m wearing this bb cream</li>
            <li> have been using for over a year. Love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for a woman in her 80&#x27;s and so far she&#x27;s pleased with the results. Of course the Anti-Aging factor is over the long term so I can&#x27;t offer much about this so early in use. The one complaint I did hear was the tone of the color is too light, it&#x27;s rated \\&quot;medium\\&quot; so understand this might be lighter than expected. It is rated at SPF 40 so helpful to protect from the harmful sun rays. I&#x27;ll update this review if I hear any new news about this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s easy to take along when I&#x27;m on the golf course and I&#x27;m not having white streaks from normal sun screen. Still look good even when I&#x27;m playing in the heat of the day.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. A little goes a long way. Goes on smooth and even. Great price at amazon!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be lightweight enough for me -- I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation. Unfortunately, this was like the worst of both worlds: thick and heavy foundation crossed with that gloopy feeling from sunscreen. It also made my pores look oddly huge -- what the? Isn&#x27;t foundation supposed to make you look better? This made my skin look worse, and feel really gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and that was in winter time! I can&#x27;t even imagine how heavy this would feeling during the summer.</li>
            <li> The Hydroxatone Anti-Aging BB Cream has SPF 40 and has more coverage than I expected. It evened out my skin tone, minimizing my pores and hiding minor blemishes better than an over-the-counter BB cream that I tried (Garnier). It has a pleasant fragrance that is not too strong. The cream comes out of a tiny hole, which I appreciated because you do not need much for each application. It goes on smoothly, and does not feel greasy. This cream feels cool on the skin, with a matte, rather than dewy, finish. My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrance, so I was happy that this cream did not cause it to break-out, even after prolonged use.  The medium color was more fair than medium though. The tan color blended better with my fair-to-medium skin. I really like the high SPF content, which is higher than most BBs. The main drawback is that this cream is on the pricey side, but otherwise, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging cream has a broad spectrum SPF 40 sunscreen, which is really nice. This cream is a little thicker than I&#x27;m used to, so I apply it lightly. The cream is medium tan in color and it goes on smoothly and actually covers some of my skin flaws. I found I needed less foundation which is nice too. The cream feels soft and not as thick as it looked at first. I like it and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. Now, do I appear younger? I don&#x27;t know of any cream that can do that for me, but I&#x27;ve got my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I love BB Cream and had been using \\&quot;Skin Miracle\\&quot; BB cream, also in medium, and really liking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a pleasant smell, and seems to be a bit more tinted then my previous BB cream.  I live in the PNW, but still make sure to always wear sunblock and so this being a SPF 40 is pretty neat (previous was only SPF 20, which for here was fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you initially put this on, it appears a bit chalky but after a few minutes it evens out.  I always combine it with some additional moisturizer since I have super dry skin, but also it will help in spreading it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any issues with breaking out, or any issues with this creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since BB creams (makeup in general) are really person specific, I would suggest doing a lot of research before purchasing.  Medium works well for my currently really pale olive skin tone, but would be MUCH too light if I were anywhere near tan.  I believe &#x27;light&#x27; must be for really fair skinned people, and I&#x27;m guessing tan would work well for me if I were at all actually tan.</li>
