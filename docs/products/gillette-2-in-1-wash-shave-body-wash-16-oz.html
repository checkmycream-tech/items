            <li> I prefer a bodywash that lathers and doesnt just fall to the shower floor like the gels usually do. This product is amazing and I highly recommend, be careful when openining if the box has been outside. One of the bottles caps came undone and evacuated a third of its contents near and around my face. Why does it burn!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really good on the skin in winter time. Keeps skin moist</li>

            <li> Exactly as advertised with the usual fast delivery</li>
            <li> Superb!!.. Smells great, exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This wash smells amazing and is great on the skin. The wash lathers so much that I only have to use about a quarter-sized amount on my scrubber, making it last a long time. My store stopped selling it and I tried just about everything else, this wash still wins.</li>
            <li> Best body wash on the market!</li>

            <li> This body was is great, rinses clean unlike a lot of all those others with heavy and oily feeling additives. For the price, it comes to about $3.46 per bottle which is even cheaper than my local Walmart which has them for $4.92! This is the more economical choice with my Prime membership.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried a bunch of different body washes and soap bars. My goal was something that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin but not have even a slight lady&#x27;s perfume smell. This is the one that won by a mile. Cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave me with flakey or dry skin anywhere and I smell like a man. Love this stuff and have been using it ever since.</li>
