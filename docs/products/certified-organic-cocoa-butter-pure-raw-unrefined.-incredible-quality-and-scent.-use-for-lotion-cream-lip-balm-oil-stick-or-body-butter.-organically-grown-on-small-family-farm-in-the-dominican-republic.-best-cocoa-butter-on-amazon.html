            <li> I have very dry skin on the legs and arms from hypothyroid, so this does help with the dryness.  </li>
            <li> I am going to use an empty baby oil bottle for the remaining.</li>
            <li> No super dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> I was seriously tempted to take a big bite.</li>
            <li> I got little tablets of Coco Butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this during the late summer, It didn&#x27;t arrive melted</li>
            <li> This is not good for grating into beauty products.</li>

            <li> Smells good enough to eat.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so much better than any other coco butter I have ever purchased. Pretty good quality too. I use it for lotions and hand/foot cream.  Also, just tried this one on a chocolate bath fizz recipe.  Really impressive.&lt;br /&gt;I would definately purchase this product again</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter was a great deal and while I&#x27;m very happy with the product, I do have to say that I&#x27;ve found more fragrant cocoa butters in the past. If you are using this cocoa butter straight then it&#x27;s a perfect amount of chocolate scent, but if you&#x27;re diluting it then the fragrance won&#x27;t be as strong as you&#x27;d like. Cocoa essential oil would have been a good addition to the lotion I made with this. The feel of the product on the skin is gorgeous, though.</li>
            <li> My son and I split this order to attempt making chocolate and this was a very nice choice, flavor-wise for chocolate making!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/12/16.  Back again for my third time!  So fresh and chocolatey smelling!  Very shelf stable...has stayed in the heavy opaque Ziploc bag it came in, on my pantry shelf for over a year still smelling and feeling as decadent as when it was first opened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even added some to my brownie recipe (tho not as the sole fat...) And it took them over the top!  Can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! Used it in my homemade body butter. I like the wafer discs better for measuring out what I want but the blocks will do. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smelled good enough to eat.  Product worked great.  Awesome quality.</li>
            <li> I love this butter!  The securely-sealed butter arrived in the form of chips and chunks, which I prefer.  The rich chocolate scent is divine.  I used it to make a body butter and scented it with essential oils.  The end product was a smooth, creamy, lightly scented butter.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I was floored by the incredible clean, chocolatey scent. I was seriously tempted to take a big bite. It melted wonderfully into a cp soap and smelled and worked magnificently. I will buy cocoa butter from noone else, this stuff is amazing quality.</li>

            <li> Admittedly we haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it smells divine and that&#x27;s exactly what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> Love! It smells great!  It works really well.  It comes in circle pieces (unlike what the pic shoes) which I was happy to find out.  I would definitely purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Great product for my body butters and soaps...thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes amazing! Works great for my recipes. Consistency is great. Love it! I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great quality!! I would highly recommend buying this. It was better than what I could have thought. I will likely repeat order this.</li>
            <li> Great all natural product. I use for my hair and skin.  This cocoa butter smells amazing. It makes makes my skin and hair so soft . LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> The quality is even better than I had expected! The mild cocoa chocolate scent is an added bonus! This has been a wonderful product to use in my body butters and soaping projects.</li>
            <li> Very yummy, I use this in my homemade lotion. Smells and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Looks and smells great</li>
            <li> This is great cocoa butter! I use it to make homemade dark chocolates :)</li>
            <li> OMG, I will NEVER again purchase Palmer &#x27;s cocoa butter!!!,,,This cocoa butter has definitely ruined me for any other. It is decadent and wickedly moisturizing, and delicious smelling. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. PLEASE everyone try this and see. TOTALLY hooked!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Smells like chocolate. Most importantly good moisturizer. Also, Cocoa Butter does clear up marks on the skin. Before I used it for the first time I melted it down on the stove and poured it in an empty container. It does harden later but I just put it in the microwave to soften. I am going to use an empty baby oil bottle for the remaining.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.  It&#x27;s very chocolatey.</li>
            <li> good product, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really loved my Cocoa Butter! The scent is magnificent and it feels really great on the skin. Just like home.</li>
            <li> I use this for my company&#x27;s organic body butter and everyone raves that it&#x27;s the best they&#x27;ve ever used. It definitely smells like coconut but mixes really well with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this for making white chocolate from scratch.  As soon as you open the package the room smells like cocoa.  It melts and tempers at the correct temperature.  This is a good product for making chocolate.</li>
            <li> Best cocoa butter hands down</li>
            <li> This product is great! Unlike most reviewers, I use the cocoa butter for baking and making my own home made frappes. I bought this during the late summer, It didn&#x27;t arrive melted and it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It arrived in large pieces inside a mylar envelope. Very happy with it&#x27;s condition, and have made chocolate twice with it now. I will order again!</li>
            <li> Skin soaks this stuff up</li>
            <li> Arrived in crumbles.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting that since I normally get these in blocks from other places.  Great product though.</li>
            <li> Did not smell fresh, and some of it appears to have some sort of gritty material in it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a block of Coco Butter. I got little tablets of Coco Butter. This is not good for grating into beauty products.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Its amazing!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how large a bar it was, but I am please with it.  I have very dry skin on the legs and arms from hypothyroid, so this does help with the dryness.  I just cut a piece off and rub in the pure butter onto my skin.  It will warm and melt in your hands as you rub it in.  I do a body scrub in the shower first.  Then I apply it after I towel dry off for silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Works great in my lotions, both soft lotions and bars.  Gives the end product a nice chocolate aroma.  No issues with the quality of the product received.  I&#x27;ve had the unused portion in my kitchen in the original packaging for over 6 months with no decrease in the quality or usability of the product.</li>
            <li> The perfectly sized pellets are so easy to work with.  This is a great product and my skin just soaks it in and is a lot happier.  No super dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to order cocoa butter.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I&#x27;m pleased.  There was a lot in the the pkg and it smelled great.  I am so glad to have found organic raw cocoa butter on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff in my baking and skin products. It smells great and adds wonderful flavor. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a very good grade of cocoa butter. If you&#x27;re new to to cocoa butter and not sure what to buy for cooking this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s high grade pure.</li>
            <li> this smells so good.. Used it to make body butter and every time i use the body butter, my dogs think they are getting treat.. ( i don&#x27;t think dogs should eat cocoa) but they think it smells good too :D</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter. Smells amazing and is so healthy for your skin. I will be ordering more. The seller is fantastic as well. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> SUPER QUALITY! I make soap and this product is fantastic. Be prepared though, it is alot!</li>
