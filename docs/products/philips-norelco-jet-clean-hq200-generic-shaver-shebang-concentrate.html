    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Now for the best part, which is that Shaver Shebang does an excellent job of cleaning my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this a very good alternative to the manufacturer&#x27;s brand name cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Over all a great buy.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product a shot after making my own with Organic Apple Vinegar and not caring for the smell.</li>
            <li>This sandlewood has a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent I got is OK also.</li>
            <li>and I think this is a much better</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get the factory stuff as they never stock in stores any more.</li>
            <li>This works fine and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I was very suprised at how effective this solution was.</li>
            <li>The system errors out when it is filled with this solution.</li>
            <li>The seller replaced the original product with an updated one and it now works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally, this product did not work in my Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaver Shebang seems to evaporate at about twice the rate of Norelco&#x27;s Jet Clean solution.</li>
            <li>It is also much more economical than the OEM product and the scent after cleaning is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I appreciated the quick response to my problems!</li>
            <li>For the person who wants the fresh  clean smell every day on the razor.  </li>
            <li>Chose it for the price and love it for the performance, will definitely be a regular customer.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Jet Clean takes about 12 days for enough solution to evaporate to where I either need to add to or clean and refill the cleaner&#x27;s solution tray.</li>
            <li>like saving money, and I love that is more natural than the other stuff.</li>
            <li>In addition, my cleaner does not always recognize that there is enough solution in the tray; however this is easy to remedy by just pushing the start button again and it will go ahead</li>
            <li>Perhaps the Norelco brand has certain chemicals that the cleaning system detects.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this product was that it only took two days from order placement to recieve product from the other side of the US.</li>
            <li>exactly the same product but in a natural way and a cheaper way!!</li>
            <li>The fluid level has to be almost exactly at the max fill line...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like it enough to probably buy it again after the first bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood seems to do a good job cleaning my razor, the only thing negative that I have noticed is that it does leave a residue that is a little harder to clean off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also takes much longer to fully dry.</li>
            <li>A few months back I tried the original electric shaver cleaner Sandalwood Tee.</li>
            <li>However, Shaver Shebang gets to this point after only five days, leaving me with a decision as to whether to add to the solution tray or to change the cleaner completely.</li>
            <li>as feature, and I don&#x27;t mind it too much, but it was a little jarring the first time when it was still wet the next day after a cleaning</li>
            <li>Only difference I see is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to evaporate as completely from the razor head and sometimes there is a little liquid left when you first start to shave.</li>
            <li>and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had other less significant issues with Shaver Shebang.</li>
            <li>Smells good and is indeed less expensive.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with norelco razor systems.  You get an out of solution error which is like a printer out of ink error. It won&#x27;t run the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> lasts a lot longer then the Norelco and is much less expensive. The scent I got is OK also. Over all a great buy.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a shot after making my own with Organic Apple Vinegar and not caring for the smell. This sandlewood has a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like saving money, and I love that is more natural than the other stuff. But I think because it has a lower &amp;#34;solvent&amp;#34; content, it makes the sensors in the cleaning base MUCH more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;. The fluid level has to be almost exactly at the max fill line...it can&#x27;t be too low or too high by even a little bit, or the base will flash the &amp;#34;change fluid&amp;#34; lights at you. Even when it is exact, it will fail a lot of times and require multiple button presses to get it to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also takes much longer to fully dry. I know it lists &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; as feature, and I don&#x27;t mind it too much, but it was a little jarring the first time when it was still wet the next day after a cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it enough to probably buy it again after the first bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Chose it for the price and love it for the performance, will definitely be a regular customer. Try it ... you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> exactly the same product but in a natural way and a cheaper way!! way to go.</li>
            <li> I was very suprised at how effective this solution was. The amazing thing about this product was that it only took two days from order placement to recieve product from the other side of the US. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the person who wants the fresh  clean smell every day on the razor.  Works well.</li>
            <li> it works.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the Norelco stuff.</li>
            <li> I hope my electric razor did not break.</li>
            <li> The seller replaced the original product with an updated one and it now works fine. I appreciated the quick response to my problems! It is also much more economical than the OEM product and the scent after cleaning is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, this product did not work in my Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System. The system errors out when it is filled with this solution. Perhaps the Norelco brand has certain chemicals that the cleaning system detects. Maybe this has changed since I purchased it in December of 2013.</li>
            <li> A few months back I tried the original electric shaver cleaner Sandalwood Tee. That product did not please me, but now it has been replaced by Shaver Shebang and I think this is a much better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;First of all Shaver Shebang comes in small packets of the concentrated product. The user mixes one packet into a 16oz bottle which is supplied. This amount is enough to fill my Norelco cleaner three times. Now for the best part, which is that Shaver Shebang does an excellent job of cleaning my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shaver Shebang seems to evaporate at about twice the rate of Norelco&#x27;s Jet Clean solution. Jet Clean takes about 12 days for enough solution to evaporate to where I either need to add to or clean and refill the cleaner&#x27;s solution tray. However, Shaver Shebang gets to this point after only five days, leaving me with a decision as to whether to add to the solution tray or to change the cleaner completely. In addition, my cleaner does not always recognize that there is enough solution in the tray; however this is easy to remedy by just pushing the start button again and it will go ahead and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had other less significant issues with Shaver Shebang. The packets of concentrate are to be opened by bending the packet across the middle and squeezing the concentrate into a plastic bottle. I found this to be awkward because it is messy to get out of the packet and the opening in the bottle is not very large (1 3/8\\&quot; in diameter). A suggestion that I would make is that Shaver Shebang come in an unscented form. As it is now there are two scents from which the purchaser must choose.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood tree cleaner for norelco electric shaver. It does not clean my shaver and it smells after a couple of shaves. It was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.  I no longer can find it in Walmart so I am happy to find it here.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells good and is indeed less expensive. Unfortunately,  I haven&#x27;t had enough time to make a true comparison.</li>
            <li> I find this a very good alternative to the manufacturer&#x27;s brand name cleaner.  Works very well for me.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> For some reason the cleaner/charger does not recognize the fluid and will not keep the blades in the solution.</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood seems to do a good job cleaning my razor, the only thing negative that I have noticed is that it does leave a residue that is a little harder to clean off.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get the factory stuff as they never stock in stores any more. This works fine and will buy again. Only difference I see is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to evaporate as completely from the razor head and sometimes there is a little liquid left when you first start to shave.</li>
