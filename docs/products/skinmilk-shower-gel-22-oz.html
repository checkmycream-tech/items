            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>

            <li>Smells delicious but leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>SMELLS great for long time and makes very smooth.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s considerably cheap and easy to find in grocery stores.</li>
            <li>Anyway, now the patches have healed up &amp; for months i&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
            <li>I smell vanilla but also a light spice, maybe nutmeg?  </li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacturer and was relieved to hear it was available online.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic smell.</li>
            <li>I already feel like I have gotten a great value for my money, and I&#x27;m only half-way through the jug!  </li>
            <li>It also lathers well and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Just using it those three times made my skin smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Skin Milk Shower Gel is such a great scent, and cleans without drying.  </li>
            <li>I have a preference for milk-based products, and when I saw this, I got overly excited.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead and I have very fair, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Add it to your bath and have yourself a nice milk bath that makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I had to use special body washes that have no perfumes dyes or detergents in them.</li>
            <li>The gentle scent was even noticed by my 5 year old nephew who said &#x27;you smell really nice&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>and it reacts to my skin differently, still smells good</li>
            <li>and I loved it discovering it at a local Publix store.</li>
            <li>I have never felt more committed to a particular brand of bath product.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to products costing twice as much.</li>
            <li>The whole Skin Milk line is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Beyond worth the money.</li>
            <li>When you lather this up you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>and you have to get right on the skin to notice.</li>
            <li>In general they don&#x27;t lather up &amp; they feel more like moisturizer than body wash.</li>
            <li>that I buy large quantities so as to never run out!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I first started using this years ago</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a bust for me, however, since skin types vary so much, I just recommend keeping that in mind while you try it (and you should!).</li>
            <li>we got exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>The pump dispenser is a real asset in the shower, also!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for a while now and find them to be super for those us us who can&#x27;t use highly scented and perfumed lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li>You get a lot of it for a pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to have super sensitive skin anymore</li>
            <li>Creamy texture and not too much fragrance, feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li>The shower gel is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>and it does a decent job of making me feel clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of the reviews of this and many other products</li>
            <li>Affordable high quality product, the whole family uses it with pleasure.</li>
            <li>I use only on special ocassions.</li>
            <li>Recently I had three special events in a row to attend to so</li>
            <li>The only problem is the company has lost most of its&#x27; main stream resellers and I can only find it online now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to get excited about mediocre products, but this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like heavily scented products, including shower gels, and don&#x27;t wear perfume because so many people have allergies to it.  </li>
            <li>I will always remain loyal to the Skin Milk product for as long as they are on the market.</li>
            <li>but idk I&#x27;m in New York now</li>
            <li>I live this shower wash.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet yet subtle scent and a really rich and creamy lather that leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve literally been bathing in milk.</li>
            <li>I love this product, however, I am giving it a low rating so that it shows as a contrast &amp; hopefully will be informative for other buyers in advance.</li>
            <li>This shower gel makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>If the pump is important to you (as it seems to have been for a previous reviewer), know that it&#x27;s no longer included with one and is instead a flip-top/cap.    </li>
            <li>The soft vanilla and milk scents is so comforting, not to mention how it leaves the skin.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, almost vanilla scent but is neither masculine or feminine in smell.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li>I have extremly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>A faint vanilla smell and good lather makes this a winner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time (i use 2-3 squirts &amp; it lathers up really well)</li>
            <li>However, soaps and lotions with lactic acids help reduce the problem and Skin Milk, so far, is the best and least expensive assistance out there.  </li>
            <li>With KP, the body produces too much keratin which clogs the hair follicles in the larger muscle areas as mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint, was many reviews said it left your skin so incredibly soft, but I found myself still having to apply lotion after showering.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is just right; not too ovepowering nor too bland.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft and I have dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Way more subtle than some of the other body washes on the market.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much either if yuu pour in a little at the start of the bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bar was a little expensive a good $ 7.00</li>

            <li> Creamy texture and not too much fragrance, feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li> The shower gel is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> and it does a decent job of making me feel clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of the reviews of this and many other products</li>
            <li> Affordable high quality product, the whole family uses it with pleasure.</li>
            <li> I use only on special ocassions.</li>
            <li> Recently I had three special events in a row to attend to so</li>
            <li> The only problem is the company has lost most of its&#x27; main stream resellers and I can only find it online now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to get excited about mediocre products, but this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavily scented products, including shower gels, and don&#x27;t wear perfume because so many people have allergies to it.  </li>
            <li> I will always remain loyal to the Skin Milk product for as long as they are on the market.</li>
            <li> but idk I&#x27;m in New York now</li>
            <li> I live this shower wash.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet yet subtle scent and a really rich and creamy lather that leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve literally been bathing in milk.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however, I am giving it a low rating so that it shows as a contrast &amp; hopefully will be informative for other buyers in advance.</li>
            <li> This shower gel makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> If the pump is important to you (as it seems to have been for a previous reviewer), know that it&#x27;s no longer included with one and is instead a flip-top/cap.    </li>
            <li> The soft vanilla and milk scents is so comforting, not to mention how it leaves the skin.</li>
            <li> It has a soft, almost vanilla scent but is neither masculine or feminine in smell.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li> I have extremly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> A faint vanilla smell and good lather makes this a winner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time (i use 2-3 squirts &amp; it lathers up really well)</li>
            <li> However, soaps and lotions with lactic acids help reduce the problem and Skin Milk, so far, is the best and least expensive assistance out there.  </li>
            <li> With KP, the body produces too much keratin which clogs the hair follicles in the larger muscle areas as mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, was many reviews said it left your skin so incredibly soft, but I found myself still having to apply lotion after showering.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is just right; not too ovepowering nor too bland.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and I have dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Way more subtle than some of the other body washes on the market.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use much either if yuu pour in a little at the start of the bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bar was a little expensive a good $ 7.00</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something in my local drug store that would work as well (no heavy scents, oils or other ingredients that clog my pores).  </li>
            <li> I have used this product and other products for gentle cleansing and there is NOTHING absolutely NOTHING WRONG with the SMELL or the LATHER or ANYTHING, it does what IT SAYS makes the SKIN SOFT and MOIST.</li>
            <li> Please note that Amazon is (apparently) now receiving the same bottles as other providers - which does NOT include the pump that SkinMilk used to package this product with.    </li>
            <li> but it dulls down as the product gets older and is in no way a deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I have also used it as shave cream, and I get far less irritation.  </li>
            <li> but it does go a long way, once you get used to the texture.</li>
            <li> I try to be careful since having a surprise eczema outbreak last year.</li>
            <li> So if you have eczema or other such skin problems you might want to skip on this.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry skin, so I ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my skin, but I still had to apply lotion after the shower</li>
            <li> I was very sad to find it was no longer available in stores!</li>
            <li> I have keratitis polaris (little bumbs on the back of arms, cheeks, thighs, etc) and lactic acid products</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say beyond the title.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited because I have HORRIBLE dry skin and eczema patches and this is the first thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that has not left my skin feeling tight and thirsty.</li>
            <li> THERE&#x27;S NOTHING WRONG with this product that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> SO WHY are so many of the NICE products getting an insane or crazy person to complain about these PRODUCTS?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as lathery as some other shower gels which took some getting used to</li>
            <li> BUT IT MAKES MY SKIN LITTLE DRY.</li>
            <li> I have break outs on my back and my skin care esthetician recommended an expensive daily wash she sold in her shop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so anxious I won&#x27;t find it anymore -</li>
            <li> I usually look out for organic products.</li>
            <li> It cleans well but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave a weird slimy film either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive though .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is not great</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon.</li>
            <li> it being at a dollar store knowing that their products are expensive.</li>
            <li> but I was shocked by just seeing the brand Skin Milk again and</li>
            <li> I hated using them.</li>
            <li> Some of the body washes for us guys smell terrible weather</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Creamy texture and not too much fragrance, feels luxurious.  Would prefer it without sulfate and tetrasodium EDTA, which is a preservative that&#x27;s made from the known carcinogen, formaldehyde and sodium cyanide.  Should have checked the ingredients before I purchase!  I have a preference for milk-based products, and when I saw this, I got overly excited.  Would not re-buy.</li>
            <li> I used to love using this soap when I was in GA but idk I&#x27;m in New York now and it reacts to my skin differently, still smells good though</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel.  I use it every day.  Way more subtle than some of the other body washes on the market.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of the reviews of this and many other products and I sincerely hope a lot of the viewers read this view. I have used this product and other products for gentle cleansing and there is NOTHING absolutely NOTHING WRONG with the SMELL or the LATHER or ANYTHING, it does what IT SAYS makes the SKIN SOFT and MOIST. SO WHY are so many of the NICE products getting an insane or crazy person to complain about these PRODUCTS? THERE&#x27;S NOTHING WRONG with this product that&#x27;s right it&#x27;s PERFECT for daily use. Picasso..................</li>
            <li> was exited to get but it was busted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dial, Zest and many others body washes but there&#x27;s no comparison. A little goes a long way. This shower gel lathers very well and has an attractive vanilla scent -- it&#x27;s a great value. I guarantee - one try and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth, rich foaming and moisturizing shower gel with a pleasant smell. Affordable high quality product, the whole family uses it with pleasure.</li>
            <li> I read an online review of several shower gels for men. The person testing the products stated that Skin Milk is his &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shower gel for every day use. I have a problem with dry skin, so I ordered a bottle. I will say, this feels really good. The lather is great and the scent is not too feminine for a man to use. It is very light and you have to get right on the skin to notice. It does not interfere with any cologne that I use. My skin is noticeably softer after a couple of weeks use. That being said...&lt;br /&gt;I will not be ordering more from Amazon. I paid over $9 because I did not want the six-pack for a trial (about $6 each). I happened across the product at a local grocery store for about $4.50 (same size). Sorry Amazon. You are still my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for shopping. Just not for this product.&lt;br /&gt;My rating is for the product only, and is without a doubt one of the best performing shower gels I have used to date.</li>
            <li> I first started using this years ago and I can&#x27;t stop using it. The only problem is the company has lost most of its&#x27; main stream resellers and I can only find it online now.</li>
            <li> This body wash is bananas. The soft vanilla and milk scents is so comforting, not to mention how it leaves the skin. You must try this.</li>
            <li> Received my order of this product nicely packed in a timely fashion...Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a while now and find them to be super for those us us who can&#x27;t use highly scented and perfumed lotions, etc.  This works as well as or better than the extremely expensive brands and I love the quality.</li>
            <li> Please note that Amazon is (apparently) now receiving the same bottles as other providers - which does NOT include the pump that SkinMilk used to package this product with.    If the pump is important to you (as it seems to have been for a previous reviewer), know that it&#x27;s no longer included with one and is instead a flip-top/cap.    I love this product, however, I am giving it a low rating so that it shows as a contrast &amp; hopefully will be informative for other buyers in advance.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item a long time ago and had forgotten how wonderful it was.  Came across it by mistake and figured why not try it again and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Plenty of moisture and bubbles and the scent is divine.  I smell vanilla but also a light spice, maybe nutmeg?  You can&#x27;t beat the price and size either!  So glad I found you again &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Very gentle and smells great. It has a soft, almost vanilla scent but is neither masculine or feminine in smell.</li>
            <li> I have used Skin Milk bar soap they had before and I loved it discovering it at a local Publix store. My skin was soft and supple after using it. The bar was a little expensive a good $ 7.00 Then one day it was no where to be found on the shelves and I return to using Dove. But today I just found the Skin Milk shower gel in Dollar Tree I havent tried the shower gel before but I was shocked by just seeing the brand Skin Milk again and it being at a dollar store knowing that their products are expensive.They also have the body lotion I am so excited to be using Skin Milk again!!!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It moisturizes the skin. It smells great without being overpowering. The whole Skin Milk line is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have break outs on my back and my skin care esthetician recommended an expensive daily wash she sold in her shop.  I used it for a while and loved how it felt, but the cost was overwhelming after a while.  I was trying to find something in my local drug store that would work as well (no heavy scents, oils or other ingredients that clog my pores).  I grabbed a bottle of Skin Milk and couldn&#x27;t believe how it worked!!!  I was so pleased I found somthing for about $6 instead of the $60+ I was spending.  The gentle scent was even noticed by my 5 year old nephew who said &#x27;you smell really nice&#x27;!  Can&#x27;t beat that endorsement.  I was sickened when I went back to the drug store and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I was in a panic.  I contacted the manufacturer and was relieved to hear it was available online.  I&#x27;ve been so anxious I won&#x27;t find it anymore - that I buy large quantities so as to never run out!</li>
            <li> Really great stuff, non-irritating &amp; really great voluminous, silky bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use much either if yuu pour in a little at the start of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not great but it dulls down as the product gets older and is in no way a deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff i use it 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> Smells great, helps your skin a ton, I am definitely going to be buying more.</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this stuff.  The fragrance is not vanilla, exactly, but goes great with the body butter I use on my hands and arms; I get compliments all the time when I&#x27;m out &amp; about. Lathers creamy and beautifully with a body puff, and the scent while showering is awesome.  I don&#x27;t like heavily scented products, including shower gels, and don&#x27;t wear perfume because so many people have allergies to it.  This is perfect in every way.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff. My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to get excited about mediocre products, but this stuff is AMAZING. It has a sweet yet subtle scent and a really rich and creamy lather that leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve literally been bathing in milk. I&#x27;m so excited because I have HORRIBLE dry skin and eczema patches and this is the first thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that has not left my skin feeling tight and thirsty. I love it! I love it so much! And it&#x27;s considerably cheap and easy to find in grocery stores. Beyond worth the money. I wish I could find the lotion in stores. BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell. I love this body milk!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say beyond the title.  The jug itself is pretty cute, the smell is nice, and the texture of the soap feels good.  I already feel like I have gotten a great value for my money, and I&#x27;m only half-way through the jug!  Will definitely buy again, and this may become my go-to soap from now on.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is just right; not too ovepowering nor too bland. I have never felt more committed to a particular brand of bath product. I will always remain loyal to the Skin Milk product for as long as they are on the market. My skin responds well to the shower gel and lotion. Some body lotion leave me itching after use, NOT Skin Milk. I highly recommend this to anyone especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I live this shower wash. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin. Very smooth and lathers nicely. It smells wonderful too! Great great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have extremly sensitive skin. I usually look out for organic products. I went to kroger and picked up this product, when i used it, the results were amazing. SMELLS great for long time and makes very smooth.</li>
            <li> This shower gel makes your skin so soft! Add it to your bath and have yourself a nice milk bath that makes your skin so soft! Smells very good such as a light vanilla scent! This makes my skin so soft and I have dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this and it does a decent job of making me feel clean but not dry. It&#x27;s not as lathery as some other shower gels which took some getting used to but it does go a long way, once you get used to the texture.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so glad I am able to find it since none of the stores carry it any longer.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and I have very fair, sensitive skin. This soap cleanses my skin very nicely and doesn&#x27;t make me itchy or irritated (which most soaps do to me), but I didn&#x27;t notice a drastic change in moisture in my skin. It didn&#x27;t dry my skin, but I still had to apply lotion after the shower otherwise my skin would start bothering me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and totally worth it for the affordable price (if you buy it with a free shipping order, even better). It smells really lovely but isn&#x27;t overpowering. It also lathers well and goes on smooth. My only complaint, was many reviews said it left your skin so incredibly soft, but I found myself still having to apply lotion after showering. This isn&#x27;t a bust for me, however, since skin types vary so much, I just recommend keeping that in mind while you try it (and you should!).</li>
            <li> Love this body wash, we used to buy it at K-Mart and Wal-Mart, sometimes in a drug store.  When we couldn&#x27;t find any anywhere, we looked on Amazon and viola....we got exactly what we wanted.  Amazon is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought the skin milk and body cream several years ago. I&#x27;ve used it sparingly because until now I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I use only on special ocassions. Recently I had three special events in a row to attend to so of course I used my precious skin milk which has retained it&#x27;s wonder fragrance as well as its effectiveness. Just using it those three times made my skin smooth as silk. It is far superior to products costing twice as much. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll get be hooked like me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap &amp; most drugstores now carry it. The bottle lasts a long time (i use 2-3 squirts &amp; it lathers up really well) Plus it smells so good.  Nice subtle scent, not overpowering. and my skin feels great after using this body wash.  It cleans well but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave a weird slimy film either. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  beware, this product does have SLS &amp; perfumes in it.  I try to be careful since having a surprise eczema outbreak last year. I never had a problem in my life til last year, i don&#x27;t know what happened. but i suddenly had crusty patches all over my arms &amp; legs &amp; stomach that wouldn&#x27;t heal. I had to use special body washes that have no perfumes dyes or detergents in them. In general they don&#x27;t lather up &amp; they feel more like moisturizer than body wash. I hated using them. Anyway, now the patches have healed up &amp; for months i&#x27;ve been fine. I don&#x27;t seem to have super sensitive skin anymore &amp; personally i&#x27;ve had no problems using this body wash. Then again my eczema outbreak seems to be an isolated incident, probably set off by an allergic reaction to something. So if you have eczema or other such skin problems you might want to skip on this.</li>
            <li> Great soft fragrence and not at all drying to the skin. It is a great way to clean the skin before using Skin Milk Lotion.</li>
            <li> Skin Milk Shower Gel is such a great scent, and cleans without drying.  I have also used it as shave cream, and I get far less irritation.  The pump dispenser is a real asset in the shower, also!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. BUT IT MAKES MY SKIN LITTLE DRY.</li>
            <li> I bought this one is a face wash and fell in love with it!!! it was years and years ago and I can no longer find this product in stores!! The body wash I have ran across but not the face wash. I have sensitive skin and nothing else worked so I was very sad to find it was no longer available in stores! It leaves my skin feeling very silky smooth and a great fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I have keratitis polaris (little bumbs on the back of arms, cheeks, thighs, etc) and lactic acid products help ease these bumps.  Skin Milk is the best body wash even for those with sensitive skin.  I switched from Aveeno when I started developing an allergic reaction to it and wish I had switched years ago.  With KP, the body produces too much keratin which clogs the hair follicles in the larger muscle areas as mentioned above.  40% of the world&#x27;s population has this issue, especially those of Scottish and British backgrounds and there isn&#x27;t a cure.  However, soaps and lotions with lactic acids help reduce the problem and Skin Milk, so far, is the best and least expensive assistance out there.  Thank you Skin Milk for my beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> its a great soap never dries your skin! this one never leaves my skin itchy after shower. I love it! it has nice light vanilla scent!</li>
            <li> The shower gel is very soothing to the skin. It feels like you are wrapped in softness after a shower.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle and good smelling body wash , I really enjoy it .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive though .</li>
            <li> Smells delicious but leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Some of the body washes for us guys smell terrible weather it&#x27;s the woodsy scent or over cologne smell, but this body wash is lightly scented which made my wife happy and it gives a great wash. When you lather this up you get your moneys worth. The size is great too and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Best shower gel out there.  I wish they would go back to the pump style.</li>
            <li> Found out about this on a blog. Both my wife and I use it. A faint vanilla smell and good lather makes this a winner. You get a lot of it for a pretty reasonable price. I don&#x27;t think you can find this in CVS.</li>
