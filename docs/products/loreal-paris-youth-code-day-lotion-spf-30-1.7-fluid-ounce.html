            <li>very smooth and light!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used moisturizers at all price points, and this one is fantastic for anti-aging!  </li>
            <li>As soon as the furnace starts up, I will probably need to use another more potent moisturizer in addition to this.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this one delivers.</li>
            <li>I AM PLEASED</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it as an alternative to Pro-X if you don&#x27;t want to spend $30 or more for this type of lotion.</li>
            <li>It appears more supple and youthful and feels a lot softer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and I love that it has a built in SPF, which saves me a step.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others but I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day Lotion..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasure to get more than I</li>
            <li>I love how this lotion is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I love the SPF factor also.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this from Smiley360 to try out in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is...just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and I love that the SPF is 30.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in the store and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Helps me take better care of my face.</li>
            <li>Very easy to spread, feels light on the skin.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, so having the serum along with the face lotion and the day lotion with the sunscreen makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li>I love the it goes on easily and provides a strong SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF 30 in a light lotion that really improves my skin texture at a good price.</li>
            <li>For those who prefer high quality, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li>WORKS FINE.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes fine for me</li>
            <li>It works just fine, but there are no added benefits to this product.  </li>
            <li>but I will say that is a light, easily absorbable cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The SPF 30 is great and necessary!</li>
            <li>It feels light and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is the spf, but there are lots more face creams out there with spf</li>
            <li>Great for my dry, maturing skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on cleanly without any greasy after feel.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to wear under make up and still have good sun protection.</li>
            <li>I have less noticeable fine lines and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Non greasy day lotion that absorbs quickly and has the added benefit of the SPF30.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always taken care of skin with products not meant to work magic, you know leaning on the fact that I was young</li>
            <li>Will try for one more month then will not waste anymore money.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the better skin care products on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, it keeps my skin soft and protected with the SPF.</li>
            <li>though I have young skin, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of any lines and seems to sit on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>this goes on smoothly, protects from the sun and makes your face feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>This Lotion is really nice, makes my skin smooth and gives me natural even tone, softens it and moisturizes it all day long.</li>
            <li>Maybe using both product at the same time would work more</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and so smooth</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast and no damage to the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I use this first thing every morning.</li>
            <li>always gives me soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Although it wasn&#x27;t quite as effective as the Pro-X, it came close and it was significantly less money than the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li>With all the creams out there, this certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>At first this seemed like a decent product.</li>
            <li>With the pump flat lid it is easy to apply on face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Prefect stuff, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It hydrated really well, but is not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH THAT</li>
            <li>and I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY</li>
            <li>It worked reasonably well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li>I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day</li>
            <li>But the screen is gentle on the skin and works for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much because of this</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it really does anything for your skin.</li>
            <li>It really does keep my skin hydrated and moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I paid so much for it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that it makes your age disappear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s metered so you don&#x27;t get to much.  </li>
            <li>I use all the day, it give a natural fresh and radiance  look.</li>
            <li>My face texture is so much softer.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the money, I&#x27;ve had better results using cheaper products.</li>
            <li>My skin is relatively dry, blemish free.  </li>
            <li>Decent lotion.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin because of psoriasis and this works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I like the high SPF, but it does nothing else.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Once it soaks into the skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky; however, as far as doing anything for lines, wrinkles or firming, don&#x27;t count on that unless you are young and showing the first signs of aging.</li>
            <li>The  smell is good but the package is quite poor.</li>
            <li>I live in NorCal and the sun</li>
            <li>And I tried a few things and so far the most I like is this L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, it does not list an expiration date on the package so therefore there is no way to know if the sunscreen is still working or if the product is very old.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading some reviews stating that it works well for younger women that are showing those first signs of aging.</li>
            <li>packaging has changed,  but product is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised for \\&quot;younger skin showing the first signs of aging\\</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old</li>
            <li>makes the skin so soft and moist.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to a lot of products</li>
            <li>People ask me what I use on my skin as my face look young (wrinkle-wise).</li>
            <li>I like this product, keep my skin soft and moist, preventing the age effect.</li>
            <li>This product has to be over 2 years old...</li>
            <li>This makes my skin soft, nourished without being shiny, and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>But upon reaching 35 I began looking for something a bit more serious.  </li>
            <li>though it is a thick cream, it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH THAT</li>
            <li> and I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY</li>
            <li> It worked reasonably well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day</li>
            <li> But the screen is gentle on the skin and works for about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much because of this</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it really does anything for your skin.</li>
            <li> It really does keep my skin hydrated and moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I paid so much for it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that it makes your age disappear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s metered so you don&#x27;t get to much.  </li>
            <li> I use all the day, it give a natural fresh and radiance  look.</li>
            <li> My face texture is so much softer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money, I&#x27;ve had better results using cheaper products.</li>
            <li> My skin is relatively dry, blemish free.  </li>
            <li> Decent lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin because of psoriasis and this works very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I like the high SPF, but it does nothing else.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Once it soaks into the skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky; however, as far as doing anything for lines, wrinkles or firming, don&#x27;t count on that unless you are young and showing the first signs of aging.</li>
            <li> The  smell is good but the package is quite poor.</li>
            <li> I live in NorCal and the sun</li>
            <li> And I tried a few things and so far the most I like is this L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, it does not list an expiration date on the package so therefore there is no way to know if the sunscreen is still working or if the product is very old.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading some reviews stating that it works well for younger women that are showing those first signs of aging.</li>
            <li> packaging has changed,  but product is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised for \\&quot;younger skin showing the first signs of aging\\</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old</li>
            <li> makes the skin so soft and moist.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to a lot of products</li>
            <li> People ask me what I use on my skin as my face look young (wrinkle-wise).</li>
            <li> I like this product, keep my skin soft and moist, preventing the age effect.</li>
            <li> This product has to be over 2 years old...</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft, nourished without being shiny, and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> But upon reaching 35 I began looking for something a bit more serious.  </li>
            <li> though it is a thick cream, it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> not been using long enough to report on any significnt differences in my skins appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you have very dry skin, this won&#x27;t be moisturizing enough used alone.</li>
            <li> I was using Olay Pro-X Daily Repair Lotion with SPF 30 until it became temporarily unavailable (for reasons unknown).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things in that time, but keep coming back to this - its a keeper!</li>
            <li> Skin feels dry after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep my skin soft and subtle, but it protects me from the sun too.</li>
            <li> After I put it on my face stays shiny all day, it wont soak into the skin, and it is constantly running down my face and getting in my eyes, and I don&#x27;t have to sweat for this to happen.</li>
            <li> I tried many $$$ expensive creams, and it&#x27;s hard to tell difference.  </li>
            <li> except be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> When the bottle seems empty, I pull off the lid to get the remaining in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I can notice a difference in my skin from just starting to use this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> and it really not made the difference for me until know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to notice a few lines that probably aren&#x27;t yet noticeable to other people and it is starting to bother me.  </li>
            <li> I sweat a lot on my face , this product is not oily and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful in appllying it.</li>
            <li> It was less greasy than a lot of other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> It has never clogged a pore (miracle!), and helps with lines and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;VE NEVER HAD A MOISTURIZER THAT DOES BOTH...ELIMINATE BLEMISHES FROM COMING UP AND HEALS THE DARK SCARS, ACNE DARK SPOTS.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel weighed down or like you have a mask on.</li>
            <li> I just do a slight dusting over with some mineral powder and it takes all the shine away.</li>
            <li> I have to pump the dispenser up and down about 20 times to get a few drops to come out.</li>
            <li> Goes on easiy but does tend to leave a little shine on your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little perfumey-scented, but it dissipates after a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and</li>
            <li> i use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Half the price as the drugstore!  </li>
            <li> I am very careful of the products I try because if they are too drying I will have a serious reaction to them.</li>
            <li> So thats not too bad for a high spf lotion.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever put on sunscreen unless it&#x27;s in my lotion because (even though I&#x27;m 32)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for at least a year now.  </li>
            <li> but the product came with the head broken so at this point I have a hard time squeezing the cream out of the bottle</li>
            <li> nOt happy about it, but what can ya do</li>
            <li> although not hot can be brutal.</li>
            <li> This works at a fraction of the cost of the expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I paid the crazy amount of money for this product in order to ease my worries and I&#x27;m a bit angry</li>
            <li> Made me break out bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This moisturizer is very good</li>
            <li> Product was suppose to be 1.7 fl oz and I received 1.0 fl oz. nOt happy about it, but what can ya do</li>
            <li> Prefect stuff, highly recommended! I think they may have discontinued it but otherwise great! The wife loves it and she looks great :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used moisturizers at all price points, and this one is fantastic for anti-aging!  It hydrated really well, but is not at all greasy.  It has never clogged a pore (miracle!), and helps with lines and dark spots.  I&#x27;ve used it for at least a year now.  I&#x27;ve tried other things in that time, but keep coming back to this - its a keeper!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Goes on easiy but does tend to leave a little shine on your face.  I use a Matte afterwards.  I love the it goes on easily and provides a strong SPF.&lt;br /&gt;Have not been using long enough to report on any significnt differences in my skins appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great moisturizer for the price!</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and I&#x27;ve always taken care of skin with products not meant to work magic, you know leaning on the fact that I was young, I didn&#x27;t need miracle products.  Just maintenance.  But upon reaching 35 I began looking for something a bit more serious.  And I tried a few things and so far the most I like is this L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code line.  This product doesn&#x27;t work miracles but it&#x27;s stronger than you regular firming lotion or hydrating lotion.  It does make your skin firmer and your completion clearer.  It works.  If you&#x27;re looking for something stronger L&#x27;Oreal does have a concentrated version of this product but it lacks the Sunscreen.  So I haven&#x27;t tried it.  I don&#x27;t like the sun so I prefer this one.  Maybe using both product at the same time would work more but I&#x27;ll stick with this alone for now.  On a side note I do use the eye cream for this line as well but that&#x27;s another product and another review.</li>
            <li> I think SPF 30 is the minimum sun protection factor anyone should be using on the face/neck.  I&#x27;ve used this all summer, and now going into fall also, and even though I&#x27;ve been outdoors sometimes hours at a time, not once has my face or neck been burned. However, if you have very dry skin, this won&#x27;t be moisturizing enough used alone. As soon as the furnace starts up, I will probably need to use another more potent moisturizer in addition to this. It&#x27;s a little perfumey-scented, but it dissipates after a minute or so.  Once it soaks into the skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky; however, as far as doing anything for lines, wrinkles or firming, don&#x27;t count on that unless you are young and showing the first signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I feel very good after using this youth code day lotion. Moisture your skin and not oily at all. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these last month, used it and see no results. Will try for one more month then will not waste anymore money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Youth Code products about 6 months.  They make my skin feel great.  Great pricing on Amazon for them, too.  I live in the desert, so having the serum along with the face lotion and the day lotion with the sunscreen makes my face feel great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I feel very good after using this youth code day lotion. Moisture your skin and not oily at all. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers with SPF in them and they tend to burn especially around the eyes. I like this cream because it doesn&#x27;t do that at all and it is very light. There is no burning at all. I recommend this for someone who uses a moisturizer every day under their makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE HAD ACNE SINCE A TEENAGER AND I&#x27;VE NEVER HAD A MOISTURIZER THAT DOES BOTH...ELIMINATE BLEMISHES FROM COMING UP AND HEALS THE DARK SCARS, ACNE DARK SPOTS. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I&#x27;VE TOLD YOU JUST EVERYONE WHO HAS SKIN PROBLEMS ABOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT AND OFTEN TIMES WHEN I ENCOUNTER PATIENTS WITH SKIN ISSUES, I ADD IT AS AN ADJUNCT TO ANTIBIOTICS ...I LOVE THIS SO MUCH</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the better skin care products on the market. I&#x27;ve tried many and this one delivers. It&#x27;s light so you don&#x27;t feel weighed down or like you have a mask on. It absorbs into the skin immediately and provides excellent sun protection. I live in NorCal and the sun although not hot can be brutal.</li>
            <li> The cream itself it&#x27;s great! very smooth and light! but the product came with the head broken so at this point I have a hard time squeezing the cream out of the bottle</li>
            <li> This Lotion is really nice, makes my skin smooth and gives me natural even tone, softens it and moisturizes it all day long. I like it a lot. Will stick with Youth Code products for a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading some reviews stating that it works well for younger women that are showing those first signs of aging. I have used up almost a bottle and I am very dissatisfied. I have not seen any change in my skin at all. But my biggest problem with this is how greasy it is. After I put it on my face stays shiny all day, it wont soak into the skin, and it is constantly running down my face and getting in my eyes, and I don&#x27;t have to sweat for this to happen. The only good thing is the spf, but there are lots more face creams out there with spf and that don&#x27;t make your face all slimy. Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> makes the skin so soft and moist. I use it every day, morning and night . I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> THE CREAM IS GREAT, I REALLY FIND IT AMAZING FOR MY SKIN AND IT REALLY WORKS FINE. I AM PLEASED</li>
            <li> I was using Olay Pro-X Daily Repair Lotion with SPF 30 until it became temporarily unavailable (for reasons unknown).  I had to find another lotion with SPF and tried the Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day Lotion, SPF 30.  It worked reasonably well for me.  Although it wasn&#x27;t quite as effective as the Pro-X, it came close and it was significantly less money than the Pro-X.  I&#x27;d recommend it as an alternative to Pro-X if you don&#x27;t want to spend $30 or more for this type of lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel and look. It appears more supple and youthful and feels a lot softer. The SPF 30 is an added benefit. My skin is sensitive to a lot of products but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this one. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. SPF 30 is just what I need. Good under makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  There is no substitute.  Makes my skin extra hydrated. Note : packaging has changed,  but product is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product. I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin that&#x27;s combination that still breaks out from time to time. I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line. The lotion is very light but does a great job moisturizing right where I need it. It&#x27;s not greasy and I love that it has a built in SPF, which saves me a step. I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and I just love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; across my skin when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Firs time trying this product and I just love it. I sweat a lot on my face , this product is not oily and a little goes a long way.  Great seller!</li>
            <li> Decent lotion. Only issue is it does not actually hydrated well. Skin feels dry after a couple hours. But the screen is gentle on the skin and works for about 6 hours. So thats not too bad for a high spf lotion.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion - except be careful when using it. It burns the heck out of your eyes if you get it close to them. I am very careful in appllying it. I haven&#x27;t used it much because of this so I don&#x27;t know if it really does anything for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others but I love the way this makes my skin feel. Does not leave and oily feel and is weightless on the skin. The SPF 30 is great and necessary! I will continue to use the youth code line.</li>
            <li> Half the price as the drugstore!  No different than if I had bought them at a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> Youth Code Day Lotion provides moisture and sun protection with SPF 30.  I use it every day.  People ask me what I use on my skin as my face look young (wrinkle-wise). With the pump flat lid it is easy to apply on face and neck.  When the bottle seems empty, I pull off the lid to get the remaining in the bottle. I would not go outside without it.</li>
            <li> Non greasy day lotion that absorbs quickly and has the added benefit of the SPF30. My skin feels smoother and looks really nice. I can notice a difference in my skin from just starting to use this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I love my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day Lotion.. Not only does it keep my skin soft and subtle, but it protects me from the sun too.</li>
            <li> I have to pump the dispenser up and down about 20 times to get a few drops to come out.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this holds moisture to my skin quite well.  It feels light and smooth on my skin.  I recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered two 1.7 ounce bottles and received four 1 ounce bottles. It&#x27;s a pleasure to get more than I expect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF 30 in a light lotion that really improves my skin texture at a good price.</li>
            <li> It works as a sunscreen but makes my skin oily. While using this my face got some pimples because it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to spread, feels light on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use L&#x27;Oreal in the it a great product. This lotion feels good on you skin and helps with the texture of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for some time now and like the way it makes my skin feel and look. A really nice product.</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I love the SPF factor also.  I hardly ever put on sunscreen unless it&#x27;s in my lotion because (even though I&#x27;m 32)  I breakout with sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this moisturizer because it has the 30 SPF. At first this seemed like a decent product. It moisturizes fine for me but I found that after a week or so I started having breakouts and they haven&#x27;t let up the entire 2 months I&#x27;ve been using this product. So, I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena SPF15 since I never had breakouts with that product.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry, maturing skin.  I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but I donÂ´t feel that difference. IÂ´ve been using it for couple of months and it really not made the difference for me until know</li>
            <li> Love this cream, it keeps my skin soft and protected with the SPF.</li>
            <li> Made me break out bad!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this from Smiley360 to try out in exchange for my honest opinion. I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream Moisturizer for about 2 weeks ago and I am in love with it. My skin feels so soft and so smooth like never before. It really does keep my skin hydrated and moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is a thick cream, it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> This product has done nothing to improve my skin. I gave it 3 stars because it moisturizes well and I like the high SPF, but it does nothing else. It&#x27;s not worth the money, I&#x27;ve had better results using cheaper products.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is...just ok.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and though I have young skin, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of any lines and seems to sit on top of the skin.  It&#x27;s advertised for \\&quot;younger skin showing the first signs of aging\\&quot; so I think that&#x27;s me.  I&#x27;ve started to notice a few lines that probably aren&#x27;t yet noticeable to other people and it is starting to bother me.  I paid the crazy amount of money for this product in order to ease my worries and I&#x27;m a bit angry I paid so much for it.  At the drugstore, after a ton of coupons I paid about 10-12 dollars.  It works just fine, but there are no added benefits to this product.  I am probably not going to repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t really say that it makes your age disappear but I will say that is a light, easily absorbable cream.  It&#x27;s metered so you don&#x27;t get to much.  One or Two pumps is all it takes.  It has a pleasant light scent and I love that the SPF is 30.  Just perfect to minimize UVA/UVB skin damage.  I have been using this for about three years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin smooth. I also mix it with rose hip oil. It&#x27;s gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li> I liked this sunscreen lotion.  It was less greasy than a lot of other products I have used.  However, it does not list an expiration date on the package so therefore there is no way to know if the sunscreen is still working or if the product is very old.</li>
            <li> I like this product, keep my skin soft and moist, preventing the age effect. I use all the day, it give a natural fresh and radiance  look.</li>
            <li> It work really good!  One of the best in the market.  I will not change it for anything.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good price vs. Walgreens</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store and fell in love with it. Looked it up online and it was $4 cheaper!</li>
            <li> The item arrived in an unopened obx... but it still had an IRC coupon on it dated to expire 10/2013.  This product has to be over 2 years old... I don&#x27;t consider that &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this goes on smoothly, protects from the sun and makes your face feel fresh and soft. quite nice looking on a shelf too.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin because of psoriasis and this works very well. I am very careful of the products I try because if they are too drying I will have a serious reaction to them. This makes my skin soft, nourished without being shiny, and works well under makeup. Shipping is fast and no damage to the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time. Goes on cleanly without any greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I am 57 and my skin looks great. I don&#x27;t even use foundation anymore. I just do a slight dusting over with some mineral powder and it takes all the shine away. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this first thing every morning. Helps me take better care of my face. Eliminates dryness and helps protect against further sun damage.</li>
            <li> The  smell is good but the package is quite poor. For those who prefer high quality, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> i use this everyday. never greasy. always gives me soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing since using it!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. It moisturizes my skin without giving me a greasy look. This is my second bottle of this lotion and I have noticed a big difference in my skin. I have less noticeable fine lines and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> With all the creams out there, this certainly does the job.  My skin is relatively dry, blemish free.  It gives it the moisture it needs.  I tried many $$$ expensive creams, and it&#x27;s hard to tell difference.  This works at a fraction of the cost of the expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Always a great item. Packaged great every time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It is light enough to wear under make up and still have good sun protection.</li>
            <li> left my face all gross and oily. I have combo skin</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light, quickly absorbs, and is great under a translucent powder. It is shiny alone though. I would use it again.</li>
            <li> this is a very good lotion for the affordable price.</li>
            <li> My face texture is so much softer.</li>
