            <li>Although, this does look a lot better on my vanity than some wash rag discolored by eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful tool to have when doing make up.</li>
            <li>I do think I could just buy the filler, but I love the tin for travel.</li>

            <li>Looking forward to more of your products.</li>

            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty impressed that it took the shadow right off a brush with fresh product on it.  </li>
            <li>, just clean one brush in between eyeshadow application!</li>
            <li>also love that refills are available, too.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was pretty much sold right after the recommendation from him, because he&#x27;s awesome, but once I got it, I was in awe of how well it works.</li>
            <li>Thisbworks amazingly well, and its been very gentle on my brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pretty impressed with this brush cleaner and would recommend it to people looking for an easy way to clean your eye brushes between colors.</li>
            <li>Works amazing  so fast</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s meant to do and is easy to store and clean.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Use it all the time when I do weddings, quick and easy way to transition between colors</li>
            <li>Great for everyday, better for makeup artists.</li>
            <li>helps me clean brushes in between clients</li>
            <li>But otherwise, the Colour Switch is impressive and I was surprised at how well it worked with regular shadows.  </li>
            <li>I have all my clients using it to now when they see how fast and easy it is to clean the makeup of the brush!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to do anything special to it before</li>
            <li>I appreciate this cool tin that i can travel with or pack in my make-up case in purse,whatever,it works wonders and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Cool product that&#x27;s gonna make eyeshadow application</li>
            <li>Love this product,  works really well,  cleans brushes quickly</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty cool!</li>
            <li>This sponge does exactly what is says it&#x27;s going to do!</li>
            <li>Great little device...</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the brushes, especially the goat haired kind, stay a bit stained, but they do not transfer that color onto the lid, or to where you are blending.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very many brushes and it is a pain to wash them and then wait for them to dry before I could use them again.  </li>
            <li>It really works and worth what I payed for!  </li>
            <li>I tend to use 2 of my favorite It brushes for my entire shadow look,so i constantly have to wipe it on a tissues,this saves time and works 100% better!</li>
            <li>Vera Mono Color Switch is easy to use, and not messy.  </li>
            <li>Great for those who like to use the same brush for multiple colors when doing eyeshadow looks.</li>
            <li>So far the product seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>You dont need to really press down at all to clean them, and the sponge is super easy to clean out.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>Just bought a stippling sponge for like 3 or 4 dollars and it does exactly what this thing does...</li>
            <li>This product cleans my brushes so fast!</li>
            <li>but then you buy the refill and its much cheaper !</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>It really does work!  </li>
            <li>a makeupjunkie does exactly what it says ANAZING</li>
            <li>I use this lovely color switcher every single time i do my makeup.</li>
            <li>super useful if you use a lot of different</li>
            <li>It is truly a miracle worker, and there is a reason everyone talks about this amazing little guy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective at cleaning POWDERY substances off of brushes, but I find that it gets dirty very quickly, and stops working as well.</li>
            <li>It truly does remove all the shadow making my make up routine so much easier and quicker in the morning.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want to bring your whole brush set.</li>
            <li>it really helps for using your brush color after color when applying your eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes!</li>
            <li>It does not splay your brushes, and it really does get rid of the color on the brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works very well and it does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>i really didn&#x27;t think this would  work be</li>
            <li>This really works and it works well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works.</li>
            <li>20 dollars might seem steep for a sponge in a tin, and it is; but not having to clean brushes in between colors only to end up with some accidental blending changes everything.</li>
            <li>So much easier to be able to use just a couple brushes instead of several different ones during application.</li>
            <li>Why pay 20 or more dollars for a peice of stippling sponge in a decorative case, when you can just buy a stippling sponge or a hair donut for just a few dollars...</li>
            <li>love it when i have multiple colors shadow colors to work with and limited amount of brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, just someone new to experiments with makeup.  </li>
            <li>This definitely shouldn&#x27;t be used as an alternative to cleaning your brushes regularly, but it&#x27;s great if you need to use the same brush for different colors in the same day/makeup application.</li>
            <li>Works great especially when you&#x27;re down to only a cpl brushes needed to do multiple tasks, travel, artistry.</li>
            <li>It does the same exact thing..</li>
            <li>Helps when using a light and dark color eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>You can go from Black to Light Cream and you just brush it off on the sponge and never see a trace of it on your face.  </li>
            <li>Surprised how well it works if you are using powder shadow and want to change colors to give layering and depth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather use a wash rag and get the same results.</li>
            <li>You still would have to deep clean your brushes weekly with a conventional method.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says - use a dark color, brush against this and switch to a white color.</li>
            <li>just swirl your &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; brush on the black sponge and rightaway you can use that brush again with different eye shadow :)&lt;br /&gt;its a bit expensive at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but overall,  I really like it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but overall,  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a cool little idea, and it works as advertised, but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> But none the less, it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Let dry before next use.</li>
            <li> It removes eyeshadow color from the bristles so you can use the same brush to switch to a different color; without having to wet the bristles and waiting for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> Have no idea how long I have managed without it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> and you do not have to wait for your brushes to dry to use it again.</li>
            <li> When it gets dirty flip it over then to clean simply rub across a cleansing bar and rinse.</li>
            <li> I can even use the same brush to apply white shadow after using black shadow!!</li>
            <li> It has definitely cut down on the time I spend washing makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> a whole lot less frustrating.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found with this that is not great is that if you use a sparkly pigment or shadow, it doesn&#x27;t get all the sparkly particles off the brush and some of that can transfer to your next shadow.  </li>
            <li> I saw a review on YouTube for this product and it looked promising, sadly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Seriously disappointed with this. I saw a review on YouTube for this product and it looked promising, sadly, it does not even begin to take excess color out of my brushes - a paper towel works just as well, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I will not re-purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It really works and worth what I payed for!  It has sped up my morning makeup routine and is a solid investment.  No need to buy extra makeup brush, just clean one brush in between eyeshadow application!</li>
            <li> love it when i have multiple colors shadow colors to work with and limited amount of brushes.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty cool! It truly does remove all the shadow making my make up routine so much easier and quicker in the morning.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! ,who woulda thought! I am a sucker for these genius ideas that seem to be ingenius. I appreciate this cool tin that i can travel with or pack in my make-up case in purse,whatever,it works wonders and gets the job done. I tend to use 2 of my favorite It brushes for my entire shadow look,so i constantly have to wipe it on a tissues,this saves time and works 100% better! WOOHOOOOO! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I works great for changing in between shadow colors. Saw on a Gossmakeupartist video.</li>
            <li> I love love love this item.  Now I only use one brush for all the colors I decide to use for the day.  I bought one for my daughter because she begged me for one after trying mine.  If anyone has anything bad to say about this product, they are lieing.  Everyone who uses eye shadow needs this item.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  works really well,  cleans brushes quickly</li>
            <li> This really works! Swipe a makeup brush a few times and you&#x27;re ready for the next color!  (I hope I don&#x27;t find it damages the brushes after a year of use! ;) ) How did I do makeup without this?</li>
            <li> Best thing ever. Now i done have to brush my brushes on a hand towel to switch colors in the middle of applying that days make up.</li>
            <li> This looks like just some gimmick, but I absolutely love it, it does work!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I think this is crazy... Why pay 20 or more dollars for a peice of stippling sponge in a decorative case, when you can just buy a stippling sponge or a hair donut for just a few dollars... It does the same exact thing.. That&#x27;s what I did. Just bought a stippling sponge for like 3 or 4 dollars and it does exactly what this thing does...</li>
            <li> Surprised how well it works if you are using powder shadow and want to change colors to give layering and depth.</li>
            <li> It is very good  . I love it</li>
            <li> Thisbworks amazingly well, and its been very gentle on my brushes. You dont need to really press down at all to clean them, and the sponge is super easy to clean out.</li>
            <li> This is great for in between washes, you can do all of your eye make up with one brush. A must have when traveling and you don&#x27;t want to bring your whole brush set.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this...it really helps for using your brush color after color when applying your eyeshadow.  You can go from Black to Light Cream and you just brush it off on the sponge and never see a trace of it on your face.  Excellent product!!!  Its one of those...why didn&#x27;t I think of that products!!!!</li>
            <li> I just luvd it..very helpfull indeed!</li>
            <li> I love love this!! I can&#x27;t believe how it work.</li>
            <li> It works!  It&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> I thought with all the great YouTube reviews out there, that this was gonna be awesome. I had high hopes! But none the less, it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a cool little idea, and it works as advertised, but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price point. I&#x27;d much rather use a wash rag and get the same results. Although, this does look a lot better on my vanity than some wash rag discolored by eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective at cleaning POWDERY substances off of brushes, but I find that it gets dirty very quickly, and stops working as well. Also, it won&#x27;t work with any sort of liquid or cream makeup. This definitely shouldn&#x27;t be used as an alternative to cleaning your brushes regularly, but it&#x27;s great if you need to use the same brush for different colors in the same day/makeup application.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after watching a review on Youtube by a wonderful makeup guru. I have to admit that I was pretty much sold right after the recommendation from him, because he&#x27;s awesome, but once I got it, I was in awe of how well it works. It does not splay your brushes, and it really does get rid of the color on the brush. I have noticed that the brushes, especially the goat haired kind, stay a bit stained, but they do not transfer that color onto the lid, or to where you are blending. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a quick brush cleaning.  It removes eyeshadow color from the bristles so you can use the same brush to switch to a different color; without having to wet the bristles and waiting for it to dry.  Quick and easy.  You still would have to deep clean your brushes weekly with a conventional method.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful tool to have when doing make up. I no longer need to rub the shadow from the brush so vigorously, just a simple swirl and I can switch colors. A must have!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I use it EVERYTIME I apply makeup and frankly I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. I&#x27;ve gone back and purchased 3more for friends.</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it all the time when I do weddings, quick and easy way to transition between colors</li>
            <li> What a great idea! I don&#x27;t have a ton of makeup brushes and used to wipe each on a towel as I did my makeup, but this has changed my makeup life forever! Do yourself a favor and get it!</li>
            <li> This sponge does exactly what is says it&#x27;s going to do! I am a makeup artist and use a lot of brushes while applying makeup. This product cleans my brushes so fast! I can even use the same brush to apply white shadow after using black shadow!! All I do is swipe my brush across this sponge a few times before I want to change colors. I don&#x27;t know how this works so well but it is amazing! I have all my clients using it to now when they see how fast and easy it is to clean the makeup of the brush!</li>
            <li> I use this lovely color switcher every single time i do my makeup. It is truly a miracle worker, and there is a reason everyone talks about this amazing little guy. Next Time i will be trying the Duo!</li>
            <li> Great little device...although, I think I could make the sponge myself...like get it at the hardware store.</li>
            <li> super useful if you use a lot of different brushes.&lt;br /&gt;you just swirl your &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; brush on the black sponge and rightaway you can use that brush again with different eye shadow :)&lt;br /&gt;its a bit expensive at first but then you buy the refill and its much cheaper !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, just someone new to experiments with makeup.  Now I don&#x27;t feel the need to have 2 or 3 of the same brush just to avoid residual color from the last thing I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vera Mono Color Switch is easy to use, and not messy.  I don&#x27;t have to do anything special to it before or after I use it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that refills are available, too.</li>
            <li> Works great! Helps when using a light and dark color eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to. 20 dollars might seem steep for a sponge in a tin, and it is; but not having to clean brushes in between colors only to end up with some accidental blending changes everything. Great for everyday, better for makeup artists.</li>
            <li> This works very well and it does what it says it will do.  It remove the makeup from the brush, but it is over priced.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.  No miracle but good to have nearby in a convenient and cool looking tin.</li>
            <li> i really didn&#x27;t think this would  work be it does..it really nice will be buying more</li>
            <li> It really does work!  I just hope over time it wont damage my brushes.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I am amazed how well this works!</li>
            <li> This product works as described.  I do think I could just buy the filler, but I love the tin for travel.</li>
            <li> Awesome product to have if you&#x27;re doing a bridal parties or make up in general I&#x27;m a make up artist and I always bring along helps me clean brushes in between clients</li>
            <li> Yes, this may be simple, but it works!  So much easier to be able to use just a couple brushes instead of several different ones during application.</li>
            <li> Works amazing  so fast and you do not have to wait for your brushes to dry to use it again. Shopped to me in one day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to work as great as it did, 2 thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and is a great product. Does what it&#x27;s meant to do and is easy to store and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching some youtube reviews and decided I would try it out.  I don&#x27;t have very many brushes and it is a pain to wash them and then wait for them to dry before I could use them again.  I thought trying this would help me switch colors without having to dirty another brush.  I was a little skeptical that this thing would actually work, but I tried it as soon as I got it and I was pretty impressed that it took the shadow right off a brush with fresh product on it.  The only thing I found with this that is not great is that if you use a sparkly pigment or shadow, it doesn&#x27;t get all the sparkly particles off the brush and some of that can transfer to your next shadow.  But otherwise, the Colour Switch is impressive and I was surprised at how well it worked with regular shadows.  The tin is also nice since it catches any shadow that trickles through the sponge, it also seems like it will be great to travel with since it won&#x27;t get make up everywhere if you toss it in a makeup bag.  They do sell refills for the tin, but I think I will just wash the one it came with and see how that works out.  Overall, I am pretty impressed with this brush cleaner and would recommend it to people looking for an easy way to clean your eye brushes between colors.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Have no idea how long I have managed without it. Does exactly what it says - use a dark color, brush against this and switch to a white color. Amazing!</li>
            <li> This really works and it works well. It has definitely cut down on the time I spend washing makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Removes most of the shadow from brush. Great for those who like to use the same brush for multiple colors when doing eyeshadow looks. I usually only get to wash my brushes every 2 weeks or so this helps me in between washes. Works pretty good. It reminds me of the material used for those hair donuts. I think that I could probably make one for less than half the cost so I do think it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> Cool product that&#x27;s gonna make eyeshadow application a whole lot less frustrating. Nice, clean brush every time? Sold!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It does what it says. It cleans your brushes so you won&#x27;t have to mess your make up anymore!</li>
            <li> this product is awesome, great way to switch in between colors</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!</li>
            <li> So far the product seems to work fine. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but overall,  I really like it. Looking forward to more of your products.</li>
            <li> Works great especially when you&#x27;re down to only a cpl brushes needed to do multiple tasks, travel, artistry. When it gets dirty flip it over then to clean simply rub across a cleansing bar and rinse. Let dry before next use. Doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing...i don&#x27;t have to use paper towel anymore to get the color out of my brushes....a must have!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST THING for any one like me a makeupjunkie does exactly what it says ANAZING I will order again</li>
            <li> Love this beauty product. My daughter keeps trying to steal mine so I had to order another.  Absolutely works.</li>
