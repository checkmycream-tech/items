            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>The odor from his shoes used to be overwhelming!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It kind of works.</li>
            <li>Has kind of a piney, lemony smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff works-easy to use, nice lemony scent.  </li>
            <li>so I would not run out with the warm weather.</li>
            <li>Got it as kind of gag gift, but thought it would work.</li>
            <li>The spray has it&#x27;s own scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles for the grand kids stinky shoes.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more as the kids need it...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I want to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Anything more, just move on.</li>
            <li>I ordered more.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Kept the product as it did make most shoes smell nicer and it freshened athletic shoes so their odor didn&#x27;t dominate the space where they are stored.</li>
            <li>i love the pouporri, so i had to buy this for my husband.</li>
            <li>I think it masks more than &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and now he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about any more foot odor embarrassment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than stinky feet, but it&#x27;s still not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on better than a dozen pair of shoes at once in my entry hall so that may be the reason why the smell was just so over-powering.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works great but don&#x27;t really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>It even made the closet smell better.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Works on my smelly shoes what more would you want?</li>
            <li>So the shoes just smell kind of sweet with no &amp;#34;powder over foot stink&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>A Koala bear would love it I suppose, strong eucalipsis smell.</li>
            <li>This is the first product we found (and we have tried MANY!)</li>
            <li>I love this product - it smells like rich cedar.</li>
            <li>shoe spray is easy to use, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think it would be fine for every day shoes, but not for exercise shoes/soccer cleats.</li>
            <li>Effective, smells nice, and once you spray it into your sneakers (make sure you let it dry before you stick your feet</li>
            <li>We spray a little bit every day into their boots and they smell great!</li>
            <li>I already am a huge fan of poo pourri.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t effective that much</li>
            <li>So far -- so good.</li>
            <li>I sprayed each of his shoes and now it just smells fresh!</li>
            <li>This is especially so when you consider that a spray bottle of alcohol eliminates odor just as well (but doesn&#x27;t have the pleasant smell that this product does).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate odor and has it&#x27;s own odor.</li>
            <li>The cool thing about Shoe-Pourri is that it doesn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; the odors - it eliminates them.  </li>
            <li>some -- good equally in all type of materials.</li>
            <li>8-10 sounds more reasonable to me.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working pretty good.  </li>
            <li>She has used it on old shoes and new shoes, and she is completely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>But the smell dissipates rather quickly and then, there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not enough for soccer cleats for sure!</li>
            <li>I play roller derby and the inside of my skates can get pretty stinky and there is no way to clean them.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t stop it completely, but it works better than any product we have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>OK, not to give too much information, but my feet perspire so much,</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like it, but I certainly don&#x27;t mind smelling clean, over smelling stinky feet.</li>
            <li>This product seems to eliminate shoe odor well and leaves a pleasant cedar mixed with saw dust smell rather than a baby powder smell like most other sprays.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wild about the smell (it&#x27;s kind of &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; to me)</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know what Vibrams are, they are those funny &amp;#34;toe shoes&amp;#34; that one wears barefoot.</li>
            <li>finally my closet doesn&#x27;t smell like my husbands work boots, I had given up on being able to get rid of the odor</li>
            <li>Used it the first time at my mother-in-law&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>He was reminding me the other day that he needed some more!</li>
            <li>Only ok.</li>
            <li>but it really helps eliminate shoe odor!</li>
            <li>Really works !</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s closet always smelled like his tennis shoes...not pretty.  </li>
            <li>The product really works!</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been married almost 50 years, and he has always run track meets, jogged in the mornings, etc.</li>
            <li>Shoe-Pourri, on the other hand, works but has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>i felt that the eliminator was effective but the spray smelled like pine sol and why I am giving it less than a 5 star.</li>
            <li>Strong, simple and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a different smell not this strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>This product is a keeper and I will certainly be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more scents like they do with their main toilet product.</li>
            <li>I just spray it in my shoes once every few days, leave it to dry overnight, and I am good to go!</li>
            <li>The shoe-pouri really helps to neutralizer the odor.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent at all.</li>
            <li>It really works on all my stinky shoes</li>
            <li>We tried baking soda, talcum powder, etc, but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>They really have helped my sneaks on their smell.</li>
            <li>I tried rubbing it in to the inside sole of one of my pairs of shoes, and it seems to be doing its job well, but I just don&#x27;t see myself using this product without being able to actually spray it inside of my shoes.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I have one particular pair of leather sandal Danskos that stink.</li>
            <li>and much better and without the mess of show powders.</li>
            <li>Sprayed in shoes- immediately took them to porch due to the strong odor.</li>
            <li>It just makes them smell like new and not stink.</li>
            <li>Another new product from Poo Pourri that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We invested in a shoe dryer recently for my son&#x27;s soccer cleats, and that&#x27;s the first thing to work</li>
            <li>SO FRESH AND LASTS FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work on an everyday shoe, but a good product if you want to spray down shoes that just sit in the closet.</li>
            <li>no more boy problems with this - THANKS for this and the POO and the cute names that go along with the entire brand...</li>
            <li>Did nothing but help the shoe odor evolve into a new kind of odor that was even worse.</li>
            <li>Ordered the large, economy size to fill all my smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product as a solution for stinky shoes, but the smell is only a little better.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for our 19 year old daughter to use with her sneakers &amp; hiking boots.</li>
            <li>My husband has very smelly, problem feet and has his entire life.  </li>
            <li>so maybe his &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is too far a reach for this to eliminate the &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>shoes and closet smell like cedar now instead of old cheese</li>
            <li>My 6 year old refuses to wear socks, so his sneakers reek like something died in them.  </li>
            <li>Learned of the POO pourri from QVC for bathroom trips and recommend that TEN TIMES as much - and this really works just as well on stinky feet - and shoes that just have to be placed outside.....</li>
            <li>The only word to describe this product - WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and would especially recommend for people that have children that play sports, and wear sneakers,</li>
            <li>Normally considered running shoes, I wear them 24/7 - for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li>Unique little stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>Not too many things smell worse than roller derby pads.</li>
            <li>Strikes you as odd at first</li>
            <li>The strange scent lasts for a few hours, but a full day of use</li>

            <li> This product is a keeper and I will certainly be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> I wish they had more scents like they do with their main toilet product.</li>
            <li> I just spray it in my shoes once every few days, leave it to dry overnight, and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> The shoe-pouri really helps to neutralizer the odor.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent at all.</li>
            <li> It really works on all my stinky shoes</li>
            <li> We tried baking soda, talcum powder, etc, but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> They really have helped my sneaks on their smell.</li>
            <li> I tried rubbing it in to the inside sole of one of my pairs of shoes, and it seems to be doing its job well, but I just don&#x27;t see myself using this product without being able to actually spray it inside of my shoes.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have one particular pair of leather sandal Danskos that stink.</li>
            <li> and much better and without the mess of show powders.</li>
            <li> Sprayed in shoes- immediately took them to porch due to the strong odor.</li>
            <li> It just makes them smell like new and not stink.</li>
            <li> Another new product from Poo Pourri that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We invested in a shoe dryer recently for my son&#x27;s soccer cleats, and that&#x27;s the first thing to work</li>
            <li> SO FRESH AND LASTS FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work on an everyday shoe, but a good product if you want to spray down shoes that just sit in the closet.</li>
            <li> no more boy problems with this - THANKS for this and the POO and the cute names that go along with the entire brand...</li>
            <li> Did nothing but help the shoe odor evolve into a new kind of odor that was even worse.</li>
            <li> Ordered the large, economy size to fill all my smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product as a solution for stinky shoes, but the smell is only a little better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our 19 year old daughter to use with her sneakers &amp; hiking boots.</li>
            <li> My husband has very smelly, problem feet and has his entire life.  </li>
            <li> so maybe his &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is too far a reach for this to eliminate the &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> shoes and closet smell like cedar now instead of old cheese</li>
            <li> My 6 year old refuses to wear socks, so his sneakers reek like something died in them.  </li>
            <li> Learned of the POO pourri from QVC for bathroom trips and recommend that TEN TIMES as much - and this really works just as well on stinky feet - and shoes that just have to be placed outside.....</li>
            <li> The only word to describe this product - WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and would especially recommend for people that have children that play sports, and wear sneakers,</li>
            <li> Normally considered running shoes, I wear them 24/7 - for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li> Unique little stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Not too many things smell worse than roller derby pads.</li>
            <li> Strikes you as odd at first</li>
            <li> The strange scent lasts for a few hours, but a full day of use</li>
            <li> We had tried everything for my kids shoes and this stuff really works, no more embarrassing moments</li>
            <li> and it works really well for all my shoes, not better on</li>
            <li> I leave it all out after practice to air dry rather than shoving them back in my bag.</li>
            <li> This shoe odor eliminator is made by the producers of Poo-Pourri a toilet spray deodorizing film that works like a charm.</li>
            <li> far as I can tell, it at least doesn&#x27;t make it worse like many other similar products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn my &amp;#34;smellies&amp;#34; for long periods of time yet</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry before wearing them.</li>
            <li> You spray and leave it to dry over night - thats it.</li>
            <li> I spray it in at night to give it time to dry.  </li>
            <li> She only has to use a little, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just spray and let it dry, put your shoes on.......and go!  </li>
            <li> I spray my shoes before and after wearing them and there is absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li> Works where other products didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> that by the end of the day, there is like almost a sour odor to my shoes.</li>
            <li> But this arrived with a defective(cracked from the spray opening down) spray pump and just dribbles everywhere.</li>
            <li> So you first spray it.... smells crazily like pine-sol.</li>
            <li> It does a little bit of help temporarily, ie less than an hour.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it fails to live up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> other shoes I have doesn&#x27;t have oodor , so the problem is with the shoes :/</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of sprays and powders with little results.</li>
            <li> Sorry my English is limited .</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wasted money on this product.</li>
            <li> (Which sucks, as I like their other products).</li>
            <li> No more stinky feet with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> , not sure if I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> smell is not nice.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little weird.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for what it does.  </li>
            <li> Will keep at least one bottle around!</li>
            <li> Worked, but not as well as I desired it to, my son has THE WORST SMELLING FEET EVER, to the point that even when going to a friends house he is asked to leave his shoes in the garage ;)</li>
            <li> Since it is unable to eliminate all original shoe odor, the mixture of two smells make it even worst....</li>
            <li> He was forced (by me!)</li>
            <li> Not proud of my foot odor issues.  </li>
            <li> I have a 7 year old son with the worst stinky feet.</li>
            <li> but after I used this shoe pourri shoe odor my feet no more smell bad .</li>
            <li> and it fails.</li>
            <li> And a lot of times it smells like its weird scent and feet.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> Did help my daughters horribly stinky shoes, but bit as well as I expected</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s on his feet 10-12 hrs a day for work) and again, this failed to tame the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s shoes were rank to say the least!</li>
            <li> She was complaining to me that she had to throw away some shoes because she couldn&#x27;t stand the odor, and was afraid to take her shoes off around others.  </li>
            <li> I like it before my feet smell bad</li>
            <li> My son has the worst problem with foot odor</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does what it says it will.  Effective, smells nice, and once you spray it into your sneakers (make sure you let it dry before you stick your feet in)--doesn&#x27;t smell like something covering another odor.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This spray works in all types of shoes.  Just spray inside of shoes or on the foot bed of sandals. Let it dry before wearing them.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker but the smell is inoffensive</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help with my Vibram shoes. Sadly, it fails to live up to it&#x27;s claim. For those who don&#x27;t know what Vibrams are, they are those funny &amp;#34;toe shoes&amp;#34; that one wears barefoot. Normally considered running shoes, I wear them 24/7 - for the last 4 years. And anyone knows wearing shoes barefoot makes for stinky shoes. I was hoping this would help for &amp;#34;in between washing&amp;#34; for the shoes and it fails. The strange scent lasts for a few hours, but a full day of use &#x3D; NOPE. I tried it in my husband&#x27;s work shoes (he&#x27;s on his feet 10-12 hrs a day for work) and again, this failed to tame the nasty smell. In his &amp;#34;weekend&amp;#34; shoes, it did help some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless you are using it on &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; use shoes, I would skip it. Heavier use items are not tamed by this spray. (Which sucks, as I like their other products).</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles for the grand kids stinky shoes. Works great and it&#x27;s not toxic! I will purchase more as the kids need it...</li>
            <li> I had my doubts as to whether this would work or not but IT does!!  If you or family member have odiferous shoes, I recommend that you try this product.  You spray and leave it to dry over night - thats it.</li>
            <li> Unique little stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> No more stinky feet with this stuff.  I spray it in at night to give it time to dry.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Very effective....great product!</li>
            <li> This is the first product we found (and we have tried MANY!) that actually works!  thank you!  and my son&#x27;s feet thank you!</li>
            <li> finally my closet doesn&#x27;t smell like my husbands work boots, I had given up on being able to get rid of the odor</li>
            <li> It did the job, but my shoes a coloring my feet now.  They didn&#x27;t color anything before I used the spray. So, the bottom line is I still can&#x27;t wear my shoes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Whoever invented it is a genius!  Used it the first time at my mother-in-law&#x27;s. She ordered some for me from QVC. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Ordered the large, economy size to fill all my smaller bottles. Have this in all bathrooms (including the motorhome) and carry the travel size in my purse.</li>
            <li> I want to love this stuff. I already am a huge fan of poo pourri. But this arrived with a defective(cracked from the spray opening down) spray pump and just dribbles everywhere. I tried rubbing it in to the inside sole of one of my pairs of shoes, and it seems to be doing its job well, but I just don&#x27;t see myself using this product without being able to actually spray it inside of my shoes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our 19 year old daughter to use with her sneakers &amp; hiking boots. She loves it and said it works terrific at eliminating odors.</li>
            <li> It works . I like it before my feet smell bad but after I used this shoe pourri shoe odor my feet no more smell bad . I would buy it again if I run out of it . Sorry my English is limited .</li>
            <li> It kind of works. The scent is a little weird. And a lot of times it smells like its weird scent and feet. It does a little bit of help temporarily, ie less than an hour. The bottle isn&#x27;t very big and it requires a lot. I think it would be fine for every day shoes, but not for exercise shoes/soccer cleats. It&#x27;s just not enough for soccer cleats for sure! We invested in a shoe dryer recently for my son&#x27;s soccer cleats, and that&#x27;s the first thing to work successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you are looking to cover run of the mill shoe smell for short term, this works. Anything more, just move on.</li>
            <li> So you first spray it.... smells crazily like pine-sol. Some people don&#x27;t like it, but I certainly don&#x27;t mind smelling clean, over smelling stinky feet. But the smell dissipates rather quickly and then, there is no smell at all. Thank you Shoe-Pourri! Now my boyfriends Work Shoes dont have to stay in his car cuz they stink up the foye, and I don&#x27;t mind riding in his car, cuz they no longer smell like hard-working, sweaty, stinky, man feet lol</li>
            <li> She was complaining to me that she had to throw away some shoes because she couldn&#x27;t stand the odor, and was afraid to take her shoes off around others.  I bought her this, and she loves it!  She has used it on old shoes and new shoes, and she is completely happy with the results.  She only has to use a little, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Works Great! Will keep at least one bottle around!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was possible but, Shoe-Pourri took the stink out of my son&#x27;s shoes.  He gives each shoe 2 sprays in the morning and 2 in the evening.  We have been using for about a week and are amazed at the difference!!!!  This will be a product we continue to purchase.  Guess it&#x27;s time to try the Poo-pourri</li>
            <li> We had tried everything for my kids shoes and this stuff really works, no more embarrassing moments</li>
            <li> My husband has very smelly, problem feet and has his entire life.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t stop it completely, but it works better than any product we have ever tried.  I ordered more.</li>
            <li> Stinky shoes, beware!  This stuff works like a charm on my daughter&#x27;s stinky work shoes.</li>
            <li> Strong, simple and works as advertised. Good value and reliable functionality. I would recommend for purchase to anyone looking for such a product.</li>
            <li> My husband thought it was a joke.  But he finally used it and raved about how well it works.  He was reminding me the other day that he needed some more!</li>
            <li> Only ok. Just seemed to cover, not neutralize.  Did help my daughters horribly stinky shoes, but bit as well as I expected</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it WORKS! I spray my shoes before and after wearing them and there is absolutely no odor.  I would highly recommend this product and would especially recommend for people that have children that play sports, and wear sneakers,</li>
            <li> Wonderful seller, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I play roller derby and the inside of my skates can get pretty stinky and there is no way to clean them. The shoe-pouri really helps to neutralizer the odor. Not only do I use it for my skate, but I also spray it on my knee, elbow, and write pads between practices. Not too many things smell worse than roller derby pads. It works so well, i&#x27;ve been told I smell too good to have playing roller derby for hours. I use the shoe-pouri between washes of my pads. I also sometimes spray it in my helmet and my ankle braces between washes. I leave it all out after practice to air dry rather than shoving them back in my bag. It doesn&#x27;t make your stuff smell like flowers or berries or anything like that. It just makes them smell like new and not stink. This product is a keeper and I will certainly be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate odor and has it&#x27;s own odor.</li>
            <li> Works where other products didn&#x27;t. Good delivery.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for my toms and Dr. Shaltz flats, but it did not work and they still stink.&lt;br /&gt;Any other shoes I have doesn&#x27;t have oodor , so the problem is with the shoes :/</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have one particular pair of leather sandal Danskos that stink. I tried everything and nothing would take the smell out. This was just a hopeful, maybe-it-will-work-but-it-probably-won&#x27;t purchase. I am delighted to report that it does work!</li>
            <li> I have a 7 year old son with the worst stinky feet. I spray this into the shoes and the next day the smell is gone. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Has kind of a piney, lemony smell. Strikes you as odd at first but it really helps eliminate shoe odor! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not proud of my foot odor issues.  This spray is the only thing I have found to neutralize shoes that are already stinky.</li>
            <li> It works. Surprisingly. May need to reapply after a day of sweating into your shoes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Really works !</li>
            <li> I love this product - it smells like rich cedar. Goes well into boots, shoes, etc. Used it for over six months now and would not be without it!</li>
            <li> This product helps keep shoes fresher but for shows worn often or almost daily the foot odor lingers despite subsequent treatments. Kept the product as it did make most shoes smell nicer and it freshened athletic shoes so their odor didn&#x27;t dominate the space where they are stored.</li>
            <li> OK, not to give too much information, but my feet perspire so much, that by the end of the day, there is like almost a sour odor to my shoes. I have tried all kinds of sprays and powders with little results. This stuff is amazing! I just spray it in my shoes once every few days, leave it to dry overnight, and I am good to go! Like the cedar scent. Not too overpowering. I had read somewhere that you are not supposed to wear the same pair of shoes 2 days in a row - they need to air out - so I always follow that and that helps too. I am going to try the Poo-Pourri next! Saves being embarrassed especially if you are at someone&#x27;s house and have to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. i love the pouporri, so i had to buy this for my husband. It works great!</li>
            <li> This product seems to eliminate shoe odor well and leaves a pleasant cedar mixed with saw dust smell rather than a baby powder smell like most other sprays.  A little expensive for what it does.  This is especially so when you consider that a spray bottle of alcohol eliminates odor just as well (but doesn&#x27;t have the pleasant smell that this product does).</li>
            <li> Very good but smell is not nice.</li>
            <li> I think it masks more than &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;. It won&#x27;t work on an everyday shoe, but a good product if you want to spray down shoes that just sit in the closet. I really don&#x27;t like the scent at all.</li>
            <li> All the Poo-Pourri products are great.&lt;br /&gt;The shoe spray is easy to use, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Your friends and family will be thrilled!</li>
            <li> bought for son for Christmas. says it works great and now he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about any more foot odor embarrassment.</li>
            <li> The only word to describe this product - WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It really works on all my stinky shoes</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product as a solution for stinky shoes, but the smell is only a little better. It&#x27;s better than stinky feet, but it&#x27;s still not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m gonna try odor eaters for shoes.</li>
            <li> The cool thing about Shoe-Pourri is that it doesn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; the odors - it eliminates them.  So the shoes just smell kind of sweet with no &amp;#34;powder over foot stink&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> MAKES MY SNEAKERS SMELL SO FRESH AND LASTS FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the smell (it&#x27;s kind of &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; to me) but it does the job. I wish they had more scents like they do with their main toilet product.</li>
            <li> Worked, but not as well as I desired it to, my son has THE WORST SMELLING FEET EVER, to the point that even when going to a friends house he is asked to leave his shoes in the garage ;) so maybe his &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is too far a reach for this to eliminate the &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34; Thx for helping me try though</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!  This works.  My husband&#x27;s closet always smelled like his tennis shoes...not pretty.  I sprayed each of his shoes and now it just smells fresh!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Did nothing but help the shoe odor evolve into a new kind of odor that was even worse. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of stinky feet</li>
            <li> This shoe odor eliminator is made by the producers of Poo-Pourri a toilet spray deodorizing film that works like a charm. Shoe-Pourri, on the other hand, works but has a very strong smell. I used it on better than a dozen pair of shoes at once in my entry hall so that may be the reason why the smell was just so over-powering.  I think it would be great for someone just spraying it into one pair of shoes at a time as they go out the door.</li>
            <li> I have used it in my dress shoes, work shoes and boots, sneakers, and even on my sandals! The product really works!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a different smell not this strong chemical smell. Lets see if it actually works, I only sprayed it today.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands shoes (pwwwww-eee!) ...and it totally works!  and much better and without the mess of show powders.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working pretty good.  I haven&#x27;t worn my &amp;#34;smellies&amp;#34; for long periods of time yet tho so will see how it works when I do.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works for me. So glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Works great on stinky shoes!</li>
            <li> Wasted money on this product. Did not come close to eliminating shoe odor.</li>
            <li> Works great but don&#x27;t really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t effective that much</li>
            <li> Thought we would try this. Great service, good price, and the stuff works very nicely with a good scent as well</li>
            <li> Feet that stink thank Shoe-Pourri. I could use this in my teens entire bedroom!</li>
            <li> If shoes have a funky smell, it can return in a couple of days. Does what it claims to a point.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, it at least doesn&#x27;t make it worse like many other similar products.</li>
            <li> This stuff works-easy to use, nice lemony scent.  It even made the closet smell better. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been married almost 50 years, and he has always run track meets, jogged in the mornings, etc. The odor from his shoes used to be overwhelming! We tried baking soda, talcum powder, etc, but nothing really worked. He was forced (by me!) to keep his shoes in the garage - and one was stolen by a neighborhood dog one time! This spray does what it says - it removes the odor, instead of just covering it up! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love this.  I bought this several years ago and sprayed it in all my shoes and it really works.  No odor whatsoever.  Lasts a long time.  Decided to get another so I would not run out with the warm weather.</li>
            <li> Another new product from Poo Pourri that works.&lt;br /&gt;My shoes and closet smell like cedar now instead of old cheese</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My 6 year old refuses to wear socks, so his sneakers reek like something died in them.  We tried baking soda, newspaper, washing them, etc.  Nothing worked.  My sister had some shoe-pourri so we gave it a shot!  It worked Great!  Couldn&#x27;t believe it covered the smell.  We use it once or twice a week!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s shoes were rank to say the least! We have been using Pourri products for a while, when I came across this one. We have been very satisfied. Nobody gets run out of the bathroom now. Getting back to the shoes. Two sprays in each shoe, and the funk was gone! Thank you.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters and system wearing the boots every day over the months they built up quite an odor. This product is wonderful! We spray a little bit every day into their boots and they smell great!</li>
            <li> It works!  Just spray and let it dry, put your shoes on.......and go!  When you take the shoes off, no odor.  Love this.</li>
            <li> This product works well, smells good and isn&#x27;t overpowering &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine! Great products and it works really well for all my shoes, not better on some -- good equally in all type of materials.</li>
            <li> Works great price good</li>
            <li> They really have helped my sneaks on their smell. I put it in at night and the next morning I don&#x27;t smell like it would in the morning.</li>
            <li> We have tried to find a way to rid the athletic shoes of odors and this helps. So far -- so good.</li>
            <li> Learned of the POO pourri from QVC for bathroom trips and recommend that TEN TIMES as much - and this really works just as well on stinky feet - and shoes that just have to be placed outside.....no more boy problems with this - THANKS for this and the POO and the cute names that go along with the entire brand...travel sizes you have are wonderful too....you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> My son has the worst problem with foot odor and I have tried everything on the planet...if he uses this faithfully, it does help somewhat !</li>
            <li> Works on my smelly shoes what more would you want?</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, has a nice fragrance. $15 dollars though, not sure if I will be buying this again. 8-10 sounds more reasonable to me.</li>
            <li> Quite name for a product and guaranteed it says. Got it as kind of gag gift, but thought it would work. Well, it is a gag gift- the smell of this stuff will make you gag! Sprayed in shoes- immediately took them to porch due to the strong odor. Porch smelled for 2 days. A Koala bear would love it I suppose, strong eucalipsis smell.</li>
            <li> i felt that the eliminator was effective but the spray smelled like pine sol and why I am giving it less than a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The spray has it&#x27;s own scent.  Since it is unable to eliminate all original shoe odor, the mixture of two smells make it even worst....</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it in my martial arts class to help keep the odor of sweat and work out of my gear in between washings. The fragrance is pleasant, sort of an earthy pine smell. It also works awesome for shoes. :)</li>
