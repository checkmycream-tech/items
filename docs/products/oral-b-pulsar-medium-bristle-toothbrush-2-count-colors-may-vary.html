    <ol>
            <li>These are the best toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Its the best of both worlds-</li>
            <li>These are the best tooth brushes for my use...</li>
            <li>Thes are great but battery changes need improving so when you do change the batteries, you don&#x27;t ruin the brush!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; stiffness brush should be used solely for cleaning industrial parts -- but come to think of it, it might be an excellent life-hack in that service.  </li>
            <li>the battery should outlast the bristles for this to be a perfect 5 star item.  </li>
            <li>Best &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>Great price for the two of them!</li>
            <li>Try them and then decide what&#x27;s best for your needs.</li>
            <li>This is one the best toothbrushes ever.</li>
            <li>I had a Pulsar Medium Toothbrush and was so impressed with the cleaning I got from it</li>

            <li>These are a great inexpensive &amp;#34;elecetric&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush too, been using these for 2 years.</li>
            <li>Plus the rubbery bits at the sides provide great gum stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It feels great.</li>
            <li>They work great.  </li>
            <li>&gt;· I get great checkups since adopting this.  </li>
            <li>I had bought them then read that medium bristles aren&#x27;t great for your teeth.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful with continued use my gums have gotten much better.</li>
            <li>works , now I can smile again !!!!</li>
            <li>And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . .</li>
            <li>Good for some.</li>
            <li>This brush with the medium bristles seems to give a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Good, delivered.</li>
            <li>Did you know that if you turn these on and hide them somewhere good</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush for getting a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun and the grip on the handle is superb.  </li>
            <li>it works great, the speedy vibrations leaves a very clean sensation, I recommended.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>and I liked the shape of the head for getting between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used this kind of tooth brush for quite a while</li>
            <li>Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  </li>
            <li>The design is nice and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The weight is good (light).  </li>
            <li>Works best when the batteries are low; rather than throwing it out,  have some fun with a nice bright</li>
            <li>/&gt;Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than the rechargeable ones I have used before.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Love em.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with what I received.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes even after I have tried many others.</li>
            <li>make sure the foil stays in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them more and more.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Ok for me.</li>
            <li>more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them now for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Like it much better than my wife&#x27;s $80 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what you do when the battery runs out in two weeks like most of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to change the battery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite disposable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It more than lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>but out of the many pulsars I&#x27;ve used, not one had any smell at all</li>
            <li>and you need to wait for more to be delivered.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This works just as well as sonicare, and is much more cost effective and user friendly - just use until battery runs out and toss.  </li>
            <li>I really like these toothbrushes they work very nicely.</li>
            <li>But this is still my go-to toothbrush, since the excellent cleaning performance is worth paying for a new toothbrush</li>
            <li>I just wish they were more environmentally sound.  </li>
            <li>Great vibrating action on the ones that work though.</li>
            <li>They really are good and feel well made for $5 per brush.</li>
            <li>If Oral B can&#x27;t make these so the batteries are easily replaced I will no longer buy them.</li>
            <li>Great build quality, big brush, powered, get many of them.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a strong rubber/tire smell flrom thr handle</li>
            <li>Good product, but you are better off testing them in the store to make sure the brushes have battery power left.</li>
            <li>I was kind of sketchy about Tia toothbrush at first</li>
            <li>The bristles feel fine</li>
            <li>Popping in a dollar store battery to replace it would be fine with me, but I don&#x27;t like the gamble on whether or not my toothbrush is going to work, or the need to call for a replacement if one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it works fine as a manual toothbrush if it runs out of juice</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are adequate!</li>
            <li>And children may find it more fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These Pulsar brushes vibrate nicely, and get the plaque off the teeth really well.</li>
            <li>But this is a bit like worrying about buying a dud light bulb.  </li>
            <li>else.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one get one free item for sale now?&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>I do think the product itself is fantastic</li>
            <li>I wanted to insure I had them available to me for time to come.  </li>
            <li>many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful vibration.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is closer to a true &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; bristle stiffness, and work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- The brush lasts quite a long time when using good quality batteries six to eight weeks or more...</li>
            <li>But after trying them, they are wonderful, my new regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>but this is the one I grab first most days.</li>
            <li>In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible.</li>
            <li>so it does not matter since we are taking product apart, but if needed for original purpose would have had an issue.</li>
            <li>These would be okay if the batteries lasted consistently beyond fifteen uses, but often that is not the case.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got this.  </li>
            <li>At first that bugged me, because I thought the bristles had a bit more life in them yet, and when I tried to replace the battery, I found it was not designed for that.  </li>
            <li>, I like the medium bristles, I like the amount of vibration, I like how clean my teeth feel after using this brush.  </li>
            <li>but it made my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li>Oral B&#x27;s Pulsar, is a battery powered disposable toothbrush that cleans using specially designed vibrating bristles, rather than a rotating circular head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  </li>
            <li>Good feeling while brushing Only hope the battery lasts all of 3 months - wish the battery was chargeable and the option to change the brush is with me instead of throwing it away after the battery is over/dead.</li>
            <li>I got unlucky on my shipment because both colors were the same, which isn&#x27;t good when you&#x27;re a couple and need to distinguish who&#x27;s toothbrush is who&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush provides a more clean feeling than a normal toothbrush with the vibrating bristles.</li>
            <li>But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are quite powerful but my teeth do feel a lot better than when i brush with a normal brush.</li>
            <li>Easy storage and very reliable for use.</li>
            <li>Clean the teeth very, very well.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are better than non-powered brushes, but the batteries don&#x27;t last too long (brush is always in great shape and the batteries die before the rest of the brush).</li>
            <li>My favorite so far!</li>
            <li>Besides, dentists say it&#x27;s best to use a new toothbrush every month rather than use the same old, bacteria-laden one whose bristles might have warped.</li>
            <li>I know it is recommended to replace your toothbrush monthly, but I still feel like it is a waste since the bristles are still in great condition.</li>
            <li>Lol don&#x27;t take the battery out, it&#x27;s a waste of time trying to beat the system by replacing the battery.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried, it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love how they are still skinny and light, unlike the bulky battery powered brushes I find locally.</li>
            <li>The yellow bristles feel really nice as they pass over my gums, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to have to brush twice</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I have now changed to a sonic care power up model and the difference in terms of the how much powerful the brush is and how it feels as it cleans my teeth is tangible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, in spite of how easy it seems to change the battery, it is not designed for normal customers to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the pulsating, makes teeth feel extra clean(:</li>
            <li>Once you twist the end cap off the battery is right there</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold this brush with an extended-life battery, but I suspect the business case for it is not appealing to Oral B (most of the differential profits would go to battery maker, not Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Typical for Oral B&#x27;s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn&#x27;t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded this review from 2 to 4 stars because the company sent me a free replacement voucher and the new ones lasted in excess of 3 months.</li>
            <li>but when I used it I loved it won&#x27;t be going back to the old one any time soon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B battery toothbrushes for years and though my old one still works fine, when I bought this 2-pack for my son, I kept one for myself.</li>
            <li>The headline for my review is exactly how my teeth feel after using Oral-B Pulsar Medium toothbrush.</li>
            <li>One last thing to worry about :-)</li>
            <li>At first I was blown away by the batter-operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>when I first started using this toothbrush 10 yrs ago I used as a travel brush and some how I stayed with it.</li>
            <li>And I suppose if I got a dud the first time, I&#x27;d never try the product again.  </li>
            <li>I can only hope they do a better job then a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Came not in working condition, most likely took the batteries (((</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>After I received my first brush, I immediately purchased a set for my husband &amp; son.</li>
            <li>We prefer this one even at a higher price.</li>
            <li>Finally using an electric tooth brush - This would be a five star rating if the brush allowed for easier battery replacement - Butusing a paper clip on the 12th ridge from the top of the brush to push out the pattery compartment  is not</li>
            <li>You never know how fast a battery might die, but the vibrating brush function is only available while the original battery is working.</li>
            <li>There is not a whole lot more to add - the tooth brush does its job well, and my teeth feel clean without much effort or splatter.</li>
            <li>eventually gave up an purchased a sonicare, and now having used both, I can say that the pulsing action of the sonicare is far superior and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My two pack arrived in pink and blue, great for his and hers.</li>
            <li>Instead, there are times when I still have good strong bristles left but the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li>I really like the pulse/vibrating feature of this toothbrush and definitely thing it helps give my teeth a better cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the difference between my old one and this one: the speed is MUCH faster and it cleans better.</li>
            <li>I mean, in as much as one can love a toothbrush, this is the one I love.  </li>
            <li>Usually they are very good and last over 2 months, so maybe I just got a faulty product.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of cleaning with less effort.  </li>
            <li>, the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice to just how large this brush head is.</li>
            <li>Occasionally the battery goes out quickly and they cannot be replaced but most of my experience has been good with the battery lasting past the time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my teeth yet strong enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>* Funny direction written on the box, it tells us what to do when battery dies:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Simply throw it away and use a new one&amp;#34;?!</li>
            <li>This brush has great hand-feel, is not too large or too thin.  </li>
            <li>A simple option to open the brush and let the customer be able to switch batteries might have been great, and it doesn&#x27;t seem so hard to design it</li>
            <li>No changing of heads, and much cheaper than even replacement heads for sonicare, not to mention cost of device.</li>
            <li>The battery wears out much sooner than the bristles.</li>
            <li>(thanks tea and coffee).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>(there are youtube videos dedicated to how to accomplish this), but really I don&#x27;t think I should have to and nor do I want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfying…</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this toothbrush is wonderful and gets all those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>I feel like they clean much better than non-powered ones, but they&#x27;re not gigantically awkward to hold like most powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel super clean, I gave my roommate the other one</li>
            <li>These really do seem to get the teeth extra clean.</li>
            <li>and tehre&#x27;s not many ways it could be better!</li>
            <li>Pretty harsh on the gums I thought,  even after 2-3 weeks of getting used to it it didn&#x27;t get better for me</li>
            <li>At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B&#x27;s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  </li>
            <li>I mean, they are pretty amazing toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The price for these is not much over the cost of an average manual brush, and the results are so good that I&#x27;m willing to replace it when the battery dies.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(This is a completely updated review from my first entry on this product.)</li>
            <li>For your favorite friends slide one down the heater vent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other battery powered or electric toothbrushes before and they&#x27;ve worked great, but definitely not this one.</li>
            <li>For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  </li>
            <li>so I had no knowing anything at this point) and decided to quickly use the battery in my mom&#x27;s since we didn&#x27;t have extra AAA laying around.</li>
            <li>And it packs for a trip way better (smaller) than those giant spin-y type powered brushes.  </li>
            <li>Although, I think I believe the claim that the sound the Sonic puts out help to shake loose plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush head is high quality, and I&#x27;ve found it to outlast the included battery.  </li>
            <li>and i never noticed that with other toothbrushes of the same kind.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft that, without the battery, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning very well.</li>
            <li>(which I feel normally with a manual brush).</li>
            <li>I think they cover more tooth surface than the ones with round, rotating heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like them a lot better than the plain jane ones the dentist sends home, and I don&#x27;t like the spinny electric ones, but</li>
            <li>I just do it when they new ones arrive.  </li>
            <li>Slip in the new AAA battery&lt;</li>
            <li>This promotes the purchase of a new brush for want of a AAA battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably throw it away and get a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shame that such a great product is ruined by poor battery life.</li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t go back to a regular cheap brush.</li>
            <li>For my gums their not, but if you have very sensitive teeth and gums you might find otherwise.</li>
            <li>And since further moving up to this type of buzzy manual brush, I get stellar reports from my dentists.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last night was when I first used it</li>
            <li>so you get more brushing done with less work, even if you just hold the brush up to your teeth without moving it back and forth.</li>
            <li>Also, the medium bristles are still way too hard for my healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>I think the slightly curved brush head would wrap around the teeth, maintain more contact, than ones with flat heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching to the soft bristles, but I&#x27;ll stay with Oral-B Pulsars.</li>
            <li>If you need a medium to soft bristle this is not for you.</li>
            <li>You must bend the metal contact to remove the old battery.</li>
            <li>: the brush head itself only lasts as long as the battery, with the bristles becoming noticeably softer and starting to fall apart at the four month mark.</li>
            <li>The battery life stated below is wildly optimistic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have tried the soft bristle version and its just a bit too soft and wimpy for for.  </li>
            <li>My mouth does feel cleaner and my teeth like the added foaming action the vibration allows.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much gentler than a standard electric toothbrush, and has softer bristles that made it easier on my gums.</li>
            <li>I bought several for my dad since he loves it so much.</li>
            <li>They give me at least the impression of doing a more thorough job of brushing than with manual tootbrushes, but there is no recharging hassle, nothing else taking up room on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Too bad, because for those 3 weeks, I loved the toothbrush!</li>
            <li>(why not enjoy the hot water for a few more minutes?)</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, but after having it only a few months, the battery died!</li>
            <li>I think it would be better if the&lt;br /&gt;end of the brush was round but long the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel right if I get any other brand.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes, too bad the battery can&#x27;t (easily) be replaced.  </li>
            <li>Wish you could replace the batteries, as they seem to sometimes run out long before the toothbrush itself is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li>I tested before I used and the little yellow flaps swished back and forth just fine.  </li>
            <li>As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products.</li>
            <li>so prefer these Oral-B ones because you don&#x27;t have to charge them, the battery is sealed against water, lasts for at least a month and are light.</li>
            <li>The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  </li>
            <li>so I went back to my old manual brushes.</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched to simple manual brushes, my checkups improved markedly.  </li>
            <li>I was a fan - it didn&#x27;t have as much power as other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly have to give a bad review when this is a great toothbrush because the battery died in both units after only ONE month of use when the packaging states that it&#x27;s designed to last three.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Perfect!</li>
            <li> Its the best of both worlds-</li>
            <li> These are the best tooth brushes for my use...</li>
            <li> Thes are great but battery changes need improving so when you do change the batteries, you don&#x27;t ruin the brush!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; stiffness brush should be used solely for cleaning industrial parts -- but come to think of it, it might be an excellent life-hack in that service.  </li>
            <li> the battery should outlast the bristles for this to be a perfect 5 star item.  </li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> Great price for the two of them!</li>
            <li> Try them and then decide what&#x27;s best for your needs.</li>
            <li> This is one the best toothbrushes ever.</li>
            <li> I had a Pulsar Medium Toothbrush and was so impressed with the cleaning I got from it</li>

            <li> Very good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush is, as the title says, a great low-cost alternative.  </li>
            <li> These are a great inexpensive &amp;#34;elecetric&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush too, been using these for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Plus the rubbery bits at the sides provide great gum stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It feels great.</li>
            <li> They work great.  </li>
            <li> &gt;· I get great checkups since adopting this.  </li>
            <li> I had bought them then read that medium bristles aren&#x27;t great for your teeth.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful with continued use my gums have gotten much better.</li>
            <li> works , now I can smile again !!!!</li>
            <li> And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . .</li>
            <li> Good for some.</li>
            <li> This brush with the medium bristles seems to give a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Good, delivered.</li>
            <li> Did you know that if you turn these on and hide them somewhere good</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush for getting a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The colors are fun and the grip on the handle is superb.  </li>
            <li> it works great, the speedy vibrations leaves a very clean sensation, I recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> and I liked the shape of the head for getting between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of tooth brush for quite a while</li>
            <li> Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  </li>
            <li> The design is nice and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The weight is good (light).  </li>
            <li> Works best when the batteries are low; rather than throwing it out,  have some fun with a nice bright</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They are much better than the rechargeable ones I have used before.  </li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Love em.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with what I received.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes even after I have tried many others.</li>
            <li> make sure the foil stays in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them more and more.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Ok for me.</li>
            <li> more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them now for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Like it much better than my wife&#x27;s $80 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what you do when the battery runs out in two weeks like most of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to change the battery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite disposable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It more than lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> but out of the many pulsars I&#x27;ve used, not one had any smell at all</li>
            <li> and you need to wait for more to be delivered.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as sonicare, and is much more cost effective and user friendly - just use until battery runs out and toss.  </li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes they work very nicely.</li>
            <li> But this is still my go-to toothbrush, since the excellent cleaning performance is worth paying for a new toothbrush</li>
            <li> I just wish they were more environmentally sound.  </li>
            <li> Great vibrating action on the ones that work though.</li>
            <li> They really are good and feel well made for $5 per brush.</li>
            <li> If Oral B can&#x27;t make these so the batteries are easily replaced I will no longer buy them.</li>
            <li> Great build quality, big brush, powered, get many of them.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a strong rubber/tire smell flrom thr handle</li>
            <li> Good product, but you are better off testing them in the store to make sure the brushes have battery power left.</li>
            <li> I was kind of sketchy about Tia toothbrush at first</li>
            <li> The bristles feel fine</li>
            <li> Popping in a dollar store battery to replace it would be fine with me, but I don&#x27;t like the gamble on whether or not my toothbrush is going to work, or the need to call for a replacement if one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it works fine as a manual toothbrush if it runs out of juice</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are adequate!</li>
            <li> And children may find it more fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These Pulsar brushes vibrate nicely, and get the plaque off the teeth really well.</li>
            <li> But this is a bit like worrying about buying a dud light bulb.  </li>
            <li> else.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one get one free item for sale now?&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> I do think the product itself is fantastic</li>
            <li> I wanted to insure I had them available to me for time to come.  </li>
            <li> many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful vibration.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is closer to a true &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; bristle stiffness, and work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - The brush lasts quite a long time when using good quality batteries six to eight weeks or more...</li>
            <li> But after trying them, they are wonderful, my new regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> but this is the one I grab first most days.</li>
            <li> In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible.</li>
            <li> so it does not matter since we are taking product apart, but if needed for original purpose would have had an issue.</li>
            <li> These would be okay if the batteries lasted consistently beyond fifteen uses, but often that is not the case.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this.  </li>
            <li> At first that bugged me, because I thought the bristles had a bit more life in them yet, and when I tried to replace the battery, I found it was not designed for that.  </li>
            <li> , I like the medium bristles, I like the amount of vibration, I like how clean my teeth feel after using this brush.  </li>
            <li> but it made my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li> Oral B&#x27;s Pulsar, is a battery powered disposable toothbrush that cleans using specially designed vibrating bristles, rather than a rotating circular head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  </li>
            <li> Good feeling while brushing Only hope the battery lasts all of 3 months - wish the battery was chargeable and the option to change the brush is with me instead of throwing it away after the battery is over/dead.</li>
            <li> I got unlucky on my shipment because both colors were the same, which isn&#x27;t good when you&#x27;re a couple and need to distinguish who&#x27;s toothbrush is who&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush provides a more clean feeling than a normal toothbrush with the vibrating bristles.</li>
            <li> But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are quite powerful but my teeth do feel a lot better than when i brush with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> Easy storage and very reliable for use.</li>
            <li> Clean the teeth very, very well.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are better than non-powered brushes, but the batteries don&#x27;t last too long (brush is always in great shape and the batteries die before the rest of the brush).</li>
            <li> My favorite so far!</li>
            <li> Besides, dentists say it&#x27;s best to use a new toothbrush every month rather than use the same old, bacteria-laden one whose bristles might have warped.</li>
            <li> I know it is recommended to replace your toothbrush monthly, but I still feel like it is a waste since the bristles are still in great condition.</li>
            <li> Lol don&#x27;t take the battery out, it&#x27;s a waste of time trying to beat the system by replacing the battery.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried, it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li> I love how they are still skinny and light, unlike the bulky battery powered brushes I find locally.</li>
            <li> The yellow bristles feel really nice as they pass over my gums, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to have to brush twice</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> I have now changed to a sonic care power up model and the difference in terms of the how much powerful the brush is and how it feels as it cleans my teeth is tangible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in spite of how easy it seems to change the battery, it is not designed for normal customers to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the pulsating, makes teeth feel extra clean(:</li>
            <li> Once you twist the end cap off the battery is right there</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold this brush with an extended-life battery, but I suspect the business case for it is not appealing to Oral B (most of the differential profits would go to battery maker, not Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typical for Oral B&#x27;s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn&#x27;t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded this review from 2 to 4 stars because the company sent me a free replacement voucher and the new ones lasted in excess of 3 months.</li>
            <li> but when I used it I loved it won&#x27;t be going back to the old one any time soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B battery toothbrushes for years and though my old one still works fine, when I bought this 2-pack for my son, I kept one for myself.</li>
            <li> The headline for my review is exactly how my teeth feel after using Oral-B Pulsar Medium toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One last thing to worry about :-)</li>
            <li> At first I was blown away by the batter-operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> when I first started using this toothbrush 10 yrs ago I used as a travel brush and some how I stayed with it.</li>
            <li> And I suppose if I got a dud the first time, I&#x27;d never try the product again.  </li>
            <li> I can only hope they do a better job then a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Came not in working condition, most likely took the batteries (((</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> After I received my first brush, I immediately purchased a set for my husband &amp; son.</li>
            <li> We prefer this one even at a higher price.</li>
            <li> Finally using an electric tooth brush - This would be a five star rating if the brush allowed for easier battery replacement - Butusing a paper clip on the 12th ridge from the top of the brush to push out the pattery compartment  is not</li>
            <li> You never know how fast a battery might die, but the vibrating brush function is only available while the original battery is working.</li>
            <li> There is not a whole lot more to add - the tooth brush does its job well, and my teeth feel clean without much effort or splatter.</li>
            <li> eventually gave up an purchased a sonicare, and now having used both, I can say that the pulsing action of the sonicare is far superior and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My two pack arrived in pink and blue, great for his and hers.</li>
            <li> Instead, there are times when I still have good strong bristles left but the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> I really like the pulse/vibrating feature of this toothbrush and definitely thing it helps give my teeth a better cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the difference between my old one and this one: the speed is MUCH faster and it cleans better.</li>
            <li> I mean, in as much as one can love a toothbrush, this is the one I love.  </li>
            <li> Usually they are very good and last over 2 months, so maybe I just got a faulty product.</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job of cleaning with less effort.  </li>
            <li> , the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice to just how large this brush head is.</li>
            <li> Occasionally the battery goes out quickly and they cannot be replaced but most of my experience has been good with the battery lasting past the time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my teeth yet strong enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> * Funny direction written on the box, it tells us what to do when battery dies:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Simply throw it away and use a new one&amp;#34;?!</li>
            <li> This brush has great hand-feel, is not too large or too thin.  </li>
            <li> A simple option to open the brush and let the customer be able to switch batteries might have been great, and it doesn&#x27;t seem so hard to design it</li>
            <li> No changing of heads, and much cheaper than even replacement heads for sonicare, not to mention cost of device.</li>
            <li> The battery wears out much sooner than the bristles.</li>
            <li> (thanks tea and coffee).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> (there are youtube videos dedicated to how to accomplish this), but really I don&#x27;t think I should have to and nor do I want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfying…</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this toothbrush is wonderful and gets all those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I feel like they clean much better than non-powered ones, but they&#x27;re not gigantically awkward to hold like most powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel super clean, I gave my roommate the other one</li>
            <li> These really do seem to get the teeth extra clean.</li>
            <li> and tehre&#x27;s not many ways it could be better!</li>
            <li> Pretty harsh on the gums I thought,  even after 2-3 weeks of getting used to it it didn&#x27;t get better for me</li>
            <li> At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B&#x27;s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  </li>
            <li> I mean, they are pretty amazing toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The price for these is not much over the cost of an average manual brush, and the results are so good that I&#x27;m willing to replace it when the battery dies.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(This is a completely updated review from my first entry on this product.)</li>
            <li> For your favorite friends slide one down the heater vent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other battery powered or electric toothbrushes before and they&#x27;ve worked great, but definitely not this one.</li>
            <li> For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  </li>
            <li> so I had no knowing anything at this point) and decided to quickly use the battery in my mom&#x27;s since we didn&#x27;t have extra AAA laying around.</li>
            <li> And it packs for a trip way better (smaller) than those giant spin-y type powered brushes.  </li>
            <li> Although, I think I believe the claim that the sound the Sonic puts out help to shake loose plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush head is high quality, and I&#x27;ve found it to outlast the included battery.  </li>
            <li> and i never noticed that with other toothbrushes of the same kind.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft that, without the battery, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning very well.</li>
            <li> (which I feel normally with a manual brush).</li>
            <li> I think they cover more tooth surface than the ones with round, rotating heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot better than the plain jane ones the dentist sends home, and I don&#x27;t like the spinny electric ones, but</li>
            <li> I just do it when they new ones arrive.  </li>
            <li> Slip in the new AAA battery&lt;</li>
            <li> This promotes the purchase of a new brush for want of a AAA battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably throw it away and get a new one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame that such a great product is ruined by poor battery life.</li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t go back to a regular cheap brush.</li>
            <li> For my gums their not, but if you have very sensitive teeth and gums you might find otherwise.</li>
            <li> And since further moving up to this type of buzzy manual brush, I get stellar reports from my dentists.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last night was when I first used it</li>
            <li> so you get more brushing done with less work, even if you just hold the brush up to your teeth without moving it back and forth.</li>
            <li> Also, the medium bristles are still way too hard for my healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> I think the slightly curved brush head would wrap around the teeth, maintain more contact, than ones with flat heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching to the soft bristles, but I&#x27;ll stay with Oral-B Pulsars.</li>
            <li> If you need a medium to soft bristle this is not for you.</li>
            <li> You must bend the metal contact to remove the old battery.</li>
            <li> : the brush head itself only lasts as long as the battery, with the bristles becoming noticeably softer and starting to fall apart at the four month mark.</li>
            <li> The battery life stated below is wildly optimistic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have tried the soft bristle version and its just a bit too soft and wimpy for for.  </li>
            <li> My mouth does feel cleaner and my teeth like the added foaming action the vibration allows.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much gentler than a standard electric toothbrush, and has softer bristles that made it easier on my gums.</li>
            <li> I bought several for my dad since he loves it so much.</li>
            <li> They give me at least the impression of doing a more thorough job of brushing than with manual tootbrushes, but there is no recharging hassle, nothing else taking up room on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because for those 3 weeks, I loved the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> (why not enjoy the hot water for a few more minutes?)</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, but after having it only a few months, the battery died!</li>
            <li> I think it would be better if the&lt;br /&gt;end of the brush was round but long the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel right if I get any other brand.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes, too bad the battery can&#x27;t (easily) be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Wish you could replace the batteries, as they seem to sometimes run out long before the toothbrush itself is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li> I tested before I used and the little yellow flaps swished back and forth just fine.  </li>
            <li> As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products.</li>
            <li> so prefer these Oral-B ones because you don&#x27;t have to charge them, the battery is sealed against water, lasts for at least a month and are light.</li>
            <li> The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  </li>
            <li> so I went back to my old manual brushes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched to simple manual brushes, my checkups improved markedly.  </li>
            <li> I was a fan - it didn&#x27;t have as much power as other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly have to give a bad review when this is a great toothbrush because the battery died in both units after only ONE month of use when the packaging states that it&#x27;s designed to last three.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I see lots of other complaints about early death after only a week or two or maybe a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my opinion - damage is inevitable if water seeps in, and the brushes only last so long and should to replaced.  </li>
            <li> I thought they would be to tough and not soft enough to clean my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I love the way these work, I am totally disgusted with the lack of easy battery replacement.</li>
            <li> btw one reason I used had to do with how flat the brush head was</li>
            <li> in the past few yrs though I noticed a significant difference on the quality of the brush that I get and the health of my gum and teeth.</li>
            <li> Just a really stupid move design wise to let me access the battery and not tell me it&#x27;s not replaceable before I rip it out.</li>
            <li> The battery usually lasts about three months, but I have had the occasional one last only one month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gum cuts from it (from a single use, AND while being very careful with applied pressure and such) which took days to heal.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can scrub half my mouth at a time if I want to, while also using the longer bristles at the front and back for detail work.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single cavity since I started using them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To turn off brush: just srew to the left a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While screwimg on cap be careful \</li>
            <li> I saw some complaints about the medium being too rough on the gums but did not have that</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Having had this experience, I&#x27;m certainly not going to purchase this product again and would advise others to stay away from it too.</li>
            <li> the Pulsar is as light as a manual toothbrush, but works just as well as an expensive electric one!</li>
            <li> Be careful where you buy these because shops that sell only a few may have old brushes with weak batteries on their shelves.  </li>
            <li> If it stops, you&#x27;ve still got a toothbrush, so it&#x27;s not a complete waste I guess.  </li>
            <li> After this I can never go back to those tiny brush heads on the big expensive electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The same weakness makes it difficult to use a regular toothbrush because of the extra motion required.</li>
            <li> All dentists I&#x27;ve met aggressively praise the other Oral-B: the spin-y type.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The same toothbrushes purchased at the supermarket last at least 4-6 months!  </li>
            <li> are sites that show you how to replace the battery, but it&#x27;s not worth it in</li>
            <li> my old electric brush had a thick brush head that made it hard to use but the new one I bought from philips is as thin as this one.</li>
            <li> I took the batts out and tested in other devices and did a voltage test... dead.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a little over three months, which is just what it says on the box.</li>
            <li> but I usually pick it up from Walmart or some other place.</li>
            <li> of foil: around  the size of the palm of your hand, crunch it up, than shape it as a thick round stick, bend it as a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape, half side of U should be between battery and metal the other half between metal and cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands such as Crest, CVS and several very expensive Sonicare ones</li>
            <li> mine were both the same color, which is very confusing if you are a couple and share a bathroom...</li>
            <li> My 2-pack came with one toothbrush with a dead battery.  </li>
            <li> (the battery was dead</li>
            <li> A waste of money over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased 6 of these and two came with dead Duracell AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> but you have to destroy the connection to remove it</li>
            <li> Batteries dies a few weeks in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was still using at night) and yet ours died within a few days of each other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So really, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> the battery life of this toothbrush is often not very good as it lasts less than a month.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy that the battery on these toothbrushes that I purchased on Amazon only last less than a month!  </li>
            <li> But I got years of bad checkups using those (despite being VERY diligent about using them, and flossing/Proxabrushing/etc.).  </li>
            <li> Batteries Dead!</li>
            <li> (no goofy Dr. Seuss designs).  </li>
            <li> When you bend it back after replacing the battery, you cannot get the base screwed back on without twisting the metal contact.</li>
            <li> figuring out how to shape the foil..is hard.</li>
            <li> Or the company&#x27;s greed, hard to tell.</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the bristles are too hard.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a more expensive travel electric toothbrush which I was very disappointed in.</li>
            <li> The less expensive ones don&#x27;t have curved heads.</li>
            <li> seriously ,  been buying these for years.</li>
            <li> The brushes online, must be outdated products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so silly to have a toothbrush advertised as battery operated, but not replaceable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The expensive</li>
            <li> I have to subtract one star because they are a bit expensive for toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my wife bought me a pair of these</li>
            <li> is especially annoying as I was using mine way less than my wife was using hers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying for something to be broken when you get it.  </li>
            <li> However, the battery compartment is designed so that it is virtually impossible to remove the battery without bending the metal contacts to the point that the vibration mechanism is rendered inoperable.</li>
            <li> The company has purposely made these so it is nearly impossible to change the battery.</li>
            <li> so bad - Look up the Youtube instruction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric toothbrush with this brush form-factor, so for now I feel like an idiot and continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a terrible product, but you can save it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You get what you pay for on this one. I used this toothbrush for only one month and the only reason I stopped using it was my gum on one tooth was starting to bother me. I recently had to pay $700 at a Periodist to have a gum graft and fix the damage this toothbrush did to my gum in the ONE month I used it. I&#x27;ve used several other battery powered or electric toothbrushes before and they&#x27;ve worked great, but definitely not this one.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  They are much better than the rechargeable ones I have used before.  I just wish they were more environmentally sound.  The batteries should be removable so you can dispose of them correctly, even you you can&#x27;t replace them.</li>
            <li> been using this type of toothbrush for about 6 or 7 years.. my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel right if I get any other brand.</li>
            <li> Oral B&#x27;s Pulsar, is a battery powered disposable toothbrush that cleans using specially designed vibrating bristles, rather than a rotating circular head.  The vibrating action is similar to a Sonicare, as the bristles scrub the teeth, and stimulate the gums.  It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference, but this method may be more comfortable, and do a better job at cleaning, than a rotary brush.  And children may find it more fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many brushes the Pulsar is good for is not specified, but the non-replaceable Duracell battery, is supposed to have enough juice to power the brush for three months.  The brush is relatively quiet, but the power delivered to the bristles is pretty substantial, with enough vibration and force to do a good job of cleaning.  Typical for Oral B&#x27;s manual toothbrushes, the handle is ergonomically designed, with ridged rubber strips for better grip, and isn&#x27;t oversized, like many electric toothbrushes.  Separate on and off buttons, are located on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsar is being packaged and sold in various quantities.  At present, between four to five dollars per brush, is a good price, however that much, for a device that lasts just three months, is a bit pricey, when you consider that a rechargeable toothbrush like Oral B&#x27;s Vitality can be had for less than twenty dollars.  Amazon is not the best source for great deals on household products, so check your local store for a better price.  For some mysterious reason, the Pulsar two pack is another of the many products that Amazon will only ship to the 48 contiguous states.  The four star rating is primarily for the performance of the product, as the replacement cost will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively compact, convenient, and comfortable to use, the Pulsar is great when traveling, or for a quick refresher at work.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrushes.  Very powerful vibration.  Clean the teeth very, very well.  If you have never tried, it&#x27;s so worth it.  Love em.  My pack came with blue and red if color matters I was pleased with what I received.  The headline for my review is exactly how my teeth feel after using Oral-B Pulsar Medium toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes even after I have tried many others. I have spinners and sonic but this is the one I grab first most days. Occasionally the battery goes out quickly and they cannot be replaced but most of my experience has been good with the battery lasting past the time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than non-powered brushes, but the batteries don&#x27;t last too long (brush is always in great shape and the batteries die before the rest of the brush). Also, the medium bristles are still way too hard for my healthy mouth. I&#x27;m switching to the soft bristles, but I&#x27;ll stay with Oral-B Pulsars.</li>
            <li> I set the toothbrushes up on a repeating order. They came just on time!  Now, I do not need to think of when to change out my toothbrush.  I just do it when they new ones arrive.  One last thing to worry about :-)</li>
            <li> This works just as well as sonicare, and is much more cost effective and user friendly - just use until battery runs out and toss.  No changing of heads, and much cheaper than even replacement heads for sonicare, not to mention cost of device.</li>
            <li> This is moreso an indictment of buying these online as opposed to the actual toothbrushes.  My 2-pack came with one toothbrush with a dead battery.  Good product, but you are better off testing them in the store to make sure the brushes have battery power left.</li>
            <li> This brush is, as the title says, a great low-cost alternative.  It&#x27;s also a low-effort one.  No changing batteries or brush heads--just toss and replace.  The brush head is high quality, and I&#x27;ve found it to outlast the included battery.  The brush head vibrates, rather than rotate like a traditional electric brush.  It earned me my only Dentist-supplied compliment.</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I generally recommend Oral B products. And I think this toothbrush does a good job . . . until the battery dies - - which occurs way before the brush needs to be replaced. You would think, therefore, that Oral B would make the battery user-replaceable. In fact, the toothbrush does use a AAA battery and the handle unscrews so that the battery is accessible. However, the battery compartment is designed so that it is virtually impossible to remove the battery without bending the metal contacts to the point that the vibration mechanism is rendered inoperable. There is a Youtube video that shows how to change the battery using a screwdriver and an Exacto knife but why should it be necessary to jump through hoops just to change a battery???</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, but after having it only a few months, the battery died! Tried simply popping it out to replace it and bam, metal gets bent. I assumed no big deal (the battery was dead so I had no knowing anything at this point) and decided to quickly use the battery in my mom&#x27;s since we didn&#x27;t have extra AAA laying around. Go to turn mine on and it doesn&#x27;t work. Try to put it back in hers and it doesn&#x27;t work... It&#x27;s so silly to have a toothbrush advertised as battery operated, but not replaceable.  I ended up figuring out a way to get mine to work by overbending the metal and sticking the battery in, then bending the metal back. It strips the outside of the battery and the button doesn&#x27;t click like it&#x27;s supposed to going to the off position, but it works. If it stops, you&#x27;ve still got a toothbrush, so it&#x27;s not a complete waste I guess.  Just a really stupid move design wise to let me access the battery and not tell me it&#x27;s not replaceable before I rip it out.</li>
            <li> Bought these by mistake, thinking they were regular tooth brushes.  But after trying them, they are wonderful, my new regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Batteries Dead! Bought product for a science project so it does not matter since we are taking product apart, but if needed for original purpose would have had an issue.</li>
            <li> These are a great inexpensive &amp;#34;elecetric&amp;#34; toothbrush. We use these all the time, especially my kids. They have never had a cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Pulsar brushes vibrate nicely, and get the plaque off the teeth really well. I love how they are still skinny and light, unlike the bulky battery powered brushes I find locally. The yellow bristles feel really nice as they pass over my gums, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to have to brush twice (which I feel normally with a manual brush).</li>
            <li> These brushes&#x27; bristles &#x27;vibrate&#x27; so you get more brushing done with less work, even if you just hold the brush up to your teeth without moving it back and forth. I think they cover more tooth surface than the ones with round, rotating heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other brands such as Crest, CVS and several very expensive Sonicare ones [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White]]. The less expensive ones don&#x27;t have curved heads. I think the slightly curved brush head would wrap around the teeth, maintain more contact, than ones with flat heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expensive, re-chargeable toothbrushes break if you drop them. Although, I think I believe the claim that the sound the Sonic puts out help to shake loose plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brush my teeth in the shower (why not enjoy the hot water for a few more minutes?) so prefer these Oral-B ones because you don&#x27;t have to charge them, the battery is sealed against water, lasts for at least a month and are light. Besides, dentists say it&#x27;s best to use a new toothbrush every month rather than use the same old, bacteria-laden one whose bristles might have warped.</li>
            <li> If you need a medium to soft bristle this is not for you. Pretty harsh on the gums I thought,  even after 2-3 weeks of getting used to it it didn&#x27;t get better for me so I went back to my old manual brushes.</li>
            <li> - Screw off cap&lt;br /&gt;- SLIP out battery , TRY NOT TO BEND OUT OF SHAPE ANY METAL.&lt;br /&gt;- Slip in the new AAA battery&lt;br /&gt;- Fill in the space between the (minus-side of)  battery and metal with aluminum foil.&lt;br /&gt;Size of foil: around  the size of the palm of your hand, crunch it up, than shape it as a thick round stick, bend it as a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape, half side of U should be between battery and metal the other half between metal and cap.&lt;br /&gt;- While screwimg on cap be careful \ make sure the foil stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush will turn on when screwing the cap on because its compressing the foil , metal, foil,and battery together !&lt;br /&gt;To turn off brush: just srew to the left a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m doing this for years it works!&lt;br /&gt;Just figuring out how to shape the foil..is hard.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes! My teeth always feel super clean, I gave my roommate the other one and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> Walmart &#x3D; $4.99 for 1&lt;br /&gt;Amazon &#x3D; $6.89 for 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said. Great toothbrush too, been using these for 2 years. I never succeeded in replacing the internal battery, never get it to work again.</li>
            <li> I love the way these work, I am totally disgusted with the lack of easy battery replacement. I have attempted it with two units. You must bend the metal contact to remove the old battery. When you bend it back after replacing the battery, you cannot get the base screwed back on without twisting the metal contact. I have modified it several ways, to no avail. If Oral B can&#x27;t make these so the batteries are easily replaced I will no longer buy them. The battery wears out much sooner than the bristles.</li>
            <li> Needed this! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Its the best of both worlds- the Pulsar is as light as a manual toothbrush, but works just as well as an expensive electric one! I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them more and more.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. People always comment on how white my teeth are and I know it&#x27;s from these brushes because when I try another non-vibrating brand my teeth get yellow (thanks tea and coffee). Worth it.</li>
            <li> works , now I can smile again !!!!</li>
            <li> One of the two toothbrushes received yesterday, August 5, is non functional.  The battery must have died in the warehouse. We would like a replacement, but not a trip to the Post Office at our age.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the last year.  Gentle on my teeth yet strong enough to get the job done.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You never know how fast a battery might die, but the vibrating brush function is only available while the original battery is working. A simple option to open the brush and let the customer be able to switch batteries might have been great, and it doesn&#x27;t seem so hard to design it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in spite of how easy it seems to change the battery, it is not designed for normal customers to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Funny direction written on the box, it tells us what to do when battery dies:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Simply throw it away and use a new one&amp;#34;?!</li>
            <li> Good feeling while brushing Only hope the battery lasts all of 3 months - wish the battery was chargeable and the option to change the brush is with me instead of throwing it away after the battery is over/dead.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush provides a more clean feeling than a normal toothbrush with the vibrating bristles. My two pack arrived in pink and blue, great for his and hers. I saw some complaints about the medium being too rough on the gums but did not have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback is the battery life of these. It is about a month if you brush 2x daily and about two months if you only brush 1x daily. I know it is recommended to replace your toothbrush monthly, but I still feel like it is a waste since the bristles are still in great condition.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush for getting a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. Batteries are will outlast the amount of time you keep the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a little over three months, which is just what it says on the box. I don&#x27;t understand why some people want to extend that: the brush head itself only lasts as long as the battery, with the bristles becoming noticeably softer and starting to fall apart at the four month mark. I find the battery life serves as a convenient reminder that it&#x27;s time to replace my brush head for maximum cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice to just how large this brush head is. It&#x27;s massive! I feel like I can scrub half my mouth at a time if I want to, while also using the longer bristles at the front and back for detail work.  After this I can never go back to those tiny brush heads on the big expensive electric toothbrushes. Plus the rubbery bits at the sides provide great gum stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try! You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> These would be okay if the batteries lasted consistently beyond fifteen uses, but often that is not the case. The company has purposely made these so it is nearly impossible to change the battery. This promotes the purchase of a new brush for want of a AAA battery. A waste of money over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually gave up an purchased a sonicare, and now having used both, I can say that the pulsing action of the sonicare is far superior and worth the extra cost. I can not recommend this shortly lived disposable brush.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 6 of these and two came with dead Duracell AAA batteries. I took the batts out and tested in other devices and did a voltage test... dead. Once you twist the end cap off the battery is right there but you have to destroy the connection to remove it... set up this way purposely. What a shame that they do this. Great vibrating action on the ones that work though.</li>
            <li> These really do seem to get the teeth extra clean. Wish you could replace the batteries, as they seem to sometimes run out long before the toothbrush itself is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li> I was kind of sketchy about Tia toothbrush at first but when I used it I loved it won&#x27;t be going back to the old one any time soon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 75 percenter. Good for some. Ok for me.</li>
            <li> Batteries dies a few weeks in. Def will just buy these at the store...</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are adequate! At first I was blown away by the batter-operated toothbrush. It feels great. However, the battery is removable, but not replaceable! What!? So, you&#x27;ll need a two-pack.</li>
            <li> These are the best tooth brushes for my use... this is a very good deal and come factory packed. So really, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> the battery life of this toothbrush is often not very good as it lasts less than a month. when I first started using this toothbrush 10 yrs ago I used as a travel brush and some how I stayed with it. in the past few yrs though I noticed a significant difference on the quality of the brush that I get and the health of my gum and teeth. I have now changed to a sonic care power up model and the difference in terms of the how much powerful the brush is and how it feels as it cleans my teeth is tangible. I will not be buying this product again. btw one reason I used had to do with how flat the brush head was my old electric brush had a thick brush head that made it hard to use but the new one I bought from philips is as thin as this one.</li>
            <li> I buy these every six months or so since the battery is self contained.  They work great.  For those concerned about some lemons, I haven&#x27;t run into the problem, but believe that there are lemons out there.  But this is a bit like worrying about buying a dud light bulb.  It&#x27;s annoying for something to be broken when you get it.  And I suppose if I got a dud the first time, I&#x27;d never try the product again.  But a toothbrush isn&#x27;t an investment.  I&#x27;d probably throw it away and get a new one.  They really are good and feel well made for $5 per brush.</li>
            <li> I use the Pulsar Oral B regularly.  I like the extra-clean of an electric toothbrush but cannot tolerate the added weight of traditional electric brushes because of weakness in my arms.  The same weakness makes it difficult to use a regular toothbrush because of the extra motion required. This one is about the weight of a regular, non-electric, non-battery toothbrush.  It does an amazing job of cleaning with less effort.  The battery usually lasts about three months, but I have had the occasional one last only one month.  Be careful where you buy these because shops that sell only a few may have old brushes with weak batteries on their shelves.  If the batteries lasted longer, I would give it ten stars!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this.  I tested before I used and the little yellow flaps swished back and forth just fine.  After just one use they don&#x27;t move anymore.  The unit still vibrates, but nothing moves.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> There is not a whole lot more to add - the tooth brush does its job well, and my teeth feel clean without much effort or splatter.</li>
            <li> Thes are great but battery changes need improving so when you do change the batteries, you don&#x27;t ruin the brush!</li>
            <li> UPDATE (30 Sep 2017):&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)  Avoid the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; stiffness version of this.  I&#x27;ve had gum cuts from it (from a single use, AND while being very careful with applied pressure and such) which took days to heal.  The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; stiffness brush should be used solely for cleaning industrial parts -- but come to think of it, it might be an excellent life-hack in that service.  The &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; is closer to a true &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; bristle stiffness, and work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The battery life stated below is wildly optimistic.  The actual life I&#x27;ve gotten from these, after tracking it for about 3 years, is about 4-5 weeks (that&#x27;s with 4-5 minutes total use per day, every day, and no, I never leave it running).  This is shorter than the bristle life.  But this is still my go-to toothbrush, since the excellent cleaning performance is worth paying for a new toothbrush more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· I get great checkups since adopting this.  All dentists I&#x27;ve met aggressively praise the other Oral-B: the spin-y type.  But I got years of bad checkups using those (despite being VERY diligent about using them, and flossing/Proxabrushing/etc.).  As soon as I switched to simple manual brushes, my checkups improved markedly.  And since further moving up to this type of buzzy manual brush, I get stellar reports from my dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· This brush has great hand-feel, is not too large or too thin.  The weight is good (light).  And it packs for a trip way better (smaller) than those giant spin-y type powered brushes.  The bristles feel fine (no goofy Dr. Seuss designs).  And my teeth and breath feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SO-SO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· The battery life is maybe 12 weeks.  At first that bugged me, because I thought the bristles had a bit more life in them yet, and when I tried to replace the battery, I found it was not designed for that.  (Replacing the battery tends to make the on/off switch erratic.)  It would be nice if they sold this brush with an extended-life battery, but I suspect the business case for it is not appealing to Oral B (most of the differential profits would go to battery maker, not Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· The price for these is not much over the cost of an average manual brush, and the results are so good that I&#x27;m willing to replace it when the battery dies.  This is my favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is a completely updated review from my first entry on this product.)</li>
            <li> The battery died about 3 weeks after I got it.  Probably won&#x27;t buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;Also mine were both the same color, which is very confusing if you are a couple and share a bathroom...</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I mean, in as much as one can love a toothbrush, this is the one I love.  I&#x27;ve been using them now for many years.  I like the size in my hand, I like the medium bristles, I like the amount of vibration, I like how clean my teeth feel after using this brush.  My only quibble, and the reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that on some of them the battery has a very short life.  I wonder whether these have been sitting on shelves longer, but it almost doesn&#x27;t matter....  the battery should outlast the bristles for this to be a perfect 5 star item.  Instead, there are times when I still have good strong bristles left but the battery is dead.  I know I can change the battery myself (there are youtube videos dedicated to how to accomplish this), but really I don&#x27;t think I should have to and nor do I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the soft bristle version and its just a bit too soft and wimpy for for.  This brush with the medium bristles seems to give a good cleaning.  Some have complained that the bristles are too hard.  For my gums their not, but if you have very sensitive teeth and gums you might find otherwise.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 pairs of these from Amazon and both turned out to be duds !! Just a week after using these the batteries started dying out on them, they&#x27;re supposed to last 3 months. Having had this experience, I&#x27;m certainly not going to purchase this product again and would advise others to stay away from it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a over a year now, the recent one I bought stopped working after 2 weeks. Usually they are very good and last over 2 months, so maybe I just got a faulty product. Otherwise, these are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> item&lt;br /&gt;is&lt;br /&gt;good,&lt;br /&gt;You do not need anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one get one free item for sale now?&lt;br /&gt;Must buy item.</li>
            <li> I had bought them then read that medium bristles aren&#x27;t great for your teeth. I thought they would be to tough and not soft enough to clean my teeth and gums. It&#x27;s wonderful with continued use my gums have gotten much better.</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; toothbrush on the market. Beats the electric models by a mile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B battery toothbrushes for years and though my old one still works fine, when I bought this 2-pack for my son, I kept one for myself. I was pleasantly surprised at the difference between my old one and this one: the speed is MUCH faster and it cleans better. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Great build quality, big brush, powered, get many of them.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush. Like it much better than my wife&#x27;s $80 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what you do when the battery runs out in two weeks like most of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to change the battery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/T7EZsY8JJJY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible product, but you can save it.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. Lol don&#x27;t take the battery out, it&#x27;s a waste of time trying to beat the system by replacing the battery. There is a tiny metal piece inside that will bend if you try to replace the battery which will prevent you from keeping the toothbrush longer than its intended use. Other than that, this toothbrush is wonderful and gets all those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I love these. The vibrations are quite powerful but my teeth do feel a lot better than when i brush with a normal brush. Great price for the two of them!</li>
            <li> I can only hope they do a better job then a manual toothbrush. My mouth does feel cleaner and my teeth like the added foaming action the vibration allows. Try them and then decide what&#x27;s best for your needs.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as I expected behind the top and bottom teeth.  I think it would be better if the&lt;br /&gt;end of the brush was round but long the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth white as can be.</li>
            <li> I mean, they are pretty amazing toothbrushes. I like them a lot better than the plain jane ones the dentist sends home, and I don&#x27;t like the spinny electric ones, but with the vibration in these, my teeth feel a lot cleaner than with a standard manual toothbrush. My favorite so far!</li>
            <li> Came not in working condition, most likely took the batteries (((</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much gentler than a standard electric toothbrush, and has softer bristles that made it easier on my gums. When I first got it I was a fan - it didn&#x27;t have as much power as other electric toothbrushes but it made my mouth feel clean and I liked the shape of the head for getting between my teeth. However, the battery died after 2 weeks. The bristles are so soft that, without the battery, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning very well. So I paid 6.50 at Walmart for 2 weeks use of it. I&#x27;ll stick to other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought several for my dad since he loves it so much. He said he can change the battery by screwing the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li> [Update] I upgraded this review from 2 to 4 stars because the company sent me a free replacement voucher and the new ones lasted in excess of 3 months. (Yes I know I should replace them sooner, but I wanted to test them out and I keep them in sanitary conditions when not in use, so we gave them a bit longer.)&lt;br /&gt;If the ones we got were a fluke, that&#x27;s understandable. I do think the product itself is fantastic and tehre&#x27;s not many ways it could be better! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the battery was replaceable/accessible in the case I got one with a faulty battery. Popping in a dollar store battery to replace it would be fine with me, but I don&#x27;t like the gamble on whether or not my toothbrush is going to work, or the need to call for a replacement if one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly have to give a bad review when this is a great toothbrush because the battery died in both units after only ONE month of use when the packaging states that it&#x27;s designed to last three.&lt;br /&gt;This is especially annoying as I was using mine way less than my wife was using hers (I have a Spinbrush I was still using at night) and yet ours died within a few days of each other.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like the product is designed to die way before its time. I see lots of other complaints about early death after only a week or two or maybe a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame that such a great product is ruined by poor battery life. Or the company&#x27;s greed, hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a more expensive travel electric toothbrush which I was very disappointed in. (travel sonic). This one was more than I expected for a very small electric toothbrush, and I was fully satisfied. The only additional thing I wanted was a case to carry it in, which the travel sonic came with, but that one was so ineffective I wouldn&#x27;t carry it no matter how convenient the packaging was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a home electric toothbrush, this might not meet the needs of some. But if you want an electric toothbrush to travel with, I was very pleased with this one from a mobile &amp;#34;good enough for the road!&amp;#34; perspective.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite disposable toothbrush.  The colors are fun and the grip on the handle is superb.  I really like the pulse/vibrating feature of this toothbrush and definitely thing it helps give my teeth a better cleaning.  I have to subtract one star because they are a bit expensive for toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is one the best toothbrushes ever. The design is nice and very comfortable. Easy storage and very reliable for use.</li>
            <li> I had a Pulsar Medium Toothbrush and was so impressed with the cleaning I got from it I wanted to insure I had them available to me for time to come.  I will say it is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It more than lived up to my expectations. After I received my first brush, I immediately purchased a set for my husband &amp; son. This was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying…although I don&#x27;t use them for my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes.  I feel like they clean much better than non-powered ones, but they&#x27;re not gigantically awkward to hold like most powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Good, delivered. Thanks. Item arrived exactly as expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes, too bad the battery can&#x27;t (easily) be replaced.  Oral-B needs to modify this unit to allow replaceable batteries and brushes.  Seems so wasteful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are sites that show you how to replace the battery, but it&#x27;s not worth it in my opinion - damage is inevitable if water seeps in, and the brushes only last so long and should to replaced.  I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric toothbrush with this brush form-factor, so for now I feel like an idiot and continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are my bread and butter.</li>
            <li> Batteries died after 3 weeks, when they are supposed to last about 3 months! Too bad, because for those 3 weeks, I loved the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of tooth brush for quite a while but I usually pick it up from Walmart or some other place. I started using the subscribe and save and decided to get one of these. Last night was when I first used it and I noticed a strong rubber/tire smell flrom thr handle and i never noticed that with other toothbrushes of the same kind. Hopefully it goes away but out of the many pulsars I&#x27;ve used, not one had any smell at all</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my wife bought me a pair of these but I like them. They give me at least the impression of doing a more thorough job of brushing than with manual tootbrushes, but there is no recharging hassle, nothing else taking up room on my bathroom counter. The battery lasts 6 weeks or so which also reminds me to change my toothbrush regularly. And it works fine as a manual toothbrush if it runs out of juice and you need to wait for more to be delivered.</li>
            <li> The M size Oral -B Pulsar is bigger in size than the M Oral-B Pulsar that sells at Costco (4 in a pack). We prefer this one even at a higher price.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and I just can&#x27;t go back to a regular cheap brush. I can definitely tell the difference between these and a non-vibrating brush. I haven&#x27;t had a single cavity since I started using them!</li>
            <li> best toothbrush I have every had and the delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes they work very nicely.</li>
            <li> Did you know that if you turn these on and hide them somewhere good it will drive someome nuts. For your favorite friends slide one down the heater vent. Works best when the batteries are low; rather than throwing it out,  have some fun with a nice bright smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously ,  been buying these for years. Fav brush. But the pranks do work.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy that the battery on these toothbrushes that I purchased on Amazon only last less than a month!  The same toothbrushes purchased at the supermarket last at least 4-6 months!  The brushes online, must be outdated products.  Will no longer purchase them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it works great, the speedy vibrations leaves a very clean sensation, I recommended.</li>
            <li> Finally using an electric tooth brush - This would be a five star rating if the brush allowed for easier battery replacement - Butusing a paper clip on the 12th ridge from the top of the brush to push out the pattery compartment  is not so bad - Look up the Youtube instruction - The brush lasts quite a long time when using good quality batteries six to eight weeks or more...</li>
            <li> Same product in stores, just cheaper. Love the pulsating, makes teeth feel extra clean(:</li>
            <li> The only toothbrush I&#x27;ll use. I got unlucky on my shipment because both colors were the same, which isn&#x27;t good when you&#x27;re a couple and need to distinguish who&#x27;s toothbrush is who&#x27;s.</li>
