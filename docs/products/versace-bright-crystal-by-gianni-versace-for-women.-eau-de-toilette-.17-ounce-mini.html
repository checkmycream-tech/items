            <li>it is cute, and the smell is good.</li>
            <li>Bought this sample to see if I liked as I was intrigued with a perfume containing Lotus.</li>
            <li>Kind of musky for my taste.&amp;#34; to a 4.</li>

            <li>This gives off a really nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragance and the size, perfect for travel !!!</li>
            <li>Its light, flowery scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This was given as a gift and my friend liked it better than I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for people who are really sensitive to smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a really great deal and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>The sent is very light.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for traveling and true to real Versace scent.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly which was good as I wanted it for traveling.  </li>
            <li>It has a heavenly scent and would agree with most women&#x27;s keen floral scent appreciation.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PERFUME</li>
            <li>Love the scent</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so feminine, and I have had many compliments on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but as you spray more, the smell got perfect and last so long！</li>
            <li>I love the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>Just OK scent.</li>
            <li>I like it ok but</li>
            <li>(I have allergies to many cologne&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of YSL Babydoll for years and this feels like a more well rounded, grown-up version of that.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell</li>
            <li>From a 2 and &amp;#34;It&#x27;s an ok perfume.</li>
            <li>The citrus (yuzu) stands out on me the most.</li>
            <li>Perhaps you will love both like I do.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend tell me, she really love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances in a portable glass bottle.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>UNLIKE SO MANY MANY FRAGRANCES</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m keeping mine because I love the scent.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>If intending to get as a gift keep this in mind that you will not be able to use the box it comes in.</li>
            <li>There is no spray top of roller ball....</li>
            <li>Other than that, great size, great scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful, very light and fresh fragrance that is super easy to wear in hot weather.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and undamaged as well.</li>
            <li>It smell strong sense of alcohol at the beginning.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about scents and this one is just great, very feminine without being overly sweet.  </li>
            <li>Was intended as a gift, the scent is fine...</li>
            <li>i bought this to see if i would enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>It would make a fantastic gift.</li>
            <li>It has longevity with a light flower smell that isn&#x27;t overly pungent.  </li>
            <li>Love this little bottle, lightly scented and great to take with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the cost!  </li>
            <li>Not the original.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to use more of it since it&#x27;s so light, but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for wearing in the office because it is such a light EDT, so it&#x27;s not as strong as an actual perfume.</li>
            <li>Wonderful light, delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li>i have the versace bright crystal and versace yellow diamon perfumes</li>
            <li>- jars personally do nothing for me when it comes to judging the aromatic flavors of a good parfum.  </li>
            <li>Good smelling product although took quite a long time to get.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s Versace&amp;#34; when any one asks and I think this might become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>Another favorite is D&amp;G Light Blue Toilette Spray (don&#x27;t like the perfume one), so</li>
            <li>I found it was priced just right at Amazon.</li>
            <li>The sillage of Bright Crystal is average</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like how it smells when you first put it on but when the smell sets in after a few minutes it smells great.</li>
            <li>but like I stated above most women like this Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li>So be gentle with it!  </li>
            <li>The smell (on me) is almost fruity, almost floral, confident and sexy, complex yet balanced.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not a statement making perfume or a particularly unforgettable one, but it is very inoffensive and just plain clean smelling; it&#x27;s the type of scent</li>
            <li>its very feminine and my first day of wearing it</li>
            <li>Very sweet smelling; a little too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li>Very unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>Body mist disappears on me within the hour, while this fragrance lingers until the rest of the day, though it is very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Very small in size but good smell</li>
            <li>its something i would wear on a daily basis or a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have LESS jar and better parfum.  </li>
            <li>very pretty light fragrance,  doesn&#x27;t last very long tho&#x27;.</li>
            <li>it was tiny but worth purchasing a sample prior to a full bottle</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy the mini before buying the bigger bottle, scent doesn&#x27;t last long because its an eau de toilette, but its all good.</li>
            <li>Once I have room on the shelf, this one will be my new #1.</li>
            <li>: I gave in and purchased a 3oz bottle of this lovely perfume; it&#x27;s slowly become one of my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I could find a small, affordable bottle of this EDT before considering a full-size</li>
            <li>Love smell but to pricy for such a small bottle</li>
            <li>YOU CAN BARELY HOLD</li>
            <li>little too much for me</li>
            <li>Very subtle and classy, not flowery or sweet.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I could find a small, affordable bottle of this EDT before considering a full-size</li>

            <li> little too much for me</li>
            <li> Very subtle and classy, not flowery or sweet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she pulled the top off completely and took the little metal spray piece with that wide cover, but we are getting it fixed soon.  </li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but seems to last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> The scent stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I open it empty! !</li>
            <li> Only complaint is this bottle was just so tiny!</li>
            <li> You can only dump it out and that gets messy.</li>
            <li> I bought a mini bottle because I&#x27;m still trying to use up other perfumes I have.  </li>
            <li> but the bottle is so small and on the back of the box they scratched off where it says sample not for sale what a rip off</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than what I expected!</li>
            <li> But the large bottle is just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you would like to know an estimated size I am an average sized woman</li>
            <li> The bottle was small but that was expected for the price.</li>

            <li> Versace Bright Crystal reminds me of a garden of roses.  It has a heavenly scent and would agree with most women&#x27;s keen floral scent appreciation.  The jar it comes in is overly attractive - jars personally do nothing for me when it comes to judging the aromatic flavors of a good parfum.  I&#x27;d rather have LESS jar and better parfum.  The sillage of Bright Crystal is average but like I stated above most women like this Eau De Toilette. I purchased my bottle at perfume.com for 1.7 oz for $38.47 NO shipping &amp; handling charges.</li>
            <li> i bought this to see if i would enjoy the smell. it was tiny but worth purchasing a sample prior to a full bottle</li>
            <li> Smells good, I love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME SMELL SOO GOOD N THE SCENT IS LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly which was good as I wanted it for traveling.  Love the scent it is really nice.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent and the bottle is lovely too.</li>
            <li> What can I say!  I LOVE Versace Bright Crystal.  It makes me feel so feminine, and I have had many compliments on the fragrance.  It&#x27;s so worth the cost!  Jeannie</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, good value for the money</li>
            <li> I gave a bottle of this to my teenage niece for her recent birthday and she loved it. The smell is very nice and she said it lasts all day. It arrived very quickly and undamaged as well.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my favorate！ I wanna wear it every day！ It smell strong sense of alcohol at the beginning. wanted to return it. but as you spray more, the smell got perfect and last so long！ great product, great seller！</li>
            <li> I got this small bottle for my mom for Christmas, because she doesn&#x27;t usually wear a lot of perfume.  She likes body mists, like from B&amp;BW, but this size was perfect for her.  Unfortunately, she pulled the top off completely and took the little metal spray piece with that wide cover, but we are getting it fixed soon.  So be gentle with it!  Other than that, great size, great scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Packaged well and smells wonderful. I wanted to buy the mini before buying the bigger bottle, scent doesn&#x27;t last long because its an eau de toilette, but its all good.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling and true to real Versace scent. However, really hard to apply to body because sprayer not included. You can only dump it out and that gets messy.</li>
            <li> The bottle was small but that was expected for the price. It shipped the same day I ordered it and I recieved it the same week!</li>
            <li> Love it smells so good!  Bought a smaller bottle to test out the fragrance but now that I know I like it will be buying a larger one!</li>
            <li> Very sweet smelling; a little too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> it is cute, and the smell is good. like a girl. and it is a travel size for me to try it</li>
            <li> this is a VERY small bottle.  But the large bottle is just too expensive.  The smell is amazing.  It&#x27;s subtle but seems to last the whole day.  There is no spray nozzle so you have to dab it with your finger.  Would purchase this again</li>
            <li> I love the way it smelled. its very feminine and my first day of wearing it, i got lots of compliment, from my friends and co workers. its something i would wear on a daily basis or a special occasion. the only thing i did not like about it is the amount, i knew it would be small but i didn&#x27;t expect it to be that small. its about as big as your thumb. so it only lasted me for about a week because i used it on a daily basis. i will definitely buy it again, and again, and again, and again, and again!</li>
            <li> Purchase was good. Delivered within time frame. The sent is very light. Watery. Fresh. Just OK scent. Not something I&#x27;d wear to make me feel like wearing a perfume. Very unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and my friend liked it better than I did. I like it ok but&lt;br /&gt;a little too much for me (I have allergies to many cologne&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Bought this sample to see if I liked as I was intrigued with a perfume containing Lotus. I absolutely love it! I have been a fan of YSL Babydoll for years and this feels like a more well rounded, grown-up version of that. The smell (on me) is almost fruity, almost floral, confident and sexy, complex yet balanced. Add to that I get to say &amp;#34;Oh, it&#x27;s Versace&amp;#34; when any one asks and I think this might become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! It smells sooo good, and it took no time to get here</li>
            <li> Travel often and this is great to carry.  Fits perfect in my travel bag and I never have to leave the fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> i have the versace bright crystal and versace yellow diamon perfumes and i love them both! someone always asks me what i&#x27;m wearing wherever i am. very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. The spray does I noticed, but not this.</li>
            <li> Changing my review! From a 2 and &amp;#34;It&#x27;s an ok perfume. But not for me. Kind of musky for my taste.&amp;#34; to a 4. I didn&#x27;t really like how it smells when you first put it on but when the smell sets in after a few minutes it smells great. A very nice feminine smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I could find a small, affordable bottle of this EDT before considering a full-size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful, very light and fresh fragrance that is super easy to wear in hot weather. It is definitely not a statement making perfume or a particularly unforgettable one, but it is very inoffensive and just plain clean smelling; it&#x27;s the type of scent I believe everyone should have in their fragrance wardrobe. The citrus (yuzu) stands out on me the most. It&#x27;s perfect for wearing in the office because it is such a light EDT, so it&#x27;s not as strong as an actual perfume. I feel like I need to use more of it since it&#x27;s so light, but I don&#x27;t really mind. Someone called it a glorified body mist, but I have to disagree. Body mist disappears on me within the hour, while this fragrance lingers until the rest of the day, though it is very close to the skin. It&#x27;s perfect for people who are really sensitive to smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely considering getting a bigger bottle of this fragrance for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I gave in and purchased a 3oz bottle of this lovely perfume; it&#x27;s slowly become one of my absolute favorites. I&#x27;d also like to add that this perfume is quite similar to Dior Addict 2 - Addict 2 is the sweeter, fruitier, non-aquatic sister of Versace Bright Crystal. Perhaps you will love both like I do.</li>
            <li> Bought this bc my wife loved the way it smelled. Only wish it was a spray sample. Nice scent though.</li>
            <li> I open it empty! ! Why no stuff inside?</li>
            <li> Wonderful light, delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend tell me, she really love it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sister-in-law and she loves the fragrance.  I found it was priced just right at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this little bottle, lightly scented and great to take with me everywhere. i&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. i recommend it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances in a portable glass bottle. Love it!</li>
            <li> very pretty light fragrance,  doesn&#x27;t last very long tho&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner. The size of the bottle is perfect for travel. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good smelling product although took quite a long time to get.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent.  I smelled it on a friend and was instantly hooked.  Its light, flowery scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  I bought a mini bottle because I&#x27;m still trying to use up other perfumes I have.  Once I have room on the shelf, this one will be my new #1.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  UNLIKE SO MANY MANY FRAGRANCES OUT THERE THAT HAVE AN OVER POWERING SCENT, THIS ONE IS SO SUBTLE AND CAN BE WORN WHEREVER YOU GO.</li>
            <li> This was a really great deal and the bottle is pretty. It would make a fantastic gift. But, I&#x27;m keeping mine because I love the scent. Very subtle and classy, not flowery or sweet.</li>
            <li> it smells okay but the bottle is so small and on the back of the box they scratched off where it says sample not for sale what a rip off</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance. I LOVE it. Only complaint is this bottle was just so tiny!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into light scents, this is a great one.  It has longevity with a light flower smell that isn&#x27;t overly pungent.  I&#x27;m super picky about scents and this one is just great, very feminine without being overly sweet.  Another favorite is D&amp;G Light Blue Toilette Spray (don&#x27;t like the perfume one), so if you like that, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Was intended as a gift, the scent is fine... but the box states SAMPLE NOT FOR RESALE.  If intending to get as a gift keep this in mind that you will not be able to use the box it comes in. Also, if you would like to know an estimated size I am an average sized woman and it is no taller than my pinky and the cap is sizable.</li>
            <li> Love smell but to pricy for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> Not the original. Dont buy this.</li>
            <li> IT IS A FAKE FAKE  FAKE. SMELLS LIKE ALCOHOL- THE BOTTLE IS SO SMALL YOU CAN BARELY HOLD IT.SHOULD BE BARBIE THE DOLL PERFUME</li>
            <li> This gives off a really nice scent.  If you have allergies though beware, its kinda fruity/flowery but I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great service im just not in love with the smell but im not a floral scent person</li>
            <li> Very nice scent.  Not too strong.  Can be used in both winter and summer in my opinion.  The scent stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very small in size but good smell</li>
            <li> Cute size and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than what I expected! I highly recommend this fragance and the size, perfect for travel !!! Smells great</li>
            <li> Smells soapy...has to be mixed with a scented lotion.</li>
            <li> There is no spray top of roller ball....it&#x27;s just an open hole.</li>
