            <li>This relaxes the hair nicely although it&#x27;s best to get a trim after using.  </li>
            <li>Over all it is a good product I would recommend.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and it turned out good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a month and my hair looks good.</li>
            <li>Good procudt.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to try this as the results were surprising!</li>
            <li>I am usually very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>For those of us who have relaxed our own hair for years, the tendency is to feel you know what to do.</li>
            <li>I wanted to play it safe the first time around see which strength would work best for my hair.</li>
            <li>but that is my own fault for not protecting them better.  </li>
            <li>I\\&quot;ve used relaxers for 20 years now and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>and I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I used a blow dryer and a large barrel curling iron for styling and my hair came out great.</li>
            <li>Followed all the directions, and the results were okay.  </li>
            <li>This product is simply the best relaxer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I was not at all pleased.</li>
            <li>but it is way more manageable.  </li>
            <li>there was no damage done to my hair in the process :)</li>
            <li>Ok, but pricey.  </li>
            <li>my hair is growing much more.</li>
            <li>, now i face a lengthy return process and delay in being able to use the product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I just wish it was more affordable</li>
            <li>two months later, the product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturers did a fabulous job!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love the product and will recommend it and use it again and again.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perm.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, curly hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>My hair was extremely dry (after a perm then this, it is the best I could hope for!)</li>
            <li>Great product I used before I went completely natural.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I used non-ammonia hair color a month afterwards and no hair breakage occured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural, doesn&#x27;t burn and have re ordered the product because it worked so successfully.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling healthy not over processed and still leaves my hair with a beautiful manageable curl, yet it is easy to straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Like others reviews read, hair did not get extremely straight which is good because fine and thing hair looks fuller.</li>
            <li>very mild for hairs that tend to break&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and easy to manage</li>
            <li>Too strong of a relaxer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine, curly-frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I beleive throroghly removing the relaxer and shampoo from your hair after application is important (to minimize the chance of breaking, burining, stripping, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted that this product is natural, without damaging chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I go to, but it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>It came out great - not bone straight like a Brazilian treatment but manageable and took out the natural wave.</li>
            <li>My bangs are almost completely straight, but the rest still has a bit of a wave to it (which is fine with me!)</li>
            <li>This has been my absolute favorite relaxer for over 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>it is healthy and straight.  </li>
            <li>but it still seems better if I go ahead and use the whole thing.</li>
            <li>The smell was not bad at all</li>
            <li>This product works perfectly for fine, delicate hair!</li>
            <li>It has been over a year and there has been no breakage; my hair is growing and strong, soft and I love the way it moves.  </li>
            <li>I only believe in writing reviews when a product is outstanding, and this is one of them!</li>
            <li>Index 1 is ideal for short, gentle, sensitive hair I think.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, it is well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>It seems to just have made my natural hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>But this product is a bit different and a careful reading of the instructions will ensure perfect results.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 because i needed to use them right away</li>
            <li>I must admit I didn&#x27;t use it right away but</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first as to whether or not this would be safe to use or even work as I am Caucasian and am also pregnant, but I did the research to make sure it would be okay to use while expecting.  </li>
            <li>This product was very gentle</li>
            <li>Good choice to use the first go round.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest trying the weaker relaxer first before switching over to a stronger one..</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not difficult to do</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and full.</li>
            <li>I believe Index 1 just wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>
            <li>Phytospecific doesn&#x27;t burn or have a strong smell, I get next to no breakage either.</li>
            <li>Plus the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn so i didn&#x27;t het a single perm or better yet relaxer  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care to much for the milk conditioner as it didn&#x27;t seem to really make my hair softer.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing my hair with the milk conditioner, then applied Keratin Conditioner for 5 minutes and it really made a difference (probably any gentle conditioner would do).  </li>
            <li>Not bone straight, but it definately relaxed the frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m biracial with VERY curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this relaxer!</li>
            <li>so I just use the whole thing even if I do not need it..</li>
            <li>and I wanted it straight again</li>
            <li>so I figured after much research, I would give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t get that straight</li>
            <li>They really scare you with all the warnings on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>is really STRAIGHT.  </li>
            <li>It did not get my hair bone straight at the ends, but the edges and roots are straight.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions carefully and have someone available to give you a hand, especially with long hair, so you can be sure to smooth all areas.  </li>
            <li>love what God gave you and don&#x27;t mess with it...</li>
            <li>My hair soft, full and straight without being flat.</li>
            <li>No burning when applied, just straight hair that is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a more natural and less chemical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it it did not smell bad, it was easy directions to follow.  </li>
            <li>Many protein treatments and hot oil treatments later (and a few months)</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic ,gentle and allows my hair to be strong, long and thick</li>
            <li>When I measure half, it seems like my hair is brittle and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>The hair is still very soft, manageable and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I first came to know of this relaxer via the Internet, I studied each review searching for an all natural relaxer I could switch to after having 3 surgeries and being placed on Coumadin and high blood pressure meds for a blood disorder that left my hair in shambles</li>
            <li>Thank you for this natural, no-lye product!</li>
            <li>My only issue is that my hair feels extra rough and tangles a great deal when my hair is wet since I&#x27;ve relaxed it.  </li>
            <li>I had read a lot of other reviews and other users were saying also that the index one did not produce bone straight results which is ok with me.</li>
            <li>and they look natural</li>
            <li>It did not have a chemical smell, it was soft on the hair and it tackled the frizzes.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to go natural.  </li>
            <li>so I get it professionally done, I don&#x27;t recommend anybody doing any chemical process unless its done by a professional in a salon setting</li>
            <li>call me old fashion</li>
            <li>I only have two negatives: it is a bit messy to do it on your own and it left my hair</li>
            <li>Everybody loves my hair and everybody wants to know my secret i gladly tell them what im using.  </li>
            <li>I am a 71 year old afro American woman who finally found the right hair relaxer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the same issue once I dry and style it, but it makes detangling my long hair a bit challenging.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and mixed the entire product.  </li>
            <li>Application and smoothing was easy; there was a little stinging above one ear</li>
            <li>It seems that I get better results when I mix the whole thing as oposed to trying to mix half now and half for a later application.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to women who have fine, thin, hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using Phyto PhytoSpecific PhytoRelaxer Index 1 - Delicate, Fine Hair for a while now..</li>
            <li>After relaxing, my hair is shiny, soft, and not dry (one of the side effects of regular relaxers!) .</li>
            <li>recommend it for fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, thin hair which was virgin when I used this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just applied the Phytorelaxer Index 1.  I have very thick, long, frizzy hair.  Not tight curls, but extremely frizzy and puffy.  Followed all the directions, and the results were okay.  Would try it again for retouches, but will do Index #2.  I believe Index 1 just wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  I wanted to play it safe the first time around see which strength would work best for my hair. It&#x27;s very important to follow the directions (read them twice!!) especially when rinsing the relaxer out.  I basically just stepped in the shower, and rinsed my hair for about 5-10 minutes, as it takes awhile to get the relaxer out.  Next came the shampoo.  I shampooed 3 times.  I beleive throroghly removing the relaxer and shampoo from your hair after application is important (to minimize the chance of breaking, burining, stripping, etc.).  Didn&#x27;t care to much for the milk conditioner as it didn&#x27;t seem to really make my hair softer.  After rinsing my hair with the milk conditioner, then applied Keratin Conditioner for 5 minutes and it really made a difference (probably any gentle conditioner would do).  Blowed dry and flat ironed my hair.  Not bone straight, but it definately relaxed the frizz. If you have thick, long hair (past shoulders) one jar is barely enough, but doable.  Kept relaxer in for about 30 min.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t keep in as long when I use Index 1.  Index 1 is ideal for short, gentle, sensitive hair I think. Good choice to use the first go round.  In any event, will use this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best relaxer I have ever used. No burning when applied, just straight hair that is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Phytospecific saves me a lot of trouble with my hair.  I had stopped using perms in my hair (not a pretty sight) until I tried this product.  It has been over a year and there has been no breakage; my hair is growing and strong, soft and I love the way it moves.  I recommended it to my girlfriend and she likes it as well.  We look great without any of the bother.  Thank you for this natural, no-lye product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial with VERY curly hair.  This has been my absolute favorite relaxer for over 2 years now.  It leaves my hair feeling healthy not over processed and still leaves my hair with a beautiful manageable curl, yet it is easy to straighten with a flat iron.  I highly recommend this relaxer!</li>
            <li> I am usually very satisfied with this product. However, this last order started getting crumbling flakes in it upon application. I&#x27;m not sure if the product you sent me out was outdated or what but I was not at all pleased. I had to rinse it out immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been using Phyto PhytoSpecific PhytoRelaxer Index 1 - Delicate, Fine Hair for a while now.. I thought I needed the Index 2 but it broke my hair.. I would suggest trying the weaker relaxer first before switching over to a stronger one.. Just in case... I have used half and use the other half but it doesn&#x27;t seem to take well when I use half? Like it looses its freshness.. maybe its just me?  so I just use the whole thing even if I do not need it.. I just throw it away.. Over all it is a good product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I just had to leave a review for this product. I was skeptical at first as to whether or not this would be safe to use or even work as I am Caucasian and am also pregnant, but I did the research to make sure it would be okay to use while expecting.  I am so glad that I decided to try this as the results were surprising! I have really thick, curly hair and years ago I had my hair chemically straightened with okay results and horrible odors, but not with this product! The smell was not bad at all and there was plenty of product to do my shoulder length hair. It is not perfectly \\&quot;bone straight\\&quot; after use but it is way more manageable.  My bangs are almost completely straight, but the rest still has a bit of a wave to it (which is fine with me!) Anyway, just wanted to let others know that it worked for me and there was no damage done to my hair in the process :)</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for fine, delicate hair! It&#x27;s very natural, doesn&#x27;t burn and have re ordered the product because it worked so successfully. .It may be more expensive than a lot of other relaxers, they don&#x27;t sell it in any of the beauty supply stores I go to, but it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVE THE WRONG HAIR RELAXER. THEY DID NOT SEND ME THE WHITE BOX WITH THE GOLD LEAF ON FRONT AND BACK OF THE BOX... PHYTOSPECIFIC FOR CURLY,FRIZZY AND RELAXED HAIR  PHYTORLAXER WITH EGG AND SOY ACTIVE EXTRACTS.INDEX 1....THEY SENT ME PHYTOSPECIFIC...PARIS INDEX 1....FOR CURLY COILED AND RELAXED HAIR THIS WAS A BROWN BOX...NOT THE SAME AS I RECEIVED BEFORE....THIS LEFT MY HAIR VERY DRY</li>
            <li> Great product I used before I went completely natural. Still gave the illusion as if you needed a stronger relaxer, thats until heat was applied.</li>
            <li> Ok, but pricey.  There are other relaxers out there that are just as good - if not better - that are not as expensive.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today. I have short, fine, thin hair which was virgin when I used this product. I had my hairdresser do it for me and she did a wonderful job. It did not burn, or break off my hair  (no lye in this product). I am a 71 year old afro American woman who finally found the right hair relaxer. Too bad I never heard of this product in all my years of relaxing my hair. My hair looks beautiful! I highly recommend this product to women who have fine, thin, hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> Got a perm 6 plus months ago.  Not a good choice.  I have long hair and I wanted it straight again so I figured after much research, I would give this a shot.  I hated the perm anyway so if this fried my hair, I would just cut it off and start over...so, nothing to lose.  This would have been a lot easier if I had someone helping me.  I followed the instructions and it turned out good.  My hair was extremely dry (after a perm then this, it is the best I could hope for!) But it did not fall out so that was a plus. I did have to get about an inch cut off after to help it though.  Many protein treatments and hot oil treatments later (and a few months) it is healthy and straight.  I learned my lesson the hard way... love what God gave you and don&#x27;t mess with it... It NEVER turns out like you hope it will.  This stuff did burn my ear and my neck a little but that is my own fault for not protecting them better.  I did do a few oil treatments before and after this product and that seemed to help keep it healthier.  But it did straighten my hair and that is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t get that straight but I wasn&#x27;t worried about that.  I didn&#x27;t want my hair to fall out after putting in my hair.  And it worked out my hair is growing and it is manageable</li>
            <li> Wonderful product loved how it made my hair feel...this is the second time using product and I can see great results my hair is growing much more. I would recommend this product to anyone, it is well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using this today and wanted to do a review. They really scare you with all the warnings on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not difficult to do and I have very fine hair and it didn&#x27;t harm it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited 3 days after my last shampoo and used 1/2 of everything since my hair is above the chin. It came out great - not bone straight like a Brazilian treatment but manageable and took out the natural wave. I still have volume when I blow it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for fine, thin hair. I applied it for 7 minutes and smoothed it for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! very mild for hairs that tend to break&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product. It makes your hair very fluffy&lt;br /&gt;and easy to manage and they look natural</li>
            <li> Like others reviews read, hair did not get extremely straight which is good because fine and thing hair looks fuller.</li>
            <li> buy two goods, one of them is damaged from the inside and not fit for use, and the other slightly damaged and can be used&lt;br /&gt;I hope the next time to improve these products because it could be us deal in the future regarding this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your thank,</li>
            <li> Seller is misleading.  the product does not match the one advertised in the photo. this is not the phytospecific with soy extracts.  so disappointed. I bought 2 because i needed to use them right away, now i face a lengthy return process and delay in being able to use the product.</li>
            <li> My hair become dry and stiffer than before .I followed the instruction but It didn&#x27;t relax even a bit !! worthless product</li>
            <li> I had not chemical in my hair for 3 years and I used this and my hair fell out like it was leaves falling of a tree. I had about 6 inch of hair on my head not it is about 1/2 inch and  am not pleased. there is not number to call to get my money back.[[ASIN:B000O7JNC0 PhytoSpecific Phyto Relaxer Index 2]]</li>
            <li> I loved it it did not smell bad, it was easy directions to follow.  It&#x27;s a month and my hair looks good.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a relaxer. Shampoo and conditioner not for my hair.</li>
            <li> I would never use another relaxer.  This is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this relaxer because it leaves my hair soft with volume and my relax hair last longer than when I was using other brands of relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;Recomended for thin, delicate hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent organic-based relaxer.  Gentle and effective on coarse hair.  The package arrived in a timely manner in great condition. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel so fluffy and soft, like cotton. I love it I just wish it was more affordable so i could use it moe often. Plus the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn so i didn&#x27;t het a single perm or better yet relaxer  burn is great!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly hair that breaks easily.  I don&#x27;t mind curls, but I hate frizzes.  So I did my research before purchasing.  I was nervous about ruining my hair or worst.  I followed the instructions exactly and mixed the entire product.  I am happy to say two months later, the product is wonderful.  It did not have a chemical smell, it was soft on the hair and it tackled the frizzes.  Most importantly, I used non-ammonia hair color a month afterwards and no hair breakage occured. The hair is still very soft, manageable and shiny.  It also takes me a lot less time to blow dry the hair.  I only have two negatives: it is a bit messy to do it on your own and it left my hair is really STRAIGHT.  Other than that, I recommend it for those with very delicate hair who do not want to go to the extreme with keratin hair straightening.</li>
            <li> The best!  The strength and beauty of my hair has improved.  I&#x27;m delighted that this product is natural, without damaging chemicals.  The manufacturers did a fabulous job!</li>
            <li> Loved this product; best relaxer I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine, curly-frizzy hair.  Follow instructions carefully and have someone available to give you a hand, especially with long hair, so you can be sure to smooth all areas.  My only issue is that my hair feels extra rough and tangles a great deal when my hair is wet since I&#x27;ve relaxed it.  I don&#x27;t have the same issue once I dry and style it, but it makes detangling my long hair a bit challenging.  Otherwise, I love the product and will recommend it and use it again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this relaxer for 2years now and I love it. I\\&quot;ve used relaxers for 20 years now and this one by far is the best. I&#x27;ve been trained in cosmetology I know how to care for hair.  I first came to know of this relaxer via the Internet, I studied each review searching for an all natural relaxer I could switch to after having 3 surgeries and being placed on Coumadin and high blood pressure meds for a blood disorder that left my hair in shambles so I decided to go natural.  About 4 months in I decided it wasn&#x27;t for me and I ordered the phytospecific I must admit I didn&#x27;t use it right away but about 2 months later I did and I&#x27;ve never looked back. ALL other relaxers react with the medication except for the phytospecific. That has made a believer out of me that this relaxer is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I buy it and take it to my beautician so I get it professionally done, I don&#x27;t recommend anybody doing any chemical process unless its done by a professional in a salon setting call me old fashion but I do not believe kitchen beauticians should do chemical processes. Phytospecific doesn&#x27;t burn or have a strong smell, I get next to no breakage either. And I only use it 3 times a year. I love it. Everybody loves my hair and everybody wants to know my secret i gladly tell them what im using.  I heard from a guy on my job that Oprah endorsed this product on her show and said she uses the phytospecific and some of the other products by Phyto...I hope this review helps</li>
            <li> Good procudt. It seems that I get better results when I mix the whole thing as oposed to trying to mix half now and half for a later application. I am measuring to the tee but it still seems better if I go ahead and use the whole thing. When I measure half, it seems like my hair is brittle and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the index one back in November and I a just applied today. My last relaxer was almost five years ago. The results are perfect! It did not get my hair bone straight at the ends, but the edges and roots are straight. I had read a lot of other reviews and other users were saying also that the index one did not produce bone straight results which is ok with me. It seems to just have made my natural hair more manageable. I used a blow dryer and a large barrel curling iron for styling and my hair came out great. Application and smoothing was easy; there was a little stinging above one ear but I had probably been scratching a little. I had to wash five times before I didn&#x27;t see any pink. This product was very gentle but it did what it was supposed to do.  I was a little worried because I have a sensitive scalp and haven&#x27;t had much luck with relaxers in the past even with a professional applying. It is worth the money and I will continue to purchase in the future as I have never had results like this in the past.</li>
            <li> I only believe in writing reviews when a product is outstanding, and this is one of them! After relaxing, my hair is shiny, soft, and not dry (one of the side effects of regular relaxers!) . I have been relaxing my hair/and having it relaxed for 40 years and it has never, ever felt like this! I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a more natural and less chemical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution is to ensure to read and reread the instructions. For those of us who have relaxed our own hair for years, the tendency is to feel you know what to do. But this product is a bit different and a careful reading of the instructions will ensure perfect results.</li>
            <li> I will never use a traditional lye or no lye relaxer again. this product is fantastic ,gentle and allows my hair to be strong, long and thick</li>
            <li> I love this perm. My hair soft, full and straight without being flat. I had no scalp irritation and hardly any shedding. I took it to my regular hairdresser and let her put it on instead of trying to do it myself. My hair is soft, shiny and full. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have thin, very curly &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair.  This relaxes the hair nicely although it&#x27;s best to get a trim after using.  My curls started coming back after 4 months and took over a year to grow out entirely.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to do it yourself for someone with hair shoulder length or longer so I would advise having a friend help.</li>
