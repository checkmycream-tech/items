            <li>The temperature control is great.</li>
            <li>but it works great</li>
            <li>The Remington curling wand is a great curling wand once you get used to its difference from curling iron.  </li>

            <li>so I bought one immediately and have been nothing but happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>

            <li>Still getting used to the way it works but the varying temperature control and shape make my hair look great when I curl it.  </li>
            <li>the result is great.</li>
            <li>I wanted an affordable and great curling wand for the beach waves look.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>but this had great reviews.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T, lol.  </li>
            <li>This is a great wand if you are looking for the tapered barrel, though.</li>
            <li>Curls hold up great</li>
            <li>Great product, I recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased after reading great reviews.</li>
            <li>The product has an automatic shutoff feature after 30 minutes (which is great)</li>
            <li>It makes perfect beachy waves and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use the glove!!</li>
            <li>I love how my beachy waves turn out using this curling iron!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>I love mine!!</li>

            <li>Love this wand!!</li>
            <li>This is partly why my curls did not come out very nice, but also they did not stay curled.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering my very own curling wand soon.</li>
            <li>The glove is very handy, and you save a lot of money having them packaged together.</li>
            <li>And my curls still didn&#x27;t stay with this product either, although the curls were very nice looking.  </li>
            <li>The perfect curling tool for someone with fine, wavy hair!</li>

            <li>and I can get nice curls all over in under 20!</li>
            <li>if I had any successful result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is more than one way to get the effect, though, and I don&#x27;t think this is the best way.  </li>
            <li>i wish they would explain more as to what temperature works best for this type of curl and etc.</li>
            <li>not the best, but works okay</li>
            <li>If they solved that and included a better quality glove, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Good curling wand for the a great price.</li>
            <li>Fair price and great quality.</li>
            <li>I have bought this curling wand for gifts as well, since it worked so great on my hair, and the receivers loved it as well.</li>
            <li>The size of the barrel is great and the fact that you can  turn the thing on and off without having to unplug it are  good too.  </li>
            <li>Makes the best curls I&#x27;ve ever been able to make in my hair</li>
            <li>good product with great price ...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes great wonderful curls.</li>
            <li>Nice price, good product!</li>
            <li>This tool is easy to use and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, curls superbly and eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>If you saw videos on YouTube about this product and see how wonderful curls the girls get, remember is not that easy, you have to practice a lot with this.</li>
            <li>Great, I love it!</li>
            <li>I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; , very easy to use &amp; the curls are fabulousness ( and no kink at the end from the clamp!)  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li>If youre the kind of girl who can curl her hair, then I&#x27;m sure this is the best thing in the world.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The skinnier wand gives you undoubtedly gorgeous think Taylor Swift like curls.</li>
            <li>as described good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, this is a good quality curling wand.</li>
            <li>I loved the results, then did some research and found the wider barrel.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I loved the way it makes my hair and will use this when I want that darling bounce that the Pearl Wand gives me.</li>
            <li>This makes gorgeous waves that HOLD.  </li>
            <li>gave it three stars because the iron itself is good quality.</li>
            <li>It just requires us to hold the on button for a good 20 seconds or so before it will start.</li>
            <li>It works so good.</li>
            <li>This product had good reviews</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It works well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say I loved it</li>
            <li>but it curls good</li>
            <li>a good buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wond.</li>
            <li>The recipient loved it.</li>
            <li>I got it from reading how good the reviews are .</li>
            <li>But if you are happy with clamp-style irons, I see no reason to switch to this kind.</li>
            <li>good value; comes with a glove to prevent burning  ones fingers</li>
            <li>my friend had this curler, I absolutely loved it  and used it every time I was at her place.</li>
            <li>Good price for this product.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job</li>
            <li>Just as good as the $200 ones you see in the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>This looks like it would be a good product.</li>
            <li>But the product is still a good deal.</li>
            <li>good product good quality care recommended</li>
            <li>I Would recommend, good buy for the money</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and my sister loved it.  </li>
            <li>But would never return it because of how good my hair looks.</li>
            <li>so what i do is use a product that is heat protecter and smells good as well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good affordable wand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some items that I feel are good and spared this review a 1 star.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is, you don&#x27;t end up with a crimp in your hair from clipping it on the barrel.</li>
            <li>, glove is good too.</li>
            <li>Appears to achieve all that she needs it too and the results look good.</li>
            <li>Also good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>This curling wand seemed good quality and did the job, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good curls.</li>
            <li>it comes in handy, the glove is great</li>
            <li>surprisingly it worked wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>hope this help someone save some $$. &amp; choose a good product..</li>
            <li>~someone save some $$. &amp; choose a good product..</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in love !! :)</li>

            <li>Great wand, easy to use</li>
            <li>Works great, heats up nicely, easy to use, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Great tool easy to use</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t easy to curl but this works great.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is an amazing tool at an even more amazing price!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s great and its fairly easy to use, plus you can control the heat temperature.  </li>
            <li>: This is a great product that makes it easy to curl your hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets HOT!!!!</li>
            <li>note - it is very light, so good for travel.</li>

            <li>This works amazingly well and does not damage my hair, but I haven&#x27;t had a brand name curling iron like Chi or NuMe</li>
            <li>The wand works amazing.</li>
            <li>The 1\\&quot; works amazing too.</li>
            <li>It turns out really nice.    </li>
            <li>It takes longer to heat up compared to some curling irons I own.</li>
            <li>All of mine came with gloves, which I never use because you need to be able to have a good hold on your hair to get the look you want.</li>
            <li>I watched a couple video tutorials before using it, and it really does work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The glove is nice while you are getting used to the wand.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful make the hairline in a very magnificence ..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get burned, per se, but way to warm for comfort.</li>
            <li>It heats very well and gives great curls!</li>
            <li>Gives nice curls.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gives me beautiful curls!!!</li>
            <li>and you will be thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>What kind of wizard do you have to be to use this thing?  </li>
            <li>The included heat protectant glove is nice if you&#x27;re worried about burning your fingers, which I was.</li>
            <li>I bought this curler because I had used a friend&#x27;s wand and wanted one of my own.</li>
            <li>I honestly find it easier to not use the glove...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice that it has an automatic timed turn off</li>
            <li>and I did my own hair.</li>
            <li>Wish I could just skip the star rating on this one because I feel like it gets a 1 star in terms of how effective I am at using it, but would probably get 4-5 stars if I were more talented.  </li>
            <li>I have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, but when my sister used this on my hair, the curls stayed in beautifully for hours!</li>
            <li>The ceramic coating is really nice as well.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- nice surface, not sticking</li>
            <li>The glove is also handy.</li>
            <li>The curls come out nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand what everybody is complaining about, though everyone has their own opinions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives you nice glossy bouncy curls without having to use a ton of products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to come so fast, I was very happy about that.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>nice isn&#x27;t the reason I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I never knew that I could do my own hair this way.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for those that like to do their own hair.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I JUST GOT MY OWN ONE BEFORE THREE DAYS</li>
            <li>All in all, a nice tool.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES NICE CURLS.</li>
            <li>it comes with a nice glove as well.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my every dasy go-to curling wand, but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>my hair does look nice after and ppl compliment my toussled look but achieving the look is not effortless.  </li>
            <li>Her hair hold curl better than mine, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me, but I was so happy when it did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the heat resistant glove as it allows me to focus on getting the curls to look great instead of worrying if I&#x27;m about to burn my fingers!</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;m sure an experienced hair stylist will be able to use it effortlessly.</li>
            <li>the design is nice and sleek looking, but I&#x27;d have bought a straightener for the results I got.</li>
            <li>do a spectacular curly...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li>is just perfect and recommend for others to purchase very affordable</li>
            <li>It does give me nicely sized curls</li>
            <li>I can now get nice curls always when using this.  </li>
            <li>Also shuts off automatically which is nice</li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to holding it the correct way to get your hair curled, but the result is nice.</li>

            <li>Love this wand.  </li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This wand worked a lot better than the nume.</li>
            <li>This clipless curling iron works way better than it should at that price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up on Amazon purchasing it :)  </li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this</li>
            <li>This seemed an ok quality.</li>
            <li>but it ends up making my hair more frizzy.</li>

            <li>I love this wand...</li>

            <li>love it</li>
            <li>so watch your ears :)</li>
            <li>You have to use one hand to wrap the hair around the barrel, so your ends won&#x27;t be touching it and getting damaged.</li>
            <li>My Con air wand is a lot better than this one.</li>
            <li>I need to practice more</li>
            <li>Most curling irons I have to hold for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was more heat resistant.</li>
            <li>With most curlers you get one that keeps the metal</li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>I love this wand.</li>
            <li>I love that it has an automatic timer in case you leave it on by mistake.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this curling wand</li>
            <li>but i have to because i love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it curls ok.</li>
            <li>The material of the handle is OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better before</li>
            <li>then i tried my housemate&#x27;s curling wand and FELL IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>its better than my $50 nume hair wand.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I truly love using this wand.</li>
            <li>But when it is deployed post-blow out, it does create lovely beachy waves.</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t know well how to do it , I keep trying on my hair and every time I do , it looks better :)</li>
            <li>But I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>Just like the box says it is more of a salon iron curler</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how perfect this wand is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a go.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with having both because I have two daughters</li>
            <li>After watching a couple tutorials I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll prefect the technique</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was able to wrap around the barrel</li>
            <li>This wand works great but really takes a lot of practice to get the curls the way you want them.  </li>
            <li>Love this curler others would no heat like it.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I had longer hair it would have been better.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself shortly after I saw how wonderful this curling wand was</li>
            <li>and (okay here is where I start sounding like an infomercial)</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of a clipless curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>I also love the temperature range on it.</li>
            <li>The big barrel is perfect.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Much better than many brand names.</li>
            <li>This is a great iron at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My sister and I absolutely love this Curling Wand.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more from this brand.</li>
            <li>found that compared to the Jose Eber irons, this one also produced better, longer-lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after doing so many research on curling wand, i decided to get this one.</li>
            <li>I tend to heat the wand, put on some makeup, curl some hair, put on more makeup, curl some more, get dresses, curl some more, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the thing.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this I read tons of reviews and watched many video tutorials online.  </li>
            <li>a wand definitely is better than using that approach).</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter love this - she got it for her 15th b-day.</li>
            <li>I Love ittttttttttttttttttttttt, but I want to buy more than 3</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have seen and used so many brands and for about under $25 you can not beat it.  </li>
            <li>:) I also recommend getting the 1-1 1/2 inch if you have longer hair and the 1/2-1 inch if you have shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li>so the skinny end was at the top</li>
            <li>but then my hair just slid up to the top.</li>
            <li>so I can do waves more often.</li>
            <li>But I will have to keep working with it to find more consistency in waves and hopefully get faster with it.</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>but this thing is so simple and awesome!</li>
            <li>Glad they included the glove.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>But I find that the hotter it is, the more defined the curls,</li>
            <li>Most of the time it looks so messed up</li>
            <li>I have many of them but for some reason this just isn&#x27;t a look for me .</li>
            <li>For me, that adds even more frustration to an already maddening situation.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my hair a lot more often now.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Bottom line - it worked great for me, not so much for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift and they love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Thank you a lot :)</li>
            <li>I love what this does for my hair.</li>
            <li>But love the product itself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the heat-resistant glove that it comes with is so crappy and cheap!</li>
            <li>The gradient spiral effect is interesting in theory -  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments when I curl my hair with this wand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this size</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS WAND</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE THIS IRON AND PRICE.</li>
            <li>Such a good wand!!</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>Best wand for big bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>Got here two days after purchased and fell in love after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to always wear the glove that comes with the curling iron.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m not so sure in which direction i&#x27;m supposed to curl my hair...</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this curling wand; there&#x27;s no need to pay a ton of money for fancy wands when this one does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li>But for me, it was just okay.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a splendid product!</li>
            <li>The more hair you curl at a time, the looser your curls, so you can do tighter or looser ones depending on the look</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to being able to watch TV or whatever with curling/straight irons.</li>
            <li>My favorite ones came from monicasocal on Youtube; her video is named \\&quot;Beachy curls/waves using Remington curling wand\\</li>
            <li>If you exclude this factor it does the job perfectly and takes only minutes to heat up.</li>
            <li>curled better than anything i have used.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I now know that I&#x27;m better off with a barrel that is all one width.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been able to hold curl.  </li>
            <li>This is my go-to styling wand, and I get so many compliments on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My ceramic straightner does better curls than this thing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have only tried this once, as I have been straightening my hair, but it was great!</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this</li>
            <li>so many styles of waves/</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand</li>
            <li>I love the curls it produces, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Love this curing iron.</li>
            <li>Either that or I need to look into how to better use this curler.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>the 1in is so much better</li>
            <li>more like waves and I like that.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, but</li>
            <li>this is what u get OK ,  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this curling wand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Maybe someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li>This is more of a wave...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed and ended up buying a smaller one.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, and i now love my hair even more</li>
            <li>great, high heat holds the curls!</li>
            <li>Her hair looks adorable :)</li>
            <li>She gets just the curls she loves and uses it most every day</li>
            <li>I think that if they have a smaller barrel version, you&#x27;d be very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Light weight is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary</li>
            <li>to many of the reviews, my curls do NOT stay overnight</li>
            <li>I twist my hair and clip it on top of my head</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok to accidentally press buttons while you hold the wand&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand, it curls my hair the way I like</li>
            <li>but I think it turned out pretty nice!</li>
            <li>Overall awesome product :)</li>
            <li>so love love the way the curls stay the wand</li>
            <li>and I fell completely in love with it</li>
            <li>work well for someone who has more time and easier hair to style</li>
            <li>just got mine today and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>Love my curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought sure that there must be some technique</li>
            <li>Really Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>My best friend had this in a smaller size.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and people ask me what I used to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I probably should have gotten the smaller size, but this one works great too!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this wand and have recommended it to a lot of friends.</li>
            <li>but I cried more when they were all out of stock.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>nothing held my curls together, but something about this did the magic.</li>
            <li>so make sure you wear the glove that comes included.</li>
            <li>you get better at it.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>It does come with a glove but it ends up causing static when I used it.</li>
            <li>But it does make big beautiful curls when you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this &amp; wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if I didn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>so I can tousle them but still have them stay more intact.</li>
            <li>My hair is still shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I definitely love Remington products.  </li>
            <li>No complaints :)</li>
            <li>I love this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>i love it and</li>
            <li>I have tons of burn marks now, so make sure to buy a longer heat-resistant glove (and use it)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I LOVE the curler -- it makes my hair look better than it ever has before.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this wand - got it quickly from Best Rx.</li>
            <li>It was a good idea to be able to lock the buttons because they are right when your hand grips.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use and great addition to any woman&#x27;s hot tool collection.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy way to get beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>The shipping is very fast and very good service Absolutely recommend it to all !!</li>
            <li>The lower temperatures are just right, though.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li>in all, this wand is a great deal and perfect for someone looking for decent quality at a low price.</li>
            <li>for the price, it really doesn&#x27;t get better than this!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>but my hair comes out flawless soft kink-free and beautiful everytime - if I use hair spray the curls will last the days.</li>
            <li>kind of fun!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>she was so happy and excited and started making curls right away.</li>
            <li>Works great, heats up very fast, handle is comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>Insta Wave which has pretty much has no learning curve and got perfect waves in about seven minutes.</li>
            <li>but once I had experience, I got great curls and was able to do my whole head very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and enjoy the structure of the curler.</li>
            <li>The glove doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job of being heat resistant and despite the high quality of the wand, I still have to hold my hair there for about 40 seconds for it to make any difference at all.</li>
            <li>I am kind of new to curlers so it might just be me not know how to use it correctly for a good curl.</li>
            <li>The curling wand perfectly suits my needs, leaving me with quickly flipped and completely dentless</li>
            <li>but I had a full head of curls in under 30min which is amazing</li>
            <li>If I want to have a nice full curl on my bang</li>
            <li>It gave me nice curls in 30 minutes to do my full head.</li>
            <li>and I think it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a pretty good wand.</li>
            <li>I think this would work best on long hair though.</li>
            <li>Frankly, her hair looks beautiful whatever you do to it, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised it turned out well with this device.</li>
            <li>and this one was pretty well reviewed and for a good price.</li>
            <li>Also, Bethany Mota, a youtuber beauty guru who&#x27;s so sweet, has 7 million subscribers her own perfume, clothing line, bedroom line and will be appearing on dancing with the stars (or so I heard) has recommend this wand over and over.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a good wand that gives you loose beach waves and a great price</li>
            <li>this is a very good curling wand it heats up fast and gives big bouncy curls love it ! !</li>
            <li>this is a must buy, worth every cent!!</li>
            <li>I am so excited!</li>
            <li>Friends have complimented my &amp;#34; new hair cut&amp;#34;  and noticed my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s takes a minute to get the hang of it, but it produces quick curls that look amazing.  </li>
            <li>I Love this it heats up very quickly</li>
            <li>and I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>This product is well made, heats quickly and makes nice waves.  </li>
            <li>My roommate borrowed mine and liked it so much that she got her own.</li>
            <li>Good price, great product, pink</li>
            <li>But as experienced as I am in doing my own hair for years with a wand, I still inevitably burn myself every once in a while...</li>
            <li>I used it, it made nice soft wavy curls and and the curls stayed really good for 2 hours without any spray</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS SO AWESOME FOR LOOSE CURLS.....</li>
            <li>It gave me perfect bouncy loose curls in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>the very cheap and light weight glove does not protect your hand from burns.</li>
            <li>Now, I am no hair styling expert, in fact I am very far from it, but my hair looked PERFECT the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium length, and fine, and gave me a cute easy-curl bob.</li>
            <li>i did it a couple of times with the glove and within 20 minutes i was able to wrap it fine without the glove on</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and am able to get the results I want on a lower heat setting than the max.</li>
            <li>and im sure its fine.</li>
            <li>Love it, and it&#x27;s super easy to use!</li>
            <li>This beautiful wand gives my hair those really amazing loose curls.  </li>
            <li>Usually my hair is very good at taking a curl, and this did a good job of putting in a curl, but heck</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the glove because it gets very hot!</li>
            <li>But make sure to adjust your  heat settings as the wand can get very hot and damage your hair!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for making loose curls or beach waves!</li>
            <li>the curls are nice and full and they lasted all night on my super fine hair!</li>
            <li>Price is cheap but could be better in quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to the old curling iron I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>It can make my hair look great with soft curls.</li>
            <li>Great product for some natural looking waves.</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair as well as my 4 year old twin girls.</li>
            <li>i was surprised and extremely happy.</li>
            <li>These are great for natural, beachy waves for your hair.</li>
            <li>Rounded edges might have been a better design idea or anything that would make a smooth transition instead of having something your hair can catch on.</li>
            <li>This is the best fourteen dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>Im surprised at the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Love it and enjoy using it to style hair.</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful curls this does without the &#x27;line&#x27; that a standard curling iron can have.</li>
            <li>There is also a temperature control so you can decide how much heat is good for your hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the 1-1.5 inches one as a gift for my friend because she loved mines so much.</li>
            <li>Look wise, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and gets heated quickly.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to learn how to use just by watching a quick YouTube video.</li>
            <li>it heats up super fast, and the swivel cord is a great feature to keep it from getting tangled while you curl.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, and it is curly but the hair curler makes my hair have super nice waves you know like those beach waves that are super cute?</li>
            <li>so this barrel size works great to get nice loose curls in my hair and the tapered barrel</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such a good product for this price!</li>
            <li>This wand is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>I almost bought the conair wand, but I heard the Remington was better and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I put on the glove and started experimenting and picked up on how to use it very quickly.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly and looked like new.i</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use the glove anymore because it is just so easy to do</li>
            <li>Giving it 4 stars because have not perfected how to use this yet, not as easy as I thought so I&#x27;m hoping with practice, it will be easier &amp; curls will come out nicer...</li>
            <li>sometimes when you forget to wear the glove/bring the glove when you are traveling it burns your finger easily..</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>This particular iron heats up quickly and produces any size wave you need, which is great for shorter strands of hair, bangs or just a variety of hairstyles.</li>
            <li>The barrel heats well and delivers a marvelous curl once one gets the hang of it, but it seems a bit of talent with a regular curling iron would be just as useful.</li>
            <li>But you should mind the heat because you will get burned easily too.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The wand heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It heats up VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use -</li>
            <li>So, in short, this curling wand is great, but it takes a lot of practice to learn how to use it on yourself and works a lot better if you have someone else curl your hair with it.</li>
            <li>its easy to use</li>
            <li>I love this wand, it is great that it comes with a glove, however I don&#x27;t use the glove.&lt;br /&gt;The only things that I do not like about this wand are that where the buttons are I tend to press them with my thumb when I am curling.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is easy to use..  </li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t pick it up and think it&#x27;s going to be easy.  </li>
            <li>Once you practice getting used to using the wand, it gets really easy.</li>
            <li>but then it was easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, watch a youtube tutorial before using it.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and take no time at all to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Makes it very quick and easy to do your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and your curls stay in all day.</li>
            <li>The tapered end at the bottom lets you have tighter, bouncier curls at the bottom and allows you to easily make a curly beach look by brushing them through with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Very Quick shipment .</li>
            <li>I am a first-time hair curler buyer/user and this thing is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wish all these hair appliance product print voltage use or non/dual voltage or worldwide voltage on the package so customer will find out easily</li>
            <li>easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I would easily fork over $150.00.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t burn my self as easily</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy styling</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of using a wand, it is very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Using this curling iron is not as easy as you think.</li>
            <li>Easy to do yet</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>At this point, this takes me longer than the flat iron to create waves, but when I get a good wave, I love the shape of it!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 1 year already and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets very hot which I love, I just haven&#x27;t been able to learn how to do more than one style of curl</li>
            <li>And for best looking results, use left hand to curl right side of head, pointing narrowest part towards shoulder of ground and wrap hair in direction away from face.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get the right size option to fit your needs!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes beautiful big waves.</li>
            <li>This is best for super long hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly, and it&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li>This tool provides nice waves for my very straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried others and after about two hours my hair would lose its clues - NOT WITH THIS iron which actually keeps my hair with beautiful curly waves for three day.</li>
            <li>I have used this product several times, always hoping it will get easier to use and always hoping my curls will miraculously turn out beautiful this time.</li>
            <li>Curls beautifully nice beach wave curls, I bought this wand and a higher end wand by NUME</li>
            <li>you want to add even more impact, use dickbill clips to set the curls while they cool.  </li>
            <li>The larger wand creates beautiful waves and creates volume.</li>
            <li>But overall who cares, this wand leaves me with beautiful long-lasting waves.</li>
            <li>The glove is a nice touch to protect your hands from being burned while handling hot hair</li>
            <li>It produces the most attractive and natural looking curl i have found, is super easy once you get the hang of it and is easy to maneuver quickly when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>but with practice you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Fine</li>
            <li>Curls / waves my fine,</li>
            <li>Either my hair is too fine and just can&#x27;t stay on the barrel</li>
            <li>After a year and a half, still works great!</li>
            <li>The iron great up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I never try yet but soon and hope it works fine</li>
            <li>I tried this wand abroad with 220 V and worked just fine</li>
            <li>pretty much followed those directions, and yes, it turned out great.</li>
            <li>There were no frills with packaging, which was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>* Hairspraying after each half section works best for holding my hair</li>
            <li>The included glove is fine, you wouldn&#x27;t want to hold the barrel with your hand, but you can use a couple fingers to hold hair in place if needed.</li>
            <li>curling wand that doesn&#x27;t work as well or as as quickly as this one!</li>
            <li>This thing heats up so quickly!</li>
            <li>Works quickly!</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased with this,</li>
            <li>Order came quickly!</li>
            <li>if you buy this particular wand, understand that it is more slippery, I noticed that this wand does make my hair shine more and look more smooth and</li>
            <li>Omg, good bye old curling irons!</li>
            <li>The reason why I ever bought this specific one in the first place is because of all the good things I heard about it on a list of good curling irons; I do not understand how this could even be considered for that list.</li>
            <li>However, once you get the hang of using the wand, you don&#x27;t really need it to fend off the &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; moments of touching the wand!</li>
            <li>Very pretty waves. :)</li>
            <li>Works really well and its cute!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and makes great soft curls.</li>
            <li>Great curling wand that comes with a glove for those of us who are using a wand for the first time and getting used to the new technique!</li>
            <li>swivel cord is pretty junky looking, and gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>This tool can get VERY HOT!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair using this- even after my first time!</li>
            <li>I like the adjustable temperature it gets very hot!</li>
            <li>But, with a little practice, this one is perfect!!</li>
            <li>It just takes a little practice and patience, but once you get the hang of it, it gives great results!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use the included glove because it does get VERY hot!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot so wear the glove!</li>
            <li>The handling took a little getting used to but worked great!</li>
            <li>it definitely gives even my fine straight hair beautiful \\&quot;Kardashian-like\\&quot; waves!</li>
            <li>With a not so great iron or no hairspray, my hair can easily fall from voluminous curls to completely flat.</li>
            <li>Can make tight-ish curls or lose huge waves if I shake them out</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars is because if your hair is clean and smooth it tends to slide off the iron easily.</li>
            <li>It really does heat up fast and gives me great waves.</li>
            <li>In the process, I got a huge burn on my ear.  </li>
            <li>I need to by a huge convertor that cost twice the price of this wond</li>
            <li>Maybe a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; would be great in the package for different styles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and leaves your curls silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but well worth the effort :)</li>
            <li>you are a beginner to curling wands, don&#x27;t be discouraged, they are fantastic, but start with a one size barrel to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ceramic just glides your hair through and gives it a shiny smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Smooth curls</li>
            <li>Regular curling irons aren&#x27;t great for this purpose because the hair holding clamp leaves a visible dent where it contacts my hair.</li>
            <li>It almost doesn&#x27;t hurt hair and has fabulous effect.</li>
            <li>If u use a light hairspray the curls will hold longer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put any product in while using it but sprayed a light hairspray on when I was done.</li>
            <li>This helped me get a lot of volume at the roots, precisely what I bought this for.  </li>
            <li>This wand and the others in the line, work fantastic.</li>
            <li>i use it everyday, creates awesome waves.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to see some cheap features..</li>
            <li>She said it works great and opted for the larger size wand for ease of use.</li>
            <li>Great for longer hair and bigger waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the iron and will use it often.</li>
            <li>I am now the proud owner of a smaller rod, as well.</li>
            <li>This ridge catches on my hair so it doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly off the end.</li>
            <li>It works great, curls last all day.</li>
            <li>After asking my cousin what she does to her hair that it looks perfect everyday, she pointed me towards these wands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>Cheap quality</li>
            <li>Thank you SOOOOOOOOOO much Remington for creating this amazing tool that has literally replaced EVERY hair tool i have ever owned including my $100 baby bliss curling iron and $200 or so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the tool, but I need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li>Overall the wand works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap glove you would buy for your kid at a flea market.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and makes nice beach curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I finally managed to get that wavy great looking all by myself, it takes couple of times until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>My curls look WAY better and more natural with the wand, and I feel like my curls hold up better as well.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the price, size (I bought the bigger one), and look.</li>
            <li>When I opened it it felt light and almost cheap</li>
            <li>its amazing how much difference 1/4&amp;#34; makes.</li>
            <li>I bought the 1-1 1/2&amp;#34; size and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>My curls always come out looking fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think this wand is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did like the smooth \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; barrel, but that was about it.</li>
            <li>Take an hour or two practicing, figure out what feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>After curling my hair with this iron I had smooth curls that stayed in even after sleeping.</li>
            <li>This wand is worth way more than the advertised price.</li>
            <li>Curls turn out smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Great product overall!</li>
            <li>Great quality for low price</li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product - especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the included glove much, but it&#x27;s nice to have in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, and makes nice beach curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a curling wand with a wider barrel for ages, this one had fantastic reviews</li>
            <li>I was never a fan of the clamp curling irons, so the wand definitely fit what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product and would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>We loved the fact that you can get all different size curls, and both me and my daughter really love this feature.</li>
            <li>but my straight Asian hair holds curls best with this wand vs curling iron.</li>
            <li>Good product, natural hair curl</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first curling iron/wand ever (besides using a Conair curl &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; which works great but is more for giving a little wave), and I love it!</li>
            <li>Gets hot and easy to use!</li>
            <li>But ita super easy and quick!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl very easily-</li>
            <li>I would just say make sure you select the right size.  </li>
            <li>The small wand creates perfect, flawless, tight curls within seconds ...</li>
            <li>I am sure with the right spray it will stay for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>The wand came with a full glove and the wand is easy to use.</li>
            <li>- it gets hot!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curler!!!!</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s really HOT!!</li>
            <li>I own a smaller wand, but this really gives you a nice beach/loose curls that stay on for days!</li>
            <li>Only downside is that the temperature setting has to be extremely high for the best waves.</li>
            <li>The larger barrel and high temperature scale of this curling wand make it the best value for the price that I have found!</li>
            <li>it creates beautiful loose curls.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and makes beautiful, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need any product and it was super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and seems to be made of decent materials.</li>
            <li>but it is still great, heats up quickly and gives fabulous curls in a short space of time!</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s quick and easy to create loos curls.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for people who don&#x27;t know how to curl their own hair because all you have to do is wrap around the wand and hold it for a few seconds!</li>
            <li>Once you get used to using the wand it provides a quick and easy way to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also cooled off pretty fast as well, which is a good thing if your in a rush &amp; don&#x27;t have one of those fancy curling iron /blow dryer holders &amp; I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the glove is very useful because the rod can get very hot.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a wand that heats up fast gives you nice loose curls and for great price I defiantly recommend this Remington wand.</li>
            <li>and so I thought that this would be perfect, but the barrel is too large and it is hard to get really nice curls.</li>
            <li>It heats up real hot and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot, so you have to be careful, but does make great curls, quick and easy!</li>
            <li>it heats very fast, i love it came with the glove</li>
            <li>The change in temperatures is also nice - I like being able to set it very low for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot very quickly, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>Perfect large loose curls and waves.</li>
            <li>I love my new tool, and have had many people ask me how I do my hair...</li>
            <li>the great thing is it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair which is important to me.</li>
            <li>The hair will slip if you do not hold it right, and it worked best for me when I held the curler upside down with the skinnier part of the barrel pointed at the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall the curling iron is amazing!...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the &amp;#34;Pearl&amp;#34; helps your hair, but the curls are perfect (plus its pink!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, worth the money all the way!</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Love the built in stand that really works!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased the 1-1.5 inch curling wand, but found the results to be too \\&quot;shirly temple\\&quot;-esque for me.</li>
            <li>This thing is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep practicing and using this product.</li>
            <li>but it was worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I love this wand so much!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>You can get the ultimate perfect natural curls with this curling iron!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t in its original packaging or anything just put in a box.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure you can use it abroad</li>
            <li>its just not user friendly.</li>
            <li>although mine sis not come in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>And I imagine with each next time it will only look more beautiful!</li>
            <li>Works great on her long hair.</li>
            <li>I love that you can change the heat and that it heats up so fast!</li>
            <li>Love it and the curl stays in my stick straight hair all day!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what originally attracted me to it</li>
            <li>curls come out beautiful, although takes a couple of tries to get used to</li>
            <li>Got many compliments on my hair first time using this.</li>
            <li>make sure you know how to use it before you try (watch tutorials) because it is very helpful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun!</li>
            <li>I figured for the price, who cares if it works or not, it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and straight.</li>
            <li>Aside from that the wand itself works fine and heats up and gets very hot</li>
            <li>I have to give this product a 1-star, because while the curling iron itself is great, the glove that comes with it is nothing more than a little knit mitten.</li>
            <li>Great for my long hair!  </li>
            <li>I own the smaller version of this curler and love it</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand, still have to get used to using it (burnt my fingers a few times lol)</li>
            <li>I own both the 1-1.5 inches and 0.5-1 inch wands but mostly use the bigger wand.</li>
            <li>But occasionally I do like to have some curls in my hair because it does look nice and its a refreshing change.  </li>
            <li>Temperature is adequate and the surface on the iron is smooth.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this curling wand gives nice beach waves and big curls.</li>
            <li>I love how this curling iron gives me the flexibility to play around with the size and shapes of my curls and and they look more natural.</li>
            <li>The pearl finish is super smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap, works so well, and comes with a glove to protect your hand.</li>
            <li>This product simply does not make Remington look good - it&#x27;s so cheap, and there is nothing \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; about the barrel even though the photo makes it look pearlescent.  </li>
            <li>Perfect  present for young girls.</li>
            <li>I already fell in love with the smaller size to this...and the temperature setting is nice...</li>
            <li>The wand heats up quickly too which is a huge plus, and it has adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li>It looks kinda cheap, but it heats up quickly and it does its job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap</li>
            <li>Temperature is adequate and the surface on the iron is smooth.</li>
            <li>The controls are super easy and simple to understand and the curls are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast, and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>was planning on buying the Nume curling wands after seeing so many positive feedback on them, but their prices are just too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess Im old fashioned I like my curling iron better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I always use a leave in conditioner, and because my hair has more texture than my friend&#x27;s, it didn&#x27;t slip right off the wand, and with a bit of practice, I was able to create some nice, loose curls.</li>
            <li>Does do a great job with loose curls.</li>
            <li>SO easy so handle, so light but very sturdy, it heats up in SECONDS!</li>
            <li>:) And use the glove everytime...it gets super hot.</li>
            <li>this thing gets super hot so be sure to use the glove that comes with it to prevent from burning your hands.</li>
            <li>This helped make my waves look smooth and beautiful in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I knocked it down a star because the gloves that come with it do still transmit a fair amount of the heat, and it melted my nail polish!</li>
            <li>Creates large waves. :)</li>
            <li>It makes large curls and as they fall, they are more just a wave on me.</li>
            <li>its alright, nothing special.</li>
            <li>it creates a more natural-looking large curl.</li>
            <li>I chose right when I selected this product!  </li>
            <li>Not to mention, the price is right!</li>
            <li>the hair slides right off it!</li>
            <li>Try the smaller wand if you want tighter curls this one is for large beautiful curls/waves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little tricky to use at first, I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I am really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Which is probably fine for many of you, and perhaps obvious to most of you, but I like a clamp</li>
            <li>It was hard to get the hang of this curling wand, but once I got the hang of it, it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping was also a huge plus!</li>
            <li>Works great, not much else to say.</li>
            <li>instead I got the Herstyler Grande pink curling wand (which was cheaper) and it works great.</li>
            <li>Even being inexperienced I am getting great results, and it gets easier every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing , and a vary good quality for a small price , i recomend it a lot</li>
            <li>But if you practice a bit with wrapping your hair around it and get a feel for it (before you heat it up), then you&#x27;ll have more success at not burning the bleep out of your fingers ;)</li>
            <li>Then one of my girls&#x27; schoolmates had beautiful curls in her pin straight hair and told me they were 2nd day curls!</li>
            <li>First time i used this my hair turned out great, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since I&#x27;ve gotten the same results.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of experience with curling wands, so I thought I would weigh in, since most of the reviews on this product are from people who don&#x27;t seem to have much knowledge about how to use them or what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ready tons of reviews and this wand seemed to be the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>The reviews stating that their hair held a curl even when sleeping on it were true.</li>
            <li>I get better curls with this than a curling iron and it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Love this wand and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>love this product and the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>My friends fell in love with it when I let them borrow it when we are getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li>&amp; I knew that wouldn&#x27;t be the last time, so I just decided to get her one of her own &amp; it delivered the very next day instead of the 2-day shipping I chose, so that was a great surprise as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good curling wand especially for the price ,,,.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly yesterday, which was 2 days after I ordered it thanks to amazon prime; and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>item produces some nice soft curls.</li>
            <li>so I just felt the need to say that I currently own a wand and use it all the time with no trouble.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I used to be one of those people who thought all the heated hair tools had to cost at least $100 to be good and work great, but apparently they make them better than they used to years ago</li>
            <li>Also, the tip doesn&#x27;t stay cool</li>
            <li>Make sure you start twirling the strand from the very bottom</li>
            <li>Just remember to let the curls COOL before you touch them, or else you&#x27;ll be coming the curl</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and the curls lasts more than a day for me.</li>
            <li>Good product, low price.</li>
            <li>i love it, makes it so much easier to curl hair...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much but am pleased with my purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li>makes them look really natural and nice.</li>
            <li>I have to slide my hair off the barrel, keeping the curl shape intact so it can cool in ringlet form.</li>
            <li>over all its really good if you want bigger curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glove is good size even for my big palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>Basically, to let the hair cool in my palm before releasing it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, love the glove thing that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Not bad for 10-15 minutes of effort.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sure how to use this kind of curling iron, just watch some YouTube tutorials - there are tons of good ones out there.</li>
            <li>The 1-1 1/2 inch curls are really beautiful and it gives me a good mix of having casual looking curls.</li>
            <li>It is so quick, so simple, and very easy to do!</li>
            <li>I burned myself first time out because I was too concentrated on making sure the hair was going on right</li>
            <li>This gets much hotter than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had before (hence the glove, which is pretty important in my opinion) but each section of my hair only needed about 30 seconds and the curls are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>heats up super fast, digital easy read numbers to set, wrap, hold, and wonderful, soft bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>cause it arrives super fast and free!</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast, and I love the waves I got.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want huge curls, so I bought the smaller option and let me tell you: I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works really well on my hair!</li>
            <li>Actually easy to use,  came fast too!  </li>
            <li>It was pretty easy for her to get the hang of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and fast!</li>
            <li>I consider this my first real curler, since the one I had before is now so old, I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I used it and the result was, if not awful, then something passable at best .</li>
            <li>They use this technique for special occasion hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this very much!</li>
            <li>I had the right sized curler in time for Christmas and they picked up the original one for me right at home!</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold hairstyles well and even when I got my hair done professionally for prom years ago, the style didn&#x27;t hold for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other then that, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other ppl use it and curls come out great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this on other people and it works great.</li>
            <li>they looked great, but not exactly what I had in mind.</li>
            <li>For it to be most effective, you have to do your hair first then touch up with this potentially scalding device.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty handy with bobby pins, but I have never been able to master the traditional curling iron that comes with a clip.  </li>
            <li>It curled my hair very well despite my hair being a little below shoulders since I got the 1-1 1/2 inch one it was perfect</li>
            <li>Pretty straightforward and easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It takes practice learning how to hold the wand in the most comfortable way (especially when doing the back of your head) but it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>Im a stylist and it creates nice, loose curls, wand is a little tricky to manipulate on hair but practice makes perfect, use your glove so you don&#x27;t get burned, If you have shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>They are not \\&quot;super easy\\&quot; to use.</li>
            <li>The smaller one would be better for tighter more Shirley Temple</li>
            <li>Much better than same shape from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my hair as quickly as I would like...</li>
            <li>I like the bigger wand better even though it was $10 more.  </li>
            <li>Makes quick, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Some of these wands make super curly</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was as described.  </li>
            <li>I recently went for a bachelorette weekend for my best friend &amp; she used it constantly.</li>
            <li>Granted my hair is super long-to my waist-</li>
            <li>Quick shipping also</li>
            <li>they ship it super fast&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly &amp; the curls lasted all night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching for a routine that will be quick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very used to having good luck with the old clamp-style irons and cannot for the life of me get my hair to stay on the barrel.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Dominiocan with super curly hair</li>
            <li>I have also used it on smaller sections of hair to do big bouncy curls that drop into perfect waves.</li>
            <li>Very well priced and really does an amazing job, heats up quick, has a thermometer, and curls hold forever.</li>
            <li>really quick</li>
            <li>Adjustable heat, quick heat up time, and safety auto-shut off are must have features.</li>
            <li>Quick heating&lt;</li>
            <li>Love this iron because it lessens them and makes them hold outside better.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and sets the wave in my hair immediately.</li>
            <li>I can do a quick curling job with this curling want in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Julie said she loves the curling iron since it curls her hair quickly without burning the hair strands.</li>
            <li>It came so quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the curls stay in.</li>
            <li>Ok, I watch many YouTube beauty/hair gurus &amp; they all have different hair tools of choice.</li>
            <li>The high heat settings on this actually keeps the curls in for a good few hours though, so I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten blowouts at high end places and hair done with this wand fares better.</li>
            <li>Good wand.heats up fast comes with a glove very safe and cute if u like Victoria secret model curls</li>
            <li>this is a  very good curling wand gets very hot but the glove it comes with is just a little cheap glove that doesn&#x27;t really work that well but 5 stars for the wand</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see this product come up, and I watched several instruction videos to make sure I used it</li>
            <li>this really needs something to catch the hair to be able to curl it the right way.  </li>
            <li>, other go to 450, I can&#x27;t see WHY anyone would need more heat than THIS??!!</li>
            <li>Creates beautiful curls easily even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>This curls your hair very nicely,  and overall works really well.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s very hot and works well.....</li>
            <li>It gets very hot</li>
            <li>I would recommend wearing the included glove until you get the hang of using it because it does get very hot.</li>
            <li>Very fast once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li>Gets very hot.</li>
            <li>down(I&#x27;m normally the most patient person ever)</li>
            <li>This wand gets very hot but comes with a glove.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I no longer lose hair due to pulling it out because it got stuck on the screw hinge section of the clamp to my old curling iron</li>
            <li>after receiving my product and using it almost daily I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This curling wand works well on curling my hair, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>A lot better than a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li>The wand&#x27;s heat is very HOT.</li>
            <li>My hair look very pretty when I use it</li>
            <li>The cool tip is not actually cool, but in my opinion that&#x27;s a happy accident-</li>
            <li>Again, this was my very first time handeling any sort of hair curler</li>
            <li>It does get very hot and</li>
            <li>That type keeps your hair in place, not your hand holding a very hot barrel.</li>
            <li>does get very hot.</li>
            <li>The thickness was good since my hair is long.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly and having the glove is very useful.</li>
            <li>Once you practice with it, one can really create beautiful loose beach waves.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and creates beautiful curls that last all day and night (and sometimes into the next day!).</li>
            <li>You do not have good results trying to hold the hair on the bar long enough to get a good curl as your hand begins to get to hot.</li>
            <li>Gave my very fine, but very thick bone-straight hair great body and lasted hours.</li>
            <li>the prices on them are great, and they look pretty in pink.</li>
            <li>okey yess it work, it make some nice curly on my hair  and they look natural ;)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really gift this easily for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love this wand, it gets hot fast</li>
            <li>It actually makes my hair feel softer when i use it, which is strange in a great way!</li>
            <li>I accidentally burned myself the first time I used it although I herd only good things from this curling wand</li>
            <li>I wish I could do it more consistently throughout my whole head.</li>
            <li>but I defiantly love how it gets hot fast , and you can control your heat settings .</li>
            <li>Soooo fast and easy.</li>
            <li>(I have medium-long length hair) and I am pretty much always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>it heats up fast and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m just not a fan generally of the tapered design, but it is a sleek wand, easy to read display, heats up super quickly, and was otherwise a fine wand if you don&#x27;t mind the design.</li>
            <li>It gets salon hot!  </li>
            <li>and IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT!.</li>
            <li>I finally bought one myself and love it!</li>
            <li>This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve tried after watching a Youtube video of a girl doing it with ease!</li>
            <li>But hey, for this price it doesn&#x27;t really matter!!</li>
            <li>Product even came with a protective glove because product gets really hot!</li>
            <li>My favorite curling product so far!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>With so many bogus, fake reviews now on here, I feel we &amp;#34;true consumers&amp;#34; owe it to ppl to write HONEST reviews!!  </li>
            <li>must it gets really really hot!</li>
            <li>At first, I was like wth!  </li>
            <li>It gets super hot super quick.</li>
            <li>I curl my bangs and my under curl with my older larger barrel iron and then go around my whole head with the top most layer of hair and make ringlets, after the heat dissipates I scrunch my hair with my hands at the roots to get more body.</li>
            <li>You can easily create many different looks using just this wand.</li>
            <li>Simple curling iron that works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>I did learn to make my own hair gel, and that helped tremendously, but the second day still needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do spray my hair with dry shampoo before I use the wand so that the curl holds more, but this wand is better than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is such an easy curling wand, and so inexpensive for such a great result.  </li>
            <li>But I have really fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>It certainly has a learning curve, but it is fairly easy and quick, and the curls stay in pretty well (even without additional product).</li>
            <li>But since I like loose curls, the bigger size is perfect.</li>
            <li>The glove this thing comes with barely covers your hand, so it&#x27;s still very easy to burn your wrist --</li>
            <li>Gets hot super quick.</li>
            <li>This one is good for loose curls!</li>
            <li>She really likes this for curling, and I can say her hair looks fantastic when she uses it.</li>
            <li>this things is amazing for 20 bucks definitely</li>
            <li>it is amazing do not recommend for younger ages</li>
            <li>Heats up real fast</li>
            <li>Now, i have amazing hair every day and it takes me only 5 min.</li>
            <li>I have multiple styling tools from Remington and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li>after watching a few youtube tutorials on curling wands i decided to order this one paired with great amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this iron after reading countless reviews and seeing many Youtube videos on this iron.</li>
            <li>gloves are nice but they&#x27;re not necessary.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Within a week, using the wand became more natural.</li>
            <li>That works far better</li>
            <li>and decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems as if the wand style irons/wavers are the direction that hair appliances are heading so it is worth trying one out.</li>
            <li>Produces looser, more natural looking waves than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;gifted&amp;#34; as some say with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Def not even worth the $15</li>
            <li>and I think for my next wand I&#x27;m going to invest in a better curling wand and not get something just because it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Since she bought her own, she has since bought them as presents for several of her friends and family members.</li>
            <li>I thought a tapered barrel would be more important than it actually turned out to be -</li>
            <li>I rarely use the highest setting.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This creates great natural curls that really last!  </li>
            <li>I have only used once, but  really liked the results.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair curl and feel soft from the ceramic barrel.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in the bigger size once I tested it because I liked it</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve been using this iron since 2012, and it is STILL my favorite curling wand I&#x27;ve found, thus far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I even find myself using my old curling iron with the clip more often.  </li>
            <li>I am a stylist who spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a good wand that would put curls that would hold in the sleekest of hair.</li>
            <li>y&#x27;all don&#x27;t hear me, Yasssss I love it Fabulous curl that last all day even to the morning</li>
            <li>The Remington Pearl curlers are the best though and actually provide lasting texture to my ever straight locks.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love that its digital and light wight.</li>
            <li>You want professional and light wight!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this completely depends on the behavior of your hair as well as the tightness of the curls, so don&#x27;t expect that to work for everyone!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use wrapping lotion or holding spray when making curls although the wand curls the hair it wont last on its own.</li>
            <li>Overall this product gives a nice curl.</li>
            <li>I just wished I got a smaller one, just for the size of the curls, but it&#x27;s a really nice hair styling tool</li>
            <li>but just in case, always make sure to get a professional&#x27;s advice on it.</li>
            <li>I was reading the reviews and saw that a lot of people with thicker hair that never holds a curl were having success with this.</li>
            <li>The iron takes a minute or two to warm up to 410, so don&#x27;t expect instant flaming heat.  </li>
            <li>high temperate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>And the nice thing is, if you apply the tape just right, you can reuse it again a few more times.    </li>
            <li>Creates gorgeous full curles that bounce and last, looks very natural and glamorous..</li>
            <li>It took seconds to make a nice curl in my super long hair.</li>
            <li>This product gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot for very fast curling with a lot of</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a quick compromise between a curling iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li>you can  burn your hand pretty quick ..</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>I got a 1-1/2 size for bigger curl, my hair is very easy to slide off but after practicing more times i can make it fixed well.</li>
            <li>You do have to get the hang of it at first, but overall my hair looked really nice the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>I have the eliptical wand as well and both get very hot and stay hot.</li>
            <li>That was a good tip from one of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>I gets very hot and stays hot.</li>
            <li>The temperature gets hot so be careful but overall one of the best ones out there</li>
            <li>I have long needed a clipless curling iron, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought one!</li>
            <li>Be carful if it&#x27;s your first time using it because it gets very hot</li>
            <li>THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT HEATS UP REALLY FAST AND ITS REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li>Other than that, like I said, the wand is really good.</li>
            <li>but once you got that down, great tool, awersome large curls&amp;#62</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>you get the right way to do .</li>
            <li>you can select the right size wand for your hair/curl size preference&lt;</li>
            <li>then it is just about right for my medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 1-1 1/2 &amp;#34; size and that was the right size for my length hair.  </li>
            <li>maybe its just that i dont know how to use it right</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>All I needed was the right tool.  </li>
            <li>But it must take lots of practice because I can&#x27;t get any of my curls to look right.</li>
            <li>My hair rolled right off the wand as I tried to avoid scorching my hands.</li>
            <li>biggest problem for me is that you cant&#x27; let go of your hair at any time during the process or it slips right off.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s HOT.&lt;br /&gt;-The glove is right handed.</li>
            <li>but it still didn&#x27;t come out right.</li>
            <li>Should be you need to hold it for a couple seconds for it to make the change since the settings are right on the handle.</li>
            <li>My hair slips right off the tapered barrel</li>
            <li>I received my package 3 days after placing my order and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>Once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s easy to get the cute barrel curls that are gorgeous with long hair.</li>
            <li>These curls are big, beautiful, and last all day!</li>
            <li>This one provides more natural curls because of the shape of the wand and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>impressed but only as an average curler.</li>
            <li>It really does get super hot, so use caution and give your hair a break in between uses!</li>
            <li>My only complain about these wands is that I find it very easy to burn your arms and fingers.</li>
            <li>Both sizes work great, it really comes down to the look you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the curler itself, works fantastic and I highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li>This one is good but not great -- my problem is that it tapers into a smaller size at the top which kind of messes up the shape of the curls it creates.</li>
            <li>I had the half inch size but love the 1 inch so much more</li>
            <li>Its really easy to use, and i love how its pink..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same technique before with a curling iron, wrapping the hair around the iron rather than clamping it on for a less &#x27;perfect&#x27; curl.</li>
            <li>They also own the smaller version, but wanted the bigger one for more of a wave look</li>
            <li>In my opinion, and the only way I curl my hair is outwards because it looks more natural and frames my face better.</li>
            <li>This is the second clipless curling wand i have bought (I also got the conair you curl which was okay) and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the larger barrel and it gives beautiful big curls that fall into really pretty waves.</li>
            <li>It did take several attempts at styling before I became comfortable with the wand, but it heats up fast and the handle is comfortable to hold!</li>
            <li>its great and does the job however cuz its so slippery all the hair bunches to the thiner portion :/</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice curing iron, I have just not been able to get use to using a wand, not sure if it is me or just the design.</li>
            <li>Gives nice curls to my medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>Nice long cord and built in stand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried doing blow outs and flat irons but hands down this works the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the glove comes in very handy, as I&#x27;ve seen other curlers like this that don&#x27;t come with a glove and can potentially burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>baby gets hot, hot, hot!</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1-1.5&amp;#34; wand after wanting nice bouncy curls and not being able to achieve them with a regular curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li>The curls held extremely well, I even brushed it out after curling just to see how well they would hold, and I still have full head of curls and beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>I only tested a few strands of hair, but let me tell you: AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Both wands had great hold altogether, but if you want the curls that you see on TV and in magazines, I would definitely go with the larger wand.</li>
            <li>But I got the results that make my wand seem worth a lot more than it actually was.</li>
            <li>it is enough time to protect your fingers, but I would have liked something I could keep on the barrel longer to really curl to the tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my old curling iron (it was a good brand, just worn out), my curls got drabby as soon as I left the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the control buttons are clear.</li>
            <li>The glove they supply with it isn&#x27;t anything to great, and it makes it harder to grip your strips of hair, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t help you out.</li>
            <li>I have the smaller one and it works great, got this one for bigger curles.</li>
            <li>Regular big banana curls are great too with this.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and am please with my purchase but surprised that no mentioned how easy it is to accidentally change the heat settings while curling your hair.</li>
            <li>otherwise it heats up super fast and curls hair</li>
            <li>This is a great product, Im not very good with hair</li>
            <li>So while the product is good, i believe the heat isn&#x27;t high enough for people with straight hair.</li>
            <li>So, once more I decided to show the tool some mercy, and try it out on my other two sisters&#x27; medium and ultra fine hair...SAME RESULTS.</li>
            <li>PLUS, the larger barrel size is better for my long hair - giving it nice curls throughout the day, and wavy/beachy curls by the end of the night.   </li>
            <li>can be very hot, be very careful!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hot and curls my hair fast.</li>
            <li>Love this curler really amazing , curls stay in your hair for so long (: Definitely purchase this item</li>
            <li>This wand only takes about 25 mins to curl my whole head (that&#x27;s a record for me, since I have a head full of hair) and the end result looks A MILLION times better and</li>
            <li>Makes nice loose fashionable curls.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact I can have nice loose curls</li>
            <li>Gives nice loose beachy waves.</li>
            <li>and it still makes nice loose curls.</li>
            <li>Makes nice, loose beachy waves.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a nice head of loose curly waves with lots of volume, and those Kardashians girls had nothing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watching someone using this kind if curling iron on TV or YouTube, it seems easy, but, when you attempt doing it for the first time, it&#x27;s so difficult, that i decided to return it, because i had an event coming up and didn&#x27;t have time to figure this thing out on my extremely fine hair!</li>
            <li>It is also very fast to use</li>
            <li>This wand curls very fast and it took around 15 minutes to have all of my hair completed.</li>
            <li>but when I went to use it, the wand heated up very fast</li>
            <li>It heats up VERY fast.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair that does not take well to any attempts to make it do otherwise.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and my curls stay all day.</li>
            <li>So far she&#x27;s done just fine with it.  </li>
            <li>It does not include 20 soft rollers as stated in the description, which was fine since I didn&#x27;t need them.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job on one side and then just completely refused to curl the other side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, these wands do give you a more natural and professional curl/wave, and can do so quickly, but it does take practice to achieve the goal.</li>
            <li>I do have to use the glove still &amp; that was one of the main reasons I chose this one in the first place &amp; after reading all of the other reviews, as I&#x27;m still a beginner with wands, never doing much more than straightening my hair for many years, so I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how not to burn myself yet without the glove.</li>
            <li>It works best for long hair and flowing waves, as opposed to tight curls.</li>
            <li>and I found it very easy to wrap my hair around it, as long as I wore the accompanying glove.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>Good little curling wand.</li>
            <li>I was easily able to make gorgeous loose curls that stayed all night with minimal hairspray.</li>
            <li>but this is super easy, especially since i just like the wavy effortless look.</li>
            <li>An easy, quick and total confidence booster for under $25?</li>
            <li>I accidentally purchased this wand when I meant to buy the smaller size, but Amazon made the exchange incredibly quick and easy.</li>
            <li>first I was debating on the 1/2 to 1inch and the 1 to 1.5inch.</li>
            <li>Also, first try it out before turning it on that way</li>
            <li>i recomend it plus is not so espensive ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall 5 stars, It&#x27;s cheaper than Hot Tools and Jose Eber, yes,</li>
            <li>I figured it out the first try.</li>
            <li>This wand comes with a glove which is absolutely essential to make sure you curl the tips of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve a curl before and this goes above and beyond.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to get hot.</li>
            <li>but overall I do love this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair first, then use this.</li>
            <li>They have used it at least once or twice a week since then and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to style my hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m considering buying the bigger size for more different looks :)</li>
            <li>But the curling iron really works!</li>
            <li>I had problems learning how to use it at first (and my hair kept sliding out of place)</li>
            <li>Like seriously,it burns my hands,and this is not even my first time using it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got the bigger barrel!</li>
            <li>First night I tried it, it sucked.</li>
            <li>Take another short strip and fold it over the top of your ears, protecting the tip, sides and outward-facing aspect of your ear.  </li>
            <li>And not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>But then I watched a how-to video on YouTube (which I HIGHLY recommend doing!!)</li>
            <li>And love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like regular curlers did when a strand of hair would get caught in the clamp part.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair and it heats up pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I may have burned my fingers once or twice when first using it</li>
            <li>Use the curling wand glove at first to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely use the glove until you&#x27;re comfortable or you WILL burn yourself!</li>
            <li>It doesnt damage your hair and it holds a curl pretty well even without hairspray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got REVLON&#x27;s curling iron first, it burned me a lot and the curls cannot be maintained for even a dinner time.</li>
            <li>I recommend spaying hair with hairspray first and brushing through before curling hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend to YouTube videos on how to use a wand before trying for your first time.</li>
            <li>I like this one better, the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this tool.  </li>
            <li>Seems comparable to and or better than products below and above this price range as well.</li>
            <li>I tried this wand only for one side of my hair didn&#x27;t even use spray and it held nicely most of the day.</li>
            <li>heats up fast!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend it to my friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li>I always straightened it first, and then by the time I straightened it I saw no point to curl it again.</li>
            <li>my hair did feel any different or any more damaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning, but love the different looks.</li>
            <li>You have to get used to holding it backwards when you switch sides, and it gets extremely hot</li>
            <li>My sister used it on my hair the first time and it took about 35 min to finish all my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking to buy a better glove because it is definitely needed when working with this type of iron.</li>
            <li>410 degrees is pretty hot and does a great job keeping the curl long lasting.</li>
            <li>This may not be a higher end brand but the pearl coating has allowed me to heat style without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>These babies really work!</li>
            <li>Since it does get so hot, considering using a heat protector</li>
            <li>Definitely not for a first timer at hair curling that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Thank you - love it will be buying the smaller one soon</li>
            <li>My first time using it, it rolled a bit on the countertop and wound up melting through a bottle of mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It gives me big, lovely waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it for newbies like me, maybe with more experience</li>
            <li>you can create so many different styles: causal (every day), work, formal.</li>
            <li>I already owned the narrower version, but wanted larger more wavy curls.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to correctly work a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>was buy the 1/2-1 inch at first</li>
            <li>At first I used the mitten that comes with it while getting used to handling it, but now I find I don&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li>, so you know exactly what you&#x27;re setting it to.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 1-1 1/2 inch barrel because I wanted looser curls and this gave me the exact look I was going for.</li>
            <li>but I am absolutely in love with the larger version.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve had only fabulous hair days!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to work on trying to improve my motor skills with a burning hot object close to my hands and face.  </li>
            <li>and I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot, I think you need a heat protector glove for each hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>It works ok but the barrel is too big to curl my chin length hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty dextrous person</li>
            <li>She has used several times and is always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>i love the 1.5 inch part, makes big waves</li>
            <li>first time I use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li>It was very affordable and my go-to style!</li>
            <li>Love how it shuts off after 1 hour, sometimes being in such a rush</li>
            <li>I love this product overall</li>
            <li>My first one is thinner (meant to be for tighter curls)</li>
            <li>The wand is pretty slick/slippery, and most of all it is BIG!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, suffered severe burn on my ear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shown each one exactly what to buy on amazon.</li>
            <li>They said that it is exactly what they wanted.</li>
            <li>My first time using this iron it burned my carpet.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing better protection when using this product.</li>
            <li>When I first revived this product, I thought it was a piece of #%?</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;ll stick with my hot tools rod instead.</li>
            <li>First, directions show a tong for use, but there was none.</li>
            <li>The photo is from my first time using.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot but still doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, will never use a regular curling iron again.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>If the hair tends to slip off, use a hairspray first, then brush through your hair and it should help.</li>
            <li>Love this larger one!  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot and works with all hair types.</li>
            <li>She suggested STARTING the wand at your chin for your lower hair (bottom of your head, say, ear length); for the middle section, start curling at the top of your lip; and for the top, start curling at the bridge of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it gets really hot, so it sets well.</li>
            <li>this is fast!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try it your first time and assume you&#x27;ll be a pro.</li>
            <li>Returned this product - I was aware of the diameter</li>
            <li>This product works exactly how it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>Glad i seen it cuz this is a total rip off!!!!</li>
            <li>This was exactly as stated it would be.</li>
            <li>I guess if this is not your first time using this, you might like it.</li>
            <li>Love the digital dial and the temperature lock feature...</li>
            <li>Comes with a glove that lets you touch your hot hair as you curl it (though not the wand</li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>and it is extremely hot.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t curl the way</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re most likely gonna burn your fingers while you try to figure this out.</li>
            <li>hair-styling challenged ;)</li>
            <li>it will still take at least 30 minutes, but it holds the curls way better than a curling iron and looks great the next day even!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what my grandaughter wanted.</li>
            <li>I never use the glove, but you might want to the first couple of uses because it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if i will ever use a regular curling iron as i like the shape these make better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I had wanted to try out a cheaper version first before I decided if I needed a pricier one, however I am just going to stick to this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>did you expect a hot iron NOT to burn you if you touched it?</li>
            <li>This gets 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from my big beachy waves I&#x27;ve created.</li>
            <li>The knob is made so that when you place the iron on a surface the hot part stays off that surface.</li>
            <li>I had first purchased the 1/2 to 1 inch wand</li>
            <li>I like how hot it gets</li>
            <li>However, for the price, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m willing to put up with</li>
            <li>Then once I got the hang of it it turned out so much more easier and quicker then your standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Makes big cute curls</li>
            <li>It does get really hot</li>
            <li>I love the bigger barrel because you can curl thicker pieces of hair and it makes the process a lot faster.</li>
            <li>The is my first time using one of these</li>
            <li>That is Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Such lovely waves</li>
            <li>Digital button controls, which I had NO problems with touching or hitting them &amp; changing it or turning it of( u know?)  .</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand for big barrel curls.</li>
            <li>but I did like the results with the first use.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>(It can get really really hot though...</li>
            <li>Works WAY better on my hair than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>Its hot, i cant place it on any surface from the warning signs.</li>
            <li>is my first curler without any &#x27;clip&#x27;.</li>
            <li>And the hot glove is a</li>
            <li>First of all, the on/off button doesn&#x27;t work -- I have to plug it in/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done this from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this curling iron!!</li>
            <li>It took a bit of time to be able to get used to it, but now with enough practice, it&#x27;s quite effortless.</li>
            <li>the hot part will be on the table or wherever you have it set</li>
            <li>other than that, I love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never fooled with the temp control, the baseline setting that it starts at is way hot for me.</li>
            <li>First time buying a curler</li>
            <li>I love how I can easily curl my hair and spray a little bit of hairspray and my curls or waves will stay.</li>
            <li>The heating is pretty quick and high ..</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does a good job if you hold the hair on it long enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great success with other wands like this, but I was looking for a larger barrel.</li>
            <li>It works very well, gets very hot, and even my straight hair will hold the curl.</li>
            <li>Easy to get burned if you are not careful</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only burned myself two or three times, which is more than with a regular curling iron, but worth it for the smooth curls.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that the reviews on this were so positive (which is the reason I purchased it in the first place).</li>
            <li>Probably the large more in the winter and the smaller for HUMID weather.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I get better results curling with my GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love the Pearl flat iron</li>
            <li>some other wands I own do.</li>
            <li>This definitely helps create the loose waves that are very popular now.  </li>
            <li>I have the smaller one, but I absolutely love more this one because my hair it&#x27;s very long.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I have time I like to turn this iron on and my old iron on at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have two Jose Eber clipless irons that I bought a few years ago, and I really think that this Remington option is superior to the ones</li>
            <li>For sure the next wand I get will be a straight one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this curling iron but was left wishing I didn&#x27;t throw out the packaging to return it.  </li>
            <li>I got the bigger barrel because I wanted big loose waves and they turn out perfect.</li>
            <li>Now, even though my hair is natural curly, does not mean it is easy to curl with an iron.</li>
            <li>The black tip on the top gets super hot</li>
            <li>It is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve tried, is big enought to make loose curls, besides it gets hot enough to make them very well defined, i would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>My hair looks natural, it is already curly but with the Remington curl it take the frizz out of your hair specially if you color your hair.</li>
            <li>Several reviewers said it was easy to use, others said it was tricky at first</li>
            <li>Digital control with LCD temperature readout make it easy to know how hot it is</li>
            <li>* Positive Points:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;m not hitting the off button (which doesn&#x27;t work anyway), and it just shuts off while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update my review in about 6-8 months to review the long term quality of this product. :)</li>
            <li>You pretty much have to wear it to avoid burning your fingers, but I don&#x27;t care for the glove.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, so the larger wand would be better fit for those with the same length or longer because of the size of the barrel.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and gets really hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wand heats up fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li>glove didn&#x27;t protect my fingers when the setting was at 410 degrees, but that&#x27;s really too hot for anyone&#x27;s hair, no matter what anyone tells</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It gets hot fast.  </li>
            <li>This wand does an amazing job with my hair--it works fast and the curls look very big and natural.</li>
            <li>The price was also great compared to other products of similar quality.</li>
            <li>First off let me say that the iron works very well.</li>
            <li>and I love the barrel size since I have long hair.</li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t think I paid that much for it the first time around</li>
            <li>This product get hot extremely fast and stays hot through out the whole curling process.</li>
            <li>Flat irons are nice for the coordination-challenged who might burn themselves otherwise, as the outsides of the flat iron are protected and cool.  </li>
            <li>This curling wand produces gorgeous curls for a variety of styles without any line from the usual clamp style irons.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Also good for small curls.</li>
            <li>I loved the smaller barrel wand so much that I ordered the larger one</li>
            <li>My curls are gorgeous, they cascade down, are full and bouncy, truly last all day.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a gift for a teenaged girl, as it&#x27;s super easy to burn yourself with a curling rod if you&#x27;re not ultra careful.  </li>
            <li>(very appealing to girls), long lasting soft curls, fast and easy yo use.</li>
            <li>Must be careful when using it though as you can easily get burned!</li>
            <li>I love this brand for the low price and the high quality.</li>
            <li>I own both sizes, and found the smaller (1/2- 1&#x27;&#x27;) made the curls tighter than what I wanted - only when it loosened after a few hours does it look good.  </li>
            <li>Love how my curls look and how long they hold all day!</li>
            <li>I love my smaller clipless curling iron, so I was excited to find this larger sized one.</li>
            <li>They seem to work better on extensions or very long hair.</li>
            <li>With two gloves, it is easy to alternate between hands to style.</li>
            <li>The wand was easy to use and I had the bigger, voluminous curls that I desired from the beginning.</li>
            <li>The only cons that it has is that it could burn your finger easily</li>
            <li>The controls are simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My friend got herself one too after she tried mine, and she is very particular about hair products and devices-</li>
            <li>Works very well, fast and gives pretty curls.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple and easy to use it.</li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit, as I have bigger hands, but it fits...like a glove (haha)!</li>
            <li>have tried to make the curls with no products and the curls last a few hours, because you have to help them to stay beautiful.</li>
            <li>It SOUNDS like a good idea but not if you cant hold the hair place long enough to..</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair and it curls it perfectly.</li>
            <li>so you get strong curls that last.</li>
            <li>first w/hair dryer then go through w/a curling iron for smooth curls, I found it hard to curl the hair framing my face, so make sure that&#x27;s straightened first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The barrel is tapered, so you do need to hold it at certain angles to ensure it doesn&#x27;t slip off.</li>
            <li>It is really large.</li>
            <li>I got the 1-1.5 inch option because I like the beachy wave or large curl effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the problem is because it heats up just fine and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it for loose beachy curls.</li>
            <li>Because I want more loose curls, I bought the 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the way this wand gives me the loose curls I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>bought this after i bought a 1-in to 1/2-in barrel curling wand because those curls were a bit too tight (however, using a hairdryer to stretch out those curls was effective).</li>
            <li>This wand is really for long hair and it heats up nice and hot but it will burn ur scalp if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have tried other curling iron</li>
            <li>I wish it did have a clasp, however I do think the curl is more intense and long lasting, it also has more body and volume than my old iron.</li>
            <li>because the larger barrel will give you a more natural look!</li>
            <li>Works fine looks slightly different than the photo</li>
            <li>Long story short, I got a defective one, I only got to use it once, and the result was beautiful curls, absolutely beautiful on my medium length, thin hair.</li>
            <li>(short hair may work just fine)</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly and the glove works well, though I should probably buy a second glove, as I switch hands pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty decent shipping time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t show up curling, instead of his temperature is very high.</li>
            <li>this gives a nice soft curl when they start to fall loose.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I really liked this curling iron, but the on switch is a little tricky.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see how the more expensive wands etc could be any better than THIS ONE!</li>
            <li>I chose this curling iron after returning a highly rated clamp-style product from Hot Tools I had seen featured in women&#x27;s magazines.</li>
            <li>, I had to use a lot of hair spray to do my curls and would fall flat very quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and has very high temp.</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair hold a curl but the next day its still looking amazing.</li>
            <li>These 5-star reviews are nothing short of accurate.</li>
            <li>The introduction of clipless irons a few years back was welcome news.  </li>
            <li>all the amazing reviews made me buy it but different strokes for different folks.  </li>
            <li>Heat&#x27;s up fast.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really the look I was going for</li>
            <li>-which results in parts of my palm or fingers pushing the buttons -and changing the temperature or turning off the whole thing while I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really lik the curls it produces.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>nothing really works</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Swivel cord is very helpful</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t use throughout my whole hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience using these tools.</li>
            <li>I like the size of the wand, the curl is much looser than using the 3/4 inch ones.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curling iron!</li>
            <li>I woke to smooth curls just the way I left them when I went to bed.  </li>
            <li>Now you&#x27;re ready to begin.   </li>
            <li>The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the glove doesn&#x27;t do much to protect your fingers from the heat.</li>
            <li>, very Shirley Temple-esk.</li>
            <li>to really set it.</li>
            <li>so I need something really fast and heated to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>They lasted for a whole night.</li>
            <li>I bought a nume curl wand and paid 4 times as much.</li>
            <li>Another tip is it really matters which way you curl your hair inwards or outwards.</li>
            <li>My sister brought this very phallic looking curling wand when she came to visit me, and after urging me to try it..</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t already use a wand, it may not impress you much.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s pink :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and my hair holds curls for days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The protective glove that comes with it is much appreciated.</li>
            <li>But for me, my hair is stubbornly straight.</li>
            <li>Curls REALLY well.</li>
            <li>This curling wand works very well.  </li>
            <li>Used on my wedding day on my real hair and rely extensions</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of anything</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting too much based on the reviewers rating.  </li>
            <li>When I feel the heat over the glove I know that my hear is ready</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that can&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, the curls were much looser, but still gave the hair some additional volume.</li>
            <li>I really like this wand because I can curl my hair and my curls will stay intact for 2 to 3 days without any hair spray or anything.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, emits heat evenly.</li>
            <li>curling iron is fantastic, especially give the price.</li>
            <li>and these did not work to much for me.</li>
            <li>like it says, it really does create fullness at the crown.</li>
            <li>I had so much expectation.</li>
            <li>You simply can&#x27;t put your hair around the wand since it&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li>These Remington pink pearl hair wands &amp; straighteners are fantastic!</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>If I use the very end of the wand</li>
            <li>it heats up so fast..</li>
            <li>so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t take much for me to get the hang of using it.  </li>
            <li>It requires too much time and too much work for this gal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really takes some getting used to</li>
            <li>Before buying this product decide how much effort you want to put into curling your hair every day 20 minutes or 45?</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend anyone to buy this Remington Wand!</li>
            <li>The cone is also really slippery</li>
            <li>it could be the type of hair that i have (which is stubbornly straight)</li>
            <li>It is a very versatile wand that gives wavy and spiral curls.</li>
            <li>Knock on wood, I&#x27;ve never been burnt, but I don&#x27;t curl the very tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the price or quality has a real effect on the results with this wand</li>
            <li>I also have to say my hair is so much smoother and shinier after I use</li>
            <li>how much hair spray I used.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to be careful with your hands so that you don&#x27;t accidentally burn yourself, which I haven&#x27;t done yet,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the ends stay straight when I want them curled.</li>
            <li>Not too much waiting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much easier to do with this curling wand and</li>
            <li>IT CURLS FAST AND LASTS FOR DAYS.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really curl my hair...</li>
            <li>curling iron itself doesn&#x27;t look like much.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a lot of effort, but the whole business took about 40 minutes, and I believe it will go faster once I start getting used to the process.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really hold it on the end.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It curls my hair really well</li>
            <li>I really like how the curls come out with this curling wand.</li>
            <li>It stretches so it would fit multiple sizes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>I literally do my whole head of hair in 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>as much</li>
            <li>and I go so fast</li>
            <li>And the price was really reasonable.</li>
            <li>and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>They curl your hair really well</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly thanks to Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment and product as described</li>
            <li>Two suggestions: 1) the stand isn&#x27;t very stable.</li>
            <li>It is a very slippery barrel.</li>
            <li>: the glove that comes with it does not offer much protection from the heat.</li>
            <li>hair is straight and takes a lot to make it curl.</li>
            <li>would began to turn straight once again.</li>
            <li>the glove doesnt do much.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought the straight barrel.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Came in on time with not issues, my wife loves it, thanks.</li>
            <li>They do start to relax after 5 hours, but they don&#x27;t go completely straight.</li>
            <li>Heats up so fast,</li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast too.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>I use my REAL name etc.  </li>
            <li>I used it one day &amp; saw my hair looking like Annie&#x27;s, too much bounce</li>
            <li>and the whole curler will rest on this metal portion on the table surface etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t do much to protect your hand from hurtng/burning while you hold your hair.</li>
            <li>I learned how to curl my hair using this; its so much easier because it doesn&#x27;t have that clippy thing.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, and works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really think I have some of the thickest hair, thicker than even the ladies that did all those how-to videos on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good to have since I constantly am clumsy and burned myself here and there.</li>
            <li>Kind of wastes all the time of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>The missing two stars are for the clunky glove and the fact that you have to drain the blood from your arms to curl your own hair.</li>
            <li>My Wife liked the one with smaller curl so returned this one and got lesser size one</li>
            <li>We own several of the Remington Pearl items and was looking for one with a larger barrel.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was missing the real feminine genes because I can&#x27;t apply makeup or do my own hair</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and the pink is so lovely.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that reaches to the middle of my back; this always give me effortless beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Letting it twist around makes such nice bouncy spirals similar to Taylor Swifts.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my own curling wand, but I found it very hard to use on myself.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is really easy to use and creates nice, big curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s willing to take the time to experiment with it perhaps 2-3 times before really relying on it for a quick morning routine or a big night out.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the glove gets hot really quick.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s humid and hot..</li>
            <li>originally bought the 1/2 inch to 1 inch wand and used to curl my whole entire head</li>
            <li>pros are several: it heats up quickly and the temperature is easy to control and lock with the digital display.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, the glove barely protects fingers from burning while curling curl with caution.</li>
            <li>: When curling the right side of your hair, have the curler in your left hand and use your right hand to wrap.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and is able to curl hair almost instantly I get compliments on my hair daily asking what product i use.</li>
            <li>With this wand, I can let my hair air dry into a frizzy mess, and twenty minutes later I can have perfect curls a la Kate Beckett from Castle.</li>
            <li>I tried the 1/2-1 inch wand on my hair the other day and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Better than any curling iron or other wand I have had before.</li>
            <li>Both pearl products are truly better than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in the quality of my curls from that of a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>Yes like others have said, it is a bit more slippery than other wands but with practice you get used to it.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally thick, fine, and stick straight not keep curls easily</li>
            <li>It feels cheap compared to the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>When I read other reviews on Amazon about this product I was convinced it must be a miracle-worker and surely would turn my luck around.</li>
            <li>I gave up on the machine after this &amp; went back to the original curling iron</li>
            <li>I bought the small 1 inch curling wand first &amp; loved it so much I bought the larger wand and the large straightener.</li>
            <li>the glove is flimsy and I honestly do better without but VERY carefully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for this particular wand, it is infused with real pearl...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very coordinated, and I was able to figure out how to use this easily within 2 tries.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s full potential as I have not used it much, but I look forward to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I would definitely purchase while keeping in mind that the first time may not be a success, so don&#x27;t try it the morning before work.</li>
            <li>It makes perfect waves quickly and they last for days (at least 2, I wash every other day).  </li>
            <li>I can curl my whole head of long hair in less than 10 minutes, and the result is flawless loose waves.  </li>
            <li>However, I have long and thick hair, so to do my whole head took a good hour to do!</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair that generally doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, but with this iron I get perfectly wavy/curly hair, and it stays that way all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very attractive, and the barrel is a good size for several different styles of curls (looser using the base, or tighter at the top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use the large one for everyday use going to work and if I want super curls, the small one is great.</li>
            <li>It does the curls super fast and my curls last me all night.</li>
            <li>Gives a very pretty and soft curl that will fall into a natural wave by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I normally curl my hair with my straightener, which is fast.  </li>
            <li>but after a few tries, I was able to get the hang of it and didn&#x27;t have any more problems with it.  </li>
            <li>This hair is resistant to curling, volumizing or generally doing anything fun with it.  </li>
            <li>I would have given a full 5 stars if it actually had two gloves instead of one.</li>
            <li>With this wand it takes me about ten minutes and the curls seem to last really good for several hours.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to buy a really expensive one, this one works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to to use but it curls very well and allows different types of waves and curl that most traditional curlers don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Of course on day 1 the curls are much tighter, and on day 3, you have loose fabulous hair.  </li>
            <li>And its very easy to use, take very less time to heat up the want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>probably works better on people with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I just need to make sure to put my hair down lower on the barrel.  </li>
            <li>and i was able to curl my hair without straigtening it in advance which cuts down time and heat damage to my hair.   </li>
            <li>I had to hold the wand and curl my hair around it from top down.</li>
            <li>Curls do look better if you hold the want with the tip pointing down towards the floor FYI.</li>
            <li>so I need to move the hair down the barrel as I go to make room for more hair</li>
            <li>I find it has a tendency to &#x27;tip down&#x27; and burn the top of the counter, so I use a stone coaster underneath it and go about my day.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any of my friends because I really do like it, but in all honesty was hoping for something a little better.</li>
            <li>You can either buy a $200 curler or this very reasonable priced Remington curler n get the exact same results!</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t stay throughout the entire day, but long enough for me to look good.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought the 1/2-1&amp;#34; wand because it seemed the most popular and reviews and vids said that you can make the curls as loose or tight as you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but less is more and all I can say is....</li>
            <li>This one is so easy to use and gives very loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li>However, this 1 - 1 1/2-inch curling wand by Remington for less than $20 gave me outstanding results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s EASY to get burned with this unit even when I&#x27;m careful.  </li>
            <li>I use it to curl some of my top layer to help control frizz and make it seem less like I just rolled out of bed.</li>
            <li>Like I said, this particular style of wand needs some experience and/or practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the bigger curl much better than the smaller one.  </li>
            <li>I got the bigger size, which is better for waves than the smaller version.</li>
            <li>It gave me some decent waves but nothing</li>
            <li>Looked to be the better buy when compared to similar products in the similar price ranges.</li>
            <li>Makes a decent curl</li>
            <li>and I definitely think it holds curl better for a longer time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love this hair wand but the only downside is that my hair won&#x27;t hold the curl for the entire day.</li>
            <li>So, either the temperature buttons are seriously not working??</li>
            <li>This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve purchased and/or handled a curling wand (vs. curling iron) and this picture was taken immediately after my first attempt at using this product.</li>
            <li>May take time for newbies to learn but my teen figured it put quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep on trying and will update my review if I can ever learn how to use this and get a decent hairstyle out of it.</li>
            <li>It is a great invention for people with really big and thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The smaller smaller-diameter one makes curls like Taylor swift, while this larger barrel one looks more like</li>
            <li>I also have the smaller version of this and got the larger to create more of a wave vs a curl look.</li>
            <li>However, besides that, this works decently well.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is decent.</li>
            <li>wand REALLY curls my hair, and I have naturally stick straight silky hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
            <li>Many different ways to style your hair with this if held different.</li>
            <li>Many way more expensive then this one,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this wand is not worth $25, I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for a much better wand.</li>
            <li>its so easy to use, with a little bit of practice at first.</li>
            <li>but it curls my hair so much more faster due to the fact that I have super long hair.</li>
            <li>so when my curls lasted all day I was very surprised!</li>
            <li>After trying to hold my hair onto the barrel several times while having very hot fingers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve literally had at least 15 of my friends purchase it after me, because they love my curls!</li>
            <li>The wand definitely gets very hot.</li>
            <li>This larger iron gives looser curls that don&#x27;t hold as long, which is good for a different look.</li>
            <li>the curls looks much better, but I&#x27;m still pretty slow at the whole process.</li>
            <li>With this curling iron, not only do they last all day, but all night, because when I wake up in the morning, they still are distinct and full.</li>
            <li>I kept swapping between putting the glove on the left hand and the right and felt that that step was really cumbersome.</li>
            <li>I have long hair (down to my lower back) and was originally nervous about getting the larger barrel, but it works great.</li>
            <li>&quot; loose curls by curling my hair with this wand, spraying it with L&#x27;Oreal Elnett hairspray and then lightly finger combing or brushing it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much of a barrier between the handle and the super hot part.</li>
            <li>Although it gets super hot which burned my skin to the touch if your careful</li>
            <li>I went with this size barrel since I have longer hair and didn&#x27;t want tightly coiled curls, wanted more of the Kardashian/beachy wavy thing-</li>
            <li>A lot of wands seem to taper way too fast (with long hair, this exacerbates the too much hair too little iron problem), but the shape of this one is nice and seems to make very natural-looking curls.</li>
            <li>, that don&#x27;t take good to styling, it&#x27;s very hard to do anything with them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but this come highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and i highly reccomed this product to women who have course ethinic hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I need to put this on high to get it to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wand.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly suggest that you have a heat resistant pad to set this on during use.</li>
            <li>That means my hair requires a high heat to hold a curl while also straightening out the waves.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My wife likes that his curler provides high heat</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can curl my mom&#x27;s thicker, harder to curl hair at a high temp and curl my fine, damaged hair at a lower temp.</li>
            <li>Once my whole head was done I resprayed my entire head, used my fingers to adjust the curls, then used a dry shampoo at the roots to give it more volume, and a shine spray.</li>
            <li>Took a couple of tries getting use to without burning myself but am fine now and don&#x27;t use the glove.</li>
            <li>Such pretty spirals!</li>
            <li>There is a little more arm yoga involved.</li>
            <li>but I know that once I practice a little more, it will be a lot easier.  </li>
            <li>and they love the little curls but</li>
            <li>I love this little curling iron.</li>
            <li>I use this often and finally have the hang of it, but watch out - this thing gets so hot!  </li>
            <li>FYI, make sure to deep moisturize since ALL hot tools dry your ends!!!</li>
            <li>Wrapping my hair around the barrel was easy when doing the left side of my head, but it was much harder to wrap the hair on the right side (I&#x27;m right-handed).</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out the best way to curl my hair, but I can now curl my long thick hair relatively fast (about 10 minutes) into loose waves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this with just a light spray of the organix coconut water spray and by the end of the day, it relaxes a little but still has really pretty bend &amp;</li>
            <li>easy to use, heats quick, several different temps for different hair types.  </li>
            <li>It curls your hair in seconds good temp  ,a little too thin for my liking get the 1.5  better and wider curls</li>
            <li>It is not too expensive and is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the glove  not being a huge help there really is no way to hold your hair against the barrel to get curled.  </li>
            <li>As I said, I haven&#x27;t used a curler for a veeery long time, and I lack every practice possible, but with this, even on the first try, my hair looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have never really been able to curl my hair with a regular curling iron but this worked very well.</li>
            <li>I also included a comparison picture of my natural straight hair vs my curled hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this product would do a great job, it&#x27;s just difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>and they stay for 3 days in normal conditions</li>
            <li>She has long thick hair, and I have shoulder length thinner hair, and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li>Normally, the morning after I flat-iron style my hair, it is all frizzy with squished curls.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot, once you get into a groove its fast (way faster than straightening actually)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments when I do my hair for work everyday.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a receipt for this item,its not even worth sending back to me because I don&#x27;t have a receipt I will not order any electronics in the mail through Amazon again</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I am normally curling iron challenged.</li>
            <li>As most of the reviews state, it takes a few tried before you get the hang of using a wand versus a spring curling iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair, with no frizz.</li>
            <li>thats normal</li>
            <li>I sprayed my whole head first with Aussie Sprunch spray, then brushed my hair.</li>
            <li>The curls don&#x27;t last as long as if I use my fat iron (turn as you go), but they stay better than if I used a reguar curling iron that does not get to 410 degrees like this does.</li>
            <li>This makes curling my long hair a breeze, and I love the look of the curls I get from the larger barrel.</li>
            <li>but now I use this to curl my hair regularly since the result is totally worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t curl my hair with a normal curling iron to save my life.  </li>
            <li>and they last longer and look more natural than with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>, I have tried this wand on many of my friends and it works well on them- long hair, short hair, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really no different than how you would use a curling iron, just without the clip, so the glove is useful when wrapping your hair around the wand.</li>
            <li>I now was able to curl my thick, straight, chemically treated hair!  </li>
            <li>My hair length at the time was about under arm length, so long enough to have a good curl, but not too long that my arm length would &amp;#34;run out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Many of the good reviews say not to listen to those negative reviews and that the negative people didn&#x27;t take the time to learn how to use the tool</li>
            <li>The learning curve to this product is not hard</li>
            <li>It makes the trial and error part a lot more trial and a lot less error!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t read many other review that mention the major issue I have with this product</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim (actually got the smaller version first, but wasn&#x27;t a fan of the super curly prom queen look).</li>
            <li>product is pretty sturdy - I have had many different types of flat irons by different companies, some $ and some $$$.</li>
            <li>I have always used the curling iron with the clip, but once you practice a few times with this one it really is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>bought this back in September of 2015 and after using it fairly regularly for over a year, it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is great but be careful it only works with 110V not supporting 220V</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product, but the details provided here on Amazon are NOT accurate.</li>
            <li>but for right now it isn’t a big deal.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s very very hot, so you really have to be careful about burning yourself.  </li>
            <li>My sister has super long hair and it curls it all.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and tend to run out of iron before I run out of hair.</li>
            <li>If you are in a rush, take your blow dryer, set it to cool and blow dry then remove clips.</li>
            <li>This wand makes much more loose curls and not so ringlet prom like ones like the smaller one.</li>
            <li>I love wand curling irons and this made big loose curls.</li>
            <li>I get the loose curls I&#x27;ve never been able to do, and they last all day.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised by how cheap it looked when I first opened the box.</li>
            <li>1- 11/2 is a very large wand for regular curls purchase 1/2-1 .</li>
            <li>but this was easy to get down and</li>
            <li>Luckily, i was right there and caught it quickly, or i fear it could have been worse.</li>
            <li>The cord is also cheap compared to my other curling irons and straighteners.</li>
            <li>You end up with pretty big, natural looking waves - even with my stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this wand does work, and it is a good price, so despite these minor, inconvenient things I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It has low to high heat settings so you can choose how hot you want it.</li>
            <li>I live in Australia</li>
            <li>those that are new to styling wands: USE THE GLOVE.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning and getting a new clamp iron instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely wear the glove if you&#x27;re new to this.</li>
            <li>Item was as described in new box etc.</li>
            <li>I truly couldn&#x27;t live without this thing.</li>
            <li>And then trying to get the hair to stay on was a new technique to have to learn.</li>
            <li>If your new to the &#x27;wand&#x27;</li>
            <li>product was labeled new but arrived with no packaging.</li>
            <li>Well, I got new 22inch Remy hair extensions &amp; wanted a curling iron or wand to make the &amp;#34;curls, waves, etc</li>
            <li>Many reviewers said this curling wand really worked, even for those who have a hard time keeping a curl in their hair.</li>
            <li>The tool is not that hard to use (recommend watching a YouTube video for very easy instruction).</li>
            <li>I have a BabyLiss flat iron with rounded edges that also curls hair just as well and with limited space in my bathroom, the fewer products needed, the better.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight and has always been hard to curl, but I have been able to make really nice loose curls with this wand and just a little hairspray.</li>
            <li>This was so easy to use and took me couple of minutes to do almost half of my head.</li>
            <li>If anything, it offers a decent degree of protection, but you still need to pay attention to what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much easier to use and takes a much shorter time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>only thing I would change about it is the pink color :)</li>
            <li>But be careful because if the iron has been on for a while this part can get pretty hot</li>
            <li>so i think this works better on me than my friend who had really thick straight</li>
            <li>I purchased because  so many women said that it even works for thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I love this little wand!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the quick heating and high heat element are not just a positive point but also an easy way for the untrained hand to get burned.  </li>
            <li>You definitely get the loose curling action, which i&#x27;d be satisfied with, if the curls STAYED.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time with this at first, not as easy to use as you would think, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li>my hair is very straight but with this I can finally waves me in the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair just kept slipping right off!</li>
            <li>Maybe if you&#x27;re an experienced hairstylist you can use this, but for an amateur like me, this is WAY too difficult to use and will now hide in my bathroom closet and provoke funny looks from guests searching for more toilet paper.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s clear that this wand does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>My hair usually cant hold curls for more than 2 or 3 hours when using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Seems like it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>This wand has different heat settings and heats up fast!</li>
            <li>The photo attached shows the result of a second day hair after trying the wand for the first time.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it a 4 star, and not a 5, is I feel that the Hot Tool brand heats hair faster.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of all the awesome reviews, but I still can not figure out how to use it :(</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough for my hair to get curled and stay curled all day.</li>
            <li>I could never get the hang of the traditional curling iron with the clamp, I REALLY like this one!</li>
            <li>some complained of burns, I&#x27;m pretty sure you can burn yourself with any hair styling weapon if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>The heat glove definitely helped when I first started learning to use the wand.</li>
            <li>Get the hair separated into small amount group to curl would lead better result.</li>
            <li>Get hot enough to hold the curls.</li>
            <li>Pictures show my hair curled, and then what my hair looked like naturally before!</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>pretty hot(the highest is 410, which is the setting I use), at this temperature the glove immediately heats up, and if you accidentally touch it you only have a second or two to move before it gets too hot.</li>
            <li>I usually turn up the heat by two - to 390 and am able to curl my hair in 3 layers in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I only burnt both ears once</li>
            <li>stylists have been using this idea for many years now, they&#x27;d use ordinary curling irons to wrap hair around, without the clamps.</li>
            <li>I have been using the traditional curling iron with the clip, so at first I was hesitate at trying this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make consistent waves with this, maybe it&#x27;s the different lengths of my hair (some layers)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product since I finally let my hair grow out and wanted big wazy</li>
            <li>My hair DOES NOT curl but this wand got hot enough for my hair to hold a curl all day!</li>
            <li>Its more a flat pink color.</li>
            <li>Very challenging and frustrating at times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious that the majority of them come from people who didn&#x27;t bother to learn how to use a curling wand first.</li>
            <li>Wen I first started using the product I burned myself quite a few times, because I wasn&#x27;t used to wrapping hair around a barrel, I was used to clamping hair to a barrel and rolling, like you do with a regular curling iron; once I got the hang of it though, I started to really like the way these curls came out, more so than the regular curling iron look</li>
            <li>Before this, I&#x27;ve always used my Hot Tools iron without the clamp so switching to the wand was a piece of cake--basically the same thing.</li>
            <li>Any working hot styling appliance will do the same to you.</li>
            <li>This curling iron will take a few tries to get used to, but it produces great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse hair and so crank this up to the highest temperature.  </li>
            <li>I lost my first one and just bought my second one.</li>
            <li>In humid weather, my naturally curly frizzy hair responds so well after being styled with the 1 1/2 inch barrel!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and the digital temp display looks</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite product that I have purchased in the past 5 years, no kidding.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and I don&#x27;t have to leave my hair on it for very long before it produces a curl that will last all day.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and could cause some serious burns so make sure to use the included glove.</li>
            <li>My hair is just past my shoulders, mostly straight with a natural wave and does not hold a curl easily.</li>
            <li>I have super long and thick hair which has never been able to hold a curl even with my straightener, but this wand made it so easy to get the big loose curls I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for younger girls and those who are curious about using a wand - not super expensive but not cheaply made and works great!</li>
            <li>After practicing how to hold it best (pointing up on one side, and down on the other) and getting the timing right (at least ten seconds per strand), it worked well.</li>
            <li>You can make different tightnesses with this iron and you don&#x27;t have to hold it on very long because it heats up so quickly!</li>
            <li>It makes perfect loose curls on her very long and very thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly (wavy), long hair (several inches below my shoulders).</li>
            <li>and I rarely blow dry</li>
            <li>It does takes some time to get use to getting your hair onto the iron, but looking at few youtube tutorial it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The curls last all day, and I have completely gotten rid of my hot rollers.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and thin, therefore my \\&quot;curls\\&quot; never lasted.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up quickly and the temperature can be adjusted but do be careful if not wearing a glove</li>
            <li>wish the iron was a little longer to spread out the curls but its fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m baffled by the numerous positive reviews for this product, which I threw away.  </li>
            <li>- It takes a hot CHI flat iron to get some sort of shape and volume to it.</li>
            <li>After struggling with curling irons and flat irons to create consistent curls, I decided to try a curling wand.</li>
            <li>It is definitely suited better with long hair compared to medium or short hair since this is 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought a flat iron first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually on here to buy the other size as well.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase with confidence, practice and enjoy your new curls!</li>
            <li>I love the wide barrel for my super thick, medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used a different brand with the smaller barrel which creates tighter curls, which are also very pretty</li>
            <li>I have fine, HEAVY hair and within an hour of styling the waves drooped and lost their shape.  </li>
            <li>I do not care for tight curls, I prefer the larger waves to lift my hair and give it some body- from what I saw if you want more defined curls</li>
            <li>The size was quite adequate and i thought that the 410 temp would be hot enough for efficient curls, but didn&#x27;t produce anything more than slight waves which was odd for the amount of time I&#x27;d allowed to pass on each section of hair and the several attempts made.</li>
            <li>The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the large hole that was in my thermal glove.</li>
            <li>so its a little hard to use without the clip but works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bigger sized barrel of this wand is better for big loose spirals or beach waves hair styles.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair, and I tried this with friend who has fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, although the unit has little &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; in the center of the unit but the hot end is heavier so that it tilts onto the hot side, even with the cord hanging onto the floor!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a sharp learning curve regarding how to wrap your hair around it without burning yourself, and how to old it, but once you get it down, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other wands like this though and it is very easy to curl other&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the smaller one first!</li>
            <li>If you use the larger barrel which I have, it takes a little more time and you need longer hair to do it with.</li>
            <li>The bangs slip right off of this barrel because they are not long enough to wrap around the barrel without a clasp on it, which this iron doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, and I&#x27;ve been planning for a while to try to add a little more fun to my everyday look with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had bought the smaller version, but the bigger one works nicely too with a little hairspray or spritzing gel.</li>
            <li>The advantages over this curling wand over getting another CHI flat iron were that it was more affordable, damaged my hair less and had longer-lasting curls.</li>
            <li>also when they get &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34; they still look great, where as with a  curling iron they would look awkward.</li>
            <li>only downside is that the color is light pink and thicker shape</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a glove that clearly stated not to touch the barrel with it because it isn&#x27;t made to be heat proof.</li>
            <li>the style (curly or straight) lasts at least 2 days, they leave my hair so silky &amp; smooth</li>
            <li>Its indicated clearly that the gloves shouldnt be used to let the curler rest on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not meant to touch the wand directly.</li>
            <li>I find the temp adjustment very convenient and the only problem I have with the design is that when I press the power button it doesn&#x27;t power off unless I unplug it.</li>
            <li>I used it on the highest temperature so far, but will experiment.</li>
            <li>The glove will not protect your fingers if you put them directly onto the glove.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; traits about it.</li>
            <li>I did my hair early in the morning and went to an 8 hour shift of work.</li>
            <li>I have never used or owned a curling iron or wand before this one, so I started with this product as a complete novice.</li>
            <li>I think traditional curling irons with clips are much easier to use.</li>
            <li>only problem is that the glove transferred too much heat to my hand.</li>
            <li>Ummm, wow.  </li>
            <li>I bought this curling wand for my daughters last year and they really like it.</li>
            <li>You will burn your hand, even with the glove, if applied directly to the wand.</li>
            <li>Modestly surprised that it works well.</li>
            <li>My hair looks the same, straight.</li>
            <li>It really works, it made the curls to last</li>
            <li>It honestly only took me about 15 min to do my whole head</li>
            <li>that all I can do is straighten my hair and leave it natural.</li>
            <li>no packaging, no invoice, and  was sent directly from amazon.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with quality and performance for the price.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>but it was easier on day old hair.</li>
            <li>stick straight hair instantly.  </li>
            <li>Primarily think that me having trouble with this is my fault.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day since August 2013</li>
            <li>This product was my first ever curling wand, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get one.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my old curling iron because it broke.</li>
            <li>Natural, long-lasting, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long curly hair to begin with</li>
            <li>the next morning I got up and got ready for work and didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it but run my fingers through the waves...</li>
            <li>So my old curling iron is now retired and this is what I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
            <li>I wanted a really natural look rather than the tighter curls created by 1/2&amp;#34; and 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you ever need a passionate Account Executive to sell your product let me know ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but hoping it lasts a while (but for the price, I&#x27;m already glad I got it).</li>
            <li>And with both hands held up, over, or around your head the entire time, it&#x27;s a very tiring experience.</li>
            <li>I much rather prefer the traditional curling iron</li>
            <li>Heats really fast, only drawback is that there&#x27;s no clamp, so you have to use the glove they provide, which can be a hassle esp when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>The glove doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat completely, but again, it just takes some practice.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time, and even with the glove, it is hot work.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot makes big curls and will also make my hair wavy, i really really really really like it</li>
            <li>The wand really isn&#x27;t too different from a curling iron aside from the clamp, so</li>
            <li>After curling one complete side I would again spray with hairspray and leave it.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t  burned my fingers, unlike the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This means that for short hair, you&#x27;re grasping the very tip ends trying to get a wrap around the barrel.  </li>
            <li>youtube videos suggest shaking your hair; some suggest running your fingers through it to loosen the curls but not destroy the definition.</li>
            <li>not for young kids.  </li>
            <li>Before you know it you&#x27;ll be throwing your old irons out and vowing never to use them again</li>
            <li>I have natural wavy hair and have been straightening my hair and wanted to add some waves or curl into it, but this didn&#x27;t do anything to help that matter</li>
            <li>So far</li>
            <li>so far I like...  </li>
            <li>None of the professional brands were getting it done.</li>
            <li>So far no complaints.</li>
            <li>As far as holding my hair, idk.</li>
            <li>but the curls doesnt last too much time</li>
            <li>Your hair looks natural, not overdone</li>
            <li>I might get rid of this version and buy the straight barrel version from the same brand.</li>
            <li>I literarily took it out of the box and used it.</li>
            <li>but my wife only used the glove once because it seemed like it was more trouble than it was worth and not really needed.</li>
            <li>This has been my wife&#x27;s curler of choice since getting it so much so that her daughter borrowed it and will not give it back.</li>
            <li>it really helps especially when you&#x27;re a beginner with the wand.</li>
            <li>I always wanted to do some soft looking wavy curls on my hair.</li>
            <li>I personally dont like the clip and this works really well on my hair,never over-heated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my old fashioned curling iron.</li>
            <li>I might use the GLOVE , to save my flesh but its not totally necessary , Just for shorter pieces really.  </li>
            <li>First off, if you are prone to burning yourself or have short hairs at the nape of your neck that you want to curl, lay a strip of tape across your bare skin at the nape of your neck.</li>
            <li>The product is good but a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li>It appears as though this would be good for someone to use on someone else&#x27;s hair but is difficult to use yourself.</li>
            <li>This thing curls hair within seconds, and literally with the right products, my curls hold for 3 days straight with little to no maintenance.</li>
            <li>There definitely is a learning curve to this product... which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing as a good product doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a great hairdo.  </li>
            <li>When curling the left side of your hair, have the curler in your right hand and use your left hand to wrap.  </li>
            <li>It was way to big and did not curl right because how big it was</li>
            <li>but some time the curls are not the same size depend on how i get the iron and turn it to the left or right.</li>
            <li>The curls stay in place all day long, and I can even sleep on them and wake up only needing a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the smaller barrel of this same curling wand, not realizing there were different sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the curling iron is great for someone who has the manual dexterity to use a glove on one hand and the iron in the other, but I really hate it.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to focus more on your styling than readjusting your iron...but the Cyprus from this larger sized iron is different from the other size...</li>
            <li>Love it...works fantastic...from small curls to beach waves, this wand will do the trick!</li>
            <li>a bit about wands in general for those who are new to them.</li>
            <li>The digital thermometer showing the temperature is really easy to read and adjust up and down.</li>
            <li>I usually re-do them the next morning, but my hair is super fine and long</li>
            <li>She was confused at first no how to use this, but after watching a brief YouTube video, she understands better and has been using this.</li>
            <li>Whenever I did try to curl my hair using a normal curling iron, it would take about 2 hours and a whole lot of hair spray for it to last for only 15 mins.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for those with hair shoulder length and above, however, because the barrel size wouldn&#x27;t allow for very much curling to happen with anything above the shoulders.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very thick curly hair, so I had to straighten my hair first before using this to get the really fabulous shiny waves.</li>
            <li>It gives me really pretty loose curls.</li>
            <li>although it takes time to get used to it specially if you were using the curling irons that comes with a pattern at the beginning you might burn your fingers a little bit.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
            <li>Hair is usually styled straight but once in a while its fun to wave it.  </li>
            <li>If you want tighter/ more defined curls I would recommend the smaller wand.&lt;br /&gt;There is a small stand at the bottom of the wand that allows it to sit on any surface without burning or sliding away.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted this wand , for big waves !</li>
            <li>however, it was pretty much useless for the shorter hair on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only gripes I have about the wand is that it takes a while to heat up and that I saw this exact same product at Walgreens a week or so after I purchased it for a couple bucks CHEAPER.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a top-notch wand, but no magic.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I was using a regular 1-inch curling iron and wrapping the hair around the outside, so the technique of not having a clamp was not difficult to get used to in my case, but it could throw some people off a bit.</li>
            <li>Granted i had to watch an instructional youtube video posted by a teenage girl to figure out how to use this properly, but 5 minutes and two mild burns later i was off and running.</li>
            <li>My only problem is I&#x27;m not very good at styling my own hair in the back</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair in voluminous big curls, if I sleep on them I get loose waves which are also very pretty.</li>
            <li>you spend a little extra time using a curling wand with the glove, you can produce amazing results in the same amount of time as a traditional iron.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, very long hair and the outcome was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>other reviewers cover the details here, so I don&#x27;t want to repeat a lot, but I think that if you&#x27;ve got fairly long hair, i.e., shoulder or longer, and it&#x27;s not baby fine, it should work for you.</li>
            <li>And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the temp control buttons sit right where your fingers go while styling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this especially at this price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough protection from the high heat.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this, my old curling iron was very old and hardly working anymore.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, very curly and very frizzy hair-no other curling iron has been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls even after a curling iron or mousse/hairspray</li>
            <li>My soft wavy curl can last me the whole day without adding extra hairspray.</li>
            <li>It makes normal sized curls and at the tip, smaller sized ones.</li>
            <li>It does get hot and it does burn so be careful.  </li>
            <li>I find the flat iron produces the exact same look.</li>
            <li>It certainly is a nice hair curler, but performed no better than any other device.</li>
            <li>I grew up using a straightening iron on my thick, coarse, naturally frizzy hair, and I&#x27;m so glad I made a change and ordered this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair (mid back length) and the bigger barrel seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>No problems, strong 2-day long curls, super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was probably an issue with rough shipping and handling, as my package was actually shipped in a box way too large for the small curlers box.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think sence the curler is so big you can use big sections of hair but for me I can&#x27;t use big sections or it does not look right .</li>
            <li>It can be a little awkward to use, but once you figure out how to angle it, it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use (not that hard to burn your finger</li>
            <li>I tried this beauty appliance on my daughter&#x27;s hair, because my own hair is rather thin, and she has a lovely crown of long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I love the loose beautiful curls this makes, hate that it is tapered which makes it a challenge to keep your hair from sliding down the barrel, it makes you nearly run out of curling iron to wrap your hair.</li>
            <li>Now, although my old one still works (holy cow!), I have also bought the fatter one now that my hair is down to my butt..for more voluptuous curls.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take long to girl, quickly wrap my hair around it and let it loose.</li>
            <li>I usually have to use very little hairspray because the curl is so good on it.  </li>
            <li>Very cool but in the first couple of times was difficult to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I cannot unfairly rate this, it could be me and it does give me big beautiful loose curls after I&#x27;m done styling..</li>
            <li>Definitely jump on YouTube and watch some instructional videos if wands are new to you.</li>
            <li>I had been in the market for a new curling iron and was wanting to try a clampless iron, such as a curling wand.</li>
            <li>You can only use this wand if you live in the US or you have a voltage convertor, because this wand uses the 110 volt system here in The Netherlands we use 220 volt system.</li>
            <li>If you want huge bouncy curls that can last up to almost 2 days, heavy hair or even the lightest-</li>
            <li>, one complaint is that it easily gets that burnt smell on it that stays on the iron and transfers to your hair every time you curl it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up really fast and the various temperature settings convenient, along with the digital display.</li>
            <li>fun to use on long long hair.</li>
            <li>completely amazed that something has actually worked on my hair to curl it, just when I almost gave up completely...</li>
            <li>She has given up on her old curling irons completely and loves how the curls stay in longer than her traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li>La really think it is because one must know how to use either use some product to make waves prior to last you longer</li>
            <li>First off, the wand is slippery and your hair will not stay on it even long enough to be wound up.</li>
            <li>You need hair that is at least shoulder-length to be able to actually curl your hair.</li>
            <li>Long spiral waves are pretty on a teenage girl.</li>
            <li>This is first curling iron I&#x27;ve used that gives my hair long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>Overall I really recommend this product especially if you want beach waves.</li>
            <li>It definitely takes a lot longer since you can only use so much hair at a time.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks when I use this tool, and it takes me only 20 min to do my hair (shoulder length, thick, curly/frizzy).</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair, and before this curling wand, I wasn&#x27;t able to keep curls in my hair even with a massive amount of gel, hairspray and whatever else you can use to make your hair look like it was glued onto your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few quick videos online can help the learning process.  </li>
            <li>curls my hair nicely, but may be harder for shorter than shoulder length hair since it&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
            <li>Tried to keep at it and endure, but each session was just more and more annoying.</li>
            <li>It heated quickly and there are quite a few settings.</li>
            <li>I bought the 1&amp;#34; - 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling wand, as I am not a fan of small, tight curls, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Hold wand with right hand pointy side down and wrap hair away from face.  </li>
            <li>I have very long and thick hair and this wand gives me the big, glamorous waves I love!</li>
            <li>I had to unplug it and let it cool down because there was burnt carpet residue left on the wand&#x27;s barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I even bought one for my sister &#x27;cause her hair is even thicker and longer than mine and it curled it like no other</li>
            <li>So normally I don&#x27;t believe all of the hype when it comes to beauty products, especially hair tools and products because it seems that so many just don&#x27;t work for me, but I wanted to try this as I was tired of those Shirley Temple like curls...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems getting curls to stay with my long, thick and heavy hair but this curling iron works great.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair goes flat within an hour.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;m not exactly the most hair-savvy person on the planet and have enough trouble with regular curling irons.</li>
            <li>loose curls+no staying power&#x3D; STRAIGHT HAIR.</li>
            <li>My hair is very hard to curl and even more so for the curls to stay.</li>
            <li>This is good for those with long, or very thick hair that usually have difficulty getting curls, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Definitely use the included glove if you&#x27;re new to the curling game - you can feel the heat through the glove if you&#x27;re holding your hair in place for more than ~5 seconds.</li>
            <li>So, I would say too much effort for no particular advantage, and this thing has sat in the drawer for a month now, unused and unloved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with straight, flat hair and I curl my hair a LOT.</li>
            <li>and you want it still long but with curl, flat iron first section by your shoulders then curl the rest.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy thick hair to begin with, but this wand produces a much more polished look than if I were to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>Works well on fine but thick type 2b hair.</li>
            <li>make sure you are very careful, I have burned my hand a few times.</li>
            <li>Not cool for somebody who has a lifetime of holding styling tools in their right hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not new to using curling products, this iron is just cheaply made and feels like it will fall apart in less than a year of use.</li>
            <li>The highlights: she suggested parting your hair into a low, middle and high level.</li>
            <li>With this is the same it depend on how you curl the hair around and how high or low you start.</li>
            <li>It does give u a nice curl, however, the hair kinda sticks to the barrel (without any product in hair) and its hard to slide the hair down the barrel to curl it.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair (between shoulder blades and waist length) that has a very slight wave.  </li>
            <li>I leave the bottom layers alone and usually just use some curl activator or mousse depending on what I have on hand and how much time I have to get ready.</li>
            <li>My first attempt I did use the glove, and I&#x27;m glad because the wand is really awkward to use when you&#x27;re not used to it, and I probably would have burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gives long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>I still use my old, standard run of the mill iron.</li>
            <li>And the only time my hair stays curled is when I have my salon lady curl it professionally.</li>
            <li>Like anything else, it took some time to learn how to use it properly, but I ended up giving away my curling iron because it was completely replaced by this wand.</li>
            <li>just be careful and you can go twice as fast and was alot easier.</li>
            <li>Despite using hair product and setting the wand to 410, the initial result was soft curls, and in some sections just waves-</li>
            <li>I finally got the soft, beach waves in my hair that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely really girly as it has a pearly pink ceramic wand.</li>
            <li>then my old wand that has a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li>It curls your have and 2 hours later it drops completely.</li>
            <li>Putting on a glove and winding the hair around a hot cylinder is not really very much fun.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a low price product that works at a professional level, this is it.</li>
            <li>but after an hour or two of being outside my hair completely drops..</li>
            <li>Yes, the gloves aren&#x27;t completely heat proof, but then you wouldn&#x27;t have the necessary dexterity.</li>
            <li>I have human hair extensions and the Remington styler made my fake (and real) hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Up until now, I had only used a blow dryer as far as heat tools</li>
            <li>When I purchased the small one first, five years ago, my hair was short and straight.</li>
            <li>but you just have to be careful haha)</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical but</li>
            <li>was kind of difficult to get used to handle it without burning my fingers even though&lt;</li>
            <li>I was tired of using the curling irons where you clip your hair inside the barrel (no clue how to better explain that), so I thought I would try out this one.</li>
            <li>so I was kind of skeptical about it.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t use product in her hair as it usually weighs it down even more, and she plans on sticking with the old school clip style curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These multiple size barrels are great, they can change up the curls and waves nicely and make a more natural look, but because the barrel gets smaller on the way down, it does mean if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it can be frustrating and difficult to keep your hair even on it, without slipping....</li>
            <li>At first when I used it, the heat was moving up and down because I kept pressing it with my finger.</li>
            <li>I have weird Mediterranean hair, its wavy on top really frizzy and super curly on the bottom; when I try to straighten it with my Chi it takes me at least an hour.</li>
            <li>As far as use, I think I still prefer a curling iron over a wand as this can be hard to hold while making sure you aren&#x27;t burning your other hand that&#x27;s holding onto your hair tip.</li>
            <li>I ordered the wand in the size 1&amp;#34;-1 1/2&amp;#34; because I wanted to get a looser curl, not tight ringlets like the smaller model gives you.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast,  curls my frizzy dry hair into shiny slick bouncy curl that last even in south florida.  </li>
            <li>but I have fine hair and am afraid to get it too hot!</li>
            <li>It may take a few times to get used to using a wand and turing your hair the right way</li>
            <li>but it gives long lasting curls to my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and the lack of a clip makes this tool slightly precarious.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with hot irons on my carpet, but this one burned it in less than five minutes while I did my make up.</li>
            <li>However, the wand is much easier to use to achieve loose waves and to avoid an indent from the clasp of a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my sister picked up this styling wand a while back, and I noticed right away from the shape of her curls that it was different than other irons.  </li>
            <li>The glove that comes with it is more like a regular mitten for cold weather and doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat very much.</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds, even the spin your hair into a curl and it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li>But, remington is still my fav due to the ease of temp control and how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>The coating on the wand provides a buffer so her hair does not burn as fast as on other curlers.</li>
            <li>Do be careful not to burn yourself if it&#x27;s your first time using one, though - especially tips of the fingers and back of the neck.</li>
            <li>My curls last for ever and aren&#x27;t to tight right after i curl them.  </li>
            <li>Its the only thing that has ever been able to curl my thick long hair; would defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li>only complaint is that sometimes my hair doesn&#x27;t fit on it.  </li>
            <li>As has been noted, it takes a few uses to get used to the grip of the wand: you really want to keep it nearly inverted.</li>
            <li>The only thing that annoys me is when I wrap a piece of hair around the barrel, it tries to slide to the very tip because of the conic shape.</li>
            <li>wand does not dry out your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I burned my ear a little bit the first time)</li>
            <li>Using this iron can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky at first</li>
            <li>but when my boyfriend&#x27;s sister curled my hair with hers (and a little hairspray) and the curls held pretty well.</li>
            <li>* Work from back to front in each half section (left &amp; right side)</li>
            <li>The barrel was too large, even though I have long hair and was looking for loose curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight but most of the weight is concentrated at the pink part that it&#x27;s rather difficult to control.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that I&#x27;m not experienced enough on how to make a \\&quot;style\\&quot; happen with it - but that will come with practice, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>As suggested, I watched a few online tutorials to get the gist of wand curling techniques before my first use</li>
            <li>I had to buy another one because I killed mine in China with the voltage being much higher than here.</li>
            <li>and I burned myself a few times a first, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>You have to wrap the hair TIGHTLY around the wand (with your gloved hand), with the wand facing down to get the best curl and hold it there for at least 5 seconds, if not more, depending on your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take some getting used to, as my hair wants to slide down to the slimmer end.</li>
            <li>I got it down and my whole head curled in under 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought the straight barrel version that is one width all the way down the shaft.</li>
            <li>The glove is not thick enough and also doesn&#x27;t cover your wrist sufficiently - when you&#x27;re wrapping your hair around the wand your bare wrist and forearm are exposed and always dangerously close to touching that +400F wand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asian and have extremely long, straight hair, getting the right size curls &amp; keeping those curls are hard for me to find as I have tried everything from steam rollers to flat irons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never mastered the curling iron, and for a serious plain Jane like me, I can actually use this thing and I love it!</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I got big, bouncy curls that STAYED - and with a little bit of hairspray, they stayed for a LONG time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other curling irons and the curls don&#x27;t last, with this curling iron curls last much longer.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that when you&#x27;re holding the handle, your hands are right on the power and temperature buttons, and I frequently turn it off or change temperatures when I don&#x27;t mean to.</li>
            <li>The pink color was discontinued, so I ordered a like new one off Amazon.</li>
            <li>I began researching for a wand (clamp-free) iron, and stumbled upon this Remington model that was highly rated by other Amazon reviewers.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast; less than a minute.  </li>
            <li>It was all black and didn&#x27;t match the photo, but I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with that.</li>
            <li>Oh and the gloves aren&#x27;t really heat gloves, they&#x27;re just black mittens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super clumsy so probably not compatible with this apparatus.</li>
            <li>Now that my hair is just a few inches longer, just past shoulder length, it works much better.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly,  don&#x27;t damage my delicate hair,</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t need to use a hair dryer to loosen these curls, but i did find that slipping the curl off the wand and holding it in my hand to cool for a few seconds radically improved the quality of the curl.</li>
            <li>It heats up to high 400 degree temps just like the other but creates larger curls.  </li>
            <li>In the end, the wand delivered on its promise of loose, natural looking curls without the clamp marks.</li>
            <li>somedays limp and somedays just phenomenally smooth and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and traditional curling irons never worked for me.</li>
            <li>Also, the glove has no special properties, so it does absolutely nothing to prevent being burn.</li>
            <li>my hair is thin, fine, and</li>
            <li>I have somewhat thin and fine hair that falls just below my shoulders, for reference.</li>
            <li>If you have fine or thin hair and you wrap your hair around the  barrel</li>
            <li>Even though my hair is super thick (I divide it into about ten sections and curl), it only takes 12-15 minutes to get lots of volume and style!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting it, especially for the price, compared to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little hard to manipulate, but with the included glove it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I really like them both, but like this larger one just a tiny bit less than the smaller one.</li>
            <li>it is very heavy and tends to weigh down, so curls tend to flatten easily.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I&#x27;m just new to curling my hair and other people don&#x27;t have any problem or need any advice.</li>
            <li>We initially believed the curling wand to be broken, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>I hold the wand upside down (tapered end down) at a slight angle, more towards horizontal.</li>
            <li>have very straight blonde hair and can&#x27;t usually hold a curl.</li>

            <li> Still getting used to the way it works but the varying temperature control and shape make my hair look great when I curl it.  </li>
            <li> the result is great.</li>
            <li> I wanted an affordable and great curling wand for the beach waves look.</li>

            <li> Great product.  </li>

            <li> if I had any successful result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is more than one way to get the effect, though, and I don&#x27;t think this is the best way.  </li>
            <li> i wish they would explain more as to what temperature works best for this type of curl and etc.</li>
            <li> not the best, but works okay</li>
            <li> If they solved that and included a better quality glove, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Good curling wand for the a great price.</li>
            <li> Fair price and great quality.</li>
            <li> I have bought this curling wand for gifts as well, since it worked so great on my hair, and the receivers loved it as well.</li>
            <li> The size of the barrel is great and the fact that you can  turn the thing on and off without having to unplug it are  good too.  </li>
            <li> Makes the best curls I&#x27;ve ever been able to make in my hair</li>

            <li> Nice price, good product!</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, curls superbly and eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> If you saw videos on YouTube about this product and see how wonderful curls the girls get, remember is not that easy, you have to practice a lot with this.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; , very easy to use &amp; the curls are fabulousness ( and no kink at the end from the clamp!)  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li> If youre the kind of girl who can curl her hair, then I&#x27;m sure this is the best thing in the world.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The skinnier wand gives you undoubtedly gorgeous think Taylor Swift like curls.</li>
            <li> as described good product</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, this is a good quality curling wand.</li>
            <li> I loved the results, then did some research and found the wider barrel.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I loved the way it makes my hair and will use this when I want that darling bounce that the Pearl Wand gives me.</li>
            <li> This makes gorgeous waves that HOLD.  </li>
            <li> gave it three stars because the iron itself is good quality.</li>
            <li> It just requires us to hold the on button for a good 20 seconds or so before it will start.</li>
            <li> It works so good.</li>
            <li> This product had good reviews</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It works well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I loved it</li>
            <li> but it curls good</li>
            <li> a good buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wond.</li>
            <li> The recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> I got it from reading how good the reviews are .</li>
            <li> But if you are happy with clamp-style irons, I see no reason to switch to this kind.</li>
            <li> good value; comes with a glove to prevent burning  ones fingers</li>
            <li> my friend had this curler, I absolutely loved it  and used it every time I was at her place.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job</li>
            <li> Just as good as the $200 ones you see in the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> This looks like it would be a good product.</li>
            <li> But the product is still a good deal.</li>
            <li> good product good quality care recommended</li>
            <li> I Would recommend, good buy for the money</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my sister loved it.  </li>
            <li> But would never return it because of how good my hair looks.</li>
            <li> so what i do is use a product that is heat protecter and smells good as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good affordable wand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some items that I feel are good and spared this review a 1 star.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is, you don&#x27;t end up with a crimp in your hair from clipping it on the barrel.</li>
            <li> , glove is good too.</li>
            <li> Appears to achieve all that she needs it too and the results look good.</li>
            <li> Also good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This curling wand seemed good quality and did the job, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good curls.</li>
            <li> it comes in handy, the glove is great</li>
            <li> surprisingly it worked wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> hope this help someone save some $$. &amp; choose a good product..</li>
            <li> ~someone save some $$. &amp; choose a good product..</li>

            <li> It gets HOT!!!!</li>
            <li> note - it is very light, so good for travel.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and it does great curls.</li>
            <li> There is certainly a learning curve with figuring out how to best style the curls and how to hold it when you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing...</li>
            <li> and i am dying, my curls are amazing</li>

            <li> as well - these curling wands are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well and does not damage my hair, but I haven&#x27;t had a brand name curling iron like Chi or NuMe</li>
            <li> The wand works amazing.</li>
            <li> The 1\\&quot; works amazing too.</li>
            <li> It turns out really nice.    </li>
            <li> It takes longer to heat up compared to some curling irons I own.</li>
            <li> All of mine came with gloves, which I never use because you need to be able to have a good hold on your hair to get the look you want.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple video tutorials before using it, and it really does work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The glove is nice while you are getting used to the wand.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful make the hairline in a very magnificence ..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burned, per se, but way to warm for comfort.</li>
            <li> It heats very well and gives great curls!</li>
            <li> Gives nice curls.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gives me beautiful curls!!!</li>
            <li> and you will be thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> What kind of wizard do you have to be to use this thing?  </li>
            <li> The included heat protectant glove is nice if you&#x27;re worried about burning your fingers, which I was.</li>
            <li> I bought this curler because I had used a friend&#x27;s wand and wanted one of my own.</li>
            <li> I honestly find it easier to not use the glove...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice that it has an automatic timed turn off</li>
            <li> and I did my own hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I could just skip the star rating on this one because I feel like it gets a 1 star in terms of how effective I am at using it, but would probably get 4-5 stars if I were more talented.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, but when my sister used this on my hair, the curls stayed in beautifully for hours!</li>
            <li> The ceramic coating is really nice as well.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- nice surface, not sticking</li>
            <li> The glove is also handy.</li>
            <li> The curls come out nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what everybody is complaining about, though everyone has their own opinions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives you nice glossy bouncy curls without having to use a ton of products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to come so fast, I was very happy about that.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> nice isn&#x27;t the reason I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I never knew that I could do my own hair this way.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for those that like to do their own hair.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I JUST GOT MY OWN ONE BEFORE THREE DAYS</li>
            <li> All in all, a nice tool.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES NICE CURLS.</li>
            <li> it comes with a nice glove as well.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my every dasy go-to curling wand, but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> my hair does look nice after and ppl compliment my toussled look but achieving the look is not effortless.  </li>
            <li> Her hair hold curl better than mine, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me, but I was so happy when it did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the heat resistant glove as it allows me to focus on getting the curls to look great instead of worrying if I&#x27;m about to burn my fingers!</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m sure an experienced hair stylist will be able to use it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> the design is nice and sleek looking, but I&#x27;d have bought a straightener for the results I got.</li>
            <li> do a spectacular curly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> is just perfect and recommend for others to purchase very affordable</li>
            <li> It does give me nicely sized curls</li>
            <li> I can now get nice curls always when using this.  </li>
            <li> Also shuts off automatically which is nice</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to holding it the correct way to get your hair curled, but the result is nice.</li>

            <li> Remington is my favorite wand of choice.  </li>
            <li> However this iron did not hold my curls and I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve burnt the tips of my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> your hair gonna be fabulous!</li>
            <li> Now use logic and realize that the more slip and smoothness of the wand, the better for your hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE...</li>
            <li> I love the shape it gives because it tapers.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I do my hair with this wand.</li>
            <li> I love this wand.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>

            <li> Fairly pleased with this wand...</li>

            <li> Alot more in the stores.</li>
            <li> love the curls this makes, and they stay all day.</li>
            <li> It does protect your hand from burns when used placed on top of hair wrapped around the wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product and its results.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I just got highlights in my brown hair and wanted something to add more curl and dimension without giving shirley temple curls.  </li>
            <li> I found so many people chose this</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this since like everyone else</li>
            <li> more than 1 minute- literally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However I can say that I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a better stand to sit on the counter</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to to switch from a curling iron to a wand, but I&#x27;m figuring it out, and I love the quality of the curls.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the larger wand, and it was a great decision!</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the fact that you can change the temperature.</li>
            <li> Hopefully amazon or the seller is able to work with me on getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love this wand.  </li>
            <li> I think the bigger barrel works best for longer length hair.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This wand worked a lot better than the nume.</li>
            <li> This clipless curling iron works way better than it should at that price.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ended up on Amazon purchasing it :)  </li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this</li>
            <li> This seemed an ok quality.</li>
            <li> but it ends up making my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li> We both love using it.</li>
            <li> I love this wand...</li>
            <li> and I love that there is a temperature option.</li>
            <li> You can also find more instructions on Youtube.</li>
            <li> i love this tool it is quite functional and affordable.</li>
            <li> Works so well, lasts all day, and my hair feels so smooth after!</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> so watch your ears :)</li>
            <li> You have to use one hand to wrap the hair around the barrel, so your ends won&#x27;t be touching it and getting damaged.</li>
            <li> My Con air wand is a lot better than this one.</li>
            <li> I need to practice more</li>
            <li> Most curling irons I have to hold for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was more heat resistant.</li>
            <li> With most curlers you get one that keeps the metal</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> I love this wand.</li>
            <li> I love that it has an automatic timer in case you leave it on by mistake.</li>
            <li> I really love the curls and volume it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling wand</li>
            <li> but i have to because i love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it curls ok.</li>
            <li> The material of the handle is OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better before</li>
            <li> then i tried my housemate&#x27;s curling wand and FELL IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> its better than my $50 nume hair wand.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I truly love using this wand.</li>
            <li> But when it is deployed post-blow out, it does create lovely beachy waves.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t know well how to do it , I keep trying on my hair and every time I do , it looks better :)</li>
            <li> But I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> Just like the box says it is more of a salon iron curler</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how perfect this wand is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a go.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with having both because I have two daughters</li>
            <li> After watching a couple tutorials I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll prefect the technique</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I was able to wrap around the barrel</li>
            <li> This wand works great but really takes a lot of practice to get the curls the way you want them.  </li>
            <li> Love this curler others would no heat like it.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I had longer hair it would have been better.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself shortly after I saw how wonderful this curling wand was</li>
            <li> and (okay here is where I start sounding like an infomercial)</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of a clipless curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I also love the temperature range on it.</li>
            <li> The big barrel is perfect.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Much better than many brand names.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My sister and I absolutely love this Curling Wand.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more from this brand.</li>
            <li> found that compared to the Jose Eber irons, this one also produced better, longer-lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after doing so many research on curling wand, i decided to get this one.</li>
            <li> I tend to heat the wand, put on some makeup, curl some hair, put on more makeup, curl some more, get dresses, curl some more, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the thing.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I read tons of reviews and watched many video tutorials online.  </li>
            <li> a wand definitely is better than using that approach).</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this - she got it for her 15th b-day.</li>
            <li> I Love ittttttttttttttttttttttt, but I want to buy more than 3</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I have seen and used so many brands and for about under $25 you can not beat it.  </li>
            <li> :) I also recommend getting the 1-1 1/2 inch if you have longer hair and the 1/2-1 inch if you have shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li> so the skinny end was at the top</li>
            <li> but then my hair just slid up to the top.</li>
            <li> so I can do waves more often.</li>
            <li> But I will have to keep working with it to find more consistency in waves and hopefully get faster with it.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> but this thing is so simple and awesome!</li>
            <li> Glad they included the glove.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> But I find that the hotter it is, the more defined the curls,</li>
            <li> Most of the time it looks so messed up</li>
            <li> I have many of them but for some reason this just isn&#x27;t a look for me .</li>
            <li> For me, that adds even more frustration to an already maddening situation.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my hair a lot more often now.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - it worked great for me, not so much for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and they love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Thank you a lot :)</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my hair.</li>
            <li> But love the product itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the heat-resistant glove that it comes with is so crappy and cheap!</li>
            <li> The gradient spiral effect is interesting in theory -  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments when I curl my hair with this wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this size</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WAND</li>
            <li> JUST LOVE THIS IRON AND PRICE.</li>
            <li> Such a good wand!!</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> Best wand for big bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> Got here two days after purchased and fell in love after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to always wear the glove that comes with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not so sure in which direction i&#x27;m supposed to curl my hair...</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this curling wand; there&#x27;s no need to pay a ton of money for fancy wands when this one does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> But for me, it was just okay.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a splendid product!</li>
            <li> The more hair you curl at a time, the looser your curls, so you can do tighter or looser ones depending on the look</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to being able to watch TV or whatever with curling/straight irons.</li>
            <li> My favorite ones came from monicasocal on Youtube; her video is named \\&quot;Beachy curls/waves using Remington curling wand\\</li>
            <li> If you exclude this factor it does the job perfectly and takes only minutes to heat up.</li>
            <li> curled better than anything i have used.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> I now know that I&#x27;m better off with a barrel that is all one width.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been able to hold curl.  </li>
            <li> This is my go-to styling wand, and I get so many compliments on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My ceramic straightner does better curls than this thing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this once, as I have been straightening my hair, but it was great!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this</li>
            <li> so many styles of waves/</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand</li>
            <li> I love the curls it produces, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love this curing iron.</li>
            <li> Either that or I need to look into how to better use this curler.  </li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> the 1in is so much better</li>
            <li> more like waves and I like that.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, but</li>
            <li> this is what u get OK ,  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li> This is more of a wave...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed and ended up buying a smaller one.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, and i now love my hair even more</li>
            <li> great, high heat holds the curls!</li>
            <li> Her hair looks adorable :)</li>
            <li> She gets just the curls she loves and uses it most every day</li>
            <li> I think that if they have a smaller barrel version, you&#x27;d be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Light weight is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary</li>
            <li> to many of the reviews, my curls do NOT stay overnight</li>
            <li> I twist my hair and clip it on top of my head</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ok to accidentally press buttons while you hold the wand&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand, it curls my hair the way I like</li>
            <li> but I think it turned out pretty nice!</li>
            <li> Overall awesome product :)</li>
            <li> so love love the way the curls stay the wand</li>
            <li> and I fell completely in love with it</li>
            <li> work well for someone who has more time and easier hair to style</li>
            <li> just got mine today and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> Love my curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought sure that there must be some technique</li>
            <li> Really Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> My best friend had this in a smaller size.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and people ask me what I used to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I probably should have gotten the smaller size, but this one works great too!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this wand and have recommended it to a lot of friends.</li>
            <li> but I cried more when they were all out of stock.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> nothing held my curls together, but something about this did the magic.</li>
            <li> so make sure you wear the glove that comes included.</li>
            <li> you get better at it.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> It does come with a glove but it ends up causing static when I used it.</li>
            <li> But it does make big beautiful curls when you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this &amp; wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if I didn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> so I can tousle them but still have them stay more intact.</li>
            <li> My hair is still shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I definitely love Remington products.  </li>
            <li> No complaints :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> i love it and</li>
            <li> I have tons of burn marks now, so make sure to buy a longer heat-resistant glove (and use it)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the curler -- it makes my hair look better than it ever has before.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this wand - got it quickly from Best Rx.</li>
            <li> It was a good idea to be able to lock the buttons because they are right when your hand grips.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and great addition to any woman&#x27;s hot tool collection.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy way to get beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> The shipping is very fast and very good service Absolutely recommend it to all !!</li>
            <li> The lower temperatures are just right, though.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> in all, this wand is a great deal and perfect for someone looking for decent quality at a low price.</li>
            <li> for the price, it really doesn&#x27;t get better than this!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> but my hair comes out flawless soft kink-free and beautiful everytime - if I use hair spray the curls will last the days.</li>
            <li> kind of fun!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> she was so happy and excited and started making curls right away.</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up very fast, handle is comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> Insta Wave which has pretty much has no learning curve and got perfect waves in about seven minutes.</li>
            <li> but once I had experience, I got great curls and was able to do my whole head very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and enjoy the structure of the curler.</li>
            <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job of being heat resistant and despite the high quality of the wand, I still have to hold my hair there for about 40 seconds for it to make any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I am kind of new to curlers so it might just be me not know how to use it correctly for a good curl.</li>
            <li> The curling wand perfectly suits my needs, leaving me with quickly flipped and completely dentless</li>
            <li> but I had a full head of curls in under 30min which is amazing</li>
            <li> If I want to have a nice full curl on my bang</li>
            <li> It gave me nice curls in 30 minutes to do my full head.</li>
            <li> and I think it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a pretty good wand.</li>
            <li> I think this would work best on long hair though.</li>
            <li> Frankly, her hair looks beautiful whatever you do to it, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised it turned out well with this device.</li>
            <li> and this one was pretty well reviewed and for a good price.</li>
            <li> Also, Bethany Mota, a youtuber beauty guru who&#x27;s so sweet, has 7 million subscribers her own perfume, clothing line, bedroom line and will be appearing on dancing with the stars (or so I heard) has recommend this wand over and over.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a good wand that gives you loose beach waves and a great price</li>
            <li> this is a very good curling wand it heats up fast and gives big bouncy curls love it ! !</li>
            <li> this is a must buy, worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> I am so excited!</li>
            <li> Friends have complimented my &amp;#34; new hair cut&amp;#34;  and noticed my hair looking great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes a minute to get the hang of it, but it produces quick curls that look amazing.  </li>
            <li> I Love this it heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> and I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> This product is well made, heats quickly and makes nice waves.  </li>
            <li> My roommate borrowed mine and liked it so much that she got her own.</li>
            <li> Good price, great product, pink</li>
            <li> But as experienced as I am in doing my own hair for years with a wand, I still inevitably burn myself every once in a while...</li>
            <li> I used it, it made nice soft wavy curls and and the curls stayed really good for 2 hours without any spray</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO AWESOME FOR LOOSE CURLS.....</li>
            <li> It gave me perfect bouncy loose curls in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> the very cheap and light weight glove does not protect your hand from burns.</li>
            <li> Now, I am no hair styling expert, in fact I am very far from it, but my hair looked PERFECT the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length, and fine, and gave me a cute easy-curl bob.</li>
            <li> i did it a couple of times with the glove and within 20 minutes i was able to wrap it fine without the glove on</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and am able to get the results I want on a lower heat setting than the max.</li>
            <li> and im sure its fine.</li>
            <li> Love it, and it&#x27;s super easy to use!</li>
            <li> This beautiful wand gives my hair those really amazing loose curls.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair is very good at taking a curl, and this did a good job of putting in a curl, but heck</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the glove because it gets very hot!</li>
            <li> But make sure to adjust your  heat settings as the wand can get very hot and damage your hair!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for making loose curls or beach waves!</li>
            <li> the curls are nice and full and they lasted all night on my super fine hair!</li>
            <li> Price is cheap but could be better in quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the old curling iron I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> It can make my hair look great with soft curls.</li>
            <li> Great product for some natural looking waves.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair as well as my 4 year old twin girls.</li>
            <li> i was surprised and extremely happy.</li>
            <li> These are great for natural, beachy waves for your hair.</li>
            <li> Rounded edges might have been a better design idea or anything that would make a smooth transition instead of having something your hair can catch on.</li>
            <li> This is the best fourteen dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> Im surprised at the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it and enjoy using it to style hair.</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful curls this does without the &#x27;line&#x27; that a standard curling iron can have.</li>
            <li> There is also a temperature control so you can decide how much heat is good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1-1.5 inches one as a gift for my friend because she loved mines so much.</li>
            <li> Look wise, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and gets heated quickly.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to learn how to use just by watching a quick YouTube video.</li>
            <li> it heats up super fast, and the swivel cord is a great feature to keep it from getting tangled while you curl.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, and it is curly but the hair curler makes my hair have super nice waves you know like those beach waves that are super cute?</li>
            <li> so this barrel size works great to get nice loose curls in my hair and the tapered barrel</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a good product for this price!</li>
            <li> This wand is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and easy to use!  </li>
            <li> I almost bought the conair wand, but I heard the Remington was better and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I put on the glove and started experimenting and picked up on how to use it very quickly.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quickly and looked like new.i</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the glove anymore because it is just so easy to do</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars because have not perfected how to use this yet, not as easy as I thought so I&#x27;m hoping with practice, it will be easier &amp; curls will come out nicer...</li>
            <li> sometimes when you forget to wear the glove/bring the glove when you are traveling it burns your finger easily..</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> This particular iron heats up quickly and produces any size wave you need, which is great for shorter strands of hair, bangs or just a variety of hairstyles.</li>
            <li> The barrel heats well and delivers a marvelous curl once one gets the hang of it, but it seems a bit of talent with a regular curling iron would be just as useful.</li>
            <li> But you should mind the heat because you will get burned easily too.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The wand heats up very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It heats up VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use -</li>
            <li> So, in short, this curling wand is great, but it takes a lot of practice to learn how to use it on yourself and works a lot better if you have someone else curl your hair with it.</li>
            <li> its easy to use</li>
            <li> I love this wand, it is great that it comes with a glove, however I don&#x27;t use the glove.&lt;br /&gt;The only things that I do not like about this wand are that where the buttons are I tend to press them with my thumb when I am curling.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is easy to use..  </li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t pick it up and think it&#x27;s going to be easy.  </li>
            <li> Once you practice getting used to using the wand, it gets really easy.</li>
            <li> but then it was easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, watch a youtube tutorial before using it.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and take no time at all to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes it very quick and easy to do your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and your curls stay in all day.</li>
            <li> The tapered end at the bottom lets you have tighter, bouncier curls at the bottom and allows you to easily make a curly beach look by brushing them through with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Very Quick shipment .</li>
            <li> I am a first-time hair curler buyer/user and this thing is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wish all these hair appliance product print voltage use or non/dual voltage or worldwide voltage on the package so customer will find out easily</li>
            <li> easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I would easily fork over $150.00.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t burn my self as easily</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy styling</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of using a wand, it is very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Using this curling iron is not as easy as you think.</li>
            <li> Easy to do yet</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> At this point, this takes me longer than the flat iron to create waves, but when I get a good wave, I love the shape of it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 1 year already and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and gets very hot which I love, I just haven&#x27;t been able to learn how to do more than one style of curl</li>
            <li> And for best looking results, use left hand to curl right side of head, pointing narrowest part towards shoulder of ground and wrap hair in direction away from face.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get the right size option to fit your needs!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes beautiful big waves.</li>
            <li> This is best for super long hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and evenly, and it&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li> This tool provides nice waves for my very straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and after about two hours my hair would lose its clues - NOT WITH THIS iron which actually keeps my hair with beautiful curly waves for three day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times, always hoping it will get easier to use and always hoping my curls will miraculously turn out beautiful this time.</li>
            <li> Curls beautifully nice beach wave curls, I bought this wand and a higher end wand by NUME</li>
            <li> you want to add even more impact, use dickbill clips to set the curls while they cool.  </li>
            <li> The larger wand creates beautiful waves and creates volume.</li>
            <li> But overall who cares, this wand leaves me with beautiful long-lasting waves.</li>
            <li> The glove is a nice touch to protect your hands from being burned while handling hot hair</li>
            <li> It produces the most attractive and natural looking curl i have found, is super easy once you get the hang of it and is easy to maneuver quickly when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> but with practice you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Fine</li>
            <li> Curls / waves my fine,</li>
            <li> Either my hair is too fine and just can&#x27;t stay on the barrel</li>
            <li> After a year and a half, still works great!</li>
            <li> The iron great up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I never try yet but soon and hope it works fine</li>
            <li> I tried this wand abroad with 220 V and worked just fine</li>
            <li> pretty much followed those directions, and yes, it turned out great.</li>
            <li> There were no frills with packaging, which was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> * Hairspraying after each half section works best for holding my hair</li>
            <li> The included glove is fine, you wouldn&#x27;t want to hold the barrel with your hand, but you can use a couple fingers to hold hair in place if needed.</li>
            <li> curling wand that doesn&#x27;t work as well or as as quickly as this one!</li>
            <li> This thing heats up so quickly!</li>
            <li> Works quickly!</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with this,</li>
            <li> Order came quickly!</li>
            <li> if you buy this particular wand, understand that it is more slippery, I noticed that this wand does make my hair shine more and look more smooth and</li>
            <li> Omg, good bye old curling irons!</li>
            <li> The reason why I ever bought this specific one in the first place is because of all the good things I heard about it on a list of good curling irons; I do not understand how this could even be considered for that list.</li>
            <li> However, once you get the hang of using the wand, you don&#x27;t really need it to fend off the &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; moments of touching the wand!</li>
            <li> Very pretty waves. :)</li>
            <li> Works really well and its cute!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes great soft curls.</li>
            <li> Great curling wand that comes with a glove for those of us who are using a wand for the first time and getting used to the new technique!</li>
            <li> swivel cord is pretty junky looking, and gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> This tool can get VERY HOT!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair using this- even after my first time!</li>
            <li> I like the adjustable temperature it gets very hot!</li>
            <li> But, with a little practice, this one is perfect!!</li>
            <li> It just takes a little practice and patience, but once you get the hang of it, it gives great results!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use the included glove because it does get VERY hot!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot so wear the glove!</li>
            <li> The handling took a little getting used to but worked great!</li>
            <li> it definitely gives even my fine straight hair beautiful \\&quot;Kardashian-like\\&quot; waves!</li>
            <li> With a not so great iron or no hairspray, my hair can easily fall from voluminous curls to completely flat.</li>
            <li> Can make tight-ish curls or lose huge waves if I shake them out</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars is because if your hair is clean and smooth it tends to slide off the iron easily.</li>
            <li> It really does heat up fast and gives me great waves.</li>
            <li> In the process, I got a huge burn on my ear.  </li>
            <li> I need to by a huge convertor that cost twice the price of this wond</li>
            <li> Maybe a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; would be great in the package for different styles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and leaves your curls silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but well worth the effort :)</li>
            <li> you are a beginner to curling wands, don&#x27;t be discouraged, they are fantastic, but start with a one size barrel to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ceramic just glides your hair through and gives it a shiny smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Smooth curls</li>
            <li> Regular curling irons aren&#x27;t great for this purpose because the hair holding clamp leaves a visible dent where it contacts my hair.</li>
            <li> It almost doesn&#x27;t hurt hair and has fabulous effect.</li>
            <li> If u use a light hairspray the curls will hold longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put any product in while using it but sprayed a light hairspray on when I was done.</li>
            <li> This helped me get a lot of volume at the roots, precisely what I bought this for.  </li>
            <li> This wand and the others in the line, work fantastic.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday, creates awesome waves.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to see some cheap features..</li>
            <li> She said it works great and opted for the larger size wand for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Great for longer hair and bigger waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the iron and will use it often.</li>
            <li> I am now the proud owner of a smaller rod, as well.</li>
            <li> This ridge catches on my hair so it doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly off the end.</li>
            <li> It works great, curls last all day.</li>
            <li> After asking my cousin what she does to her hair that it looks perfect everyday, she pointed me towards these wands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li> Cheap quality</li>
            <li> Thank you SOOOOOOOOOO much Remington for creating this amazing tool that has literally replaced EVERY hair tool i have ever owned including my $100 baby bliss curling iron and $200 or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the tool, but I need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Overall the wand works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap glove you would buy for your kid at a flea market.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and makes nice beach curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Fabulous.</li>
            <li> I finally managed to get that wavy great looking all by myself, it takes couple of times until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> My curls look WAY better and more natural with the wand, and I feel like my curls hold up better as well.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the price, size (I bought the bigger one), and look.</li>
            <li> When I opened it it felt light and almost cheap</li>
            <li> its amazing how much difference 1/4&amp;#34; makes.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1-1 1/2&amp;#34; size and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My curls always come out looking fantastic.</li>
            <li> I think this wand is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I did like the smooth \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; barrel, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> Take an hour or two practicing, figure out what feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> After curling my hair with this iron I had smooth curls that stayed in even after sleeping.</li>
            <li> This wand is worth way more than the advertised price.</li>
            <li> Curls turn out smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Great product overall!</li>
            <li> Great quality for low price</li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product - especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the included glove much, but it&#x27;s nice to have in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, and makes nice beach curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a curling wand with a wider barrel for ages, this one had fantastic reviews</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of the clamp curling irons, so the wand definitely fit what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this product and would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> We loved the fact that you can get all different size curls, and both me and my daughter really love this feature.</li>
            <li> but my straight Asian hair holds curls best with this wand vs curling iron.</li>
            <li> Good product, natural hair curl</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first curling iron/wand ever (besides using a Conair curl &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; which works great but is more for giving a little wave), and I love it!</li>
            <li> Gets hot and easy to use!</li>
            <li> But ita super easy and quick!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl very easily-</li>
            <li> I would just say make sure you select the right size.  </li>
            <li> The small wand creates perfect, flawless, tight curls within seconds ...</li>
            <li> I am sure with the right spray it will stay for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> The wand came with a full glove and the wand is easy to use.</li>
            <li> - it gets hot!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curler!!!!</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s really HOT!!</li>
            <li> I own a smaller wand, but this really gives you a nice beach/loose curls that stay on for days!</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the temperature setting has to be extremely high for the best waves.</li>
            <li> The larger barrel and high temperature scale of this curling wand make it the best value for the price that I have found!</li>
            <li> it creates beautiful loose curls.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and makes beautiful, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any product and it was super easy to use.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and seems to be made of decent materials.</li>
            <li> but it is still great, heats up quickly and gives fabulous curls in a short space of time!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s quick and easy to create loos curls.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for people who don&#x27;t know how to curl their own hair because all you have to do is wrap around the wand and hold it for a few seconds!</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using the wand it provides a quick and easy way to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also cooled off pretty fast as well, which is a good thing if your in a rush &amp; don&#x27;t have one of those fancy curling iron /blow dryer holders &amp; I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the glove is very useful because the rod can get very hot.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a wand that heats up fast gives you nice loose curls and for great price I defiantly recommend this Remington wand.</li>
            <li> and so I thought that this would be perfect, but the barrel is too large and it is hard to get really nice curls.</li>
            <li> It heats up real hot and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot, so you have to be careful, but does make great curls, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> it heats very fast, i love it came with the glove</li>
            <li> The change in temperatures is also nice - I like being able to set it very low for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot very quickly, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Perfect large loose curls and waves.</li>
            <li> I love my new tool, and have had many people ask me how I do my hair...</li>
            <li> the great thing is it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair which is important to me.</li>
            <li> The hair will slip if you do not hold it right, and it worked best for me when I held the curler upside down with the skinnier part of the barrel pointed at the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall the curling iron is amazing!...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the &amp;#34;Pearl&amp;#34; helps your hair, but the curls are perfect (plus its pink!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , worth the money all the way!</li>
            <li> but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the built in stand that really works!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Originally, I purchased the 1-1.5 inch curling wand, but found the results to be too \\&quot;shirly temple\\&quot;-esque for me.</li>
            <li> This thing is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to keep practicing and using this product.</li>
            <li> but it was worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I love this wand so much!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> You can get the ultimate perfect natural curls with this curling iron!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in its original packaging or anything just put in a box.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure you can use it abroad</li>
            <li> its just not user friendly.</li>
            <li> although mine sis not come in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> And I imagine with each next time it will only look more beautiful!</li>
            <li> Works great on her long hair.</li>
            <li> I love that you can change the heat and that it heats up so fast!</li>
            <li> Love it and the curl stays in my stick straight hair all day!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what originally attracted me to it</li>
            <li> curls come out beautiful, although takes a couple of tries to get used to</li>
            <li> Got many compliments on my hair first time using this.</li>
            <li> make sure you know how to use it before you try (watch tutorials) because it is very helpful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun!</li>
            <li> I figured for the price, who cares if it works or not, it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and straight.</li>
            <li> Aside from that the wand itself works fine and heats up and gets very hot</li>
            <li> I have to give this product a 1-star, because while the curling iron itself is great, the glove that comes with it is nothing more than a little knit mitten.</li>
            <li> Great for my long hair!  </li>
            <li> I own the smaller version of this curler and love it</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand, still have to get used to using it (burnt my fingers a few times lol)</li>
            <li> I own both the 1-1.5 inches and 0.5-1 inch wands but mostly use the bigger wand.</li>
            <li> But occasionally I do like to have some curls in my hair because it does look nice and its a refreshing change.  </li>
            <li> Temperature is adequate and the surface on the iron is smooth.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand gives nice beach waves and big curls.</li>
            <li> I love how this curling iron gives me the flexibility to play around with the size and shapes of my curls and and they look more natural.</li>
            <li> The pearl finish is super smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap, works so well, and comes with a glove to protect your hand.</li>
            <li> This product simply does not make Remington look good - it&#x27;s so cheap, and there is nothing \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; about the barrel even though the photo makes it look pearlescent.  </li>
            <li> Perfect  present for young girls.</li>
            <li> I already fell in love with the smaller size to this...and the temperature setting is nice...</li>
            <li> The wand heats up quickly too which is a huge plus, and it has adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> It looks kinda cheap, but it heats up quickly and it does its job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap</li>
            <li> Temperature is adequate and the surface on the iron is smooth.</li>
            <li> The controls are super easy and simple to understand and the curls are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast, and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> was planning on buying the Nume curling wands after seeing so many positive feedback on them, but their prices are just too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess Im old fashioned I like my curling iron better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I always use a leave in conditioner, and because my hair has more texture than my friend&#x27;s, it didn&#x27;t slip right off the wand, and with a bit of practice, I was able to create some nice, loose curls.</li>
            <li> Does do a great job with loose curls.</li>
            <li> SO easy so handle, so light but very sturdy, it heats up in SECONDS!</li>
            <li> :) And use the glove everytime...it gets super hot.</li>
            <li> this thing gets super hot so be sure to use the glove that comes with it to prevent from burning your hands.</li>
            <li> This helped make my waves look smooth and beautiful in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I knocked it down a star because the gloves that come with it do still transmit a fair amount of the heat, and it melted my nail polish!</li>
            <li> Creates large waves. :)</li>
            <li> It makes large curls and as they fall, they are more just a wave on me.</li>
            <li> its alright, nothing special.</li>
            <li> it creates a more natural-looking large curl.</li>
            <li> I chose right when I selected this product!  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, the price is right!</li>
            <li> the hair slides right off it!</li>
            <li> Try the smaller wand if you want tighter curls this one is for large beautiful curls/waves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little tricky to use at first, I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I am really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Which is probably fine for many of you, and perhaps obvious to most of you, but I like a clamp</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the hang of this curling wand, but once I got the hang of it, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was also a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Works great, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> instead I got the Herstyler Grande pink curling wand (which was cheaper) and it works great.</li>
            <li> Even being inexperienced I am getting great results, and it gets easier every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> this product is amazing , and a vary good quality for a small price , i recomend it a lot</li>
            <li> But if you practice a bit with wrapping your hair around it and get a feel for it (before you heat it up), then you&#x27;ll have more success at not burning the bleep out of your fingers ;)</li>
            <li> Then one of my girls&#x27; schoolmates had beautiful curls in her pin straight hair and told me they were 2nd day curls!</li>
            <li> First time i used this my hair turned out great, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since I&#x27;ve gotten the same results.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience with curling wands, so I thought I would weigh in, since most of the reviews on this product are from people who don&#x27;t seem to have much knowledge about how to use them or what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ready tons of reviews and this wand seemed to be the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> The reviews stating that their hair held a curl even when sleeping on it were true.</li>
            <li> I get better curls with this than a curling iron and it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love this wand and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> love this product and the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> My friends fell in love with it when I let them borrow it when we are getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li> &amp; I knew that wouldn&#x27;t be the last time, so I just decided to get her one of her own &amp; it delivered the very next day instead of the 2-day shipping I chose, so that was a great surprise as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good curling wand especially for the price ,,,.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly yesterday, which was 2 days after I ordered it thanks to amazon prime; and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> item produces some nice soft curls.</li>
            <li> so I just felt the need to say that I currently own a wand and use it all the time with no trouble.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I used to be one of those people who thought all the heated hair tools had to cost at least $100 to be good and work great, but apparently they make them better than they used to years ago</li>
            <li> Also, the tip doesn&#x27;t stay cool</li>
            <li> Make sure you start twirling the strand from the very bottom</li>
            <li> Just remember to let the curls COOL before you touch them, or else you&#x27;ll be coming the curl</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and the curls lasts more than a day for me.</li>
            <li> Good product, low price.</li>
            <li> i love it, makes it so much easier to curl hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much but am pleased with my purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li> makes them look really natural and nice.</li>
            <li> I have to slide my hair off the barrel, keeping the curl shape intact so it can cool in ringlet form.</li>
            <li> over all its really good if you want bigger curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glove is good size even for my big palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> Basically, to let the hair cool in my palm before releasing it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, love the glove thing that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for 10-15 minutes of effort.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure how to use this kind of curling iron, just watch some YouTube tutorials - there are tons of good ones out there.</li>
            <li> The 1-1 1/2 inch curls are really beautiful and it gives me a good mix of having casual looking curls.</li>
            <li> It is so quick, so simple, and very easy to do!</li>
            <li> I burned myself first time out because I was too concentrated on making sure the hair was going on right</li>
            <li> This gets much hotter than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had before (hence the glove, which is pretty important in my opinion) but each section of my hair only needed about 30 seconds and the curls are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> heats up super fast, digital easy read numbers to set, wrap, hold, and wonderful, soft bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> cause it arrives super fast and free!</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast, and I love the waves I got.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want huge curls, so I bought the smaller option and let me tell you: I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works really well on my hair!</li>
            <li> Actually easy to use,  came fast too!  </li>
            <li> It was pretty easy for her to get the hang of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and fast!</li>
            <li> I consider this my first real curler, since the one I had before is now so old, I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I used it and the result was, if not awful, then something passable at best .</li>
            <li> They use this technique for special occasion hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this very much!</li>
            <li> I had the right sized curler in time for Christmas and they picked up the original one for me right at home!</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold hairstyles well and even when I got my hair done professionally for prom years ago, the style didn&#x27;t hold for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other then that, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other ppl use it and curls come out great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this on other people and it works great.</li>
            <li> they looked great, but not exactly what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> For it to be most effective, you have to do your hair first then touch up with this potentially scalding device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty handy with bobby pins, but I have never been able to master the traditional curling iron that comes with a clip.  </li>
            <li> It curled my hair very well despite my hair being a little below shoulders since I got the 1-1 1/2 inch one it was perfect</li>
            <li> Pretty straightforward and easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It takes practice learning how to hold the wand in the most comfortable way (especially when doing the back of your head) but it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Im a stylist and it creates nice, loose curls, wand is a little tricky to manipulate on hair but practice makes perfect, use your glove so you don&#x27;t get burned, If you have shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> They are not \\&quot;super easy\\&quot; to use.</li>
            <li> The smaller one would be better for tighter more Shirley Temple</li>
            <li> Much better than same shape from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my hair as quickly as I would like...</li>
            <li> I like the bigger wand better even though it was $10 more.  </li>
            <li> Makes quick, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Some of these wands make super curly</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and was as described.  </li>
            <li> I recently went for a bachelorette weekend for my best friend &amp; she used it constantly.</li>
            <li> Granted my hair is super long-to my waist-</li>
            <li> Quick shipping also</li>
            <li> they ship it super fast&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; the curls lasted all night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for a routine that will be quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very used to having good luck with the old clamp-style irons and cannot for the life of me get my hair to stay on the barrel.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dominiocan with super curly hair</li>
            <li> I have also used it on smaller sections of hair to do big bouncy curls that drop into perfect waves.</li>
            <li> Very well priced and really does an amazing job, heats up quick, has a thermometer, and curls hold forever.</li>
            <li> really quick</li>
            <li> Adjustable heat, quick heat up time, and safety auto-shut off are must have features.</li>
            <li> Quick heating&lt;</li>
            <li> Love this iron because it lessens them and makes them hold outside better.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and sets the wave in my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> I can do a quick curling job with this curling want in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Julie said she loves the curling iron since it curls her hair quickly without burning the hair strands.</li>
            <li> It came so quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the curls stay in.</li>
            <li> Ok, I watch many YouTube beauty/hair gurus &amp; they all have different hair tools of choice.</li>
            <li> The high heat settings on this actually keeps the curls in for a good few hours though, so I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten blowouts at high end places and hair done with this wand fares better.</li>
            <li> Good wand.heats up fast comes with a glove very safe and cute if u like Victoria secret model curls</li>
            <li> this is a  very good curling wand gets very hot but the glove it comes with is just a little cheap glove that doesn&#x27;t really work that well but 5 stars for the wand</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see this product come up, and I watched several instruction videos to make sure I used it</li>
            <li> this really needs something to catch the hair to be able to curl it the right way.  </li>
            <li> , other go to 450, I can&#x27;t see WHY anyone would need more heat than THIS??!!</li>
            <li> Creates beautiful curls easily even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This curls your hair very nicely,  and overall works really well.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s very hot and works well.....</li>
            <li> It gets very hot</li>
            <li> I would recommend wearing the included glove until you get the hang of using it because it does get very hot.</li>
            <li> Very fast once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot.</li>
            <li> down(I&#x27;m normally the most patient person ever)</li>
            <li> This wand gets very hot but comes with a glove.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> Best of all, I no longer lose hair due to pulling it out because it got stuck on the screw hinge section of the clamp to my old curling iron</li>
            <li> after receiving my product and using it almost daily I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This curling wand works well on curling my hair, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> A lot better than a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> The wand&#x27;s heat is very HOT.</li>
            <li> My hair look very pretty when I use it</li>
            <li> The cool tip is not actually cool, but in my opinion that&#x27;s a happy accident-</li>
            <li> Again, this was my very first time handeling any sort of hair curler</li>
            <li> It does get very hot and</li>
            <li> That type keeps your hair in place, not your hand holding a very hot barrel.</li>
            <li> does get very hot.</li>
            <li> The thickness was good since my hair is long.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly and having the glove is very useful.</li>
            <li> Once you practice with it, one can really create beautiful loose beach waves.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and creates beautiful curls that last all day and night (and sometimes into the next day!).</li>
            <li> You do not have good results trying to hold the hair on the bar long enough to get a good curl as your hand begins to get to hot.</li>
            <li> Gave my very fine, but very thick bone-straight hair great body and lasted hours.</li>
            <li> the prices on them are great, and they look pretty in pink.</li>
            <li> okey yess it work, it make some nice curly on my hair  and they look natural ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really gift this easily for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love this wand, it gets hot fast</li>
            <li> It actually makes my hair feel softer when i use it, which is strange in a great way!</li>
            <li> I accidentally burned myself the first time I used it although I herd only good things from this curling wand</li>
            <li> I wish I could do it more consistently throughout my whole head.</li>
            <li> but I defiantly love how it gets hot fast , and you can control your heat settings .</li>
            <li> Soooo fast and easy.</li>
            <li> (I have medium-long length hair) and I am pretty much always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> it heats up fast and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m just not a fan generally of the tapered design, but it is a sleek wand, easy to read display, heats up super quickly, and was otherwise a fine wand if you don&#x27;t mind the design.</li>
            <li> It gets salon hot!  </li>
            <li> and IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT!.</li>
            <li> I finally bought one myself and love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve tried after watching a Youtube video of a girl doing it with ease!</li>
            <li> But hey, for this price it doesn&#x27;t really matter!!</li>
            <li> Product even came with a protective glove because product gets really hot!</li>
            <li> My favorite curling product so far!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> With so many bogus, fake reviews now on here, I feel we &amp;#34;true consumers&amp;#34; owe it to ppl to write HONEST reviews!!  </li>
            <li> must it gets really really hot!</li>
            <li> At first, I was like wth!  </li>
            <li> It gets super hot super quick.</li>
            <li> I curl my bangs and my under curl with my older larger barrel iron and then go around my whole head with the top most layer of hair and make ringlets, after the heat dissipates I scrunch my hair with my hands at the roots to get more body.</li>
            <li> You can easily create many different looks using just this wand.</li>
            <li> Simple curling iron that works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> I did learn to make my own hair gel, and that helped tremendously, but the second day still needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do spray my hair with dry shampoo before I use the wand so that the curl holds more, but this wand is better than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is such an easy curling wand, and so inexpensive for such a great result.  </li>
            <li> But I have really fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> It certainly has a learning curve, but it is fairly easy and quick, and the curls stay in pretty well (even without additional product).</li>
            <li> But since I like loose curls, the bigger size is perfect.</li>
            <li> The glove this thing comes with barely covers your hand, so it&#x27;s still very easy to burn your wrist --</li>
            <li> Gets hot super quick.</li>
            <li> This one is good for loose curls!</li>
            <li> She really likes this for curling, and I can say her hair looks fantastic when she uses it.</li>
            <li> this things is amazing for 20 bucks definitely</li>
            <li> it is amazing do not recommend for younger ages</li>
            <li> Heats up real fast</li>
            <li> Now, i have amazing hair every day and it takes me only 5 min.</li>
            <li> I have multiple styling tools from Remington and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li> after watching a few youtube tutorials on curling wands i decided to order this one paired with great amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this iron after reading countless reviews and seeing many Youtube videos on this iron.</li>
            <li> gloves are nice but they&#x27;re not necessary.</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Within a week, using the wand became more natural.</li>
            <li> That works far better</li>
            <li> and decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems as if the wand style irons/wavers are the direction that hair appliances are heading so it is worth trying one out.</li>
            <li> Produces looser, more natural looking waves than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;gifted&amp;#34; as some say with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Def not even worth the $15</li>
            <li> and I think for my next wand I&#x27;m going to invest in a better curling wand and not get something just because it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Since she bought her own, she has since bought them as presents for several of her friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I thought a tapered barrel would be more important than it actually turned out to be -</li>
            <li> I rarely use the highest setting.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This creates great natural curls that really last!  </li>
            <li> I have only used once, but  really liked the results.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my hair curl and feel soft from the ceramic barrel.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the bigger size once I tested it because I liked it</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been using this iron since 2012, and it is STILL my favorite curling wand I&#x27;ve found, thus far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I even find myself using my old curling iron with the clip more often.  </li>
            <li> I am a stylist who spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a good wand that would put curls that would hold in the sleekest of hair.</li>
            <li> y&#x27;all don&#x27;t hear me, Yasssss I love it Fabulous curl that last all day even to the morning</li>
            <li> The Remington Pearl curlers are the best though and actually provide lasting texture to my ever straight locks.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love that its digital and light wight.</li>
            <li> You want professional and light wight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this completely depends on the behavior of your hair as well as the tightness of the curls, so don&#x27;t expect that to work for everyone!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use wrapping lotion or holding spray when making curls although the wand curls the hair it wont last on its own.</li>
            <li> Overall this product gives a nice curl.</li>
            <li> I just wished I got a smaller one, just for the size of the curls, but it&#x27;s a really nice hair styling tool</li>
            <li> but just in case, always make sure to get a professional&#x27;s advice on it.</li>
            <li> I was reading the reviews and saw that a lot of people with thicker hair that never holds a curl were having success with this.</li>
            <li> The iron takes a minute or two to warm up to 410, so don&#x27;t expect instant flaming heat.  </li>
            <li> high temperate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> And the nice thing is, if you apply the tape just right, you can reuse it again a few more times.    </li>
            <li> Creates gorgeous full curles that bounce and last, looks very natural and glamorous..</li>
            <li> It took seconds to make a nice curl in my super long hair.</li>
            <li> This product gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot for very fast curling with a lot of</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a quick compromise between a curling iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li> you can  burn your hand pretty quick ..</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> I got a 1-1/2 size for bigger curl, my hair is very easy to slide off but after practicing more times i can make it fixed well.</li>
            <li> You do have to get the hang of it at first, but overall my hair looked really nice the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I have the eliptical wand as well and both get very hot and stay hot.</li>
            <li> That was a good tip from one of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I gets very hot and stays hot.</li>
            <li> The temperature gets hot so be careful but overall one of the best ones out there</li>
            <li> I have long needed a clipless curling iron, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought one!</li>
            <li> Be carful if it&#x27;s your first time using it because it gets very hot</li>
            <li> THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT HEATS UP REALLY FAST AND ITS REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li> Other than that, like I said, the wand is really good.</li>
            <li> but once you got that down, great tool, awersome large curls&amp;#62</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> you get the right way to do .</li>
            <li> you can select the right size wand for your hair/curl size preference&lt;</li>
            <li> then it is just about right for my medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 1-1 1/2 &amp;#34; size and that was the right size for my length hair.  </li>
            <li> maybe its just that i dont know how to use it right</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> All I needed was the right tool.  </li>
            <li> But it must take lots of practice because I can&#x27;t get any of my curls to look right.</li>
            <li> My hair rolled right off the wand as I tried to avoid scorching my hands.</li>
            <li> biggest problem for me is that you cant&#x27; let go of your hair at any time during the process or it slips right off.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s HOT.&lt;br /&gt;-The glove is right handed.</li>
            <li> but it still didn&#x27;t come out right.</li>
            <li> Should be you need to hold it for a couple seconds for it to make the change since the settings are right on the handle.</li>
            <li> My hair slips right off the tapered barrel</li>
            <li> I received my package 3 days after placing my order and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s easy to get the cute barrel curls that are gorgeous with long hair.</li>
            <li> These curls are big, beautiful, and last all day!</li>
            <li> This one provides more natural curls because of the shape of the wand and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> impressed but only as an average curler.</li>
            <li> It really does get super hot, so use caution and give your hair a break in between uses!</li>
            <li> My only complain about these wands is that I find it very easy to burn your arms and fingers.</li>
            <li> Both sizes work great, it really comes down to the look you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the curler itself, works fantastic and I highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li> This one is good but not great -- my problem is that it tapers into a smaller size at the top which kind of messes up the shape of the curls it creates.</li>
            <li> I had the half inch size but love the 1 inch so much more</li>
            <li> Its really easy to use, and i love how its pink..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same technique before with a curling iron, wrapping the hair around the iron rather than clamping it on for a less &#x27;perfect&#x27; curl.</li>
            <li> They also own the smaller version, but wanted the bigger one for more of a wave look</li>
            <li> In my opinion, and the only way I curl my hair is outwards because it looks more natural and frames my face better.</li>
            <li> This is the second clipless curling wand i have bought (I also got the conair you curl which was okay) and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the larger barrel and it gives beautiful big curls that fall into really pretty waves.</li>
            <li> It did take several attempts at styling before I became comfortable with the wand, but it heats up fast and the handle is comfortable to hold!</li>
            <li> its great and does the job however cuz its so slippery all the hair bunches to the thiner portion :/</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice curing iron, I have just not been able to get use to using a wand, not sure if it is me or just the design.</li>
            <li> Gives nice curls to my medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> Nice long cord and built in stand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried doing blow outs and flat irons but hands down this works the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the glove comes in very handy, as I&#x27;ve seen other curlers like this that don&#x27;t come with a glove and can potentially burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> baby gets hot, hot, hot!</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1-1.5&amp;#34; wand after wanting nice bouncy curls and not being able to achieve them with a regular curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li> The curls held extremely well, I even brushed it out after curling just to see how well they would hold, and I still have full head of curls and beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> I only tested a few strands of hair, but let me tell you: AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Both wands had great hold altogether, but if you want the curls that you see on TV and in magazines, I would definitely go with the larger wand.</li>
            <li> But I got the results that make my wand seem worth a lot more than it actually was.</li>
            <li> it is enough time to protect your fingers, but I would have liked something I could keep on the barrel longer to really curl to the tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my old curling iron (it was a good brand, just worn out), my curls got drabby as soon as I left the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the control buttons are clear.</li>
            <li> The glove they supply with it isn&#x27;t anything to great, and it makes it harder to grip your strips of hair, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t help you out.</li>
            <li> I have the smaller one and it works great, got this one for bigger curles.</li>
            <li> Regular big banana curls are great too with this.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and am please with my purchase but surprised that no mentioned how easy it is to accidentally change the heat settings while curling your hair.</li>
            <li> otherwise it heats up super fast and curls hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product, Im not very good with hair</li>
            <li> So while the product is good, i believe the heat isn&#x27;t high enough for people with straight hair.</li>
            <li> So, once more I decided to show the tool some mercy, and try it out on my other two sisters&#x27; medium and ultra fine hair...SAME RESULTS.</li>
            <li> PLUS, the larger barrel size is better for my long hair - giving it nice curls throughout the day, and wavy/beachy curls by the end of the night.   </li>
            <li> can be very hot, be very careful!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hot and curls my hair fast.</li>
            <li> Love this curler really amazing , curls stay in your hair for so long (: Definitely purchase this item</li>
            <li> This wand only takes about 25 mins to curl my whole head (that&#x27;s a record for me, since I have a head full of hair) and the end result looks A MILLION times better and</li>
            <li> Makes nice loose fashionable curls.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact I can have nice loose curls</li>
            <li> Gives nice loose beachy waves.</li>
            <li> and it still makes nice loose curls.</li>
            <li> Makes nice, loose beachy waves.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a nice head of loose curly waves with lots of volume, and those Kardashians girls had nothing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watching someone using this kind if curling iron on TV or YouTube, it seems easy, but, when you attempt doing it for the first time, it&#x27;s so difficult, that i decided to return it, because i had an event coming up and didn&#x27;t have time to figure this thing out on my extremely fine hair!</li>
            <li> It is also very fast to use</li>
            <li> This wand curls very fast and it took around 15 minutes to have all of my hair completed.</li>
            <li> but when I went to use it, the wand heated up very fast</li>
            <li> It heats up VERY fast.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair that does not take well to any attempts to make it do otherwise.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and my curls stay all day.</li>
            <li> So far she&#x27;s done just fine with it.  </li>
            <li> It does not include 20 soft rollers as stated in the description, which was fine since I didn&#x27;t need them.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job on one side and then just completely refused to curl the other side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, these wands do give you a more natural and professional curl/wave, and can do so quickly, but it does take practice to achieve the goal.</li>
            <li> I do have to use the glove still &amp; that was one of the main reasons I chose this one in the first place &amp; after reading all of the other reviews, as I&#x27;m still a beginner with wands, never doing much more than straightening my hair for many years, so I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how not to burn myself yet without the glove.</li>
            <li> It works best for long hair and flowing waves, as opposed to tight curls.</li>
            <li> and I found it very easy to wrap my hair around it, as long as I wore the accompanying glove.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Good little curling wand.</li>
            <li> I was easily able to make gorgeous loose curls that stayed all night with minimal hairspray.</li>
            <li> but this is super easy, especially since i just like the wavy effortless look.</li>
            <li> An easy, quick and total confidence booster for under $25?</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this wand when I meant to buy the smaller size, but Amazon made the exchange incredibly quick and easy.</li>
            <li> first I was debating on the 1/2 to 1inch and the 1 to 1.5inch.</li>
            <li> Also, first try it out before turning it on that way</li>
            <li> i recomend it plus is not so espensive ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall 5 stars, It&#x27;s cheaper than Hot Tools and Jose Eber, yes,</li>
            <li> I figured it out the first try.</li>
            <li> This wand comes with a glove which is absolutely essential to make sure you curl the tips of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve a curl before and this goes above and beyond.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to get hot.</li>
            <li> but overall I do love this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair first, then use this.</li>
            <li> They have used it at least once or twice a week since then and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to style my hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m considering buying the bigger size for more different looks :)</li>
            <li> But the curling iron really works!</li>
            <li> I had problems learning how to use it at first (and my hair kept sliding out of place)</li>
            <li> Like seriously,it burns my hands,and this is not even my first time using it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I got the bigger barrel!</li>
            <li> First night I tried it, it sucked.</li>
            <li> Take another short strip and fold it over the top of your ears, protecting the tip, sides and outward-facing aspect of your ear.  </li>
            <li> And not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> But then I watched a how-to video on YouTube (which I HIGHLY recommend doing!!)</li>
            <li> And love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like regular curlers did when a strand of hair would get caught in the clamp part.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair and it heats up pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I may have burned my fingers once or twice when first using it</li>
            <li> Use the curling wand glove at first to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely use the glove until you&#x27;re comfortable or you WILL burn yourself!</li>
            <li> It doesnt damage your hair and it holds a curl pretty well even without hairspray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got REVLON&#x27;s curling iron first, it burned me a lot and the curls cannot be maintained for even a dinner time.</li>
            <li> I recommend spaying hair with hairspray first and brushing through before curling hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend to YouTube videos on how to use a wand before trying for your first time.</li>
            <li> I like this one better, the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this tool.  </li>
            <li> Seems comparable to and or better than products below and above this price range as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this wand only for one side of my hair didn&#x27;t even use spray and it held nicely most of the day.</li>
            <li> heats up fast!</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend it to my friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li> I always straightened it first, and then by the time I straightened it I saw no point to curl it again.</li>
            <li> my hair did feel any different or any more damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning, but love the different looks.</li>
            <li> You have to get used to holding it backwards when you switch sides, and it gets extremely hot</li>
            <li> My sister used it on my hair the first time and it took about 35 min to finish all my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking to buy a better glove because it is definitely needed when working with this type of iron.</li>
            <li> 410 degrees is pretty hot and does a great job keeping the curl long lasting.</li>
            <li> This may not be a higher end brand but the pearl coating has allowed me to heat style without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> These babies really work!</li>
            <li> Since it does get so hot, considering using a heat protector</li>
            <li> Definitely not for a first timer at hair curling that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Thank you - love it will be buying the smaller one soon</li>
            <li> My first time using it, it rolled a bit on the countertop and wound up melting through a bottle of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It gives me big, lovely waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it for newbies like me, maybe with more experience</li>
            <li> you can create so many different styles: causal (every day), work, formal.</li>
            <li> I already owned the narrower version, but wanted larger more wavy curls.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to correctly work a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> was buy the 1/2-1 inch at first</li>
            <li> At first I used the mitten that comes with it while getting used to handling it, but now I find I don&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li> , so you know exactly what you&#x27;re setting it to.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 1-1 1/2 inch barrel because I wanted looser curls and this gave me the exact look I was going for.</li>
            <li> but I am absolutely in love with the larger version.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve had only fabulous hair days!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to work on trying to improve my motor skills with a burning hot object close to my hands and face.  </li>
            <li> and I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot, I think you need a heat protector glove for each hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> It works ok but the barrel is too big to curl my chin length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty dextrous person</li>
            <li> She has used several times and is always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> i love the 1.5 inch part, makes big waves</li>
            <li> first time I use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li> It was very affordable and my go-to style!</li>
            <li> Love how it shuts off after 1 hour, sometimes being in such a rush</li>
            <li> I love this product overall</li>
            <li> My first one is thinner (meant to be for tighter curls)</li>
            <li> The wand is pretty slick/slippery, and most of all it is BIG!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, suffered severe burn on my ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shown each one exactly what to buy on amazon.</li>
            <li> They said that it is exactly what they wanted.</li>
            <li> My first time using this iron it burned my carpet.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing better protection when using this product.</li>
            <li> When I first revived this product, I thought it was a piece of #%?</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;ll stick with my hot tools rod instead.</li>
            <li> First, directions show a tong for use, but there was none.</li>
            <li> The photo is from my first time using.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot but still doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, will never use a regular curling iron again.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> If the hair tends to slip off, use a hairspray first, then brush through your hair and it should help.</li>
            <li> Love this larger one!  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot and works with all hair types.</li>
            <li> She suggested STARTING the wand at your chin for your lower hair (bottom of your head, say, ear length); for the middle section, start curling at the top of your lip; and for the top, start curling at the bridge of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets really hot, so it sets well.</li>
            <li> this is fast!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try it your first time and assume you&#x27;ll be a pro.</li>
            <li> Returned this product - I was aware of the diameter</li>
            <li> This product works exactly how it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> Glad i seen it cuz this is a total rip off!!!!</li>
            <li> This was exactly as stated it would be.</li>
            <li> I guess if this is not your first time using this, you might like it.</li>
            <li> Love the digital dial and the temperature lock feature...</li>
            <li> Comes with a glove that lets you touch your hot hair as you curl it (though not the wand</li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely hot.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t curl the way</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re most likely gonna burn your fingers while you try to figure this out.</li>
            <li> hair-styling challenged ;)</li>
            <li> it will still take at least 30 minutes, but it holds the curls way better than a curling iron and looks great the next day even!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my grandaughter wanted.</li>
            <li> I never use the glove, but you might want to the first couple of uses because it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i will ever use a regular curling iron as i like the shape these make better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I had wanted to try out a cheaper version first before I decided if I needed a pricier one, however I am just going to stick to this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> did you expect a hot iron NOT to burn you if you touched it?</li>
            <li> This gets 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from my big beachy waves I&#x27;ve created.</li>
            <li> The knob is made so that when you place the iron on a surface the hot part stays off that surface.</li>
            <li> I had first purchased the 1/2 to 1 inch wand</li>
            <li> I like how hot it gets</li>
            <li> However, for the price, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m willing to put up with</li>
            <li> Then once I got the hang of it it turned out so much more easier and quicker then your standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes big cute curls</li>
            <li> It does get really hot</li>
            <li> I love the bigger barrel because you can curl thicker pieces of hair and it makes the process a lot faster.</li>
            <li> The is my first time using one of these</li>
            <li> That is Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Such lovely waves</li>
            <li> Digital button controls, which I had NO problems with touching or hitting them &amp; changing it or turning it of( u know?)  .</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand for big barrel curls.</li>
            <li> but I did like the results with the first use.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> (It can get really really hot though...</li>
            <li> Works WAY better on my hair than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> Its hot, i cant place it on any surface from the warning signs.</li>
            <li> is my first curler without any &#x27;clip&#x27;.</li>
            <li> And the hot glove is a</li>
            <li> First of all, the on/off button doesn&#x27;t work -- I have to plug it in/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done this from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this curling iron!!</li>
            <li> It took a bit of time to be able to get used to it, but now with enough practice, it&#x27;s quite effortless.</li>
            <li> the hot part will be on the table or wherever you have it set</li>
            <li> other than that, I love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never fooled with the temp control, the baseline setting that it starts at is way hot for me.</li>
            <li> First time buying a curler</li>
            <li> I love how I can easily curl my hair and spray a little bit of hairspray and my curls or waves will stay.</li>
            <li> The heating is pretty quick and high ..</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does a good job if you hold the hair on it long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great success with other wands like this, but I was looking for a larger barrel.</li>
            <li> It works very well, gets very hot, and even my straight hair will hold the curl.</li>
            <li> Easy to get burned if you are not careful</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only burned myself two or three times, which is more than with a regular curling iron, but worth it for the smooth curls.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that the reviews on this were so positive (which is the reason I purchased it in the first place).</li>
            <li> Probably the large more in the winter and the smaller for HUMID weather.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I get better results curling with my GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love the Pearl flat iron</li>
            <li> some other wands I own do.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps create the loose waves that are very popular now.  </li>
            <li> I have the smaller one, but I absolutely love more this one because my hair it&#x27;s very long.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I have time I like to turn this iron on and my old iron on at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have two Jose Eber clipless irons that I bought a few years ago, and I really think that this Remington option is superior to the ones</li>
            <li> For sure the next wand I get will be a straight one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this curling iron but was left wishing I didn&#x27;t throw out the packaging to return it.  </li>
            <li> I got the bigger barrel because I wanted big loose waves and they turn out perfect.</li>
            <li> Now, even though my hair is natural curly, does not mean it is easy to curl with an iron.</li>
            <li> The black tip on the top gets super hot</li>
            <li> It is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve tried, is big enought to make loose curls, besides it gets hot enough to make them very well defined, i would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair looks natural, it is already curly but with the Remington curl it take the frizz out of your hair specially if you color your hair.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers said it was easy to use, others said it was tricky at first</li>
            <li> Digital control with LCD temperature readout make it easy to know how hot it is</li>
            <li> * Positive Points:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;m not hitting the off button (which doesn&#x27;t work anyway), and it just shuts off while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update my review in about 6-8 months to review the long term quality of this product. :)</li>
            <li> You pretty much have to wear it to avoid burning your fingers, but I don&#x27;t care for the glove.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, so the larger wand would be better fit for those with the same length or longer because of the size of the barrel.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wand heats up fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li> glove didn&#x27;t protect my fingers when the setting was at 410 degrees, but that&#x27;s really too hot for anyone&#x27;s hair, no matter what anyone tells</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It gets hot fast.  </li>
            <li> This wand does an amazing job with my hair--it works fast and the curls look very big and natural.</li>
            <li> The price was also great compared to other products of similar quality.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that the iron works very well.</li>
            <li> and I love the barrel size since I have long hair.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t think I paid that much for it the first time around</li>
            <li> This product get hot extremely fast and stays hot through out the whole curling process.</li>
            <li> Flat irons are nice for the coordination-challenged who might burn themselves otherwise, as the outsides of the flat iron are protected and cool.  </li>
            <li> This curling wand produces gorgeous curls for a variety of styles without any line from the usual clamp style irons.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Also good for small curls.</li>
            <li> I loved the smaller barrel wand so much that I ordered the larger one</li>
            <li> My curls are gorgeous, they cascade down, are full and bouncy, truly last all day.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a gift for a teenaged girl, as it&#x27;s super easy to burn yourself with a curling rod if you&#x27;re not ultra careful.  </li>
            <li> (very appealing to girls), long lasting soft curls, fast and easy yo use.</li>
            <li> Must be careful when using it though as you can easily get burned!</li>
            <li> I love this brand for the low price and the high quality.</li>
            <li> I own both sizes, and found the smaller (1/2- 1&#x27;&#x27;) made the curls tighter than what I wanted - only when it loosened after a few hours does it look good.  </li>
            <li> Love how my curls look and how long they hold all day!</li>
            <li> I love my smaller clipless curling iron, so I was excited to find this larger sized one.</li>
            <li> They seem to work better on extensions or very long hair.</li>
            <li> With two gloves, it is easy to alternate between hands to style.</li>
            <li> The wand was easy to use and I had the bigger, voluminous curls that I desired from the beginning.</li>
            <li> The only cons that it has is that it could burn your finger easily</li>
            <li> The controls are simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My friend got herself one too after she tried mine, and she is very particular about hair products and devices-</li>
            <li> Works very well, fast and gives pretty curls.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple and easy to use it.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit, as I have bigger hands, but it fits...like a glove (haha)!</li>
            <li> have tried to make the curls with no products and the curls last a few hours, because you have to help them to stay beautiful.</li>
            <li> It SOUNDS like a good idea but not if you cant hold the hair place long enough to..</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and it curls it perfectly.</li>
            <li> so you get strong curls that last.</li>
            <li> first w/hair dryer then go through w/a curling iron for smooth curls, I found it hard to curl the hair framing my face, so make sure that&#x27;s straightened first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The barrel is tapered, so you do need to hold it at certain angles to ensure it doesn&#x27;t slip off.</li>
            <li> It is really large.</li>
            <li> I got the 1-1.5 inch option because I like the beachy wave or large curl effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the problem is because it heats up just fine and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it for loose beachy curls.</li>
            <li> Because I want more loose curls, I bought the 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the way this wand gives me the loose curls I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> bought this after i bought a 1-in to 1/2-in barrel curling wand because those curls were a bit too tight (however, using a hairdryer to stretch out those curls was effective).</li>
            <li> This wand is really for long hair and it heats up nice and hot but it will burn ur scalp if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have tried other curling iron</li>
            <li> I wish it did have a clasp, however I do think the curl is more intense and long lasting, it also has more body and volume than my old iron.</li>
            <li> because the larger barrel will give you a more natural look!</li>
            <li> Works fine looks slightly different than the photo</li>
            <li> Long story short, I got a defective one, I only got to use it once, and the result was beautiful curls, absolutely beautiful on my medium length, thin hair.</li>
            <li> (short hair may work just fine)</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly and the glove works well, though I should probably buy a second glove, as I switch hands pretty</li>
            <li> Pretty decent shipping time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up curling, instead of his temperature is very high.</li>
            <li> this gives a nice soft curl when they start to fall loose.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really liked this curling iron, but the on switch is a little tricky.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see how the more expensive wands etc could be any better than THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> I chose this curling iron after returning a highly rated clamp-style product from Hot Tools I had seen featured in women&#x27;s magazines.</li>
            <li> , I had to use a lot of hair spray to do my curls and would fall flat very quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and has very high temp.</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair hold a curl but the next day its still looking amazing.</li>
            <li> These 5-star reviews are nothing short of accurate.</li>
            <li> The introduction of clipless irons a few years back was welcome news.  </li>
            <li> all the amazing reviews made me buy it but different strokes for different folks.  </li>
            <li> Heat&#x27;s up fast.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really the look I was going for</li>
            <li> -which results in parts of my palm or fingers pushing the buttons -and changing the temperature or turning off the whole thing while I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really lik the curls it produces.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> nothing really works</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Swivel cord is very helpful</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use throughout my whole hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience using these tools.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the wand, the curl is much looser than using the 3/4 inch ones.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curling iron!</li>
            <li> I woke to smooth curls just the way I left them when I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> Now you&#x27;re ready to begin.   </li>
            <li> The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the glove doesn&#x27;t do much to protect your fingers from the heat.</li>
            <li> , very Shirley Temple-esk.</li>
            <li> to really set it.</li>
            <li> so I need something really fast and heated to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> They lasted for a whole night.</li>
            <li> I bought a nume curl wand and paid 4 times as much.</li>
            <li> Another tip is it really matters which way you curl your hair inwards or outwards.</li>
            <li> My sister brought this very phallic looking curling wand when she came to visit me, and after urging me to try it..</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already use a wand, it may not impress you much.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s pink :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and my hair holds curls for days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The protective glove that comes with it is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> But for me, my hair is stubbornly straight.</li>
            <li> Curls REALLY well.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works very well.  </li>
            <li> Used on my wedding day on my real hair and rely extensions</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of anything</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much based on the reviewers rating.  </li>
            <li> When I feel the heat over the glove I know that my hear is ready</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that can&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, the curls were much looser, but still gave the hair some additional volume.</li>
            <li> I really like this wand because I can curl my hair and my curls will stay intact for 2 to 3 days without any hair spray or anything.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, emits heat evenly.</li>
            <li> curling iron is fantastic, especially give the price.</li>
            <li> and these did not work to much for me.</li>
            <li> like it says, it really does create fullness at the crown.</li>
            <li> I had so much expectation.</li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t put your hair around the wand since it&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li> These Remington pink pearl hair wands &amp; straighteners are fantastic!</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> If I use the very end of the wand</li>
            <li> it heats up so fast..</li>
            <li> so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t take much for me to get the hang of using it.  </li>
            <li> It requires too much time and too much work for this gal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> Before buying this product decide how much effort you want to put into curling your hair every day 20 minutes or 45?</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend anyone to buy this Remington Wand!</li>
            <li> The cone is also really slippery</li>
            <li> it could be the type of hair that i have (which is stubbornly straight)</li>
            <li> It is a very versatile wand that gives wavy and spiral curls.</li>
            <li> Knock on wood, I&#x27;ve never been burnt, but I don&#x27;t curl the very tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the price or quality has a real effect on the results with this wand</li>
            <li> I also have to say my hair is so much smoother and shinier after I use</li>
            <li> how much hair spray I used.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to be careful with your hands so that you don&#x27;t accidentally burn yourself, which I haven&#x27;t done yet,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the ends stay straight when I want them curled.</li>
            <li> Not too much waiting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much easier to do with this curling wand and</li>
            <li> IT CURLS FAST AND LASTS FOR DAYS.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really curl my hair...</li>
            <li> curling iron itself doesn&#x27;t look like much.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a lot of effort, but the whole business took about 40 minutes, and I believe it will go faster once I start getting used to the process.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really hold it on the end.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It curls my hair really well</li>
            <li> I really like how the curls come out with this curling wand.</li>
            <li> It stretches so it would fit multiple sizes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> I literally do my whole head of hair in 15 mins.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> as much</li>
            <li> and I go so fast</li>
            <li> And the price was really reasonable.</li>
            <li> and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> They curl your hair really well</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly thanks to Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment and product as described</li>
            <li> Two suggestions: 1) the stand isn&#x27;t very stable.</li>
            <li> It is a very slippery barrel.</li>
            <li> : the glove that comes with it does not offer much protection from the heat.</li>
            <li> hair is straight and takes a lot to make it curl.</li>
            <li> would began to turn straight once again.</li>
            <li> the glove doesnt do much.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the straight barrel.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Came in on time with not issues, my wife loves it, thanks.</li>
            <li> They do start to relax after 5 hours, but they don&#x27;t go completely straight.</li>
            <li> Heats up so fast,</li>
            <li> Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast too.</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> I use my REAL name etc.  </li>
            <li> I used it one day &amp; saw my hair looking like Annie&#x27;s, too much bounce</li>
            <li> and the whole curler will rest on this metal portion on the table surface etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t do much to protect your hand from hurtng/burning while you hold your hair.</li>
            <li> I learned how to curl my hair using this; its so much easier because it doesn&#x27;t have that clippy thing.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, and works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really think I have some of the thickest hair, thicker than even the ladies that did all those how-to videos on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good to have since I constantly am clumsy and burned myself here and there.</li>
            <li> Kind of wastes all the time of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> The missing two stars are for the clunky glove and the fact that you have to drain the blood from your arms to curl your own hair.</li>
            <li> My Wife liked the one with smaller curl so returned this one and got lesser size one</li>
            <li> We own several of the Remington Pearl items and was looking for one with a larger barrel.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was missing the real feminine genes because I can&#x27;t apply makeup or do my own hair</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and the pink is so lovely.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that reaches to the middle of my back; this always give me effortless beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Letting it twist around makes such nice bouncy spirals similar to Taylor Swifts.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my own curling wand, but I found it very hard to use on myself.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is really easy to use and creates nice, big curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s willing to take the time to experiment with it perhaps 2-3 times before really relying on it for a quick morning routine or a big night out.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the glove gets hot really quick.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s humid and hot..</li>
            <li> originally bought the 1/2 inch to 1 inch wand and used to curl my whole entire head</li>
            <li> pros are several: it heats up quickly and the temperature is easy to control and lock with the digital display.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, the glove barely protects fingers from burning while curling curl with caution.</li>
            <li> : When curling the right side of your hair, have the curler in your left hand and use your right hand to wrap.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and is able to curl hair almost instantly I get compliments on my hair daily asking what product i use.</li>
            <li> With this wand, I can let my hair air dry into a frizzy mess, and twenty minutes later I can have perfect curls a la Kate Beckett from Castle.</li>
            <li> I tried the 1/2-1 inch wand on my hair the other day and fell in love.</li>
            <li> Better than any curling iron or other wand I have had before.</li>
            <li> Both pearl products are truly better than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in the quality of my curls from that of a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> Yes like others have said, it is a bit more slippery than other wands but with practice you get used to it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick, fine, and stick straight not keep curls easily</li>
            <li> It feels cheap compared to the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> When I read other reviews on Amazon about this product I was convinced it must be a miracle-worker and surely would turn my luck around.</li>
            <li> I gave up on the machine after this &amp; went back to the original curling iron</li>
            <li> I bought the small 1 inch curling wand first &amp; loved it so much I bought the larger wand and the large straightener.</li>
            <li> the glove is flimsy and I honestly do better without but VERY carefully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for this particular wand, it is infused with real pearl...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very coordinated, and I was able to figure out how to use this easily within 2 tries.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s full potential as I have not used it much, but I look forward to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I would definitely purchase while keeping in mind that the first time may not be a success, so don&#x27;t try it the morning before work.</li>
            <li> It makes perfect waves quickly and they last for days (at least 2, I wash every other day).  </li>
            <li> I can curl my whole head of long hair in less than 10 minutes, and the result is flawless loose waves.  </li>
            <li> However, I have long and thick hair, so to do my whole head took a good hour to do!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that generally doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, but with this iron I get perfectly wavy/curly hair, and it stays that way all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very attractive, and the barrel is a good size for several different styles of curls (looser using the base, or tighter at the top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use the large one for everyday use going to work and if I want super curls, the small one is great.</li>
            <li> It does the curls super fast and my curls last me all night.</li>
            <li> Gives a very pretty and soft curl that will fall into a natural wave by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I normally curl my hair with my straightener, which is fast.  </li>
            <li> but after a few tries, I was able to get the hang of it and didn&#x27;t have any more problems with it.  </li>
            <li> This hair is resistant to curling, volumizing or generally doing anything fun with it.  </li>
            <li> I would have given a full 5 stars if it actually had two gloves instead of one.</li>
            <li> With this wand it takes me about ten minutes and the curls seem to last really good for several hours.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to buy a really expensive one, this one works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to to use but it curls very well and allows different types of waves and curl that most traditional curlers don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Of course on day 1 the curls are much tighter, and on day 3, you have loose fabulous hair.  </li>
            <li> And its very easy to use, take very less time to heat up the want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> probably works better on people with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I just need to make sure to put my hair down lower on the barrel.  </li>
            <li> and i was able to curl my hair without straigtening it in advance which cuts down time and heat damage to my hair.   </li>
            <li> I had to hold the wand and curl my hair around it from top down.</li>
            <li> Curls do look better if you hold the want with the tip pointing down towards the floor FYI.</li>
            <li> so I need to move the hair down the barrel as I go to make room for more hair</li>
            <li> I find it has a tendency to &#x27;tip down&#x27; and burn the top of the counter, so I use a stone coaster underneath it and go about my day.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any of my friends because I really do like it, but in all honesty was hoping for something a little better.</li>
            <li> You can either buy a $200 curler or this very reasonable priced Remington curler n get the exact same results!</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t stay throughout the entire day, but long enough for me to look good.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought the 1/2-1&amp;#34; wand because it seemed the most popular and reviews and vids said that you can make the curls as loose or tight as you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but less is more and all I can say is....</li>
            <li> This one is so easy to use and gives very loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> However, this 1 - 1 1/2-inch curling wand by Remington for less than $20 gave me outstanding results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EASY to get burned with this unit even when I&#x27;m careful.  </li>
            <li> I use it to curl some of my top layer to help control frizz and make it seem less like I just rolled out of bed.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this particular style of wand needs some experience and/or practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the bigger curl much better than the smaller one.  </li>
            <li> I got the bigger size, which is better for waves than the smaller version.</li>
            <li> It gave me some decent waves but nothing</li>
            <li> Looked to be the better buy when compared to similar products in the similar price ranges.</li>
            <li> Makes a decent curl</li>
            <li> and I definitely think it holds curl better for a longer time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this hair wand but the only downside is that my hair won&#x27;t hold the curl for the entire day.</li>
            <li> So, either the temperature buttons are seriously not working??</li>
            <li> This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve purchased and/or handled a curling wand (vs. curling iron) and this picture was taken immediately after my first attempt at using this product.</li>
            <li> May take time for newbies to learn but my teen figured it put quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep on trying and will update my review if I can ever learn how to use this and get a decent hairstyle out of it.</li>
            <li> It is a great invention for people with really big and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The smaller smaller-diameter one makes curls like Taylor swift, while this larger barrel one looks more like</li>
            <li> I also have the smaller version of this and got the larger to create more of a wave vs a curl look.</li>
            <li> However, besides that, this works decently well.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is decent.</li>
            <li> wand REALLY curls my hair, and I have naturally stick straight silky hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
            <li> Many different ways to style your hair with this if held different.</li>
            <li> Many way more expensive then this one,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this wand is not worth $25, I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for a much better wand.</li>
            <li> its so easy to use, with a little bit of practice at first.</li>
            <li> but it curls my hair so much more faster due to the fact that I have super long hair.</li>
            <li> so when my curls lasted all day I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> After trying to hold my hair onto the barrel several times while having very hot fingers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally had at least 15 of my friends purchase it after me, because they love my curls!</li>
            <li> The wand definitely gets very hot.</li>
            <li> This larger iron gives looser curls that don&#x27;t hold as long, which is good for a different look.</li>
            <li> the curls looks much better, but I&#x27;m still pretty slow at the whole process.</li>
            <li> With this curling iron, not only do they last all day, but all night, because when I wake up in the morning, they still are distinct and full.</li>
            <li> I kept swapping between putting the glove on the left hand and the right and felt that that step was really cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to my lower back) and was originally nervous about getting the larger barrel, but it works great.</li>
            <li> &quot; loose curls by curling my hair with this wand, spraying it with L&#x27;Oreal Elnett hairspray and then lightly finger combing or brushing it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much of a barrier between the handle and the super hot part.</li>
            <li> Although it gets super hot which burned my skin to the touch if your careful</li>
            <li> I went with this size barrel since I have longer hair and didn&#x27;t want tightly coiled curls, wanted more of the Kardashian/beachy wavy thing-</li>
            <li> A lot of wands seem to taper way too fast (with long hair, this exacerbates the too much hair too little iron problem), but the shape of this one is nice and seems to make very natural-looking curls.</li>
            <li> , that don&#x27;t take good to styling, it&#x27;s very hard to do anything with them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but this come highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and i highly reccomed this product to women who have course ethinic hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I need to put this on high to get it to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wand.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly suggest that you have a heat resistant pad to set this on during use.</li>
            <li> That means my hair requires a high heat to hold a curl while also straightening out the waves.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife likes that his curler provides high heat</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can curl my mom&#x27;s thicker, harder to curl hair at a high temp and curl my fine, damaged hair at a lower temp.</li>
            <li> Once my whole head was done I resprayed my entire head, used my fingers to adjust the curls, then used a dry shampoo at the roots to give it more volume, and a shine spray.</li>
            <li> Took a couple of tries getting use to without burning myself but am fine now and don&#x27;t use the glove.</li>
            <li> Such pretty spirals!</li>
            <li> There is a little more arm yoga involved.</li>
            <li> but I know that once I practice a little more, it will be a lot easier.  </li>
            <li> and they love the little curls but</li>
            <li> I love this little curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use this often and finally have the hang of it, but watch out - this thing gets so hot!  </li>
            <li> FYI, make sure to deep moisturize since ALL hot tools dry your ends!!!</li>
            <li> Wrapping my hair around the barrel was easy when doing the left side of my head, but it was much harder to wrap the hair on the right side (I&#x27;m right-handed).</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out the best way to curl my hair, but I can now curl my long thick hair relatively fast (about 10 minutes) into loose waves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this with just a light spray of the organix coconut water spray and by the end of the day, it relaxes a little but still has really pretty bend &amp;</li>
            <li> easy to use, heats quick, several different temps for different hair types.  </li>
            <li> It curls your hair in seconds good temp  ,a little too thin for my liking get the 1.5  better and wider curls</li>
            <li> It is not too expensive and is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the glove  not being a huge help there really is no way to hold your hair against the barrel to get curled.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I haven&#x27;t used a curler for a veeery long time, and I lack every practice possible, but with this, even on the first try, my hair looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have never really been able to curl my hair with a regular curling iron but this worked very well.</li>
            <li> I also included a comparison picture of my natural straight hair vs my curled hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this product would do a great job, it&#x27;s just difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> and they stay for 3 days in normal conditions</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair, and I have shoulder length thinner hair, and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li> Normally, the morning after I flat-iron style my hair, it is all frizzy with squished curls.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot, once you get into a groove its fast (way faster than straightening actually)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments when I do my hair for work everyday.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a receipt for this item,its not even worth sending back to me because I don&#x27;t have a receipt I will not order any electronics in the mail through Amazon again</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am normally curling iron challenged.</li>
            <li> As most of the reviews state, it takes a few tried before you get the hang of using a wand versus a spring curling iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair, with no frizz.</li>
            <li> thats normal</li>
            <li> I sprayed my whole head first with Aussie Sprunch spray, then brushed my hair.</li>
            <li> The curls don&#x27;t last as long as if I use my fat iron (turn as you go), but they stay better than if I used a reguar curling iron that does not get to 410 degrees like this does.</li>
            <li> This makes curling my long hair a breeze, and I love the look of the curls I get from the larger barrel.</li>
            <li> but now I use this to curl my hair regularly since the result is totally worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t curl my hair with a normal curling iron to save my life.  </li>
            <li> and they last longer and look more natural than with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> , I have tried this wand on many of my friends and it works well on them- long hair, short hair, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really no different than how you would use a curling iron, just without the clip, so the glove is useful when wrapping your hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> I now was able to curl my thick, straight, chemically treated hair!  </li>
            <li> My hair length at the time was about under arm length, so long enough to have a good curl, but not too long that my arm length would &amp;#34;run out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Many of the good reviews say not to listen to those negative reviews and that the negative people didn&#x27;t take the time to learn how to use the tool</li>
            <li> The learning curve to this product is not hard</li>
            <li> It makes the trial and error part a lot more trial and a lot less error!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t read many other review that mention the major issue I have with this product</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim (actually got the smaller version first, but wasn&#x27;t a fan of the super curly prom queen look).</li>
            <li> product is pretty sturdy - I have had many different types of flat irons by different companies, some $ and some $$$.</li>
            <li> I have always used the curling iron with the clip, but once you practice a few times with this one it really is easy and fast.</li>
            <li> bought this back in September of 2015 and after using it fairly regularly for over a year, it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is great but be careful it only works with 110V not supporting 220V</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, but the details provided here on Amazon are NOT accurate.</li>
            <li> but for right now it isn’t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s very very hot, so you really have to be careful about burning yourself.  </li>
            <li> My sister has super long hair and it curls it all.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and tend to run out of iron before I run out of hair.</li>
            <li> If you are in a rush, take your blow dryer, set it to cool and blow dry then remove clips.</li>
            <li> This wand makes much more loose curls and not so ringlet prom like ones like the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I love wand curling irons and this made big loose curls.</li>
            <li> I get the loose curls I&#x27;ve never been able to do, and they last all day.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by how cheap it looked when I first opened the box.</li>
            <li> 1- 11/2 is a very large wand for regular curls purchase 1/2-1 .</li>
            <li> but this was easy to get down and</li>
            <li> Luckily, i was right there and caught it quickly, or i fear it could have been worse.</li>
            <li> The cord is also cheap compared to my other curling irons and straighteners.</li>
            <li> You end up with pretty big, natural looking waves - even with my stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this wand does work, and it is a good price, so despite these minor, inconvenient things I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It has low to high heat settings so you can choose how hot you want it.</li>
            <li> I live in Australia</li>
            <li> those that are new to styling wands: USE THE GLOVE.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning and getting a new clamp iron instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely wear the glove if you&#x27;re new to this.</li>
            <li> Item was as described in new box etc.</li>
            <li> I truly couldn&#x27;t live without this thing.</li>
            <li> And then trying to get the hair to stay on was a new technique to have to learn.</li>
            <li> If your new to the &#x27;wand&#x27;</li>
            <li> product was labeled new but arrived with no packaging.</li>
            <li> Well, I got new 22inch Remy hair extensions &amp; wanted a curling iron or wand to make the &amp;#34;curls, waves, etc</li>
            <li> Many reviewers said this curling wand really worked, even for those who have a hard time keeping a curl in their hair.</li>
            <li> The tool is not that hard to use (recommend watching a YouTube video for very easy instruction).</li>
            <li> I have a BabyLiss flat iron with rounded edges that also curls hair just as well and with limited space in my bathroom, the fewer products needed, the better.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and has always been hard to curl, but I have been able to make really nice loose curls with this wand and just a little hairspray.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to use and took me couple of minutes to do almost half of my head.</li>
            <li> If anything, it offers a decent degree of protection, but you still need to pay attention to what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much easier to use and takes a much shorter time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> only thing I would change about it is the pink color :)</li>
            <li> But be careful because if the iron has been on for a while this part can get pretty hot</li>
            <li> so i think this works better on me than my friend who had really thick straight</li>
            <li> I purchased because  so many women said that it even works for thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love this little wand!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quick heating and high heat element are not just a positive point but also an easy way for the untrained hand to get burned.  </li>
            <li> You definitely get the loose curling action, which i&#x27;d be satisfied with, if the curls STAYED.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with this at first, not as easy to use as you would think, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> my hair is very straight but with this I can finally waves me in the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair just kept slipping right off!</li>
            <li> Maybe if you&#x27;re an experienced hairstylist you can use this, but for an amateur like me, this is WAY too difficult to use and will now hide in my bathroom closet and provoke funny looks from guests searching for more toilet paper.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s clear that this wand does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> My hair usually cant hold curls for more than 2 or 3 hours when using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Seems like it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> This wand has different heat settings and heats up fast!</li>
            <li> The photo attached shows the result of a second day hair after trying the wand for the first time.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a 4 star, and not a 5, is I feel that the Hot Tool brand heats hair faster.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the awesome reviews, but I still can not figure out how to use it :(</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough for my hair to get curled and stay curled all day.</li>
            <li> I could never get the hang of the traditional curling iron with the clamp, I REALLY like this one!</li>
            <li> some complained of burns, I&#x27;m pretty sure you can burn yourself with any hair styling weapon if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> The heat glove definitely helped when I first started learning to use the wand.</li>
            <li> Get the hair separated into small amount group to curl would lead better result.</li>
            <li> Get hot enough to hold the curls.</li>
            <li> Pictures show my hair curled, and then what my hair looked like naturally before!</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> pretty hot(the highest is 410, which is the setting I use), at this temperature the glove immediately heats up, and if you accidentally touch it you only have a second or two to move before it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> I usually turn up the heat by two - to 390 and am able to curl my hair in 3 layers in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I only burnt both ears once</li>
            <li> stylists have been using this idea for many years now, they&#x27;d use ordinary curling irons to wrap hair around, without the clamps.</li>
            <li> I have been using the traditional curling iron with the clip, so at first I was hesitate at trying this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make consistent waves with this, maybe it&#x27;s the different lengths of my hair (some layers)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product since I finally let my hair grow out and wanted big wazy</li>
            <li> My hair DOES NOT curl but this wand got hot enough for my hair to hold a curl all day!</li>
            <li> Its more a flat pink color.</li>
            <li> Very challenging and frustrating at times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that the majority of them come from people who didn&#x27;t bother to learn how to use a curling wand first.</li>
            <li> Wen I first started using the product I burned myself quite a few times, because I wasn&#x27;t used to wrapping hair around a barrel, I was used to clamping hair to a barrel and rolling, like you do with a regular curling iron; once I got the hang of it though, I started to really like the way these curls came out, more so than the regular curling iron look</li>
            <li> Before this, I&#x27;ve always used my Hot Tools iron without the clamp so switching to the wand was a piece of cake--basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> Any working hot styling appliance will do the same to you.</li>
            <li> This curling iron will take a few tries to get used to, but it produces great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse hair and so crank this up to the highest temperature.  </li>
            <li> I lost my first one and just bought my second one.</li>
            <li> In humid weather, my naturally curly frizzy hair responds so well after being styled with the 1 1/2 inch barrel!</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and the digital temp display looks</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite product that I have purchased in the past 5 years, no kidding.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and I don&#x27;t have to leave my hair on it for very long before it produces a curl that will last all day.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and could cause some serious burns so make sure to use the included glove.</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders, mostly straight with a natural wave and does not hold a curl easily.</li>
            <li> I have super long and thick hair which has never been able to hold a curl even with my straightener, but this wand made it so easy to get the big loose curls I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for younger girls and those who are curious about using a wand - not super expensive but not cheaply made and works great!</li>
            <li> After practicing how to hold it best (pointing up on one side, and down on the other) and getting the timing right (at least ten seconds per strand), it worked well.</li>
            <li> You can make different tightnesses with this iron and you don&#x27;t have to hold it on very long because it heats up so quickly!</li>
            <li> It makes perfect loose curls on her very long and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly (wavy), long hair (several inches below my shoulders).</li>
            <li> and I rarely blow dry</li>
            <li> It does takes some time to get use to getting your hair onto the iron, but looking at few youtube tutorial it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The curls last all day, and I have completely gotten rid of my hot rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and thin, therefore my \\&quot;curls\\&quot; never lasted.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up quickly and the temperature can be adjusted but do be careful if not wearing a glove</li>
            <li> wish the iron was a little longer to spread out the curls but its fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled by the numerous positive reviews for this product, which I threw away.  </li>
            <li> - It takes a hot CHI flat iron to get some sort of shape and volume to it.</li>
            <li> After struggling with curling irons and flat irons to create consistent curls, I decided to try a curling wand.</li>
            <li> It is definitely suited better with long hair compared to medium or short hair since this is 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought a flat iron first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually on here to buy the other size as well.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase with confidence, practice and enjoy your new curls!</li>
            <li> I love the wide barrel for my super thick, medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used a different brand with the smaller barrel which creates tighter curls, which are also very pretty</li>
            <li> I have fine, HEAVY hair and within an hour of styling the waves drooped and lost their shape.  </li>
            <li> I do not care for tight curls, I prefer the larger waves to lift my hair and give it some body- from what I saw if you want more defined curls</li>
            <li> The size was quite adequate and i thought that the 410 temp would be hot enough for efficient curls, but didn&#x27;t produce anything more than slight waves which was odd for the amount of time I&#x27;d allowed to pass on each section of hair and the several attempts made.</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the large hole that was in my thermal glove.</li>
            <li> so its a little hard to use without the clip but works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bigger sized barrel of this wand is better for big loose spirals or beach waves hair styles.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and I tried this with friend who has fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, although the unit has little &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; in the center of the unit but the hot end is heavier so that it tilts onto the hot side, even with the cord hanging onto the floor!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sharp learning curve regarding how to wrap your hair around it without burning yourself, and how to old it, but once you get it down, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other wands like this though and it is very easy to curl other&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the smaller one first!</li>
            <li> If you use the larger barrel which I have, it takes a little more time and you need longer hair to do it with.</li>
            <li> The bangs slip right off of this barrel because they are not long enough to wrap around the barrel without a clasp on it, which this iron doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, and I&#x27;ve been planning for a while to try to add a little more fun to my everyday look with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the smaller version, but the bigger one works nicely too with a little hairspray or spritzing gel.</li>
            <li> The advantages over this curling wand over getting another CHI flat iron were that it was more affordable, damaged my hair less and had longer-lasting curls.</li>
            <li> also when they get &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34; they still look great, where as with a  curling iron they would look awkward.</li>
            <li> only downside is that the color is light pink and thicker shape</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a glove that clearly stated not to touch the barrel with it because it isn&#x27;t made to be heat proof.</li>
            <li> the style (curly or straight) lasts at least 2 days, they leave my hair so silky &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> Its indicated clearly that the gloves shouldnt be used to let the curler rest on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not meant to touch the wand directly.</li>
            <li> I find the temp adjustment very convenient and the only problem I have with the design is that when I press the power button it doesn&#x27;t power off unless I unplug it.</li>
            <li> I used it on the highest temperature so far, but will experiment.</li>
            <li> The glove will not protect your fingers if you put them directly onto the glove.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; traits about it.</li>
            <li> I did my hair early in the morning and went to an 8 hour shift of work.</li>
            <li> I have never used or owned a curling iron or wand before this one, so I started with this product as a complete novice.</li>
            <li> I think traditional curling irons with clips are much easier to use.</li>
            <li> only problem is that the glove transferred too much heat to my hand.</li>
            <li> Ummm, wow.  </li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand for my daughters last year and they really like it.</li>
            <li> You will burn your hand, even with the glove, if applied directly to the wand.</li>
            <li> Modestly surprised that it works well.</li>
            <li> My hair looks the same, straight.</li>
            <li> It really works, it made the curls to last</li>
            <li> It honestly only took me about 15 min to do my whole head</li>
            <li> that all I can do is straighten my hair and leave it natural.</li>
            <li> no packaging, no invoice, and  was sent directly from amazon.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with quality and performance for the price.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> but it was easier on day old hair.</li>
            <li> stick straight hair instantly.  </li>
            <li> Primarily think that me having trouble with this is my fault.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day since August 2013</li>
            <li> This product was my first ever curling wand, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get one.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my old curling iron because it broke.</li>
            <li> Natural, long-lasting, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long curly hair to begin with</li>
            <li> the next morning I got up and got ready for work and didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it but run my fingers through the waves...</li>
            <li> So my old curling iron is now retired and this is what I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
            <li> I wanted a really natural look rather than the tighter curls created by 1/2&amp;#34; and 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you ever need a passionate Account Executive to sell your product let me know ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but hoping it lasts a while (but for the price, I&#x27;m already glad I got it).</li>
            <li> And with both hands held up, over, or around your head the entire time, it&#x27;s a very tiring experience.</li>
            <li> I much rather prefer the traditional curling iron</li>
            <li> Heats really fast, only drawback is that there&#x27;s no clamp, so you have to use the glove they provide, which can be a hassle esp when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat completely, but again, it just takes some practice.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time, and even with the glove, it is hot work.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot makes big curls and will also make my hair wavy, i really really really really like it</li>
            <li> The wand really isn&#x27;t too different from a curling iron aside from the clamp, so</li>
            <li> After curling one complete side I would again spray with hairspray and leave it.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t  burned my fingers, unlike the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This means that for short hair, you&#x27;re grasping the very tip ends trying to get a wrap around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> youtube videos suggest shaking your hair; some suggest running your fingers through it to loosen the curls but not destroy the definition.</li>
            <li> not for young kids.  </li>
            <li> Before you know it you&#x27;ll be throwing your old irons out and vowing never to use them again</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy hair and have been straightening my hair and wanted to add some waves or curl into it, but this didn&#x27;t do anything to help that matter</li>
            <li> So far</li>
            <li> so far I like...  </li>
            <li> None of the professional brands were getting it done.</li>
            <li> So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> As far as holding my hair, idk.</li>
            <li> but the curls doesnt last too much time</li>
            <li> Your hair looks natural, not overdone</li>
            <li> I might get rid of this version and buy the straight barrel version from the same brand.</li>
            <li> I literarily took it out of the box and used it.</li>
            <li> but my wife only used the glove once because it seemed like it was more trouble than it was worth and not really needed.</li>
            <li> This has been my wife&#x27;s curler of choice since getting it so much so that her daughter borrowed it and will not give it back.</li>
            <li> it really helps especially when you&#x27;re a beginner with the wand.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to do some soft looking wavy curls on my hair.</li>
            <li> I personally dont like the clip and this works really well on my hair,never over-heated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my old fashioned curling iron.</li>
            <li> I might use the GLOVE , to save my flesh but its not totally necessary , Just for shorter pieces really.  </li>
            <li> First off, if you are prone to burning yourself or have short hairs at the nape of your neck that you want to curl, lay a strip of tape across your bare skin at the nape of your neck.</li>
            <li> The product is good but a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It appears as though this would be good for someone to use on someone else&#x27;s hair but is difficult to use yourself.</li>
            <li> This thing curls hair within seconds, and literally with the right products, my curls hold for 3 days straight with little to no maintenance.</li>
            <li> There definitely is a learning curve to this product... which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing as a good product doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a great hairdo.  </li>
            <li> When curling the left side of your hair, have the curler in your right hand and use your left hand to wrap.  </li>
            <li> It was way to big and did not curl right because how big it was</li>
            <li> but some time the curls are not the same size depend on how i get the iron and turn it to the left or right.</li>
            <li> The curls stay in place all day long, and I can even sleep on them and wake up only needing a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the smaller barrel of this same curling wand, not realizing there were different sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the curling iron is great for someone who has the manual dexterity to use a glove on one hand and the iron in the other, but I really hate it.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to focus more on your styling than readjusting your iron...but the Cyprus from this larger sized iron is different from the other size...</li>
            <li> Love it...works fantastic...from small curls to beach waves, this wand will do the trick!</li>
            <li> a bit about wands in general for those who are new to them.</li>
            <li> The digital thermometer showing the temperature is really easy to read and adjust up and down.</li>
            <li> I usually re-do them the next morning, but my hair is super fine and long</li>
            <li> She was confused at first no how to use this, but after watching a brief YouTube video, she understands better and has been using this.</li>
            <li> Whenever I did try to curl my hair using a normal curling iron, it would take about 2 hours and a whole lot of hair spray for it to last for only 15 mins.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for those with hair shoulder length and above, however, because the barrel size wouldn&#x27;t allow for very much curling to happen with anything above the shoulders.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very thick curly hair, so I had to straighten my hair first before using this to get the really fabulous shiny waves.</li>
            <li> It gives me really pretty loose curls.</li>
            <li> although it takes time to get used to it specially if you were using the curling irons that comes with a pattern at the beginning you might burn your fingers a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls.</li>
            <li> Hair is usually styled straight but once in a while its fun to wave it.  </li>
            <li> If you want tighter/ more defined curls I would recommend the smaller wand.&lt;br /&gt;There is a small stand at the bottom of the wand that allows it to sit on any surface without burning or sliding away.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted this wand , for big waves !</li>
            <li> however, it was pretty much useless for the shorter hair on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only gripes I have about the wand is that it takes a while to heat up and that I saw this exact same product at Walgreens a week or so after I purchased it for a couple bucks CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a top-notch wand, but no magic.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I was using a regular 1-inch curling iron and wrapping the hair around the outside, so the technique of not having a clamp was not difficult to get used to in my case, but it could throw some people off a bit.</li>
            <li> Granted i had to watch an instructional youtube video posted by a teenage girl to figure out how to use this properly, but 5 minutes and two mild burns later i was off and running.</li>
            <li> My only problem is I&#x27;m not very good at styling my own hair in the back</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair in voluminous big curls, if I sleep on them I get loose waves which are also very pretty.</li>
            <li> you spend a little extra time using a curling wand with the glove, you can produce amazing results in the same amount of time as a traditional iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long hair and the outcome was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> other reviewers cover the details here, so I don&#x27;t want to repeat a lot, but I think that if you&#x27;ve got fairly long hair, i.e., shoulder or longer, and it&#x27;s not baby fine, it should work for you.</li>
            <li> And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the temp control buttons sit right where your fingers go while styling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this especially at this price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough protection from the high heat.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, my old curling iron was very old and hardly working anymore.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly and very frizzy hair-no other curling iron has been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls even after a curling iron or mousse/hairspray</li>
            <li> My soft wavy curl can last me the whole day without adding extra hairspray.</li>
            <li> It makes normal sized curls and at the tip, smaller sized ones.</li>
            <li> It does get hot and it does burn so be careful.  </li>
            <li> I find the flat iron produces the exact same look.</li>
            <li> It certainly is a nice hair curler, but performed no better than any other device.</li>
            <li> I grew up using a straightening iron on my thick, coarse, naturally frizzy hair, and I&#x27;m so glad I made a change and ordered this curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (mid back length) and the bigger barrel seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> No problems, strong 2-day long curls, super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was probably an issue with rough shipping and handling, as my package was actually shipped in a box way too large for the small curlers box.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think sence the curler is so big you can use big sections of hair but for me I can&#x27;t use big sections or it does not look right .</li>
            <li> It can be a little awkward to use, but once you figure out how to angle it, it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use (not that hard to burn your finger</li>
            <li> I tried this beauty appliance on my daughter&#x27;s hair, because my own hair is rather thin, and she has a lovely crown of long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love the loose beautiful curls this makes, hate that it is tapered which makes it a challenge to keep your hair from sliding down the barrel, it makes you nearly run out of curling iron to wrap your hair.</li>
            <li> Now, although my old one still works (holy cow!), I have also bought the fatter one now that my hair is down to my butt..for more voluptuous curls.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take long to girl, quickly wrap my hair around it and let it loose.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use very little hairspray because the curl is so good on it.  </li>
            <li> Very cool but in the first couple of times was difficult to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I cannot unfairly rate this, it could be me and it does give me big beautiful loose curls after I&#x27;m done styling..</li>
            <li> Definitely jump on YouTube and watch some instructional videos if wands are new to you.</li>
            <li> I had been in the market for a new curling iron and was wanting to try a clampless iron, such as a curling wand.</li>
            <li> You can only use this wand if you live in the US or you have a voltage convertor, because this wand uses the 110 volt system here in The Netherlands we use 220 volt system.</li>
            <li> If you want huge bouncy curls that can last up to almost 2 days, heavy hair or even the lightest-</li>
            <li> , one complaint is that it easily gets that burnt smell on it that stays on the iron and transfers to your hair every time you curl it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up really fast and the various temperature settings convenient, along with the digital display.</li>
            <li> fun to use on long long hair.</li>
            <li> completely amazed that something has actually worked on my hair to curl it, just when I almost gave up completely...</li>
            <li> She has given up on her old curling irons completely and loves how the curls stay in longer than her traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> La really think it is because one must know how to use either use some product to make waves prior to last you longer</li>
            <li> First off, the wand is slippery and your hair will not stay on it even long enough to be wound up.</li>
            <li> You need hair that is at least shoulder-length to be able to actually curl your hair.</li>
            <li> Long spiral waves are pretty on a teenage girl.</li>
            <li> This is first curling iron I&#x27;ve used that gives my hair long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> Overall I really recommend this product especially if you want beach waves.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes a lot longer since you can only use so much hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks when I use this tool, and it takes me only 20 min to do my hair (shoulder length, thick, curly/frizzy).</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, and before this curling wand, I wasn&#x27;t able to keep curls in my hair even with a massive amount of gel, hairspray and whatever else you can use to make your hair look like it was glued onto your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few quick videos online can help the learning process.  </li>
            <li> curls my hair nicely, but may be harder for shorter than shoulder length hair since it&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
            <li> Tried to keep at it and endure, but each session was just more and more annoying.</li>
            <li> It heated quickly and there are quite a few settings.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1&amp;#34; - 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling wand, as I am not a fan of small, tight curls, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Hold wand with right hand pointy side down and wrap hair away from face.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and this wand gives me the big, glamorous waves I love!</li>
            <li> I had to unplug it and let it cool down because there was burnt carpet residue left on the wand&#x27;s barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I even bought one for my sister &#x27;cause her hair is even thicker and longer than mine and it curled it like no other</li>
            <li> So normally I don&#x27;t believe all of the hype when it comes to beauty products, especially hair tools and products because it seems that so many just don&#x27;t work for me, but I wanted to try this as I was tired of those Shirley Temple like curls...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems getting curls to stay with my long, thick and heavy hair but this curling iron works great.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair goes flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;m not exactly the most hair-savvy person on the planet and have enough trouble with regular curling irons.</li>
            <li> loose curls+no staying power&#x3D; STRAIGHT HAIR.</li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to curl and even more so for the curls to stay.</li>
            <li> This is good for those with long, or very thick hair that usually have difficulty getting curls, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Definitely use the included glove if you&#x27;re new to the curling game - you can feel the heat through the glove if you&#x27;re holding your hair in place for more than ~5 seconds.</li>
            <li> So, I would say too much effort for no particular advantage, and this thing has sat in the drawer for a month now, unused and unloved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with straight, flat hair and I curl my hair a LOT.</li>
            <li> and you want it still long but with curl, flat iron first section by your shoulders then curl the rest.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy thick hair to begin with, but this wand produces a much more polished look than if I were to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> Works well on fine but thick type 2b hair.</li>
            <li> make sure you are very careful, I have burned my hand a few times.</li>
            <li> Not cool for somebody who has a lifetime of holding styling tools in their right hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not new to using curling products, this iron is just cheaply made and feels like it will fall apart in less than a year of use.</li>
            <li> The highlights: she suggested parting your hair into a low, middle and high level.</li>
            <li> With this is the same it depend on how you curl the hair around and how high or low you start.</li>
            <li> It does give u a nice curl, however, the hair kinda sticks to the barrel (without any product in hair) and its hard to slide the hair down the barrel to curl it.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair (between shoulder blades and waist length) that has a very slight wave.  </li>
            <li> I leave the bottom layers alone and usually just use some curl activator or mousse depending on what I have on hand and how much time I have to get ready.</li>
            <li> My first attempt I did use the glove, and I&#x27;m glad because the wand is really awkward to use when you&#x27;re not used to it, and I probably would have burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gives long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I still use my old, standard run of the mill iron.</li>
            <li> And the only time my hair stays curled is when I have my salon lady curl it professionally.</li>
            <li> Like anything else, it took some time to learn how to use it properly, but I ended up giving away my curling iron because it was completely replaced by this wand.</li>
            <li> just be careful and you can go twice as fast and was alot easier.</li>
            <li> Despite using hair product and setting the wand to 410, the initial result was soft curls, and in some sections just waves-</li>
            <li> I finally got the soft, beach waves in my hair that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely really girly as it has a pearly pink ceramic wand.</li>
            <li> then my old wand that has a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> It curls your have and 2 hours later it drops completely.</li>
            <li> Putting on a glove and winding the hair around a hot cylinder is not really very much fun.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a low price product that works at a professional level, this is it.</li>
            <li> but after an hour or two of being outside my hair completely drops..</li>
            <li> Yes, the gloves aren&#x27;t completely heat proof, but then you wouldn&#x27;t have the necessary dexterity.</li>
            <li> I have human hair extensions and the Remington styler made my fake (and real) hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Up until now, I had only used a blow dryer as far as heat tools</li>
            <li> When I purchased the small one first, five years ago, my hair was short and straight.</li>
            <li> but you just have to be careful haha)</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical but</li>
            <li> was kind of difficult to get used to handle it without burning my fingers even though&lt;</li>
            <li> I was tired of using the curling irons where you clip your hair inside the barrel (no clue how to better explain that), so I thought I would try out this one.</li>
            <li> so I was kind of skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use product in her hair as it usually weighs it down even more, and she plans on sticking with the old school clip style curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These multiple size barrels are great, they can change up the curls and waves nicely and make a more natural look, but because the barrel gets smaller on the way down, it does mean if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it can be frustrating and difficult to keep your hair even on it, without slipping....</li>
            <li> At first when I used it, the heat was moving up and down because I kept pressing it with my finger.</li>
            <li> I have weird Mediterranean hair, its wavy on top really frizzy and super curly on the bottom; when I try to straighten it with my Chi it takes me at least an hour.</li>
            <li> As far as use, I think I still prefer a curling iron over a wand as this can be hard to hold while making sure you aren&#x27;t burning your other hand that&#x27;s holding onto your hair tip.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wand in the size 1&amp;#34;-1 1/2&amp;#34; because I wanted to get a looser curl, not tight ringlets like the smaller model gives you.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast,  curls my frizzy dry hair into shiny slick bouncy curl that last even in south florida.  </li>
            <li> but I have fine hair and am afraid to get it too hot!</li>
            <li> It may take a few times to get used to using a wand and turing your hair the right way</li>
            <li> but it gives long lasting curls to my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and the lack of a clip makes this tool slightly precarious.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with hot irons on my carpet, but this one burned it in less than five minutes while I did my make up.</li>
            <li> However, the wand is much easier to use to achieve loose waves and to avoid an indent from the clasp of a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my sister picked up this styling wand a while back, and I noticed right away from the shape of her curls that it was different than other irons.  </li>
            <li> The glove that comes with it is more like a regular mitten for cold weather and doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat very much.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds, even the spin your hair into a curl and it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> But, remington is still my fav due to the ease of temp control and how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> The coating on the wand provides a buffer so her hair does not burn as fast as on other curlers.</li>
            <li> Do be careful not to burn yourself if it&#x27;s your first time using one, though - especially tips of the fingers and back of the neck.</li>
            <li> My curls last for ever and aren&#x27;t to tight right after i curl them.  </li>
            <li> Its the only thing that has ever been able to curl my thick long hair; would defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that sometimes my hair doesn&#x27;t fit on it.  </li>
            <li> As has been noted, it takes a few uses to get used to the grip of the wand: you really want to keep it nearly inverted.</li>
            <li> The only thing that annoys me is when I wrap a piece of hair around the barrel, it tries to slide to the very tip because of the conic shape.</li>
            <li> wand does not dry out your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I burned my ear a little bit the first time)</li>
            <li> Using this iron can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky at first</li>
            <li> but when my boyfriend&#x27;s sister curled my hair with hers (and a little hairspray) and the curls held pretty well.</li>
            <li> * Work from back to front in each half section (left &amp; right side)</li>
            <li> The barrel was too large, even though I have long hair and was looking for loose curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight but most of the weight is concentrated at the pink part that it&#x27;s rather difficult to control.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that I&#x27;m not experienced enough on how to make a \\&quot;style\\&quot; happen with it - but that will come with practice, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> As suggested, I watched a few online tutorials to get the gist of wand curling techniques before my first use</li>
            <li> I had to buy another one because I killed mine in China with the voltage being much higher than here.</li>
            <li> and I burned myself a few times a first, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> You have to wrap the hair TIGHTLY around the wand (with your gloved hand), with the wand facing down to get the best curl and hold it there for at least 5 seconds, if not more, depending on your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take some getting used to, as my hair wants to slide down to the slimmer end.</li>
            <li> I got it down and my whole head curled in under 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the straight barrel version that is one width all the way down the shaft.</li>
            <li> The glove is not thick enough and also doesn&#x27;t cover your wrist sufficiently - when you&#x27;re wrapping your hair around the wand your bare wrist and forearm are exposed and always dangerously close to touching that +400F wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and have extremely long, straight hair, getting the right size curls &amp; keeping those curls are hard for me to find as I have tried everything from steam rollers to flat irons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never mastered the curling iron, and for a serious plain Jane like me, I can actually use this thing and I love it!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, I got big, bouncy curls that STAYED - and with a little bit of hairspray, they stayed for a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other curling irons and the curls don&#x27;t last, with this curling iron curls last much longer.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that when you&#x27;re holding the handle, your hands are right on the power and temperature buttons, and I frequently turn it off or change temperatures when I don&#x27;t mean to.</li>
            <li> The pink color was discontinued, so I ordered a like new one off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I began researching for a wand (clamp-free) iron, and stumbled upon this Remington model that was highly rated by other Amazon reviewers.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast; less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> It was all black and didn&#x27;t match the photo, but I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with that.</li>
            <li> Oh and the gloves aren&#x27;t really heat gloves, they&#x27;re just black mittens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super clumsy so probably not compatible with this apparatus.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is just a few inches longer, just past shoulder length, it works much better.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly,  don&#x27;t damage my delicate hair,</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t need to use a hair dryer to loosen these curls, but i did find that slipping the curl off the wand and holding it in my hand to cool for a few seconds radically improved the quality of the curl.</li>
            <li> It heats up to high 400 degree temps just like the other but creates larger curls.  </li>
            <li> In the end, the wand delivered on its promise of loose, natural looking curls without the clamp marks.</li>
            <li> somedays limp and somedays just phenomenally smooth and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and traditional curling irons never worked for me.</li>
            <li> Also, the glove has no special properties, so it does absolutely nothing to prevent being burn.</li>
            <li> my hair is thin, fine, and</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thin and fine hair that falls just below my shoulders, for reference.</li>
            <li> If you have fine or thin hair and you wrap your hair around the  barrel</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is super thick (I divide it into about ten sections and curl), it only takes 12-15 minutes to get lots of volume and style!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting it, especially for the price, compared to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to manipulate, but with the included glove it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I really like them both, but like this larger one just a tiny bit less than the smaller one.</li>
            <li> it is very heavy and tends to weigh down, so curls tend to flatten easily.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;m just new to curling my hair and other people don&#x27;t have any problem or need any advice.</li>
            <li> We initially believed the curling wand to be broken, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I hold the wand upside down (tapered end down) at a slight angle, more towards horizontal.</li>
            <li> have very straight blonde hair and can&#x27;t usually hold a curl.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it down, and the iron gets extremely hot, so be careful, and use the glove that it comes with until you get used to using this iron.</li>
            <li> Long, naturally dead straight, thick, and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new curling iron and came across the curling wands.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair which curls relatively easily.</li>
            <li> I have super long thick hair</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not quite 12, and I was a little worried about her getting burned since it does go to such a high temperature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with long straight permed hair, but I crave a little wave.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only problem is that it is not long enough for long hair!</li>
            <li> I have super thick, very long hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the chord - I wish it were a bit longer and flat as it can tangle a bit</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a regular curling iron, a flat iron, and this wand for adding waves/curls to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron from the same line, so thought I&#x27;d try this curler.</li>
            <li> When I curl my hair using this wand, the curls last for at least 24 hours, usually even more than that.</li>
            <li> the little resting stands are purely just to keep it from rolling, and are only a CM or 2 in height, so any surface it is on is blazing hot within a few seconds of putting it down.</li>
            <li> I have a head full of very thick, curl resistant, Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> At first, it&#x27;s so hard learning to hold the wand properly and not burning your fingers while wrapping your hair around it.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a second star because I have very thick, naturally pin-straight hair which is most likely a factor in the failure of this curling iron</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the shape of small to larger on the curl.  </li>
            <li> I like the larger iron because I have long hair &amp; it gives me a wavy look instead of the tighter curls from the smaller wands.</li>
            <li> not only last all day, they are usually even decent the next day!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy thick fine slightly wavy shoulder length  hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the barrel would too thin to give my hair big waves, but that wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> So much quality for so little money!</li>
            <li> My daughter has the small barrell wand and wanted the large barrell for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how much hair you section off, you can do really loose curls, or tight spiral curls.</li>
            <li> Third, for me personally with naturally super straight hair the highest heating setting on this is not high enough to create a curl in my hair just an awkward wave.</li>
            <li> like the slight increase in curl size variety this wand offers over a traditional curling iron or a wand that is all one width.</li>
            <li> Overall, great iron, bad glove!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, this is the cheapest curling wand on the market (or at least that I&#x27;m aware of).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clumsy with this because there&#x27;s no handle to grip with my thumb while spinning the curling iron</li>
            <li> and they usually don&#x27;t hold a curl very well</li>
            <li> The sort of problems I&#x27;ve never had to deal with before when using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Unlike the YouTube videos where gals were twirling long locks over the barrel, I have short hair</li>
            <li> the curls last a long time</li>
            <li> Only for long hair.</li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t accidentally be left on for a long time.</li>
            <li> One tip I did learn is to wrap the hair around the barrel flat, do not let the hair twist.  </li>
            <li> rollers, flat iron, curling iron..</li>
            <li> ; waves with a flat iron</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- long lasting curls&lt;</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim - I can never get curls to stay in my hair using a curling iron or flat iron method.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I barely get a couple of turns around it and not much curl.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a struggle to keep my hair wrapped around it long enough.</li>
            <li> I had long hair and recently cut to just below my collar bone.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think my hair is long enough...</li>
            <li> hair is similar to hers, but not quite as long, and mine is maybe a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> However, as for technique, it may be that my hair is not yet long enough.</li>
            <li> I was about to flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> Basically you have to keep the hair section completely flat.</li>
            <li> I had the smaller version of this, but my hair is just too long.</li>
            <li> I am not cordinated enough to wrap my long hair and hold it with a glove.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have long hair, buy a wand with a smaller diameter.  </li>
            <li> Just buy a normal curling iron, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, but not unmanageable, and this curling iron did absolutely nothing, not a curl, not a wave, NADA!</li>
            <li> The digital temperature is nice to tone down the heat to use on my 5 year old&#x27;s thin hair or turn up for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My curls come out smooth (a huge plus, as they would frizz horribly with traditional irons) and last all day, and through the next if I use enough hair</li>
            <li> When I found the same one on Amazon, I was a little surprised at the price</li>
            <li> The glove definitely doesn&#x27;t protect against the heat of the iron completely and the curling bar still needs a clip on it to hold the hair in place no matter if you are using the small end or the larger mid section.  </li>
            <li> I personally find that the glove makes the process more tedious, and I don&#x27;t burn myself while curling my hair without the glove as long as I am careful.</li>
            <li> It makes curls that last a long time, and when they do &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34;, it looks like a beachy type of curl!</li>
            <li> And, when I say heats up - I mean that it becomes burning hot.</li>
            <li> My hair has only become more difficult to manage since having a baby and losing a lot of my hair due to hormones.</li>
            <li> The only tricky thing is, for those w/naturally curly hair like me who want a polished look - I dry all my hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the glove that comes with it doesn&#x27;t help much, as you can still feel the heat through the glove.</li>
            <li> The iron worked as well as an expensive salon iron and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine only a few times since purchasing it and so far have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I did not read carefully, and I thought I was getting a regular curling iron, but this is not one with the regular clamp.  </li>
            <li> Ditch the glove and just be extra careful, or buy a glove that would protect you from an actual burn.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There really needs to be a ridge at the base of the barrel to prevent your fingers from accidentally touching the iron.</li>
            <li> I have really straight, long, and thick hair and everytime that I would curl my hair with any other curling iron by the time that I was completely finish my hair</li>
            <li> The larger barrel allows for big fluffy waves and the tapered end can give pretty little ringlets too!</li>
            <li> considering my hair reaches far past the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> I chose this one because my flat iron is a Remington and has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Gives me the loose big curls I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> (I used to wrap it around the outside of the barrel and clamp to get loose waves, trust me....</li>
            <li> bought because I wanted bigger loose curls.</li>
            <li> This actually gives my hair the loose beachy waves I&#x27;ve been trying to learn how to do.</li>
            <li> I have really persistent straight hair and holds curl very poorly regardless of the combination of products used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first, but I quickly got the hang of it after watching several YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> I received my item in the mail in a white cardboard  box with no actual packaging from Remington other than the manual.</li>
            <li> The rod is thick so the curls are large, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The black part that connects to the pink part (where it connects) pulls the hair if you aren&#x27;t careful in wrapping the hair exactly on the pink barrel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wave/curls look natural because of the taper and with a little hairspray, stay in my hair until I wash</li>
            <li> FYI, I have have long, very thick, very straight, yet textured Asian hair.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t really that hard</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and wasn&#x27;t too hard to get the hang of ( without the glove).  </li>
            <li> When it was hard to use the curling irons with a clip for me and watched this product, I thought that it was very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally my curls last all day and even into the next day with little or no hairspray.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and has a small stand so you can set it down on the counter while you adjust your hair.  </li>
            <li> My curls also last a veyy long time!!!</li>
            <li> So pretty with loose, casual waves, very natural looking and</li>
            <li> I had to use a different one because the one that came with this wand still allows most of the heat through and that can be painful if not used properly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but it is messy curly</li>
            <li> You do have to be extra careful to not burn yourself</li>
            <li> Curls stay in for a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as long as the 1/2 inch wand does...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a grey curler.</li>
            <li> It has a wide barrel for a larger curl.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t take long to feel the heat even with the glove on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s absolutely no way I could achieve the big, voluminous curls I wanted with this product.</li>
            <li> /how long you have your hair wrapped around the wand.</li>
            <li> If you want to go the extra mile, when the curl comes out, cup the curl in your hand for 5 sec.</li>
            <li> My hair is not soft at all</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend ALWAYS using the glove, and also to be careful of where your hand is on the handle.</li>
            <li> It requires practice and patience after using curling irons for so long.</li>
            <li> so you need to be extra careful.....</li>
            <li> But it always took forever since my hair is long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to curl all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and with this product it took me literally 10 mins to get all my hair curled just the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> It works as expected and I like having the digital temperature display.</li>
            <li> I have long layered hair.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone that has medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> The soft curls and waves that I did get fell within a few hours and</li>
            <li> but I guess that comes with experience and not been using this that long.  </li>
            <li> but my hair got too long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the wand style</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to curl my hair for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> My long hair (combined with the tapered design) sometimes slips off the end.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of hair, long to mid-back</li>
            <li> But now it can take me 5-10 minutes to look put together as opposed to the hour long ordeal of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to say the result if you like to have a soft wavy curl for everyday look then get this, but if you are looking for pageant hair style then this is not the one to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a long time</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> i used to use a straightner to curl my hair and those curls would stay in long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would of stayed being that my hair is really long</li>
            <li> /&gt;i haven&#x27;t used this too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a very efficient way to curl short hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is also really long, to my waist</li>
            <li> or maybe it is because my girls have a really long hair</li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get used to curling, but it curls faster and cuter than the old style curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> It did take some practice to get the hang of using it though, and I feel like the curls do not stay in for as long as I want them to.</li>
            <li> just strange.  </li>
            <li> Also, I found the larger barrel harder to use as the hair slides off easier.</li>
            <li> I like both and with long hair</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t tell you... CLIP each CURL in place with a Duck Bill Clip (Long Clips).</li>
            <li> And, with relative ease!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention the pink part of the wand is ceramic and slippery.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product didn&#x27;t work for met at all.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, hair that can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it wants to be wavy or curly.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it hold very well.  </li>
            <li> Since I have very long and thick hair, plus the large amount....</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that has been problematic since I was little.</li>
            <li> Even with my hair being the typical Asian hair (thick and straight), I can get curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li> This wand makes it impossible to keep your hair from just sliding off, and no matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried and different techniques I&#x27;ve used, my hair just never curls like advertised.  </li>
            <li> I mean really</li>
            <li> Other than that small inconvenience, it heats up fast.</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m sure totally changes the game, and makes my review null and void for people with short and/or thin</li>
            <li> She was ecstatic when she opened it because although she is only ten she loves styling her and her little sisters hair.</li>
            <li> I have read that ceramic curling irons provide longer lasting curls than irons made out of other materials</li>
            <li> It gives some variety in the tightness of the curl since it&#x27;s larger on one end than the other.  </li>
            <li> : this gets HOT (duh!).  </li>
            <li> Makes bigger, fuller curls than my other wand.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive</li>
            <li> I create big waves with it in my hair and they last TWO days with a little hairspray.</li>
            <li> The curls produced by this wand last way longer than those from any other curling irons I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It does the job like more expensive name brands does but for a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because I wanted an alternative to my other Remington wand that creates a smaller curl.</li>
            <li> My only complaint really is that it doesn&#x27;t have anything to prop itself up on when you set it down, so you have to watch where and how you balance it as it&#x27;s heating up.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and use dry shampoo on my non-wash days, and the curls still stay in, even after brushing them multiple times.</li>
            <li> It tries so hard, yet does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> may be too short/small for very long hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and it works well.</li>
            <li> I notice that my curls don&#x27;t hold very long, but that might be for lack of product-</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> The curls don&#x27;t look dry and damaged after.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even use any product- just wash, dry, and curl.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> In between those days, I use dry shampoo so I can keep my hair</li>
            <li> I would wash my hair and air dry for an hour, braid my hair before bed and then take sections of my hair and curl it with this wand.  </li>
            <li> i try anything too dry</li>
            <li> MY HAIR DOSENT FEEL DRY</li>
            <li> I have never been able to properly use a curling iron without have those ugly creases at the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair, it takes 5 mins to give it some waves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several clip less irons and know how to use them properly but still It takes a couple tries to get the hair around the iron and hold it there.</li>
            <li> The curls I got with this product are hard to explain.. not tight curls, but not big ones either.</li>
            <li> i suspect its not new</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my long hair tends to slip down the barrel, but this seems to happen with any curling wand.</li>
            <li> About me: Long hair down to my lower back, cut in layers.</li>
            <li> I typically have trouble keeping curls in using a normal curling iron and rollers,</li>
            <li> My only other beef with it is that my hair always seems to only stay around the bottom half to 1/3 when I&#x27;m curling it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on other styling products (such as my flatiron)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a normal iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have frizzy hair on shower day, and flat, limp hair the following.  </li>
            <li> As long as I&#x27;m careful then I won&#x27;t burn myself and haven&#x27;t done so.</li>
            <li> barrel of the Remington is wider toward the base and thinner at the top allowing the user to create curls of different types, which was different from the two Jose Eber irons that I have that are all one width.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pretty annoyed that I got a used one, it was send in bubblewrap, so</li>
            <li> Usually very expensive ones ( often given FREE for a &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; of the product!) .</li>
            <li> My experience was that my hair was too straight and slick that I no matter how tight I wound my hair around the barrel</li>
            <li> My daughter had the smaller diameter wand and the curls were too tight for my long hair.</li>
            <li> it just wouldn&#x27;t adhere long enough to get a tight curl.</li>
            <li> It never turned on and it sounded as though there was loose wiring inside of it.</li>
            <li> The 1-1.5 inch creates loose waves.</li>
            <li> I can get a loose wavy style done in under 7 minutes</li>
            <li> with longer hair who want loose waves.</li>
            <li> but this curling iron creates a loose, barely-discernible wave that promptly falls out in a matter of an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted loose beachy curls.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affordable, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do... creates loose</li>
            <li> which makes you let go.. which leaves loose or ill-formed curls.  </li>
            <li> For new &#x27;wand&#x27; users too, I recommend you tubing a &#x27;how to&#x27; (because it&#x27;s hard to explain how to use it through words.)</li>
            <li> only wish it was a little longer; I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I find it much easier and quicker to style my (long and thick) hair with this clampless curling wand rather than the one I had previously with the clamp.</li>
            <li> only bad thing is that you have to be really aware of what you set it down on, because it doesn&#x27;t really prop up the way its supposed to so</li>
            <li> Although I only left it on for a few minutes (on the carpet by accident), this has never happened before with any other hair styling tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have very long hair and the curl lasted in my hair all day!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and goes into small tight curls that get frizzy when exposed to outside.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to use, and when it gets hot, the glove provided doesn&#x27;t really help since it doesnt do the job well because of its poor quality.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be easy, but it is awkward</li>
            <li> but then I started to only curl the bottom half of my hair for which I used the 1 inch side of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many tools in the past that i completely failed at using</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it smells like the previous owners burnt hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that is possible because you can&#x27;t wrap short hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> The only slight downside for me is the design of the handle - I often hit the temp control buttons while I&#x27;m styling.</li>
            <li> , I always towel dry so its not like I take this stick to a wet patch.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> Barely curls my hair and is very slippery and difficult to keep my hair on.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because every time I use this wand I get some hair strands caught in the spot where the barrel meets the black plastic tip.</li>
            <li> long, soft and semi thick.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time (and patience) to get the hang of using this tool, but after a few attempts you&#x27;ll be styling like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;The glove is not completely heat proof, but then again it was never meant to hold directly on the wand.</li>
            <li> This wand does wonders on my STRAIGHT, THICK hair that goes down to my waist.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple times on different occasions, and it just gives a very limp curl.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, so wearing the protective glove is quite useless.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy, puffy, and thick!</li>
            <li> It gives you the nice loose curls instead of those ugly tight ones.</li>
            <li> Fine enough, usually you see a metal wire that does the same thing near the base of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1/2 inch to 1 inch rod (same brand) results in long-lasting tight curls.</li>
            <li> I have a tapered rod that is 1/4&amp;#34; smaller throughout and the curls were just a tad too tight for my liking...</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy, layered hair that goes down just below the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use the mitt or it becomes a crazy juggling mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no pro, but after reading the other reviews, I sort of expected this wand to work miracles on my long hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to put hair spray in and the curls have only fell a little in 3</li>
            <li> and I was stunned that this little wand actually did the trick of holding curls in my hair.  </li>
            <li> With a little product they last all day, and there is no need to use the highest heat setting!</li>
            <li> It did take some getting used to in order to get the exact look I wanted (loose waves as opposed to ringlets because since it tapers my hair would go down to the thin end</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair as much as other products.</li>
            <li> would fall flat within half an hour.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item for that like loose curly look!</li>
            <li> I concur with other reviewers that this is essential for new users to avoid frustration and unnecessary hair damage.  </li>
            <li> Even though I had read countless reviews and watched numerous videos, the curls ended up being tighter than I wanted and found it hard to get the results I desired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see all the negative reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Lo must use the glove is that it is difficult to use and buy it with much illusion but actually does curl as the pictures you had averiguado.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s heavier on the pink part, it will just drop at the tip and burn your carpet or whatever you have underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair keeps slipping off.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Had problems with the hair slipping towards the end of the wand, but eventually got used to it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful using it, and if you are not an expert using curling wands</li>
            <li> I found my arms were getting tired fast.</li>
            <li> Few things:  - I have super-straight, difficult-to-style Asian hair.</li>
            <li> so I sectioned, took a wide piece of hair and laid it over the barrel horizontally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time well spent</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it within a couple of tries.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be burned if you use the glove and be careful.</li>
            <li> so I have to be really careful with heat</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected when you buy a used curling iron.</li>
            <li> Really wide barrel</li>
            <li> It takes a few sessions to transition from using a regular curling iron all your life to using a rod, but it&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
            <li> one thing I really do not like about this product is the rest/kick stand.</li>
            <li> i spent</li>
            <li> I would always wind up with a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; where the clamp closed.</li>
            <li> I only give this four stars because at this point the product has become redundant in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I feel crushed, I wanted this to work</li>
            <li> 1 inch wide lock of hair.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected.</li>
            <li> She watched a few videos on how to use this prior to getting it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful that you do not burn you neck</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work ,if i try 50,60,70% wet</li>
            <li> but no luck after two tries.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you curl your hair roughly, then brush it for a voluminous look.</li>
            <li> But was not a shiny purplish color as I expected from photo.</li>
            <li> This makes very very very loose waves...</li>
            <li> It is just as expected.  </li>
            <li> for whom curious about voltage usage it&#x27;s printed on the product and also the manual booklet</li>
            <li> you need to be careful not to burn your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> This product is everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to prevent burns until you are used to using it.</li>
            <li> the glove that comes with it is not very helpful at protecting your hand from the heat.  </li>
            <li> and it last me a few days.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly as expected.</li>
            <li> So I got it and just like I expected perfict curls that lasts.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner, and was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the prettiest shade of baby pink...</li>
            <li> and I can prevent the slipping if I adjust the position or hold I have on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to be careful though it heats up to like 400 degrees...</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to burn your self.</li>
            <li> Takes a few practices to figure out the different waves and curls</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time wrapping my hair around the barrel because it kept slipping (it might be my hair).</li>
            <li> so be careful if you have protruding ears</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair that generally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl without a ton of product.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and can curl my hair quicker than straightening and the curls last for the day-Love it!</li>
            <li> my long, thick head of hair, it usually takes me 15-20 minutes to curl my whole head, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> But Every time my hair slips too close to the base of the wand, my hair gets caught and the only way to get it out most of the time is to rip my hair out.</li>
            <li> I have also tried this on short hair and  coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> For this curler, i have put it on my ironing board when its not as hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when i slowly let the hair drop and press them inside my palm, the heat get distributed and stay on inside the hair for a longer time, making the curls last longer to the next day</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying</li>
            <li> I burned the crap out of myself, but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> Being used to a Chi, it&#x27;s annoying to wait 5 minutes for this iron to be at an effective temperature.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally wavy hair that typically takes 30-40 minutes to curl.</li>
            <li> and it was near impossible to get it all on the wand or get a pretty curl.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is they sent it to me in a different color than the pink!</li>
            <li> friend was unable to use the product because her hair would just fall right off the wand.</li>
            <li> that weird pink color looks particularly funky and indecent if you get a larger barrel</li>
            <li> Way easier than an iron and can get both of our long hair done within a half hour.</li>
            <li> I used youtube to look up how to use a wand and the results where amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive curling iron if you don&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to hold the hair on the barrel for very long so that cuts down on styling time.</li>
            <li> The stand the rod sits on is very shallow and doesn&#x27;t hold the heat far enough away from the surface.</li>
            <li> ONLY, it is actually a dual voltage tool apparently, so its wrongly labeled or something,</li>
            <li> since you have to use your fingers to hold your hair onto wand, long hair tends to want to slip down toward small end of wand hence giving you a smaller curl than attempted.</li>
            <li> and you can make lose or tight curls depending on how long you hold your hair on the wand for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only curled my long thick hair once with it</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair with coarse waves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use gel or hairspray, and the curls last for about 4-6 hours before drooping a little, but the curls stayed until I washed my hair again!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes hair slips out when wrapping it, but in general it is not too hard to use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the little crevice where the actual wand and the handle connect</li>
            <li> i have thick wavy/curly hair down to my mid back and this has cut my curl in time in half.</li>
            <li> I already had the small size Remington curling rod, so I knew I wanted to stay with the same reliable brand.</li>
            <li> Curling wands are not for inexperienced users!</li>
            <li> Be careful of burning yourself-easy to do!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just uncoordinated, but it was pretty difficult to wrap hair around.</li>
            <li> totally difficult to use.. came malfunction - too dangerously hot to use .</li>
            <li> And I say just about because I am a tool, and sometimes get it wrong in my rush when I first awaken from my slumber.)</li>
            <li> Just use a wide barrel curing iron!  </li>
            <li> I burned my fingers, and due to my lack of experience with curling irons I zinged my ears and neck a couple of times before calling it a day.</li>
            <li> With a gloved hand I smoothed it over the barrel as the other hand pulled the wand up.  </li>
            <li> so I cant compare it to any other.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this and finally have a curler, and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it make it extremely to wrap the hair around the barrel.</li>
            <li> In other words, this size of curling rod is for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I saw other people mention they don&#x27;t use the glove, but I do.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use the glove because I find that it hinders my process, but I will say that you do need to be careful!  </li>
            <li> I bought it because of the other reviews and it did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I like the wand, its look and feel but even when using gel and hairspray and other products, does not hold curl well....</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t take anymore time then any other curling iron, 10 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I received endless comments using this wand.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY</li>
            <li> Bonus: it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> With other curling methods I would have to use a lot of hairspray to keep my</li>
            <li> But the stand is small enough that it doesn’t get in your way like on some other models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a rubber stopper at the end of the wand that prevents your hair from sliding off (this has been a problem with other wands that I’ve used) and it also gives me a place to rest my fingers while I’m holding the tip of my hair.</li>
            <li> ; because it wasn&#x27;t curling the way I would see other people who would use curling a wands looked.</li>
            <li> Second, it has a small stand attached to wand but doesn&#x27;t hold it up.</li>
            <li> so you have to manually wind your hair around a hot instrument wearing a silly glove.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this I was skeptical because it didn&#x27;t have a clip</li>
            <li> I would buy this again for other people</li>
            <li> just be careful not to burn your ear like i did!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s to be expected!</li>
            <li> It was EVERYTHING i expected it to be!</li>
            <li> Unless I have a glass or other heat-proof surface</li>
            <li> I usually try to keep the heat level some where in the middle</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair thats past my shoulders and used it once, without any lasting results.</li>
            <li> Anytime I have tried to curl even one section without the glove that came with the wand I have ended up with burned fingers, so I am careful to always use the glove now!</li>
            <li> My wife would recommend something that holds your hair in place other than your hand.</li>
            <li> careful though!</li>
            <li> I also recommend this over conair or any other products.</li>
            <li> it is NOT a curling tong that you can use with one hand, you have to hold the hair in place with the other hand</li>
            <li> nothing written in the advertisement, so I bought it and I haven´t been able to try it yet. :(</li>
            <li> You can do tight spiral curls or loose waves.</li>
            <li> If you hold down the minus (\\&quot;-\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The largest part of the barrel has a very wide diameter for making waves not curls.  </li>
            <li> glove that came with my wand wasn&#x27;t a sparkly dark purple that is pictured above, but plain black.</li>
            <li> It was extremely disappointing, and a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t it will be easy to get frustrated</li>
            <li> This curling wand is super awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Gives me instant victoria secret curls and heats up instantly.</li>
            <li> I found that the default setting (356 degrees) for 10-12 sec was sufficient to set a typical curl from an approx.</li>
            <li> But the black part of the handle heats up between the buttons and the pink part.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, yes it a little awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it (which for me only took about 5 minutes)</li>
            <li> main negative aspect of this product for me is that the barrel of the wand is quite slick, so sometimes the hair slips down to the narrower end while it&#x27;s wrapped around the barrel.</li>
            <li> The barrel is very slippery making it difficult to keep my slick Asian hair on the unit.  </li>
            <li> I usually curl my hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s pretty annoying to have to turn it on ten different times just to do my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want tigher curls, just keep your hair curled around the wand a bit longer; if you want your curls softer and loose, just a few seconds are needed.</li>
            <li> I usually use this wand on the 2nd to highest setting, in hopes of damaging my hair less.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It comes with a glove I had a hard time because I do not manage to use all this tools at the same time ( comb, wand and glove).&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I did have to practice a bit, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out how to use (there are tons of YouTube video tutorials), and now this is the only curling iron I use.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and a regular curler wasn&#x27;t holding my curls.  </li>
            <li> The only down side of this wand is that my hair tends to slide down to the small end of the wand and the curls are too tight.</li>
            <li> Just weird really.</li>
            <li> Burning your finger tips even at the lowest heat setting is no fun.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling wand because my sister has been using the same one for at least one year and loves it.</li>
            <li> and you really cant go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> and it last for AT LEAST two days.</li>
            <li> have hair that is a couple of inches past my shoulders, medium thickness and long layers.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that this isn&#x27;t dual voltage and can&#x27;t be used overseas when I travel.</li>
            <li> only negative is that (and I don’t know if this is a problem for everyone or just me)</li>
            <li> I am too late to return the product back.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a wand because I&#x27;m not good at hair and it looked harder to use than my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the BIG negative</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work out that way, but maybe I was doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have long hair, I am not able to wrap hair around curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The people giving this product a negative review, just don&#x27;t know how to use this product properly.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is of the glove.</li>
            <li> I like being able to touch and run my fingers through my hair, so I hate using lots of product.  </li>
            <li> but after a few tries it became easier.</li>
            <li> What i like most about this is that there isn&#x27;t that annoying metal stand that keeps your countertops from melting.  </li>
            <li> - I used 385 degrees for coarse thick hair and my curls lasted for days without hair spray.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly coarse hair</li>
            <li> Be careful of the hair product used because unsuitable ones will cause the hairs to be heavy and eventually wear off</li>
            <li> Get loose waves or even semi tight curls !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a normal black glove that you would wear when it&#x27;s cold outside.</li>
            <li> Have the barrel facing down and Twist the hair away from your face.</li>
            <li> and now it doesn&#x27;t move up and down.</li>
            <li> During my curling - I often press the buttons (sometimes causing the temperature to change and sometimes shutting it down).  </li>
            <li> But when I used the wand, they stayed in for hours (even after I laid down for a nap)</li>
            <li> Hold down the power button on your device to fire it up.  </li>
            <li> No matter which angle I hold the wand, my hair just slides down the wand so that its all bunched up and not evenly spiraled around it.</li>
            <li> Have the wand pointing down (skinnier side down) while wrapping your hair around it.  </li>
            <li> you just have to press down on the - or + button in order to lock it.  </li>
            <li> That means that sometimes I have to move down the hair and curl again.  </li>
            <li> Hair slides down the barrel and the curl doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> There are temperature up and down buttons</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron/wand, but the hair always slips down to the bottom of the wand</li>
            <li> but i wiped it down with disinfectant</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down in no time.</li>
            <li> You can not put it down once you turn it on because the stands are about a quarter inch.  </li>
            <li> I can not  set this down</li>
            <li> We even went to the extreme of holding the hair in the barrel for over a minute!</li>
            <li> The cord also does not seem to continuously get tangled like other hair styling appliances I have!</li>
            <li> - I broke my CHI flat iron by dropping the plug end on a hard tile bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> it is helpful as well, my hair rarely holds a curl and even with this, falls flat within 1-2 hours of using it, so I don&#x27;t use it as often &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this because it did not curl my thick wiry red hair as tightly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> It felt awkward at first having to hold my hair against the wand and took few tries before I got used to the wrapping and holding process.</li>
            <li> (BE VERY CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> Now my curls relax a little but last for at least two days.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I hated it so badly that I didn&#x27;t use the wand again after my first try for a good half a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent ridiculous amounts on the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; flat irons and curling irons and nothing ever worked, my hair is very long and thick</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ll have to touch it up half way through the day.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair typically holds curls for about an hour before they start falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and a half using it probably</li>
            <li> and I got a black one it was completely black</li>
            <li> it had scratches in the black plastic parts.</li>
            <li> I use the lowest temperature setting and it takes me about half an hour to style.</li>
            <li> These curls stay in my hair until I wash it again, though they do fall slightly</li>
            <li> I seriously recommend watching a YouTube video for hints as the instructions are very basic and assume you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> cons - if you&#x27;re less coordinated (like I am)</li>
            <li> It takes less than 2 minutes to heat.</li>
            <li> Could be even less time than that.</li>
            <li> Then, half way through two sections, I thought.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair Down to my waist</li>
            <li> - there is a little know on the end of the barrel that my hair gets caught on and ruins all the curling I just did.</li>
            <li> it works on my stick straight, impossible to curl, long hair.  </li>
            <li> and I am not  cool with letting it dangle anywhere by the cord.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to burn yourself like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I got the 1-1 1/2 inch barrel because I have long thick hair and prefer looser curls.</li>
            <li> As I have long, thick hair, I found I didn&#x27;t want to use it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, and wavy/curly, and I wanted something to reduce frizz and define the curls.</li>
            <li> , bc its soo thick and long.</li>
            <li> She has long, thick waist length hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long (to my belly button), thick, and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product usually Remington has good products this did not work at all</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a wand before, it&#x27;s a little odd getting used to it to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Also, it only takes a few, and I mean FEW seconds to curl your strand of hair.</li>
            <li> Just a very bad product overall... not user friendly.</li>
            <li> The 0.5-1inch creates tight curls that reminds me of Taylor Swift&#x27;s signature curls.</li>
            <li> and my curls would be too tight for my taste).</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it and buying this one (the thicker one) because the thinner one made the curls too tight and they never fell and loosened up.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair, halfway down my back, and have always wanted to curl my hair, but unfortunately it&#x27;s always been too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this curling wand works miracles!</li>
            <li> I am Asia with thick hair and usually when I use the traditional curler I always need some kinda or product to keep it curl all day.</li>
            <li> but since my hair has gotten long, it is just so small to be using and makes it take even longer with a small wand.</li>
            <li> It took a little concern traction to learn how to handle my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t curl my hair, but often want to add a little flip to the ends.</li>
            <li> a little thicker than what I pictured, but it would work well for my daughters hair who is longer than mine.</li>
            <li> the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a clipper makes it a little tricky.</li>
            <li> Was expecting it to be a little nicer.</li>
            <li> Of, course, it takes a little bit of practice to get used to it</li>
            <li> It took me a little longer to finish than it did my sister</li>
            <li> No need for the glove after a little practice.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works well and with a little hairspray the curls stay in.</li>
            <li> I think with a little practice it will get easier for me.</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous buying a tool that I might not ever use.</li>
            <li> and so this did take a little bit of practice</li>
            <li> so my hair did relax a little</li>
            <li> no original packaging</li>
            <li> you can adjust the heat by the little screen on the wand..</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> A little bit of a learning curve with these</li>
            <li> it holds the hair little bit</li>
            <li> I found it a little ackward to use and the glove is a MUST.</li>
            <li> Experiment a little, take your time.</li>
            <li> I paid a little over $22.00, but had I known how well it was going to work</li>
            <li> I think with a little practice I can prevent that from happening.</li>
            <li> With that said, it came with a little hair oil bottle, a glove (which I&#x27;ve used once</li>
            <li> This curling iron works well and with a little hairspray the curls stay in.</li>
            <li> However, it is impossible to curl your hair with this wand, as the hair slips right off.  </li>
            <li> Mind you, I had to hunt this thing down after buying 5 other wands that sucked hard core.</li>
            <li> However when I try to slide the barrel out with this iron my hair gets completely stuck and tangled on the little knob at the end, rendering the curl useless.</li>
            <li> Not as expected, hard to roll</li>
            <li> She uses it almost everyday and has yet to have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it to create messy waves for a beachy look.</li>
            <li> 10-20 minutes after curling my hair, the curl had fallen and my hair looked like limp waves.</li>
            <li> Nothing works on my wavy/curly hair, and  my curls always fall out within a few hours, unless I use a bottle of hairspray.</li>
            <li> a few weeks before i gave it as a gift and another few before she tried to use it.</li>
            <li> I am having some trouble using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had trouble with my hair holding a curl</li>
            <li> My mom has used it a few times and loves it, but her hair is finer than mine.</li>
            <li> Adjust the heat up to 410 degrees, put the included heat-resistant glove on the hand that is not holding the rod, and twirl a section of hair around the heat rod for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I checked out a few youtube videos to get an idea of how each wand curled and ended up going with the thicker barrel.</li>
            <li> Got one in the mail, after a few weeks the curler part was detaching from the handle.</li>
            <li> The trick is to hold the curl in place for just a few seconds once it slides off the wand.</li>
            <li> I am terrible and doing my own hair</li>
            <li> MagiCurl wand (tangles your hair, waste of money....).</li>
            <li> No complaints after a few weeks using.</li>
            <li> I noticed the problem and was especially careful.</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s the narrowing wand (sometimes my hair stays on the wider end, or falls to the narrow end).</li>
            <li> This is the only curling device that works on my thin hair</li>
            <li> Before using it I read and watched a few videos to learn or take some tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to get used to</li>
            <li> I stopped using the glove after a few uses once I got the hang of wrapping my hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> and I got this to get the messy bob look going</li>
            <li> few things I do like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> feel like the trick is to go behind your head with the wand on the opposite side from which you are curling.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> (few)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble YouTube using a curling wand</li>
            <li> a few times hehe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and it is still working just as well as</li>
            <li> Received it a few days ago and used some hour or so ago.</li>
            <li> I USE IT ALMOST EVERYDAY FOR SCHOOL..</li>
            <li> I prepped by watching a few videos, but I think it&#x27;s somehow easier to burn yourself if you&#x27;re not reallyyyyy paying attention.  </li>
            <li> I must be missing something.  </li>
            <li> I was missing, but no matter what I tried, it didn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I use the wand almost everyday-</li>
            <li> and then it started to loosen up and got messy, but hey messy beach look.</li>
            <li> I bought this product quite a few months ago</li>
            <li> Hey, maybe if I hold the curl in my palm for a few seconds, after I release the curl from the wand.  </li>
            <li> so each \\&quot;curl\\&quot; was never smooth looking.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I am now left with a broken curling wand and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It also takes way less time to curl my hair with this too!</li>
            <li> They look sort of ok on one side but the other side just looks terrible.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping to use this to tame some pieces</li>
            <li> I am too lazy and old school to do it this way, sorry</li>
            <li> And since I wasting able to hold the ends down the barrel they looked horrible.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little past my shoulders</li>
            <li> just want to make sure the thick-haired girls out there aren&#x27;t too disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair &amp; could never find a wand to curl my hair the way I wanted it always ended up with small tight curls &amp;</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, frizzy, and long hair- to my waist.</li>
            <li> or it just sucks super bad.</li>
            <li> The slight cone shape makes it difficult for me to do my hair properly (holding the fatter end closer to my skull) without my hair falling off of the end.</li>
            <li> The heated tongs pretty bad siempre.</li>
            <li> I almost wanted to exchange my wand for the smaller version, at least then I could try using it for tighter curls, but if the smaller wand is just as awkward to use and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, why bother?</li>
            <li> When She did, the heat protecting glove was missing and I&#x27;m now past the window of returns.</li>
            <li> I use this wand everyday, purchased the small barrel wand also.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for an amateur, seldom-hair-styling girl like me, but not for a fashion queen that likes to do her hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Oh and I almost forgot; the tiny little rest is completely useless.</li>
            <li> This gave me serious problem: i couldn&#x27;t hold the wand up because i had to use the other hand to do the curling, therefore the wand often got too closer to my chin.</li>
            <li> This wand was a little difficult to use, only because I&#x27;ve never used a wand before.</li>
            <li> The problem I had (I have slick straight hair) was that when I wrapped my hair around the barrel it would just slide to the skinnier end making things very difficult.</li>
            <li> By the time I finish curling my hair, the first section I did is already limp :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the reviewers who left a poor rating and complained that it burned your skin...</li>
            <li> I felt less edgy and nervous that I&#x27;d burn myself.</li>
            <li> Up until now it would take me at least an hour and a half to curl all of my hair with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> However, as some of the other reviewers suggested, it&#x27;s really difficult to curl your hair barrel down with this without the hair sloping down, basically all my hair winds up at the tip of the barrel anyway</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was a little disappointed after being psyched up to all the lovely reviews I&#x27;d read on this thing.  </li>
            <li> Neat little styling tool!</li>
            <li> Just spritz a little bit of sea salt spray and bam!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had serious issues with other products in the past.</li>
            <li> And after all of that work the curls wouldn&#x27;t even last the next few hours. :(  </li>
            <li> I would not trade it for one of those much more expensive ones!!!</li>
            <li> little bit hard to control,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes very little time to do my head</li>
            <li> I received it the other day &amp; tried it out- HOLY MOTHER OF $&amp;&amp;$)!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pink!!!!</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair a little past my bra strap in length.  </li>
            <li> The second time I tried it, I will admit that I became so frustrated with it that I almost quit because it is a little awkward at first.  </li>
            <li> You have to heat the barrel, wrap your hair around it - hold your hair in place ( without burning yourself)  wear the glove, which makes actually getting your hair on the barrel so difficult.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really no more complicated than a traditional curling</li>
            <li> Not sure if i got a refurbished one or something</li>
            <li> I will just use my straightener to curl my hair from now on like i usually do.</li>
            <li> but as my hair grew longer (now about 7-8 inches past shoulders)</li>
            <li> the 1/2 inch is too small for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, I would not recommend this product for all users (for example, tweens or adults with severe arthritis who might experience discomfort after repeatedly pinching a small lock of hair under tension).</li>
            <li> The only weird thing is how this curling iron looks-</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this, I have gone back to using my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my hair-</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product in Ireland  as it had an American plug and voltage.</li>
            <li> I have curly-wavy hair that I usually keep that way or straighten.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s slick and tapered.</li>
            <li> I have hair like 3 inches past shoulders and there was no more room on the barrel for hair past mid-shaft.</li>
            <li> The temperature setting options are a plus for me because my hair doesn&#x27;t usually stay curled.</li>
            <li> I know there is a way to lock the settings though (I&#x27;m just too lazy to do it).</li>
            <li> Im not impressed and rather disapointed, actually.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up burning my hair, fingers, forehead, ears, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> (my hair is about 2.5 inches past my shoulders).</li>
            <li> Works well but requires small strands of hair in order for them to form and  keep the curls</li>
            <li> and it just takes no more than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> The barrel is so slick that when you wrap your hair around it, all your hair slides to the bottom (thin/narrow side of the barrel).</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong size I intend to purchase the smaller,</li>
            <li> I have owned both the small and now</li>
            <li> i was NEVER able to curl my hair before getting this wand.</li>
            <li> All I was getting was limp curls!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times because it is too difficult for me.  </li>
            <li> I typically can get away with not washing my hair for about 3-4 days, so I used the wand on day 2 when my hair was dirty enough to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> i have a very hard time with styling my hair, it is very thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sick of having straight hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried to use glove and it was awkward and really only gave you a little more time to pull hand away before getting a nasty burn; not meant to fully protect.</li>
            <li> I recieve 4 used white box REMINGTON CI9538 in stead of  4 new items,items shipped to Guatemala , this is very bad deel</li>
            <li> I would recommend to someone who generally knows how to curl their hair because this wand would be too annoying for someone who is learning how to style their hair due to the problem previously stated.</li>
            <li> you can have curls with a fat curve on one end and a thin curve on the other end.</li>
            <li> it does the job but the curls don&#x27;t last too long &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that has terrible frizz most days.</li>
            <li> Im not very good at using it yet...</li>
            <li> Usually I have a hard time holding a curl, but now using this wand</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and using a curling iron with a clip is difficult.  </li>
            <li> IT IS VERY UNPROTECTED  :(</li>
            <li> (I usually try to get at least 2 days wear out of it).</li>
            <li> But the taper is awkward and your hair can slip down it if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I find it extremely hard to use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get my medium length hair around it.</li>
            <li> Product is really hard to use without have a clamp on the iron.</li>
            <li> BUT it is so hard to use if you have slippery hair.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> it is hard to hold my hair in place without burning myself.  </li>
            <li> If you have hard to curl hair, and I mean HARD to curl hair, try this out.</li>
            <li> As clumsy and accident prone as I am, I did not burn myself once.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was terrible at curling my hair when it&#x27;s actually been my old curling wand.</li>
            <li> (I always have at least shoulder length hair, or longer)  </li>
            <li> Controls are in an awkward position though, I find I&#x27;m constantly hitting the buttons while using the wand and changing the temperature in the process.  </li>
            <li> I got the larger size because I was afraid of ending up with too-small curls.  </li>
            <li> so I need my curling wand to be on for at least an hour at a time without shutting off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She uses it at least 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> * Negative Points:</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> have extremely thick hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hair which is fizzy and thick.</li>
            <li> And I have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on my daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick volume hair</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the over $120 Sarah Potempa Beachwaver wand and was very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too thick, maybe mine came like that.</li>
            <li> I was forced to curl the hair upward instead of downward.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend to buy this product if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I mean, what girl isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is really hard to curl, and almost impossible to keep curly, even with tons of hairspray.</li>
            <li> P.S- For reviewers who say that the buttons are placed weirdly and while you are curling your hair you keep pressing the button and turning the heat up or down</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> The glove is terrible and offers really no protection.  </li>
            <li> Even if you are forgiving about the ridiculous holding positions to make this work , I would continue doing that  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it changes every time I hold the handle.  </li>
            <li> I found it very hard to use, especially because my hair is layered, which makes it very difficult to use this device because it does not have a clip for your hair so it has nothing to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was of little use to my wife without a bar to held her hair in place.  </li>
            <li> ignore any and all bad comments, BUY AND TRY you wont be dissapointed ESPECIALLY WITH THAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that the Conair would suck that badly though, so I am sending IT back and getting this Remington again, hopefully no hair burning this time.</li>
            <li> I am not good at doing hair</li>
            <li> It has a learning curve but it isn&#x27;t difficult once you try it a few times.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> And if you have a hard time getting your hair to stay curled, try this instead of a clamp!</li>
            <li> However, I immediately found it extremely hard to use!</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s hard to curl the tips!  </li>
            <li> I may have to buy a glove and give it another go, but that seems like a dumb method to me.</li>
            <li> product takes some getting used to, the first two times I did it my hair looked terrible.</li>
            <li> This curling iron isn&#x27;t terrible, it gets hot and curls like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> I had to get use to it, got a nasty burn on my forehead the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I was awful.</li>
            <li> Leaving 15 words is really dumb and stinky</li>
            <li> I have a lot of really thick hair and this product makes my life easier!</li>
            <li> You are supposed to use the glove instead of having the clamp, and this makes it very hard for me to use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and it won&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I am light-skinned and I have a very thick hair shaft.  </li>
            <li> so it keeps your arm from getting to tired</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t claim to ship a heat resistant glove when it is so thin</li>
            <li> I feel like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model when I use it.</li>
            <li> So, one would think that I&#x27;d be even worse with something like this...</li>
            <li> a poor product in terms of result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly accidentally pushing them when I&#x27;m curling, and it&#x27;s annoying and distracting.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is too thin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to extange it because they already screwed my order up before I am really mad and not very pleased</li>
            <li> negative reviews are very frustrating to read.</li>
            <li> Seriously recommend this!</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> My frizz always got ripped out in the clamp, I had to hold my hair in them forever to get any curl, they made my hair smell unpleasant, so I&#x27;ve been using rollers for years, but my curl falls out in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands of wands, and none produce curls like this bad boy!</li>
            <li> ; then this product is probably not ideal for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, I can work with it, but I can see how others may find it frustrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not very good with my hair</li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> The quality is too low, can&#x27;t be used, very disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate to curl my hair with a straightener or a conventional curling iron!</li>
            <li> - I hate the little mark that curling irons make where the clamp edge meets hair.  </li>
            <li> That is a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that everything always goes wrong with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I thought, well what can go wrong.</li>
            <li> It is too difficult to return.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a clamp for the shorter pieces of hair that gets difficult to hold up against the iron.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate, since this appears to be well built, just not something we could use.</li>
            <li> cuz using a wond can be difficult for some</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fairly difficult to use without burning yourself.  </li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use and burned my hand.  </li>
            <li> i was so sad that it is discontinued because i searched everywhere for it.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m holding it wrong or something...</li>
            <li> This glove is useless and not heat resistant AT ALL.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
            <li> I tried but its uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a built-in clip, so it is difficult to make your hair stay in place while you&#x27;re trying to curl it.  </li>
            <li> so I figure I will buy something not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Unable to curl my hair with it</li>
            <li> and it s really difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It has been bleached and color treated which has made it a difficult to hold curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (sadly, i had that experience).</li>
            <li> I was bored of doing both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> What I get is something that resembles a wave that lasts for 30 minutes which sadly is before I get dressed and leave the house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is difficult to keep the hair around the wand and don&#x27;t know which direction should start.</li>
            <li> It was just weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s silly</li>
            <li> needless to say I didn&#x27;t know what to do with this.  </li>
            <li> AND, it is difficult to get use to.</li>
            <li> And for the newbies to wand use, I hated the glove, it made it harder to handle my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the glove, but found it too difficult to use while wearing</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t come really unfair do not buy</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the curler.</li>
            <li> the glove is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> When I tried wrapping my hair around the barrel, my hair naturally twisted.</li>
            <li> Which made the curls end up kinky and weird.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother over-spending on a expensive name brand.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it is difficult for her to use.</li>
            <li> It appears to be well made just difficult to use without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> Amazon reviews never steer me wrong.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything technically wrong with it...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my product was damaged during delivery</li>
            <li> It is useless to me.</li>
            <li> I also have  a really expensive NuMe</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it ever since it came.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the weird two finger glove.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and the heat get through.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and the heat gets through.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!</li>
            <li> Curling time was at least 30 seconds, which is venturing into hair fry-dry.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I was expecting this curling wand with the pink thing</li>
            <li> found that the glove was clinky and awkward.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this highly awkward item.</li>
            <li> I bit awkward to use</li>
            <li> But is awkward.</li>
            <li> Wearing a glove while trying to style your hair is awkward.</li>
            <li> the tapered barrel is awkward and my hair slides when I wrap my hair around it.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that a Remington product would do the trick for my hair sense my hair is CRAZY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to let the hair twist as you circle it around the barrel.</li>
            <li> Sad spending money on this :(</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no more of that awful line that be permanently creased into your hair.</li>
            <li> I hate it when people leave negative reviews because they were too retarded to figure out how to operate the product.</li>
            <li> very difficult for someone in their 60s to use by herself.  </li>
            <li> It looked very weird.</li>
            <li> it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I hate curling irons because I could never not have that weird crease where you clamp onto your hair.</li>
            <li> but it was so wonky with me trying to keep it on the barrel that it looked terrible.</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a contortionist it is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for her to use.</li>
            <li> And since I have layers in my hair, it is VERY difficult to keep my hair wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li> This is almost impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> The lack of a clip made it almost impossible to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> - this is a bad design.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had one bad hair day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just too bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well it did.</li>
            <li> I returned it :(</li>
            <li> $$ :(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the look of the hair with the wand.</li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
            <li> disappointed bc</li>
            <li> But the packaging is what disappointed me.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t expect that :(&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> you will burn your skin like I did :(</li>
            <li> and i accidentally touched my ear with the curler while I am figuring out how to curl my hair :(</li>
            <li> I basically hate the glove, until I&#x27;m sick of burning my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The style of this curling wand is very awkward.</li>
            <li> GAME CHANGER!!!</li>
            <li> Hate these ... brought them a year ago.</li>
            <li> I hate using a curling iron so that was out of the question.  </li>
            <li> and I just hate how my hair feels with that junk in it.  </li>
            <li> When I had almost shoulder-length hair, I thought I might hate this.</li>
            <li> It gave my neck a kiss so violently that I&#x27;m scared</li>
            <li> have to pay attention because you will burn the crap out of your hand.</li>
            <li> So I start wrapping at the base, but it all ends up bunched up at the tip.</li>
            <li> Beware of idiots and their uninformed reviews.</li>
            <li> i admit glow is annoying but again u wont need it after u learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> This wand was very difficult to use!</li>
            <li> IItem didn&#x27;t come very mad and all I wanted to do is try it</li>
            <li> i saw this product in stores awhile ago and didn&#x27;t purchase it because i used a remington product and hated it.</li>
            <li> anyway, I really hate this horribly impractical beast of a styling tool.</li>
            <li> Buy this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about this, just spend the $20+ bucks and try it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is a terrible product!</li>
            <li> I suggest buying Hair heat repellent !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible at curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Awful, awful.</li>
            <li> This curling iron was horrible for me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this curling wand because it heats up immediately and the curls come out perfect after 5-10 seconds of holding it with the glove! I have been using this wand for a while and I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Heat&#x27;s up fast. Works great. Glove is not heat proof tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this wand!&lt;br /&gt;I was planning on buying the Nume curling wands after seeing so many positive feedback on them, but their prices are just too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went on amazon, looking around.. and found this baby right here!&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders! It heats up super fast, and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was debating on the 1/2 to 1inch and the 1 to 1.5inch. But since I like loose curls, the bigger size is perfect. I tried to use it to make smaller curls too (just grab smaller section of hair), and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Remington is my favorite wand of choice.  I have the eliptical wand as well and both get very hot and stay hot.</li>
            <li> Great wand, easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that everything always goes wrong with a curling iron. I tried all kinds, even the spin your hair into a curl and it was a hot mess. So when I saw this on YouTube I thought, well what can go wrong. No hair can get stuck with this one.    It was perfect!! Yes I used the gloves. I think you need to in the beginning to get use to it. Otherwise you might burn yourself. Also, first try it out before turning it on that way you get the hang of it. Have the barrel facing down and Twist the hair away from your face. That was a good tip from one of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read. It turns out really nice.    Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that my hair did get stuck at the barrel where it attaches to the handle. Not a lot just sometimes a strand or two.I just need to make sure to put my hair down lower on the barrel.  I would recommend this curling iron to anyone. Best buy ever!!    At first when I used it, the heat was moving up and down because I kept pressing it with my finger. But it has a lock which I used and now it doesn&#x27;t move up and down. I like that feature.</li>
            <li> Our daughter loves this and uses it still.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the 1/2-1&amp;#34; wand because it seemed the most popular and reviews and vids said that you can make the curls as loose or tight as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skinnier wand gives you undoubtedly gorgeous think Taylor Swift like curls. It wasn&#x27;t really the look I was going for so I returned it for the 1-1 1/2 and i absolutely love it for loose beachy curls. Both sizes work great, it really comes down to the look you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really fast and the various temperature settings convenient, along with the digital display. It has a swivel bottom for the cord. I&#x27;m not sure if the &amp;#34;Pearl&amp;#34; helps your hair, but the curls are perfect (plus its pink!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a glove that definitely helps you curls every bit of hair and not burn your finger tips. But it&#x27;s not meant to touch the wand directly. I definitely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it doesn&#x27;t have a component to grab the hair and hold it. I put on the glove and started experimenting and picked up on how to use it very quickly. Maybe a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; would be great in the package for different styles. Or maybe I&#x27;m just new to curling my hair and other people don&#x27;t have any problem or need any advice. I find the temp adjustment very convenient and the only problem I have with the design is that when I press the power button it doesn&#x27;t power off unless I unplug it. Not really a big deal. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> as described good product</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday for my niece. She was ecstatic when she opened it because although she is only ten she loves styling her and her little sisters hair. She uses it almost everyday and has yet to have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this iron after reading countless reviews and seeing many Youtube videos on this iron. However this iron did not hold my curls and I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve burnt the tips of my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not new to using curling products, this iron is just cheaply made and feels like it will fall apart in less than a year of use. It&#x27;s very lightweight but most of the weight is concentrated at the pink part that it&#x27;s rather difficult to control. The cord is also cheap compared to my other curling irons and straighteners. The buttons are not defined on the handle -which results in parts of my palm or fingers pushing the buttons -and changing the temperature or turning off the whole thing while I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are nice but they&#x27;re not necessary. It takes longer to heat up compared to some curling irons I own. Price is cheap but could be better in quality. Oh and I almost forgot; the tiny little rest is completely useless. Because it&#x27;s heavier on the pink part, it will just drop at the tip and burn your carpet or whatever you have underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this wand is not worth $25, I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for a much better wand. I returned it :(</li>
            <li> this is a very good curling wand it heats up fast and gives big bouncy curls love it ! !</li>
            <li> okey yess it work, it make some nice curly on my hair  and they look natural ;) i recomend it plus is not so espensive ;)</li>
            <li> I own the smaller version of this curler and love it so I decided to get the bigger one. It was shipped very quickly and looked like new.i really lik the curls it produces.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love this curling iron and the results you can achieve. My daughter-in-law loves it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this 8 days ago. it arrived today. I live in Australia so the time it took to get here. Just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I also got a converter because the US to AUS tongs are different :D&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, worth the money all the way! ignore any and all bad comments, BUY AND TRY you wont be dissapointed ESPECIALLY WITH THAT PRICE. It is worth every cent. 10/10.</li>
            <li> I try and try.It does not work at all on my &amp;#34;Think&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Voluminous&amp;#34; hair. It is too difficult to return. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> bought this after i bought a 1-in to 1/2-in barrel curling wand because those curls were a bit too tight (however, using a hairdryer to stretch out those curls was effective). i don&#x27;t need to use a hair dryer to loosen these curls, but i did find that slipping the curl off the wand and holding it in my hand to cool for a few seconds radically improved the quality of the curl. otherwise, it took a couple times for a curl to hold.</li>
            <li> I already had the small size Remington curling rod, so I knew I wanted to stay with the same reliable brand. I love the custom temperature settings. These rods work great, and the large waves are lovely.</li>
            <li> Update Jan 2016:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back in September of 2015 and after using it fairly regularly for over a year, it is still going strong. It took me a while to figure out the best way to curl my hair, but I can now curl my long thick hair relatively fast (about 10 minutes) into loose waves. Definitely jump on YouTube and watch some instructional videos if wands are new to you. I&#x27;m actually on to buy one for my sister who always borrows mine and says it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever used. Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I finally caved and bought myself this after wanting one forever!  I love the wide barrel for my super thick, medium length hair.  The digital temperature is nice to tone down the heat to use on my 5 year old&#x27;s thin hair or turn up for my thick hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> just in 2 minutes your hair gonna be fabulous! it&#x27;s only problem is that it is not long enough for long hair!</li>
            <li> You can either buy a $200 curler or this very reasonable priced Remington curler n get the exact same results! I&#x27;ve had it for over a year n I would not trade it for one of those much more expensive ones!!!</li>
            <li> I have read that ceramic curling irons provide longer lasting curls than irons made out of other materials so I wanted to try one. My hair is very long and I found it very easy to wrap my hair around it, as long as I wore the accompanying glove. However wrapping my bangs around it which are shorter was more difficult. If I want to have a nice full curl on my bang I still use my old, standard run of the mill iron. The bangs slip right off of this barrel because they are not long enough to wrap around the barrel without a clasp on it, which this iron doesn&#x27;t have. I wish it did have a clasp, however I do think the curl is more intense and long lasting, it also has more body and volume than my old iron. Honestly, when I have time I like to turn this iron on and my old iron on at the same time. I curl my bangs and my under curl with my older larger barrel iron and then go around my whole head with the top most layer of hair and make ringlets, after the heat dissipates I scrunch my hair with my hands at the roots to get more body. The glove and lack of clasp took a while to get used to but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand from my local Walmart for 24 +tax today. I only tested a few strands of hair, but let me tell you: AWESOME! My hair will not cooperate with me using a clamp curling iron. And the only time my hair stays curled is when I have my salon lady curl it professionally. THIS WORKS! I didn&#x27;t even have to put hair spray in and the curls have only fell a little in 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand I have is 1/2-1&#x27;&#x27;. It makes normal sized curls and at the tip, smaller sized ones. It is a ceramic with pearl I guess embedded into the barrel. It&#x27;s smooth and leaves your curls silky and shiny. The curls don&#x27;t look dry and damaged after. Also, it only takes a few, and I mean FEW seconds to curl your strand of hair. I used it on the highest temperature so far, but will experiment. I found this wand has the highest temperature out of all the ones the store had in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE! This tool can get VERY HOT! (up to 410º) The glove will not protect your fingers if you put them directly onto the glove. I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet, but I could definitely see it happening if you are just learning or are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars, It&#x27;s cheaper than Hot Tools and Jose Eber, yes, but with practice I&#x27;d say this works just as good! (Also has a 4 YEAR warranty!!)  And if you have a hard time getting your hair to stay curled, try this instead of a clamp! It takes some getting used to, but well worth the effort :)</li>
            <li> I have had this curling wand for 2 weeks now. I have a lot of experience with curling wands, so I thought I would weigh in, since most of the reviews on this product are from people who don&#x27;t seem to have much knowledge about how to use them or what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is a good quality curling wand. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; traits about it. It is not too expensive and is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a bit about wands in general for those who are new to them. Curling wands are not for inexperienced users! They are not \\&quot;super easy\\&quot; to use. That is why there are still curling irons with clamps still out there, for those who need the clamps. I have had 4 different brands/types of curling wands. All of mine came with gloves, which I never use because you need to be able to have a good hold on your hair to get the look you want. So if you learn how to hold and maneuver a curling wand, you do not need the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, these wands do give you a more natural and professional curl/wave, and can do so quickly, but it does take practice to achieve the goal. There are numerous types of curls, spirals and waves you can make with a wand and each one calls for a different technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third.....DO NOT get a curling wand that is multiple size barrel (like this one) IF you do not have experience with one. Start with a wand that is a one size barrel to learn and then gravitate to these. These multiple size barrels are great, they can change up the curls and waves nicely and make a more natural look, but because the barrel gets smaller on the way down, it does mean if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it can be frustrating and difficult to keep your hair even on it, without slipping....like I said practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for this particular wand, it is infused with real pearl...this is great, yes it makes the wand slippery! Now use logic and realize that the more slip and smoothness of the wand, the better for your hair.If you hair does not slip from a wand then you should be worried because that means your hair is sticking to the wand with the heat, by burning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you buy this particular wand, understand that it is more slippery, I noticed that this wand does make my hair shine more and look more smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick hair and a lot of it. My hair is naturally curly, but it is messy curly so I use wands to touch up my curls and make them nicer, similar to what Taylor Swift does. Now, even though my hair is natural curly, does not mean it is easy to curl with an iron. Since I have very long and thick hair, plus the large amount....it is very heavy and tends to weigh down, so curls tend to flatten easily. I have used this wand several times in the last two weeks....I did my hair early in the morning and went to an 8 hour shift of work. At the end of the day, my curls were still there and not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this wand is a great deal and perfect for someone looking for decent quality at a low price. Like I said, this particular style of wand needs some experience and/or practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger sized barrel of this wand is better for big loose spirals or beach waves hair styles. The smaller one would be better for tighter more Shirley Temple curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a beginner to curling wands, don&#x27;t be discouraged, they are fantastic, but start with a one size barrel to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in about 6-8 months to review the long term quality of this product. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE...This (1-1 1/2 inch wand) is easy to use and gives me the most amazing curls. I get compliments from so many people and it makes me feel great! My hair usually cant hold curls for more than 2 or 3 hours when using a curling iron. These curls are big, beautiful, and last all day!</li>
            <li> I use this wand constantly, it is great!  I love the shape it gives because it tapers.  Much better than same shape from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> This product works great and i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try out a curling wand after watching multiple tutorials online. I ready tons of reviews and this wand seemed to be the most bang for your buck. I have to say i am VERY impressed! I read some comments that people posted saying for beginners it is tricky, but I have to say after watching a couple videos on youtube I figured it out the first try. The ceramic just glides your hair through and gives it a shiny smooth finish. The wand itself is lightweight and gives the look of a perfect curl. Overall I am very happy with this product and would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have never used or owned a curling iron or wand before this one, so I started with this product as a complete novice. I watched a couple video tutorials before using it, and it really does work wonderfully. I bought the bigger barrel for wavier curls. I usually use this wand on the 2nd to highest setting, in hopes of damaging my hair less. I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of breakage - though I do use a heat protecting serum on my hair after I wash it. Definitely use the included glove if you&#x27;re new to the curling game - you can feel the heat through the glove if you&#x27;re holding your hair in place for more than ~5 seconds. I have naturally wavy thick hair to begin with, but this wand produces a much more polished look than if I were to let my hair air dry. The curls stay in place all day long, and I can even sleep on them and wake up only needing a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> Easy to use product! Works well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my hair as quickly as I would like...but I have fine hair and am afraid to get it too hot! Love the built in stand that really works!</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given 4 stars but it comes without the box. I can&#x27;t really gift this easily for Christmas. My sister is going to think i purchased it off the street. There shouldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;whats in the Box&amp;#34; blurb when there is NO BOX. Beware if plan to gift this. It comes packed in a plastic bag with the cord and paperwork.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the smaller barrel of this same curling wand, not realizing there were different sizes. I loved the results, then did some research and found the wider barrel. I&#x27;m not very coordinated, and I was able to figure out how to use this easily within 2 tries. Watch the videos on YouTube, they definitely help. The curls last all day, and I have completely gotten rid of my hot rollers. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually holds the curl. LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li> Takes some practice to get the gist of it. Does do a great job with loose curls. Be careful of burning yourself-easy to do!</li>
            <li> So amazing for the price. I get so many compliments when I do my hair with this wand. The glove is nice while you are getting used to the wand. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have never been particularly skilled with hair styling, but with some help from friends I can get gorgeous curls with this wand! I have yet to try it on someone else&#x27;s hair but I can easily curl my own. I&#x27;ve used other wands like this though and it is very easy to curl other&#x27;s hair. I got the 1-1 1/2 inch barrel because I have long thick hair and prefer looser curls. I have used a different brand with the smaller barrel which creates tighter curls, which are also very pretty but I just prefer the looser ones. This wand comes with a glove which is absolutely essential to make sure you curl the tips of your hair. You do have to be extra careful to not burn yourself (I burned my ear a little bit the first time) but with practice you&#x27;ll be fine. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This wand is awesome! Watch a couple of YouTube videos and your set. I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve a curl before and this goes above and beyond. I can run my fingers thru them, run a brush thru them, sleep on them and they still remain beautiful!!!! Try the smaller wand if you want tighter curls this one is for large beautiful curls/waves. Love love love these wands!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well. Didn&#x27;t seem to get hot. Perhaps I&#x27;m just uncoordinated, but it was pretty difficult to wrap hair around.</li>
            <li> Seems like it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough but overall I do love this product. Makes beautiful curls! Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> I love this little wand! It&#x27;s a great alternative to the old curling iron I&#x27;ve been using for years. Friends have complimented my &amp;#34; new hair cut&amp;#34;  and noticed my hair looking great. It took a little concern traction to learn how to handle my hair so I wouldn&#x27;t get burned and now I don&#x27;t even use the glove that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fun to use on long long hair. Curls come out great!</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls and heats up fast! Came on time and was packaged well. I had the half inch size but love the 1 inch so much more</li>
            <li> Remington CI9538 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand...Very beautiful make the hairline in a very magnificence .. The Amazon deal is very beautiful .. thank you for your products Fine</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hair which is fizzy and thick. amazing results! Smooth curls and they stay for 3 days in normal conditions</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works really well on my hair! I typically have trouble keeping curls in using a normal curling iron and rollers, etc., even with hairspray. Somehow this is able to keep the curls in my hair without any products! Also like not having to deal with the clamp from a traditional curling iron... I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> So I got this for my sister who loves braiding hair and all that stuff.&lt;br /&gt;she always checked the curling wands on NuMe but apperantley they were too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;so i looked for something similar and i got her this.&lt;br /&gt;when i got her the curling wand she was so happy and excited and started making curls right away.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! You can do tight spiral curls or loose waves.</li>
            <li> This wand has different heat settings and heats up fast! I love this wand. It&#x27;s a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Love my curling wand.  Gives me the loose big curls I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> I like the bigger curl much better than the smaller one.  Hair is usually styled straight but once in a while its fun to wave it.  I like the bigger wand better even though it was $10 more.  I just have an issue with the buttons where the handle is.  During my curling - I often press the buttons (sometimes causing the temperature to change and sometimes shutting it down).  Kind of annoying but hopefully I will get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not used to curling with a wand so I&#x27;m sure after a couple more try&#x27;s I&#x27;ll get better at it.&lt;br /&gt;410 degree temp is terrific.  Didn&#x27;t use the gloves.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great heat. And heat control. Came with gloves. Good to have since I constantly am clumsy and burned myself here and there. The thickness was good since my hair is long. I&#x27;m super clumsy so probably not compatible with this apparatus. Hair keeps slipping off. But practice makes perfect. Fan of the Remington brand since.</li>
            <li> totally difficult to use.. came malfunction - too dangerously hot to use . very difficult for someone in their 60s to use by herself.  takes a lot of time and energy... j</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price. I was expecting better quality based on the reviews. Works okay.</li>
            <li> Good product. Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy to use. Gives me the curls I want. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome curling iron for the first 15 times I used it. The 16th time I noticed a spot that needed a touch up, plugged it back in, and nothing. Wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Garbage.</li>
            <li> very good product that can adjust the temperature and make caves prefectly!</li>
            <li> Works great I bought 2. My hair is very thick  nothing really works but this Remington does the job.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s very hot and works well.....if you have longer than shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> It works just the way I needed it to! Only problem is that I&#x27;m not experienced enough on how to make a \\&quot;style\\&quot; happen with it - but that will come with practice, I&#x27;m sure. It&#x27;s size is wonderful except, since you have to use your fingers to hold your hair onto wand, long hair tends to want to slip down toward small end of wand hence giving you a smaller curl than attempted. Curls stay in for a long time. It&#x27;s a great hair tool for the price.</li>
            <li> Love that you can change the temp and my curls stay all day. It is also very fast to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Makes quick, bouncy curls. Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Fairly pleased with this wand... It doesn&#x27;t hold as long as the 1/2 inch wand does... So you&#x27;ll have to touch it up half way through the day. But overall it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> Nice item! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and every day it works like a charm!! I love my curling wand:) I don&#x27;t even use the glove anymore because it is just so easy to do and my hair is in perfect curls in about two minutes every time</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about this product. It is very hard to use, and when it gets hot, the glove provided doesn&#x27;t really help since it doesnt do the job well because of its poor quality. I think traditional curling irons with clips are much easier to use. Sad spending money on this :(</li>
            <li> It gets very hot&lt;br /&gt;Swivel cord is very helpful&lt;br /&gt;Could be easier to use&lt;br /&gt;Good results&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product for the price</li>
            <li> This Remington Salon Pearl Curling wand is a lovely styler, the look you get is really lovely. My hair is medium length, and fine, and gave me a cute easy-curl bob. It looks great after using this. I straighten my hair first, then use this. Otherwise, it wouldn&#x27;t look as incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that the glove transferred too much heat to my hand. I didn&#x27;t get burned, per se, but way to warm for comfort. If I hadn&#x27;t moved my hand away, I&#x27;d have gotten burned. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for teenagers or kids. Definitely for adults who can grasp safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I loved the way it makes my hair and will use this when I want that darling bounce that the Pearl Wand gives me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Ummm, wow.  I normally curl my hair with my straightener, which is fast.  This is faster.  So glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot &amp; curls perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I struggle with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and have extremely long, straight hair, getting the right size curls &amp; keeping those curls are hard for me to find as I have tried everything from steam rollers to flat irons. This product get hot extremely fast and stays hot through out the whole curling process. While the top of this item is not the curl size I wanted through out, it works nicely for me for curls for underneath where it seems to be the hardest to keep curled. I like this product but I wouldn&#x27;t use throughout my whole hair. I like the bigger barrels that create a looser curl.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am very impressed with this curling iron wand. I have tried others and after about two hours my hair would lose its clues - NOT WITH THIS iron which actually keeps my hair with beautiful curly waves for three day.</li>
            <li> So much love for this wand.</li>
            <li> Great quality! You can curl your hair in about 30 minutes and it will last you all day!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter......great price!  Actually easy to use,  came fast too!  I would buy!  Alot more in the stores.</li>
            <li> I hate to curl my hair with a straightener or a conventional curling iron! This thing is the bomb dot com. Just saying. My hair turns out flawlessly just about (And I say just about because I am a tool, and sometimes get it wrong in my rush when I first awaken from my slumber.) everytime!  It is so quick, so simple, and very easy to do! The only thing you gotta watch for is that heat. Oh my gosh. I don&#x27;t use the glove because it annoys me, and I have a battle scar to show for it. So curl with caution!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand for my daughters last year and they really like it. They have used it at least once or twice a week since then and it still works great. They also own the smaller version, but wanted the bigger one for more of a wave look and now this is the only one they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some practice to get used to it and get the curls the way you want them. It is different than a regular curling iron because it doesn&#x27;t have the clasp that holds your hair in place, you hold your hair with your opposite hand. I would recommend wearing the included glove until you get the hang of using it because it does get very hot. Once you&#x27;ve got it figured out, you won&#x27;t need the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the curls this makes, and they stay all day. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> It can make my hair look great with soft curls. It&#x27;s a little hard to manipulate, but with the included glove it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t curl my hair, but often want to add a little flip to the ends. Regular curling irons aren&#x27;t great for this purpose because the hair holding clamp leaves a visible dent where it contacts my hair. The curling wand perfectly suits my needs, leaving me with quickly flipped and completely dentless ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove that came with my wand wasn&#x27;t a sparkly dark purple that is pictured above, but plain black. Otherwise, it is exactly as described. You will burn your hand, even with the glove, if applied directly to the wand. It does protect your hand from burns when used placed on top of hair wrapped around the wand. If anything, it offers a decent degree of protection, but you still need to pay attention to what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the wand easier to use than a regular curling iron, but there is a learning curve involved. It felt awkward at first having to hold my hair against the wand and took few tries before I got used to the wrapping and holding process. Within a week, using the wand became more natural. The wand heats up very quickly and honestly it takes about 4 minutes all told from the moment I plug in the wand until My hair is finished and I&#x27;m putting the wand away. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product and its results.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really liked this curling iron, but the on switch is a little tricky. You have to hold it down, and the iron gets extremely hot, so be careful, and use the glove that it comes with until you get used to using this iron. We loved the fact that you can get all different size curls, and both me and my daughter really love this feature. She has long thick hair, and I have shoulder length thinner hair, and it works great for both of us. I just wish it had a clamp for the shorter pieces of hair that gets difficult to hold up against the iron. Other then that, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Modestly surprised that it works well. Only downside is that the temperature setting has to be extremely high for the best waves.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Its the only thing that has ever been able to curl my thick long hair; would defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair that generally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl without a ton of product.  I was easily able to make gorgeous loose curls that stayed all night with minimal hairspray.</li>
            <li> My hair looks the same, straight. It doesn&#x27;t show up curling, instead of his temperature is very high. For me didn&#x27;t work, maybe someone else works.</li>
            <li> I love this iron! Gets hot and easy to use! make sure you are very careful, I have burned my hand a few times. Use the burn proof glove!</li>
            <li> Did not curl hair at all</li>
            <li> We are still trying to get the hang of using it.  It works great for my friend so that is why I bought it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a good product for this price! Overall very satisfied!!! Creates beautiful curls easily even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Hair slips out. Did not make any curls at all.</li>
            <li> It heats very well and gives great curls! I love the way my hair looks when I use this tool, and it takes me only 20 min to do my hair (shoulder length, thick, curly/frizzy). I knocked it down a star because the gloves that come with it do still transmit a fair amount of the heat, and it melted my nail polish! My only other beef with it is that my hair always seems to only stay around the bottom half to 1/3 when I&#x27;m curling it. But otherwise I love it! I&#x27;ve tried doing blow outs and flat irons but hands down this works the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and I have to say that this is a great curler. although it takes time to get used to it specially if you were using the curling irons that comes with a pattern at the beginning you might burn your fingers a little bit. but as soon as you become use to it it&#x27;s a grey curler.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast; less than a minute.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Had an Enzo Milano barrel for couple years and wanted to give this a try. This one provides more natural curls because of the shape of the wand and it gets really hot. Had problems with the hair slipping towards the end of the wand, but eventually got used to it. Will use this over the Enzo Milano from now on.</li>
            <li> Gives nice curls.  Without spray, curls can last several hours.  Haven&#x27;t tried it with spray yet.  I like that there are several heat settings.  Just be careful using it, and if you are not an expert using curling wands I recommend that you use the gloves that comes with it, otherwise you will get a burn.</li>
            <li> I just got highlights in my brown hair and wanted something to add more curl and dimension without giving shirley temple curls.  This makes gorgeous waves that HOLD.  I like being able to touch and run my fingers through my hair, so I hate using lots of product.  I&#x27;ve been doing this with just a light spray of the organix coconut water spray and by the end of the day, it relaxes a little but still has really pretty bend &amp; movement.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve never used a wand before and haven&#x27;t had any issues using it.  It comes with a glove but I haven&#x27;t needed it.</li>
            <li> It is great but be careful it only works with 110V not supporting 220V</li>
            <li> I love this wand, it gets hot fast and I&#x27;m able to style my hair in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Works great..over yr now</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing...it definitely gives even my fine straight hair beautiful \\&quot;Kardashian-like\\&quot; waves! It certainly has a learning curve, but it is fairly easy and quick, and the curls stay in pretty well (even without additional product). The reviews helped me decide to purchase this item, and I hope they help you, too, which is why I am basically saying...IT ROCKS!! :) And use the glove everytime...it gets super hot.</li>
            <li> I found so many people chose this so I&#x27;d like to give it a shot. And after I use it, I know the reaosn. It almost doesn&#x27;t hurt hair and has fabulous effect.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes great wonderful curls. It does get very hot, so you have to be careful, but does make great curls, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked for me like this wand! I don&#x27;t need any product and it was super easy to use. My hair is super fine and thin, therefore my \\&quot;curls\\&quot; never lasted. With the wand my curls/waves stay all day. If u use a light hairspray the curls will hold longer. Seriously recommend this!</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars because have not perfected how to use this yet, not as easy as I thought so I&#x27;m hoping with practice, it will be easier &amp; curls will come out nicer...I&#x27;ve seen other ppl use it and curls come out great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more relaxed, &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; curls, this is a great tool to use.  It gives some variety in the tightness of the curl since it&#x27;s larger on one end than the other.  I would not recommend this for those with hair shoulder length and above, however, because the barrel size wouldn&#x27;t allow for very much curling to happen with anything above the shoulders.</li>
            <li> I tried the 1/2-1 inch wand on my hair the other day and fell in love. The curls were perfect and beautiful. I&#x27;m usually not very good with my hair but this was easy to get down and kind of fun! Also, my hair typically holds curls for about an hour before they start falling out. And that&#x27;s with hairspray! But when I used the wand, they stayed in for hours (even after I laid down for a nap) and I didn&#x27;t even use hairspray! Definitely a great buy and now I&#x27;m considering buying the bigger size for more different looks :)</li>
            <li> The photo attached shows the result of a second day hair after trying the wand for the first time. I don&#x27;t have much experience using these tools. Watched a YouTube video, and decided to give it a try. I like the size of the wand, the curl is much looser than using the 3/4 inch ones. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star, and not a 5, is I feel that the Hot Tool brand heats hair faster. But Remington&#x27;s price is unbeatable. I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - it is very light, so good for travel.</li>
            <li> a little thicker than what I pictured, but it would work well for my daughters hair who is longer than mine.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the awesome reviews, but I still can not figure out how to use it :( I have tried multiple times on different occasions, and it just gives a very limp curl. Kind of wastes all the time of straightening my hair. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This wand does wonders on my STRAIGHT, THICK hair that goes down to my waist. Great product for some natural looking waves.</li>
            <li> It really works, it made the curls to last but you have to use a heat protector to prevent the damage to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The curls last but it depends how you do it and the products you apply before and after.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to make the curls with no products and the curls last a few hours, because you have to help them to stay beautiful. But the curling iron really works! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> overall this curling iron does its job. it creates beautiful loose curls. the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a clipper makes it a little tricky. sometimes when you forget to wear the glove/bring the glove when you are traveling it burns your finger easily..</li>
            <li> My favorite!!!! I&#x27;ve had this one and the smaller one for 3 years now. No complaints</li>
            <li> Magic Wand! Perfect curls every time...such a great product for a great price. I have thick, coarse hair and can curl my hair quicker than straightening and the curls last for the day-Love it!</li>
            <li> if you want curls, this is the wand for you!  easy to use, heats quick, several different temps for different hair types.  would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The wand was too big for my length hair.</li>
            <li> -Clampless &#x3D; no kinks in your hair from trying to clamp your hair in place (&amp;wasting more time getting it in place)  -Easy to use - just wrap your hair around and around, ending up in perfect curls every time!  I had problems learning how to use it at first (and my hair kept sliding out of place) but after a few tries, I was able to get the hang of it and didn&#x27;t have any more problems with it.  I recommend the 1 -1 1/2&#x27;&#x27;  sizes over the 1/2 - 1&#x27;&#x27; because the larger barrel will give you a more natural look! I own both sizes, and found the smaller (1/2- 1&#x27;&#x27;) made the curls tighter than what I wanted - only when it loosened after a few hours does it look good.  PLUS, the larger barrel size is better for my long hair - giving it nice curls throughout the day, and wavy/beachy curls by the end of the night.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I can go on and on about this curling wand but less is more and all I can say is....AMAZING! Get it! Especially from Amazon.com cause it arrives super fast and free!</li>
            <li> I find it extremely hard to use. I am not overly impressed by it and I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was reading all the comments and though to myself wow,ok,i would give it a try.I was so excited to try it out.Turn out,it made my hair look like a total joke.Like seriously,it burns my hands,and this is not even my first time using it,it doesn&#x27;t hold curls well.C&#x27;on people,save your time and money,and go buy you a HOT TOOLS curling iron,pay a bit more,but the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this iron for the price. It looks nice and seems to be made of decent materials. It heats up very quickly. It has an auto shut off. There is also a temperature control so you can decide how much heat is good for your hair. It has a wide barrel for a larger curl. Since the barrel is tapered, you can adjust the curl size somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind standing there holding your hair, then this iron would be great for you. I found my arms were getting tired fast. As I have long, thick hair, I found I didn&#x27;t want to use it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the glove was clinky and awkward. You pretty much have to wear it to avoid burning your fingers, but I don&#x27;t care for the glove. As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t take long to feel the heat even with the glove on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because the iron itself is good quality. The missing two stars are for the clunky glove and the fact that you have to drain the blood from your arms to curl your own hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Awesome product! I highly recommend this curling iron! Deserves 5 stars 👍🏻</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Must be careful when using it though as you can easily get burned! Curls come out beautiful and hair is done in 10 minutes!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have to learn how to curl my hair right but my straight Asian hair holds curls best with this wand vs curling iron.</li>
            <li> I just received my curling wand today and I love it!  It gets salon hot!  It honestly only took me about 15 min to do my whole head and I have thick hair a little past my bra strap in length.  I didn&#x27;t put any product in while using it but sprayed a light hairspray on when I was done. I think it looks great! So easy to use and I&#x27;m glad I got the bigger barrel!</li>
            <li> This is almost impossible to use.  You have to heat the barrel, wrap your hair around it - hold your hair in place ( without burning yourself)  wear the glove, which makes actually getting your hair on the barrel so difficult.  Just use a wide barrel curing iron!  That works far better - this is a bad design.</li>
            <li> I am not a hairdresser by any means, but this wand works awesome for even someone like me. I use it to create messy waves for a beachy look. My hair comes out so awesome, that even my daughter who IS a hairdresser has commented on how good it looks. I highly recommend. But beware...this thing gets super hot so be sure to use the glove that comes with it to prevent from burning your hands.</li>
            <li> Not as expected, hard to roll</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the hang of this curling wand, but once I got the hang of it, it was perfect. Make sure you use the glove because it gets very hot! I recommend watching some Youtube videos on the curling iron and practicing before actually needing to have your hair curled for an event!</li>
            <li> Few things:  - I have super-straight, difficult-to-style Asian hair. This hair is resistant to curling, volumizing or generally doing anything fun with it.  - It takes a hot CHI flat iron to get some sort of shape and volume to it. Flat irons are nice for the coordination-challenged who might burn themselves otherwise, as the outsides of the flat iron are protected and cool.  - I broke my CHI flat iron by dropping the plug end on a hard tile bathroom floor. $$ :(  - I hate the little mark that curling irons make where the clamp edge meets hair.  So those are the reasons why I opted to try this curling wand. First night I tried it, it sucked. I burned my fingers, and due to my lack of experience with curling irons I zinged my ears and neck a couple of times before calling it a day. I kept swapping between putting the glove on the left hand and the right and felt that that step was really cumbersome. The sort of problems I&#x27;ve never had to deal with before when using a flat iron. Needless to say I was a little disappointed after being psyched up to all the lovely reviews I&#x27;d read on this thing.  I gave it another go this morning. The reviews stating that their hair held a curl even when sleeping on it were true. Normally, the morning after I flat-iron style my hair, it is all frizzy with squished curls. I woke to smooth curls just the way I left them when I went to bed.  I went and got another glove, a roll of blue painter&#x27;s tape and tried again.  First off, if you are prone to burning yourself or have short hairs at the nape of your neck that you want to curl, lay a strip of tape across your bare skin at the nape of your neck. Take another short strip and fold it over the top of your ears, protecting the tip, sides and outward-facing aspect of your ear.  Put on both gloves.  Hold down the power button on your device to fire it up.  Now you&#x27;re ready to begin.   Unlike the YouTube videos where gals were twirling long locks over the barrel, I have short hair so I sectioned, took a wide piece of hair and laid it over the barrel horizontally. With a gloved hand I smoothed it over the barrel as the other hand pulled the wand up.  This helped me get a lot of volume at the roots, precisely what I bought this for.  With two gloves, it is easy to alternate between hands to style. I felt less edgy and nervous that I&#x27;d burn myself. As clumsy and accident prone as I am, I did not burn myself once. And the nice thing is, if you apply the tape just right, you can reuse it again a few more times.    The advantages over this curling wand over getting another CHI flat iron were that it was more affordable, damaged my hair less and had longer-lasting curls. The disadvantage was the burning part, but I figured a way around that. I picked up this larger barrel because I wanted to use it to volumize my hair, and it worked.  Neat little styling tool! Very fast once you get the hang of it! I would have given a full 5 stars if it actually had two gloves instead of one.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gives me beautiful curls!!! it is one of the best!! the curls last a long time and they are just lovely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love this this iron! I gets very hot and stays hot. I get better curls with this than a curling iron and it&#x27;s much easier to use. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the glove doesn&#x27;t do much to protect your fingers from the heat. I wish the glove was thicker, as I find myself burning my fingers when I hold the curl. Overall, great iron, bad glove!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter, at her request.  She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Was expecting it to be a little nicer. Also dries my hair out faster than regular irons</li>
            <li> Some of these wands make super curly, very Shirley Temple-esk. This one make the best soft curls. Better than any curling iron or other wand I have had before. It may take a few times to get used to using a wand and turing your hair the right way but this come highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Seriously? This is what I have WANTED for years and just discovered. I thought that I was terrible at curling my hair when it&#x27;s actually been my old curling wand. This one is so easy to use and gives very loose wavy curls. It&#x27;s perfect. And not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> order was exceptional</li>
            <li> My mom bought this product for me as a christmas present and i recieved it last week and i was able to use it just once to make sure the heat settinging were working and to see if i even liked it.  And I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Now it is going away until christmas and i am dying, my curls are amazing i have course ethnic hair and i was able to curl my hair without straigtening it in advance which cuts down time and heat damage to my hair.   The learning curve to this product is not hard i did it a couple of times with the glove and within 20 minutes i was able to wrap it fine without the glove on, I cannot wait to use it again and i highly reccomed this product to women who have course ethinic hair.  P.S- For reviewers who say that the buttons are placed weirdly and while you are curling your hair you keep pressing the button and turning the heat up or down there is a lock setting if you read the directions.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;m not exactly the most hair-savvy person on the planet and have enough trouble with regular curling irons. But then I watched a how-to video on YouTube (which I HIGHLY recommend doing!!) and decided it was worth a shot. SO GLAD I DID! This gets much hotter than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had before (hence the glove, which is pretty important in my opinion) but each section of my hair only needed about 30 seconds and the curls are gorgeous! They kind of look like finger waves, which I&#x27;ve ALWAYS wanted to be able to do but never had the patience for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, yes it a little awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it (which for me only took about 5 minutes), it&#x27;s really no more complicated than a traditional curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this since like everyone else, I am time strapped when doing my hair. This curling wand produces gorgeous curls for a variety of styles without any line from the usual clamp style irons.&lt;br /&gt;Once you spend a little extra time using a curling wand with the glove, you can produce amazing results in the same amount of time as a traditional iron. It&#x27;s time well spent and you will be thrilled with the results. This particular iron heats up quickly and produces any size wave you need, which is great for shorter strands of hair, bangs or just a variety of hairstyles. I like that I only need to take one curling iron with me when I travel and still get a variety of looks.&lt;br /&gt;It seems as if the wand style irons/wavers are the direction that hair appliances are heading so it is worth trying one out. Solid, well made wand that has held up well for several months now.</li>
            <li> I cannot oversell this product enough. Where do I start- my hair is thin, fine, and before I got this it had never held a curl for more than 1 minute- literally.&lt;br /&gt;I had almost given up on beautiful, natural looking waves until my friend told me about how amazing her wand is. I got the bigger size, which is better for waves than the smaller version. As soon as I got it in the mail, I started messing around with my hair. Now, I am no hair styling expert, in fact I am very far from it, but my hair looked PERFECT the first time I used it. Beachy waves that stay literally all day. And I don&#x27;t even use any product- just wash, dry, and curl.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely amazed that something has actually worked on my hair to curl it, just when I almost gave up completely...</li>
            <li> Love this product! Produces looser, more natural looking waves than a curling iron. Like anything else, it took some time to learn how to use it properly, but I ended up giving away my curling iron because it was completely replaced by this wand.</li>
            <li> I had never used a curling wand so I cant compare it to any other. However I can say that I love this curling wand. It gets hot enough for my hair to get curled and stay curled all day. And love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like regular curlers did when a strand of hair would get caught in the clamp part. I don&#x27;t use the glove that comes with it because it tends to make my hair frizzy when I grab my hair with it. As long as I&#x27;m careful then I won&#x27;t burn myself and haven&#x27;t done so. The cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled when you are curling your hair. Its very easy to use and you can make lose or tight curls depending on how long you hold your hair on the wand for. For the price and quality I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and great addition to any woman&#x27;s hot tool collection. I wish it had a better stand to sit on the counter but all in all its a great wand.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand, still have to get used to using it (burnt my fingers a few times lol) but it is still great, heats up quickly and gives fabulous curls in a short space of time!</li>
            <li> This is an edited review. We initially believed the curling wand to be broken, but it works fine. It just requires us to hold the on button for a good 20 seconds or so before it will start. Once it has, though, it works like a charm. It takes some getting used to to switch from a curling iron to a wand, but I&#x27;m figuring it out, and I love the quality of the curls. I&#x27;d happily recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd clipless curling iron. The two I&#x27;ve owned prior to this were definitely more expensive. This curling iron rivals the more expensive ones and makes me wish I had tried this sooner. I like that there&#x27;s a temperature lock function so I don&#x27;t accidentally change the temperature if I press on the control while curling. I don&#x27;t always curl my hair but the handful of times I&#x27;ve used this curling iron, I was happy with the results. Definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Absolutely happy with this purchase. Works great, not much else to say. I would definitely recommend this curling wand!</li>
            <li> I use this wand a lot! I love it! it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair and it heats up pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets hot super quick. Perfect waves.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Works great, heats up nicely, easy to use, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product after hearing and reading great reviews on it and thought it would be the perfect tool to get the big, bouncy curls I&#x27;ve always wanted. My hair is just past my shoulders, mostly straight with a natural wave and does not hold a curl easily. I did a lot of research before I bought this wand and overall, people were saying it was a great product. Many reviewers said this curling wand really worked, even for those who have a hard time keeping a curl in their hair. Several reviewers said it was easy to use, others said it was tricky at first but after a few tries it became easier. This product is overrated - I disagree with all these reviews. This wand was very difficult to use! Even with the heat protective glove, I burned myself just about every time and I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a novice with hair tools. The glove is not thick enough and also doesn&#x27;t cover your wrist sufficiently - when you&#x27;re wrapping your hair around the wand your bare wrist and forearm are exposed and always dangerously close to touching that +400F wand. This curling wand is super awkward to use. No matter which angle I hold the wand, my hair just slides down the wand so that its all bunched up and not evenly spiraled around it. This is partly why my curls did not come out very nice, but also they did not stay curled. 10-20 minutes after curling my hair, the curl had fallen and my hair looked like limp waves. And yes, I tried using hair spray. This is not based on a one time use - I have used this product several times, always hoping it will get easier to use and always hoping my curls will miraculously turn out beautiful this time. Another point I&#x27;d like to make is that the 1 1/2\\&quot; wand is not for those with medium to short length hair. I would say I have medium length hair and there&#x27;s absolutely no way I could achieve the big, voluminous curls I wanted with this product. The curls I got with this product are hard to explain.. not tight curls, but not big ones either. It looked very weird. I almost wanted to exchange my wand for the smaller version, at least then I could try using it for tighter curls, but if the smaller wand is just as awkward to use and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, why bother?</li>
            <li> What kind of wizard do you have to be to use this thing?  It shipped quickly and was as described.  It gets hotter than the surface of the sun.  It does come with a &amp;#34;heat proof&amp;#34; glove (don&#x27;t trust it...it&#x27;s heatproof for about 3 seconds).  Maybe if you&#x27;re an experienced hairstylist you can use this, but for an amateur like me, this is WAY too difficult to use and will now hide in my bathroom closet and provoke funny looks from guests searching for more toilet paper.</li>
            <li> Hate these ... brought them a year ago. Ordered a warranty it NEVER came and they do NOT work! I have tried them on all different types of hair and they never work. So dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Im one of those girls that all I can do is straighten my hair and leave it natural. This wand is super easy to use! I&#x27;ve used a curling iron maybe twice and this is 10 times easier. You do have to get the hang of it at first, but overall my hair looked really nice the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Works great for the price! :)&lt;br /&gt;I got the 1-1 1/2 inch wand for bigger curls.</li>
            <li> I had been in the market for a new curling iron and was wanting to try a clampless iron, such as a curling wand. I saw this one on Amazon for a great deal and couldn&#x27;t resist. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this! The included heat protectant glove is nice if you&#x27;re worried about burning your fingers, which I was. This wand creates beautiful, natural-looking waves or curls, depending on the heat setting you use/how long you have your hair wrapped around the wand. It can be a little awkward to use, but once you figure out how to angle it, it works wonderfully! Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love it! It works great and the heat protectant glove is perfect</li>
            <li> Remington has done it with the Pearl ceramic line of products.  Nothing works on my wavy/curly hair, and  my curls always fall out within a few hours, unless I use a bottle of hairspray. Then they stay in for maybe 3 hours. This wand and the others in the line, work fantastic. Buy one!!</li>
            <li> Love this wand and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.  I have extremely thick hair, and before this curling wand, I wasn&#x27;t able to keep curls in my hair even with a massive amount of gel, hairspray and whatever else you can use to make your hair look like it was glued onto your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this curling wand, I can curl my hair on day 1 and have it last till day 3.  Of course on day 1 the curls are much tighter, and on day 3, you have loose fabulous hair.  In between those days, I use dry shampoo so I can keep my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my long, thick head of hair, it usually takes me 15-20 minutes to curl my whole head, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the 1/2 inch to 1 inch wand and used to curl my whole entire head but then I started to only curl the bottom half of my hair for which I used the 1 inch side of the barrel.  Because I want more loose curls, I bought the 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re both great! I highly recommend this product.  I even bought one for my sister &#x27;cause her hair is even thicker and longer than mine and it curled it like no other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this is the cheapest curling wand on the market (or at least that I&#x27;m aware of).  This is a really great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this gets HOT (duh!).  I may have burned my fingers once or twice when first using it but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it within a couple of tries.  Use the curling wand glove at first to get the hang of it.  I did but now I don&#x27;t need it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When curling the right side of your hair, have the curler in your left hand and use your right hand to wrap.  When curling the left side of your hair, have the curler in your right hand and use your left hand to wrap.  Have the wand pointing down (skinnier side down) while wrapping your hair around it.  If you want to go the extra mile, when the curl comes out, cup the curl in your hand for 5 sec. to really set it.</li>
            <li> love this product and the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> My Wife liked the one with smaller curl so returned this one and got lesser size one</li>
            <li> Originally, I purchased the 1-1.5 inch curling wand, but found the results to be too \\&quot;shirly temple\\&quot;-esque for me. Even though I had read countless reviews and watched numerous videos, the curls ended up being tighter than I wanted and found it hard to get the results I desired. I decided to purchase the larger wand, and it was a great decision! The wand was easy to use and I had the bigger, voluminous curls that I desired from the beginning. I have medium length hair, so the larger wand would be better fit for those with the same length or longer because of the size of the barrel. This wand curls very fast and it took around 15 minutes to have all of my hair completed. Plus, I love the fact that you can change the temperature. Both wands had great hold altogether, but if you want the curls that you see on TV and in magazines, I would definitely go with the larger wand.</li>
            <li> Using this iron can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first. Definitely use the glove until you&#x27;re comfortable or you WILL burn yourself! Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s quick and easy to create loos curls. Love!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, who has been searching for a durable curling iron.  Unfortunately, this was of little use to my wife without a bar to held her hair in place.  It is unfortunate, since this appears to be well built, just not something we could use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i got a refurbished one or something but the one i was sent did not even come in a box. Very strange. Works fine looks slightly different than the photo but... no packaging, no invoice, and  was sent directly from amazon. Just weird really. oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 8/27/17 - Still have this and still works like a charm love this thing !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling wand ive ever tried. It doesnt damage your hair and it holds a curl pretty well even without hairspray. It actually makes my hair feel softer when i use it, which is strange in a great way!</li>
            <li> This product gets very hot very fast. It works so good. It comes with a glove which helps at the beginning cuz using a wond can be difficult for some</li>
            <li> I received my item in the mail in a white cardboard  box with no actual packaging from Remington other than the manual. It was all black and didn&#x27;t match the photo, but I really didn&#x27;t have a problem with that. When I plugged it in to curl my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t work. I tried over the course of the day in different outlets in my house to try to turn it on. It never turned on and it sounded as though there was loose wiring inside of it. I was so excited to receive this and finally have a curler, and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I&#x27;m sure it was probably an issue with rough shipping and handling, as my package was actually shipped in a box way too large for the small curlers box. It was probably shaken around and ended up breaking on its way to me. Regardless, I am now left with a broken curling wand and a waste of money. Hopefully amazon or the seller is able to work with me on getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly&lt;br /&gt;I love it. This product doesn&#x27;t exist in France . .</li>
            <li> It curled my hair very well despite my hair being a little below shoulders since I got the 1-1 1/2 inch one it was perfect</li>
            <li> This thing is worth every penny! Such pretty spirals!</li>
            <li> My hair is not soft at all so I need something really fast and heated to curl my hair. I ordered two different products. One is REVLON&#x27;s Laser curling iron, one is Remington. I got REVLON&#x27;s curling iron first, it burned me a lot and the curls cannot be maintained for even a dinner time. I&#x27;m returning it. I tried Remington yesterday and I definitely loved it! It comes with a glove and is very easy to use. You won&#x27;t be burned if you use the glove and be careful. The curls look great. They lasted for a whole night. I really love it!</li>
            <li> There definitely is a learning curve to this product... which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing as a good product doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a great hairdo.  A few quick videos online can help the learning process.  The barrel heats well and delivers a marvelous curl once one gets the hang of it, but it seems a bit of talent with a regular curling iron would be just as useful. My biggest complain with this product is the glove. It&#x27;s not as heat resistant as one would like.</li>
            <li> Love this wand.  Works great on my hair as well as my 4 year old twin girls. I recommend spaying hair with hairspray first and brushing through before curling hair.  And for best looking results, use left hand to curl right side of head, pointing narrowest part towards shoulder of ground and wrap hair in direction away from face.  And vice versa with left side of head.  Hold wand with right hand pointy side down and wrap hair away from face.  I was pleasantly surprised with quality and performance for the price.  I think the bigger barrel works best for longer length hair.</li>
            <li> I could never get the hang of the traditional curling iron with the clamp, I REALLY like this one! some complained of burns, I&#x27;m pretty sure you can burn yourself with any hair styling weapon if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this wand, nothing would curl her hair before, and now its nothing but curls!</li>
            <li> The perfect curling tool for someone with fine, wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend and she said it was too bulgy to use and it make it extremely to wrap the hair around the barrel. Suggest using a smaller wand in the same brand.</li>
            <li> This is the Best wand ever!! i use it everyday, creates awesome waves. this is a must buy, worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> Thank you!Excellent choice!</li>
            <li> I have both sizes in this curling wand. Takes some time to learn to use but it gives long lasting curls to my fine limp hair. Love it</li>
            <li> I just received this curling wand today and I love it. I have super long and thick hair which has never been able to hold a curl even with my straightener, but this wand made it so easy to get the big loose curls I wanted.  I was only testing the wand out so I didn&#x27;t use any hairspray but even without it they held for several hours.  I&#x27;m excited to keep practicing and using this product.</li>
            <li> often doesn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> If your looking for a good wand that gives you loose beach waves and a great price this is the wand you need. I just used this 15 minutes ago and I love the way this wand gives me the loose curls I&#x27;ve been looking for. I got this at my local Walmart for 30 dollars. I thought I was going to see some cheap features.. But I got the results that make my wand seem worth a lot more than it actually was. I bought a nume curl wand and paid 4 times as much. This wand worked a lot better than the nume. It gave me nice curls in 30 minutes to do my full head. And I have really thick hair. The nume took me an hour. If your looking for a wand that heats up fast gives you nice loose curls and for great price I defiantly recommend this Remington wand.</li>
            <li> This clipless curling iron works way better than it should at that price. I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. I constantly get compliments on my beachy waves, and I have this iron to thank. I definitely recommend ALWAYS using the glove, and also to be careful of where your hand is on the handle. There&#x27;s not much of a barrier between the handle and the super hot part.</li>
            <li> great iron does the job</li>
            <li> I own both the 1-1.5 inches and 0.5-1 inch wands but mostly use the bigger wand. The 0.5-1inch creates tight curls that reminds me of Taylor Swift&#x27;s signature curls. The 1-1.5 inch creates loose waves. My friends fell in love with it when I let them borrow it when we are getting ready to go out. I bought the 1-1.5 inches one as a gift for my friend because she loved mines so much. You can create the perfect waves in about 10 minutes!! At first, it&#x27;s so hard learning to hold the wand properly and not burning your fingers while wrapping your hair around it. I hated it so badly that I didn&#x27;t use the wand again after my first try for a good half a year. After that, once I learned how to properly hold the wand and use it I use it quite often to wave my hair. The heat glove definitely helped when I first started learning to use the wand. I recommend to YouTube videos on how to use a wand before trying for your first time. Another tip is it really matters which way you curl your hair inwards or outwards. In my opinion, and the only way I curl my hair is outwards because it looks more natural and frames my face better. This wand (1-1.5 inches) is really good for the price and gets the perfect waves for me every time.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes bigger, fuller curls than my other wand. I like this one better, the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and it took us a month to open it, it was a few weeks before i gave it as a gift and another few before she tried to use it. When She did, the heat protecting glove was missing and I&#x27;m now past the window of returns.</li>
            <li> My sister brought this very phallic looking curling wand when she came to visit me, and after urging me to try it.. I ended up on Amazon purchasing it :)  This is such an easy curling wand, and so inexpensive for such a great result.  I can curl my whole head of long hair in less than 10 minutes, and the result is flawless loose waves.  I always get compliments on my hair and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this tool.  Get it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and a half using it probably 1-2x a week and its still going strong!</li>
            <li> This is the second clipless curling wand i have bought (I also got the conair you curl which was okay) and by far my favorite.  My curls last for ever and aren&#x27;t to tight right after i curl them.  My curls also last a veyy long time!!! I am so satisfied with this also it is cheaper by about $30 than the you curl.  I AM SOOOOOO HAPPY WITH THIS</li>
            <li> This seemed an ok quality. It was a good idea to be able to lock the buttons because they are right when your hand grips. But the taper is awkward and your hair can slip down it if you aren&#x27;t careful. It gave me some decent waves but nothing wow. If you don&#x27;t already use a wand, it may not impress you much. There is a little more arm yoga involved. I like to use a clamp iron that I can either clamp or use as a wand.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this because it did not curl my thick wiry red hair as tightly as I wanted. I recommend the smaller size. However when I went to return it they were out of the smaller barrel size, so instead I got the Herstyler Grande pink curling wand (which was cheaper) and it works great.</li>
            <li> Tried getting the bigger barrel for the curling wand. I was disappointed in the look of the hair with the wand.</li>
            <li> I am having some trouble using this. It requires practice and patience after using curling irons for so long.</li>
            <li> I bought this curler because I had used a friend&#x27;s wand and wanted one of my own. This product had good reviews so I decided to go for it. I&#x27;ve never had trouble with my hair holding a curl but this wand simply does not do the job. I have thick, naturally curly hair and I was hoping to use this to tame some pieces but it ends up making my hair more frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the problem is because it heats up just fine and is easy to use. My mom has used it a few times and loves it, but her hair is finer than mine.</li>
            <li> Purchased the 1-1/2&amp;#34; for girlfriend. She said it works great and opted for the larger size wand for ease of use. Looked to be the better buy when compared to similar products in the similar price ranges. Seems comparable to and or better than products below and above this price range as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this wand only for one side of my hair didn&#x27;t even use spray and it held nicely most of the day. I am very happy with this wand the price is amazing for the work it does.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught at the end of the wand, which breaks it off and causes a lot of damage. Otherwise a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say, this is a MAGIC WAND! Of, course, it takes a little bit of practice to get used to it but when you do, you can do amazing things with your hair. I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;On my pictures, you see my first-time attempt and I think it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> heats up fast! doesn&#x27;t take long to girl, quickly wrap my hair around it and let it loose. Great for longer hair and bigger waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not recommend for shot hair girls</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this wand! It makes perfect loose curls on her very long and very thick hair. She has a much more expensive (think $150) curling wand that doesn&#x27;t work as well or as as quickly as this one! I highly recommend this especially at this price!</li>
            <li> They send you ONE GLOVE for this item. Just buy a normal curling iron, don&#x27;t waste your money. Only used it once.</li>
            <li> This thing heats up so quickly! The glove that comes with it is more like a regular mitten for cold weather and doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat very much. But it&#x27;s better than doing it without a glove! Gave my very fine, but very thick bone-straight hair great body and lasted hours. Even in 90 degree heat. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great! I also have the 1/2&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; for smaller curls. I recently went for a bachelorette weekend for my best friend &amp; she used it constantly. When we got back home, she asked to borrow it for her shower coming up &amp; I knew that wouldn&#x27;t be the last time, so I just decided to get her one of her own &amp; it delivered the very next day instead of the 2-day shipping I chose, so that was a great surprise as well. We both love using it. I do have to use the glove still &amp; that was one of the main reasons I chose this one in the first place &amp; after reading all of the other reviews, as I&#x27;m still a beginner with wands, never doing much more than straightening my hair for many years, so I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how not to burn myself yet without the glove.</li>
            <li> I just did NOT receive the item. UPS tracking says they left the item at the front door. But, there was NO item at my front door. Plus, why did they NOT knock on my door? Why did they NOT make a second visit/delivery to my home if they thought I wasn&#x27;t at home? UPS track says that they left the item at the front door without my receit signature. Somebody stole the item from my front door? There is no way I can know that. For as I said, I did NOT see or receive the item at all.</li>
            <li> I got this a while ago after watching some youtube videos and seeing quite a lot of people using this brand. I didn&#x27;t know what size to get but i ended up getting the 1/5-1. I love this wand... I&#x27;ve had many tools in the past that i completely failed at using and i just couldn&#x27;t do it. I am not good at doing hair haha but this is super easy, especially since i just like the wavy effortless look. It takes very little time to do my head and i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair using this- even after my first time! I honestly find it easier to not use the glove...just be careful and you can go twice as fast and was alot easier.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Several heat settings.  Heats up fast. Don&#x27;t damage hair.  But without clamp,  will need to use your hand to wind shorter hair around barrel.  Includes heat protective glove.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! It gives me really pretty loose curls. I bleach my hair so I have to be really careful with heat and I love that there is a temperature option. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it smells like the previous owners burnt hair but that&#x27;s expected when you buy a used curling iron. Overall the curling iron is amazing!...plus it&#x27;s pink :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and gets heated quickly. But you should mind the heat because you will get burned easily too. I got a 1-1/2 size for bigger curl, my hair is very easy to slide off but after practicing more times i can make it fixed well.You can also find more instructions on Youtube. Get the hair separated into small amount group to curl would lead better result. Nice price, good product!</li>
            <li> Get hot enough to hold the curls. My hair does not curl well but this curler does them perfectly. I would most definitely recommend it to my friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li> i love this tool it is quite functional and affordable. Gives me instant victoria secret curls and heats up instantly.</li>
            <li> Works well on fine but thick type 2b hair. Gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it every day. Can make tight-ish curls or lose huge waves if I shake them out</li>
            <li> Really wide barrel so it&#x27;s hard to get my medium length hair around it. Only for long hair.</li>
            <li> For once my hair actually looks like a salon did it. I love this thing!! It&#x27;s also much easier to use and takes a much shorter time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> Best wand ever. Creates large waves. :)</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;gifted&amp;#34; as some say with naturally curly hair. AKA, if-I-brush-it-I-get-a-big-frizzy-mess-and-it-never-cooperates hair. One of my friends recently shared some knowledge with me that I had never considered before: you can curl curly hair. I always straightened it first, and then by the time I straightened it I saw no point to curl it again. Well anyways, curly hair and &amp;#34;curled hair&amp;#34; are totally different. So I wanted to buy a curling iron but I didn&#x27;t want huge curls, so I bought the smaller option and let me tell you: I LOVE it! Works so well, lasts all day, and my hair feels so smooth after! Definitely would recommend. Pictures show my hair curled, and then what my hair looked like naturally before!</li>
            <li> Its really easy to use, and i love how its pink.. The only cons that it has is that it could burn your finger easily so you need to be extra careful.....</li>
            <li> i was worried because my hair is damaged from all the at home coloring i do. but this curler works amazingly my curls lasted over 24hrs even sleeping my them. i was surprised and extremely happy. my hair did feel any different or any more damaged. love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning, but love the different looks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this wand for curling your hair.  It works well and is good quality for the price. If you are looking for a thicker barrel curling wand this fits the bill and does its job.</li>
            <li> Love it! You have to get used to holding it backwards when you switch sides, and it gets extremely hot so watch your ears :) I&#x27;ve never used one of these before and I thought it was really easy to use. You can lock the buttons so the temp setting doesn&#x27;t change when you are manipulating it. You have to use one hand to wrap the hair around the barrel, so your ends won&#x27;t be touching it and getting damaged. Keep the smaller end pointing downward. Also, I have very thick curly hair, so I had to straighten my hair first before using this to get the really fabulous shiny waves. I bought the larger size barrel. Don&#x27;t forget the hairspray afterwards though!</li>
            <li> Gives nice curls to my medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for styling my hair and I rarely blow dry it let alone curl it!  But occasionally I do like to have some curls in my hair because it does look nice and its a refreshing change.  I hate using a curling iron so that was out of the question.  For a while I would load my hair with mousse and then hairspray and I was all set.  But it always took forever since my hair is long and I just hate how my hair feels with that junk in it.  I have long, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls even after a curling iron or mousse/hairspray but when I tried this curling wand that my sister bought I was shocked.  My hair looked absolutely amazing and I was stunned that this little wand actually did the trick of holding curls in my hair.  My sister used it on my hair the first time and it took about 35 min to finish all my hair.  The second time I tried it, I will admit that I became so frustrated with it that I almost quit because it is a little awkward at first.  But I calmed myself down(I&#x27;m normally the most patient person ever) and I finally got the hang of it.  It took me a little longer to finish than it did my sister but I know that once I practice a little more, it will be a lot easier.  As for the glove, I personally would not use this wand without it because its way easier to curl the ends of your hair while wearing it, plus I would rather not burn myself.  I curled my hair in the around noon and the curls held all day plus were still in the next morning.  I will be ordering my very own curling wand soon.</li>
            <li> I dont like the using the globe system... it is very uncomfortable. I sent it back after trying a couple times</li>
            <li> The curling rod works great.  The glove is terrible and offers really no protection.  You may as well be wearing winter gloves.  I&#x27;ll be looking to buy a better glove because it is definitely needed when working with this type of iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron because of the great reviews saying how hot the iron gets. 410 degrees is pretty hot and does a great job keeping the curl long lasting. You don&#x27;t have to hold the hair on the barrel for very long so that cuts down on styling time. I ordered the larger barrel and it gives beautiful big curls that fall into really pretty waves. The reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars is because if your hair is clean and smooth it tends to slide off the iron easily. I&#x27;ve used several clip less irons and know how to use them properly but still It takes a couple tries to get the hair around the iron and hold it there. Granted my hair is super long-to my waist- but it was easier on day old hair. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the iron and will use it often.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! It is so easy to use and creates beautiful curls that last all day and night (and sometimes into the next day!). You can easily create many different looks using just this wand.</li>
            <li> Great curling wand.  No need for the glove after a little practice. My curls are big and wavy, using 1 inch sections. With a little product they last all day, and there is no need to use the highest heat setting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before this product, let me preface this with that. I hate curling irons because I could never not have that weird crease where you clamp onto your hair. This wand is PERFECT. The larger barrel allows for big fluffy waves and the tapered end can give pretty little ringlets too! The adjustable temperature option is wonderful to ensure you&#x27;re not frying your hair and the handle is ergonomically excellent. This may not be a higher end brand but the pearl coating has allowed me to heat style without damaging my hair. This is a great product for younger girls and those who are curious about using a wand - not super expensive but not cheaply made and works great! Comes with a thermal glove too - use it. Burning your finger tips even at the lowest heat setting is no fun.</li>
            <li> When I had almost shoulder-length hair, I thought I might hate this. Now that my hair is just a few inches longer, just past shoulder length, it works much better. In other words, this size of curling rod is for longer hair. A smaller barrel may work for shorter hair. It takes a few sessions to transition from using a regular curling iron all your life to using a rod, but it&#x27;s not rocket science. Adjust the heat up to 410 degrees, put the included heat-resistant glove on the hand that is not holding the rod, and twirl a section of hair around the heat rod for a few seconds. It doesn&#x27;t take long to curl all of my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a gift for a teenaged girl, as it&#x27;s super easy to burn yourself with a curling rod if you&#x27;re not ultra careful.  Update: I am now the proud owner of a smaller rod, as well. The 1/2 inch to 1 inch rod (same brand) results in long-lasting tight curls. If you haven&#x27;t gotten the results you want, try another size. These babies really work!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and when I received it I was eager to try it out. Pleasantly surprised! My hair is very hard to curl and even more so for the curls to stay. I have long hair and with this product it took me literally 10 mins to get all my hair curled just the way I wanted it. I am not use to using heat appliances on my hair but not once did I burn myself. I didn&#x27;t even use the glove. I would definitely recommend this product. Can&#x27;t beat the price! This product gives big curls and if left overnight it will give wavy hair. I personally love it!</li>
            <li> My Con air wand is a lot better than this one. I bought this because I was looking for something to make bigger, looser curls.  This seems to get hotter than what it says. The black tip on the top gets super hot so you can&#x27;t touch it while curling hair. Would not recommend this to someone.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Satisfied!</li>
            <li> Got burn several times. I need to practice more</li>
            <li> Omg, good bye old curling irons! Once you get used to curling with a wand, you&#x27;ll never go back. I want one in every size barrel.</li>
            <li> I had to watch a youtube video to learn how to use this and after that I had no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;It curls my hair nicely, but may be harder for shorter than shoulder length hair since it&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
            <li> I have really persistent straight hair and holds curl very poorly regardless of the combination of products used. However this curling wand does the best job I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;ve gotten blowouts at high end places and hair done with this wand fares better. It gets really hot and the lack of a clip makes this tool slightly precarious. That&#x27;s not the fault of the curler though. With some practice and patience, this wand does the trick. Since it does get so hot, considering using a heat protector so your hair doesn&#x27;t frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the color is light pink and thicker shape makes it a bit phallic looking.</li>
            <li> This is the larger 1 - 1 1/2&amp;#34; wand, and I also bought the smaller 1/2 - 1&amp;#34; wand. I really like them both, but like this larger one just a tiny bit less than the smaller one. I have fine, naturally curly (wavy), long hair (several inches below my shoulders). This larger iron gives looser curls that don&#x27;t hold as long, which is good for a different look. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the ridge at the tip of the curling wand that acts as a stand. This ridge catches on my hair so it doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly off the end. The smaller wand doesn&#x27;t have that ridge.</li>
            <li> When you pull it out of the box it feels like the cheapest, lightweight thing. It heats up fast and my hair holds curls for days. Most curling irons I have to hold for 30 seconds. This one-not even on it&#x27;s highest setting-I hold for about 15 seconds and the curls last. Love it!</li>
            <li> I think the amount you can fluctuate with the temperature settings is great.  It goes from 266 degrees to 410 degrees in 18 degree increments.&lt;br /&gt;The protective glove that comes with it is much appreciated. I tried using it without the glove and burnt myself several times.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about it is the pink color :)</li>
            <li> Just hasn&#x27;t done it for me.  I may have to buy a glove and give it another go, but that seems like a dumb method to me.</li>
            <li> Makes a decent curl but it&#x27;s fairly difficult to use without burning yourself.  Yes, they give you the glove but I had to keep switching hands depending on what side of my head I was doing.  Definitely not for a first timer at hair curling that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try this instead of a regular curling iron and I definitely think it holds curl better for a longer time than a traditional curling iron. I like this a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this hair wand but the only downside is that my hair won&#x27;t hold the curl for the entire day. I&#x27;ve tried this on other people and it works great. But for me, my hair is stubbornly straight. The high heat settings on this actually keeps the curls in for a good few hours though, so I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> Thank you - love it will be buying the smaller one soon</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling wand because my sister has been using the same one for at least one year and loves it. I&#x27;ve used mine only a few times since purchasing it and so far have no complaints. It works as expected and I like having the digital temperature display. The only downside is that my long hair tends to slip down the barrel, but this seems to happen with any curling wand.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy for her to get the hang of.  She&#x27;s not quite 12, and I was a little worried about her getting burned since it does go to such a high temperature.  So far she&#x27;s done just fine with it.  Makes nice loose fashionable curls.  Gets hot quickly and it&#x27;s nice that it has an automatic timed turn off so it can&#x27;t accidentally be left on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  Curls / waves my fine, stick straight hair instantly.  It did take a bit of practice to get used to wrapping hair around the iron and not burning my hand.  One tip I did learn is to wrap the hair around the barrel flat, do not let the hair twist.  If you allow the hair to twist the curls come out a bit bonkers or non-existent.</li>
            <li> Primarily think that me having trouble with this is my fault.  All thumbs, but I&#x27;m determined to master it.</li>
            <li> Works well on my daughters thick hair. Quick shipping also</li>
            <li> This is perfect for making loose curls or beach waves! Love it, and it&#x27;s super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love this. It gets super hot super quick. I wish I had bought the smaller version, but the bigger one works nicely too with a little hairspray or spritzing gel. Definitely wear the glove!! I burn myself every time I try to wing it bare-handed. My only complaint really is that it doesn&#x27;t have anything to prop itself up on when you set it down, so you have to watch where and how you balance it as it&#x27;s heating up. My first time using it, it rolled a bit on the countertop and wound up melting through a bottle of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I was expecting this curling wand with the pink thing and I got a black one it was completely black I didn&#x27;t want to extange it because they already screwed my order up before I am really mad and not very pleased I accidentally burned myself the first time I used it although I herd only good things from this curling wand so I am giving it 3 stars</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with a bit about my hair type: Long, naturally dead straight, thick, and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new curling iron and came across the curling wands. I checked out a few youtube videos to get an idea of how each wand curled and ended up going with the thicker barrel. I do not care for tight curls, I prefer the larger waves to lift my hair and give it some body- from what I saw if you want more defined curls you should probably go with the thinner wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product takes some getting used to, the first two times I did it my hair looked terrible. I&#x27;m starting to get used to how to hold the hair and barrel- the curls looks much better, but I&#x27;m still pretty slow at the whole process. The hair will slip if you do not hold it right, and it worked best for me when I held the curler upside down with the skinnier part of the barrel pointed at the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the glove, but I wish it was more heat resistant. The barrel gets pretty hot(the highest is 410, which is the setting I use), at this temperature the glove immediately heats up, and if you accidentally touch it you only have a second or two to move before it gets too hot. it is enough time to protect your fingers, but I would have liked something I could keep on the barrel longer to really curl to the tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really do not like about this product is the rest/kick stand. With most curlers you get one that keeps the metal about 1/2-1 inch off of the surface, this curler does not have that. the little resting stands are purely just to keep it from rolling, and are only a CM or 2 in height, so any surface it is on is blazing hot within a few seconds of putting it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good curling wand especially for the price ,,,. The heating is pretty quick and high .. I don&#x27;t set it all up I leave it around 351 and it&#x27;s perfect ! Get loose waves or even semi tight curls !</li>
            <li> Love it!  I get the waves I like that I just couldn&#x27;t accomplish with a regular curling iron.  I like the adjustable temperature it gets very hot!</li>
            <li> I love this tool. I have long layered hair. I do 10 or 12 curls, spray with hair spray, and then brush them out. It gives me big, lovely waves.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls. This curling iron works well and with a little hairspray the curls stay in. Temperature is adequate and the surface on the iron is smooth. The only thing I would say is not up to quality is the heat resistant glove. It is very thin and the heat get through.</li>
            <li> I have the smaller barrel and wanted a different curl, a larger curl.  It&#x27;s perfect!!  Both pearl products are truly better than any of the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Curls REALLY well.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I got a defective one, I only got to use it once, and the result was beautiful curls, absolutely beautiful on my medium length, thin hair. The second time I went to use it the temp went WAY too hot and my hair was smoking after a few seconds! However, the curls it makes are beautiful! No product needed at all! So I sent it back and replaced it with a clamp-type made by Conair. When I received the Conair, I tried EVERY way I possible could to curl my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair, and nothing.. .nada, NO curls. Even clipping it to my head to set them, when released they just fell out. So, either the temperature buttons are seriously not working?? or it just sucks super bad. I can&#x27;t believe that the Conair would suck that badly though, so I am sending IT back and getting this Remington again, hopefully no hair burning this time. I would recommend this product to anyone! Especially those of us with hard-to-curl hair!</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece and she loves it. It works great, curls last all day. Works just as well or better than expensive irons.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty using this without a clip. I thought it would be easy, but it is awkward&lt;br /&gt;using it with the glove. I plan on getting a wand with a clip attached.</li>
            <li> These are great for natural, beachy waves for your hair. The heatproof gloves work wonders as well. It heats up real hot and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does not work well and i wish i would have sent this back. I will just use my straightener to curl my hair from now on like i usually do. Def not even worth the $15 i spent</li>
            <li> This wand is absolutely amazing. My curls hold all day and I always get compliments!!</li>
            <li> This curling wand works very well.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve owned.  I chose this one because my flat iron is a Remington and has lasted a long time.  It does not include 20 soft rollers as stated in the description, which was fine since I didn&#x27;t need them.  Just beware that it&#x27;s just the wand plus a glove!</li>
            <li> So much quality for so little money! Make sure you practice before burning your forehead and hands!</li>
            <li> Heats evenly for a perfect curl every time. Used on my wedding day on my real hair and rely extensions and it did wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good quality for great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see all the negative reviews on here. I&#x27;m not a girly girl but i ordered it because it was on sale and I&#x27;m sick of having straight hair all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes your hair slips on the barrel, but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I think with a little practice it will get easier for me. I&#x27;ve only curled my long thick hair once with it and surprisingly it only took 30 min! If I had used a standard curler I probably would&#x27;ve given up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a glove that clearly stated not to touch the barrel with it because it isn&#x27;t made to be heat proof. I used the glove and didn&#x27;t burn myself once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone that has medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. i didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in the quality of my curls from that of a regular curling iron. However, the wand is much easier to use to achieve loose waves and to avoid an indent from the clasp of a regular curling iron. This wand gets very hot but comes with a glove. I love this wand.</li>
            <li> Love this wand!!!  Great for my long hair!  Heats up quickly and easy to use!  Definitely watch an instructional video so you know how to hold it.  ha!</li>
            <li> My hair just kept slipping right off! I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller version of this before but as my hair grew longer (now about 7-8 inches past shoulders) I needed a wand with a wider barrel. This has been perfect! I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day since August 2013 and it&#x27;s still working perfectly. I usually turn up the heat by two - to 390 and am able to curl my hair in 3 layers in about 10-15 minutes. I love that it has an automatic timer in case you leave it on by mistake. The only thing I would change is the chord - I wish it were a bit longer and flat as it can tangle a bit but it&#x27;s not something that would deter me from recommending it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very low maintenance so I was a little nervous buying a tool that I might not ever use. It&#x27;s a little tricky at first but it only took my one time to get a hang of it. I have stick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of anything so when my curls lasted all day I was very surprised! Very happy!</li>
            <li> maybe its just me but this curling wand was a bit o big, i man REALLY BIG... however it could have been the way i ordered it as well</li>
            <li> Love this wand! I used to never curl my hair because it seemed to never stick without a ton of hairspray and it took me forever. With this wand it takes me about ten minutes and the curls seem to last really good for several hours. I can often wake up the next day and still have the curls.</li>
            <li> I have a head full of very thick, curl resistant, Asian hair.  Up until now it would take me at least an hour and a half to curl all of my hair with a curling iron.  (I always have at least shoulder length hair, or longer)  And after all of that work the curls wouldn&#x27;t even last the next few hours. :(  This product was my first ever curling wand, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get one.  I can get a loose wavy style done in under 7 minutes and I can get nice curls all over in under 20! I am so excited! The curls stay in until I shower, even after sleeping on them.  Learning how to use the wand vs. an iron isn&#x27;t really a big deal.  Even being inexperienced I am getting great results, and it gets easier every time I use it.  I saw other people mention they don&#x27;t use the glove, but I do.  I definitely recommend it for newbies like me, maybe with more experience I won&#x27;t need it, but for now I&#x27;m grateful it came with the curling wand.  This is an awesome product at a great price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love the curls and volume it gives my hair.  The curls stay throughout the day in to the next day.  Perfect buy. Perfect price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my fiance. She was confused at first no how to use this, but after watching a brief YouTube video, she understands better and has been using this. She really likes this for curling, and I can say her hair looks fantastic when she uses it. Great product, heats up super quick, and holds curls great. Must have for ladies</li>
            <li> After asking my cousin what she does to her hair that it looks perfect everyday, she pointed me towards these wands. For the price, I had to give it a try. It&#x27;s fantastic! Gets really hot, once you get into a groove its fast (way faster than straightening actually) and then my hair looks amazing for the rest of the day. An easy, quick and total confidence booster for under $25? No brainer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling wand I have never left any reviews before but i have to because i love it. I have very fine hair and have tried other curling iron, I had to use a lot of hair spray to do my curls and would fall flat very quickly. I must say this curling want is amazing i don&#x27;t even have to use any hair spray to do my curls anymore and it would stay for hours. And its very easy to use, take very less time to heat up the want.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was way to big and did not curl right because how big it was</li>
            <li> This 1-1 1/2 is just the perfect size. Love it. It&#x27;s the best selling curling iron here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> i have a very hard time with styling my hair, it is very thick and coarse.  this beauty helps me move quickly and gives great curl/wave!  i don&#x27;t use the glove because I find that it hinders my process, but I will say that you do need to be careful!  very easy to nick your ear/finger etc.  I went with this size barrel since I have longer hair and didn&#x27;t want tightly coiled curls, wanted more of the Kardashian/beachy wavy thing- does the trick!</li>
            <li> The wand heats up very quickly and is easy to use. A glove is included. I purchased this wand because a lot of the reviews said the curls last for days. Mine did not. Despite using hair product and setting the wand to 410, the initial result was soft curls, and in some sections just waves- they looked great, but not exactly what I had in mind. My hair is long, thick, and wavy/curly, and I wanted something to reduce frizz and define the curls. It definitely reduced the frizz. The soft curls and waves that I did get fell within a few hours and were all but gone in the morning. I am returning it for a wand with a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the reviews said this was a great product for the price. Yes, it heats up well. Yes, it curls ok. The controls are simple and easy to use. But Every time my hair slips too close to the base of the wand, my hair gets caught and the only way to get it out most of the time is to rip my hair out. Only a couple hairs at a time, but still, I shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with this. I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of the tapered wands anyways but thought I&#x27;d give it a go. The material of the handle is OK and I wouldn&#x27;t say the barrel is the best material either.  I&#x27;ve used better before and I think for my next wand I&#x27;m going to invest in a better curling wand and not get something just because it is cheap.</li>
            <li> As I am living in Latvia in Europe, I wasn&#x27;t informed at the purchase moment that there is different contact for electricity an only 120 V.</li>
            <li> amazing I love the curls it make I have all sizes of these and love them all please buy you will love it</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron on my hair daily.  I found this difficult to use and burned my hand.  It may work for others, but this product was not for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  First time I used it I only burnt both ears once and my finger tips once.  Second time I used it I only burnt my finger tips.  Have yet to get a time when I don&#x27;t burn myself but I guess that comes with experience and not been using this that long.  Plus I don&#x27;t use it every day.  It does get hot and it does burn so be careful.  I like the fact I can have nice loose curls and they last all day.  Great investment!</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much based on the reviewers rating.  This didn&#x27;t curl my hair so well. I get better results curling with my GHD flat iron.</li>
            <li> I burned the crap out of myself, but that&#x27;s my own fault. Great product!</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used to make curls. I have tried it all.. rollers, flat iron, curling iron.. and this is the best! Cute color too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the curling iron is great for someone who has the manual dexterity to use a glove on one hand and the iron in the other, but I really hate it.  The product works perfectly, but it&#x27;s not for me!</li>
            <li> i saw this product in stores awhile ago and didn&#x27;t purchase it because i used a remington product and hated it. then i tried my housemate&#x27;s curling wand and FELL IN LOVE. its amazing. i was so sad that it is discontinued because i searched everywhere for it. For $20, its amazing. its better than my $50 nume hair wand. it has different heat settings and the wand its so easy to use, with a little bit of practice at first. if you want non spiral curls, that are taylor swift-esque, then this is perfect. you can create so many different styles: causal (every day), work, formal. whichever. i love it.</li>
            <li> Very cool but in the first couple of times was difficult to use it. The glove helps to protect my finger from the heat. When I feel the heat over the glove I know that my hear is ready</li>
            <li> I already owned the narrower version, but wanted larger more wavy curls.  I chose right when I selected this product!  It heats up to high 400 degree temps just like the other but creates larger curls.  I am super happy with this!</li>
            <li> Creates gorgeous full curles that bounce and last, looks very natural and glamorous.. Great tool easy to use it&#x27;s light weight so it keeps your arm from getting to tired</li>
            <li> I truly love using this wand. I have tried using all kinds of curling irons and they never work. This one is the best!</li>
            <li> This tool is great for organizing curly hair. When I use it on somebody else its easy to use, but I haven´t figured out how to use it on my hair with good results.</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this curling wand works miracles! I was scared to order it but it was worth every cent! Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> It is very good, works well! It works for 110 voltage, but in my home country voltage is 220. I have to use the Voltage Converter for this.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that can&#x27;t hold a curl. I&#x27;ve had two wands by Remington and I LOVE THEM!!!! Not only does my hair hold a curl but the next day its still looking amazing.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is easy to use and gives me the results I am looking for! I have never been able to correctly work a traditional curling iron. I would always wind up with a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; where the clamp closed. But, with a little practice, this one is perfect!! Just make sure you use the glove!!</li>
            <li> For it to be most effective, you have to do your hair first then touch up with this potentially scalding device.  But when it is deployed post-blow out, it does create lovely beachy waves.</li>
            <li> Got one in the mail, after a few weeks the curler part was detaching from the handle. Emailed the company and they sent me a new one no problem and it works great!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this curler. Since she bought her own, she has since bought them as presents for several of her friends and family members. She has given up on her old curling irons completely and loves how the curls stay in longer than her traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> Best Wand Ever !!!! -- perfect size and perfect curl, if your looking for volume this is what you need to buy. The temperature gets hot so be careful but overall one of the best ones out there and you really cant go wrong with the price. Use your glove until you get used to it and curl away for any occasion. Curl stays for at least a day sometimes 2-3 if you&#x27;re not a crazy sleeper. it was raining at a wedding and I did my own hair. My curls were the only ones that didn&#x27;t need any touch ups. SUPER HAPPY about that.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Even though I don&#x27;t know well how to do it , I keep trying on my hair and every time I do , it looks better :)it is just about you get the right way to do .</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old curling iron because it broke. I was iffy about buying this but it curls my hair so much more faster due to the fact that I have super long hair. But I am in love with this. Just like the box says it is more of a salon iron curler but it is perfect in home use.</li>
            <li> So happy with this curler....it works on my stick straight, impossible to curl, long hair.  Definitely the easiest curler I&#x27;ve ever worked with, and gives the prettiest results.  It really does get super hot, so use caution and give your hair a break in between uses!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, but not unmanageable, and this curling iron did absolutely nothing, not a curl, not a wave, NADA! So, once more I decided to show the tool some mercy, and try it out on my other two sisters&#x27; medium and ultra fine hair...SAME RESULTS. It was extremely disappointing, and a huge waste of money. I would say that maybe the one we purchased did not heat properly, but we put it on the highest setting and IT WAS EXTREMELY HOT!. We even went to the extreme of holding the hair in the barrel for over a minute! I couldn&#x27;t believe that the reviews on this were so positive (which is the reason I purchased it in the first place). So, I thought some of you may benefit from hearing that this was NOT all it was praised to be! How can I return it?</li>
            <li> If this wand had a clip to hold the hair in place while you are curling, it would be great.  However, it is impossible to curl your hair with this wand, as the hair slips right off.  It gets very hot, so wearing the protective glove is quite useless.  Would return it if I could, bit it is sold through a third part seller, so I am stuck with a dud.  Do not purchase this highly awkward item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how perfect this wand is.  I bought it because of the other reviews and it did not disappoint.  It heats up VERY quickly.  It makes perfect waves quickly and they last for days (at least 2, I wash every other day).  It arrived in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to do my &amp;#34;Real Housewives&amp;#34; waves with a flat iron but my hair got too long and it&#x27;s getting more difficult to do so I thought I&#x27;d try a wand.  I did my research and this one had the best reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a go.  Great price, great item!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did that was an oversight was buy the 1/2-1 inch at first so I ended up having to buy this one after.  I&#x27;m okay with having both because I have two daughters and they love the little curls but the 1/2 inch is too small for what I wanted.  I would just say make sure you select the right size.  The 1-1/2 gives you the big waves you see on all of the celebrities.</li>
            <li> I am not a hair stylist, nor do I consider myself someone &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; at hair. This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve purchased and/or handled a curling wand (vs. curling iron) and this picture was taken immediately after my first attempt at using this product. I think my hair in this pic is by no means perfect but it&#x27;s clear that this wand does what it&#x27;s supposed to! Yes, it took a second for me to understand how to use it, but to all the one-star reviews I&#x27;ve read - don&#x27;t blame the product, blame the user. After watching a couple tutorials I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll prefect the technique but I am already in love with it! Great product, great price, fast delivery :)</li>
            <li> This curling iron works wonderfully. It&#x27;s best for longer hair, though. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the wand style and I&#x27;ve only burned myself two or three times, which is more than with a regular curling iron, but worth it for the smooth curls.</li>
            <li> The technique takes some getting used to, but it curls so well!  Natural, long-lasting, shiny curls.  Great price.  No brainer.</li>
            <li> This works great for curling hair. At first I used the mitten that comes with it while getting used to handling it, but now I find I don&#x27;t need it anymore. I only give this four stars because at this point the product has become redundant in my bathroom. I have a BabyLiss flat iron with rounded edges that also curls hair just as well and with limited space in my bathroom, the fewer products needed, the better. I thought a tapered barrel would be more important than it actually turned out to be - I find the flat iron produces the exact same look.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful styling wand! I have very thick, very long hair and the outcome was gorgeous. The curls held extremely well, I even brushed it out after curling just to see how well they would hold, and I still have full head of curls and beautiful waves. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are new to styling wands: USE THE GLOVE. I cannot stress this enough. It takes a little time (and patience) to get the hang of using this tool, but after a few attempts you&#x27;ll be styling like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;The glove is not completely heat proof, but then again it was never meant to hold directly on the wand. It&#x27;s simply there to protect your fingers as you work towards the ends. I have a lot (LOT) of hair and did not burn myself once. Just take your time with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the buttons, I had no issues with pressing them by mistake as I was styling. There is a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; feature that allows you to keep the temperature you set it at, just incase you do press one by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I am very pleased with this product. Depending on how much hair you section off, you can do really loose curls, or tight spiral curls. The trick is to hold the curl in place for just a few seconds once it slides off the wand. If you let it drop before it cools, the curl may not hold.</li>
            <li> What i like most about this is that there isn&#x27;t that annoying metal stand that keeps your countertops from melting.  Instead, there is a plastic stand that you don&#x27;t have to worry about moving back and forth and it does not get into your way.  There is a lock button on the wand that prevents you from changing the setting....you just have to press down on the - or + button in order to lock it.  You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s locked when you see the lock on the screen.  Overall---I like this.  Of course, you&#x27;ll need to use styling products such as hair spray in order to keep the curls going.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, my old curling iron was very old and hardly working anymore. I&#x27;ve seen videos explaining how to use the wand and figured I get it. I&#x27;ve curled my hair before, I could figure this thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, not a chance. Either my hair is too fine and just can&#x27;t stay on the barrel or I&#x27;m holding it wrong or something... but my hair REFUSES to stay on the barrel unless I&#x27;m holding it to the barrel with my (gloved) hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait! I CAN&#x27;T. This glove is useless and not heat resistant AT ALL. After trying to hold my hair onto the barrel several times while having very hot fingers I realized the glove was being MELTED. What?! Don&#x27;t claim to ship a heat resistant glove when it is so thin it&#x27;s very easy to burn your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was able to wrap around the barrel did curl but it was so wonky with me trying to keep it on the barrel that it looked terrible. And since I wasting able to hold the ends down the barrel they looked horrible. I feel crushed, I wanted this to work so well and it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
            <li> The curling wand is a must have!  It&#x27;s takes a minute to get the hang of it, but it produces quick curls that look amazing.  Make sure you get the glove included!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time! The best part is that I curl my hair one day- and it last for AT LEAST two days. Its my necessity!</li>
            <li> AN EXCELLENT SALON COLLECTION ,PERFECT AND EASY TO USE AT HOME , WHICH SAVE YOU MONEY NOT GOING TO A SPECIALIST TO DO YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> Wish I could just skip the star rating on this one because I feel like it gets a 1 star in terms of how effective I am at using it, but would probably get 4-5 stars if I were more talented.  I have long, fine hair (between shoulder blades and waist length) that has a very slight wave.  Usually my hair is very good at taking a curl, and this did a good job of putting in a curl, but heck if I could actually negotiate how to do it so that I had similar curls on each side of my head.  I know they say it takes practice, but after a couple of weeks I decided to put it away for a while and just go with my regular curling iron and wait until I somehow grow a third arm to make this work.</li>
            <li> I like the wand, its look and feel but even when using gel and hairspray and other products, does not hold curl well.... only for about 1.5 hours</li>
            <li> I,ve tried every curling wand known to man.. Including a curling iron without using the clamp but nothing compares to thIs one! Been using it for a couple months now, even took it traveling with me and its still perfect. The controls are super easy and simple to understand and the curls are gorgeous. Definitely recommend !</li>
            <li> This wand works great but really takes a lot of practice to get the curls the way you want them.  Get&#x27;s very very hot, so you really have to be careful about burning yourself.  Nice long cord and built in stand.  Controls are in an awkward position though, I find I&#x27;m constantly hitting the buttons while using the wand and changing the temperature in the process.  I have pretty long curly hair to begin with and it always seems to get tangled around the end where the built in stand is.  Rounded edges might have been a better design idea or anything that would make a smooth transition instead of having something your hair can catch on.</li>
            <li> Love this curler others would no heat like it. I am now going to order others by Remington. Its a keeper</li>
            <li> I love my curling wand! It&#x27;s super easy to use!! I could never curl my hair before unless I had someone do it for me and it takes me like 15 minutes to do it with this. It&#x27;s great for the price! It comes with the glove, I used it once, but it&#x27;s just bulky and gets in my way.</li>
            <li> I need to put this on high to get it to curl my hair. It heats up pretty quickly and the glove works well, though I should probably buy a second glove, as I switch hands pretty often.&lt;br /&gt;There really needs to be a ridge at the base of the barrel to prevent your fingers from accidentally touching the iron. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to curl my hair for a LONG time. After researching all kinds of different hair curlers, I finally settled on this one. It arrived promptly yesterday, which was 2 days after I ordered it thanks to amazon prime; and I absolutely love it. I read through the instructions and it is so simple to use! I have medium length hair, and it is curly but the hair curler makes my hair have super nice waves you know like those beach waves that are super cute? Plus, the price is AMAZING.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use, cute and practical curler then you need to get this!!! Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> I tried but its uncomfortable to use. Maybe if I had longer hair it would have been better. I keep burning my fingers!</li>
            <li> I have hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, but when my sister used this on my hair, the curls stayed in beautifully for hours! I bought one for myself shortly after I saw how wonderful this curling wand was and it produced the same results. My hair was even wavy after I slept on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little tricky to use at first, I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I am really happy with this purchase! These 5-star reviews are nothing short of accurate.</li>
            <li> So normally I don&#x27;t believe all of the hype when it comes to beauty products, especially hair tools and products because it seems that so many just don&#x27;t work for me, but I wanted to try this as I was tired of those Shirley Temple like curls...I mean really, lol...&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that is a couple of inches past my shoulders, medium thickness and long layers.  I&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before and so this did take a little bit of practice but it wasn&#x27;t really that hard and (okay here is where I start sounding like an infomercial) I was amazed at how my hair looked!!!!  So pretty with loose, casual waves, very natural looking and just gorgeous!  And get this...the next morning I got up and got ready for work and didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it but run my fingers through the waves...went outside and it was foggy so my hair did relax a little but it still looked great!  So my old curling iron is now retired and this is what I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
            <li> Gives nice loose beachy waves. Heats up fast and could cause some serious burns so make sure to use the included glove. The ceramic coating is really nice as well. May take time for newbies to learn but my teen figured it put quick.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.  I have long hair, and using a curling iron with a clip is difficult.  I love the idea of a clipless curling wand.  It was easy to use - I have curled my hair probably 6 or 7 times with it and still not burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the heat setting is digital, so you know exactly what you&#x27;re setting it to.  I have seen some complaints about accidentally changing the heat setting.  If you hold down the minus (\\&quot;-\\&quot;) button, it will lock the heat setting.  I always do that to avoid changing the setting accidentally while I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that sometimes my hair doesn&#x27;t fit on it.  My long hair (combined with the tapered design) sometimes slips off the end.  That means that sometimes I have to move down the hair and curl again.  That is a little annoying.  I probably should have ordered the larger wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- nice surface, not sticking&lt;br /&gt;- digital heat control&lt;br /&gt;- lockable heat setting&lt;br /&gt;- long lasting curls&lt;br /&gt;- NO CLIP &#x3D; fewer tangles and breaks&lt;br /&gt;- you can select the right size wand for your hair/curl size preference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- can be very hot, be very careful!&lt;br /&gt;- may be too short/small for very long hair</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. While it does take some practice, it is still incredibly easy to use and the curls are beautiful. I ordered the 1-1 1/2 inch barrel because I wanted looser curls and this gave me the exact look I was going for. I also love the temperature range on it. I can curl my mom&#x27;s thicker, harder to curl hair at a high temp and curl my fine, damaged hair at a lower temp. The glove is also handy. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot. Got one that runs 20 degrees cooler and it seems to get hotter. Am returning.</li>
            <li> I chose this curling iron after returning a highly rated clamp-style product from Hot Tools I had seen featured in women&#x27;s magazines. For me, the clamp keep leaving indentations in my hair. I began researching for a wand (clamp-free) iron, and stumbled upon this Remington model that was highly rated by other Amazon reviewers. As suggested, I watched a few online tutorials to get the gist of wand curling techniques before my first use and I researched the temperature I should use. I concur with other reviewers that this is essential for new users to avoid frustration and unnecessary hair damage.  I found that the default setting (356 degrees) for 10-12 sec was sufficient to set a typical curl from an approx. 1 inch wide lock of hair. As has been noted, it takes a few uses to get used to the grip of the wand: you really want to keep it nearly inverted. And I always use the heat-protection glove (included) to minimize singeing of my finger tip. For this reason, I would not recommend this product for all users (for example, tweens or adults with severe arthritis who might experience discomfort after repeatedly pinching a small lock of hair under tension). In the end, the wand delivered on its promise of loose, natural looking curls without the clamp marks. With the exception of my standard heat protectant (I use Tresemme or Bumble &amp; Bumble), the curls held their shape for about 10 hours without any styling products. Not bad for 10-15 minutes of effort. By the end of the day, the curls were much looser, but still gave the hair some additional volume. I&#x27;d recommend this product to someone who&#x27;s willing to take the time to experiment with it perhaps 2-3 times before really relying on it for a quick morning routine or a big night out.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for ladies (or men...?) with longer hair who want loose waves. The big barrel is perfect. I wanted a really natural look rather than the tighter curls created by 1/2&amp;#34; and 1&amp;#34; barrels.&lt;br /&gt;This baby gets hot, hot, hot! I rarely use the highest setting. The lower temperatures are just right, though.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> This curls your hair very nicely,  and overall works really well. Yes like others have said, it is a bit more slippery than other wands but with practice you get used to it. The barrel is tapered, so you do need to hold it at certain angles to ensure it doesn&#x27;t slip off. I really like this wand because I can curl my hair and my curls will stay intact for 2 to 3 days without any hair spray or anything. If you want larger wavy hair I recommend getting this one, if you want tighter smaller ringlets get the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling wand before but it&#x27;s amazing. I am terrible and doing my own hair but this is very easy to use and gives me good curls. I have thick volume hair so I use the 410 max setting and have to hold it for 15-20 seconds for each curl. The 1.0-1.5 gives me the big wavy curls I want. The curls last 3 days for me. Haven&#x27;t burned myself yet. Oh and the gloves aren&#x27;t really heat gloves, they&#x27;re just black mittens. Cheap quality but it does protect your fingers.</li>
            <li> Watching someone using this kind if curling iron on TV or YouTube, it seems easy, but, when you attempt doing it for the first time, it&#x27;s so difficult, that i decided to return it, because i had an event coming up and didn&#x27;t have time to figure this thing out on my extremely fine hair!</li>
            <li> I still have to figure out the best way to curl it, I&#x27;ve burnt myself manny times. But it&#x27;s definitely worth it. My hair NEVER holds a curl, bc its soo thick and long. But this works great! It makes curls that last a long time, and when they do &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34;, it looks like a beachy type of curl! Makes my hair look so luxurious. I&#x27;m IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> Awesome and affordable!</li>
            <li> Creates beautiful waves, easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too difficult to use.  There&#x27;s nothing to hold the hair onto the wand.  They give you a glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hand.  I don&#x27;t like this design at all.  Had I realized that it was designed this way I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected.</li>
            <li> I recieve 4 used white box REMINGTON CI9538 in stead of  4 new items,items shipped to Guatemala , this is very bad deel</li>
            <li> This is the best fourteen dollars I have ever spent. My hair isn&#x27;t easy to curl but this works great.</li>
            <li> I love this wand so much! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments when I do my hair for work everyday. I don&#x27;t put any hair spray on and the curls last up till the night time</li>
            <li> Works beautifully! This is the only curling wand that will keep curls in my hair all day! Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This curling wand is an amazing tool at an even more amazing price! I originally purchased the over $120 Sarah Potempa Beachwaver wand and was very disappointed with the results. However, this 1 - 1 1/2-inch curling wand by Remington for less than $20 gave me outstanding results. I finally got the soft, beach waves in my hair that I was looking for. If you want tigher curls, just keep your hair curled around the wand a bit longer; if you want your curls softer and loose, just a few seconds are needed. Sometimes we tend to wrongly think that a more expensive tool will get us better resuts. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great! Heats up fast, emits heat evenly. I have long thick hair that generally doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, but with this iron I get perfectly wavy/curly hair, and it stays that way all day. Haven&#x27;t noticed any damage- my hair is shiny and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;You get to set the temperature to suit your needs- click + &amp; - to see what the temperature is exactly.&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is fantastic, especially give the price. Much better than many brand names. My friend got herself one too after she tried mine, and she is very particular about hair products and devices- it&#x27;s that good. The only weird thing is how this curling iron looks- that weird pink color looks particularly funky and indecent if you get a larger barrel like I did.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I ordered these reviewing the overall reviews on you tube and these did not work to much for me. They seem to work better on extensions or very long hair.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this, I have gone back to using my regular curling iron.  This wand makes it impossible to keep your hair from just sliding off, and no matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried and different techniques I&#x27;ve used, my hair just never curls like advertised.  I wish I could say I loved it but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought both the 1/2in-1in and the 1in-1.5inch; both work great but I am absolutely in love with the larger version. Gives beautiful, wavy curls and is easy to use.  Curls last a while even without hairspray!</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast,  curls my frizzy dry hair into shiny slick bouncy curl that last even in south florida.  Awesome</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product usually Remington has good products this did not work at all did not make a curl in my hair the glove was ripped I didn&#x27;t have a receipt for this item,its not even worth sending back to me because I don&#x27;t have a receipt I will not order any electronics in the mail through Amazon again</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!! Beautiful beachy curls! I ordered the 1-1 1/2 inch and I have long hair!</li>
            <li> GAME CHANGER!!! LIFE CHANGER!!!! Thank you SOOOOOOOOOO much Remington for creating this amazing tool that has literally replaced EVERY hair tool i have ever owned including my $100 baby bliss curling iron and $200 or so MagiCurl wand (tangles your hair, waste of money....). My hair has never ever held a curl until the remington wand. Even hairstylists couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make my curls stay longer than 30 minutes. With this wand my curls last ALL DAY and I wake up with 70% of the curls the next day. I LOVE YOU REMINGTON WAND! If you ever need a passionate Account Executive to sell your product let me know ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I haven&#x27;t had one bad hair day. In fact, I&#x27;ve had only fabulous hair days! It took one day to learn how to use it. My curls are gorgeous, they cascade down, are full and bouncy, truly last all day. With my old curling iron (it was a good brand, just worn out), my curls got drabby as soon as I left the bathroom. With this curling iron, not only do they last all day, but all night, because when I wake up in the morning, they still are distinct and full. Crazy! I can now go another day without washing my hair, never done that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like it says, it really does create fullness at the crown. The only tricky thing is, for those w/naturally curly hair like me who want a polished look - I dry all my hair first w/hair dryer then go through w/a curling iron for smooth curls, I found it hard to curl the hair framing my face, so make sure that&#x27;s straightened first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this curling wand is great for girls w/long hair! I have lots of hair, long to mid-back and this doesn&#x27;t take anymore time then any other curling iron, 10 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair stylists have been using this idea for many years now, they&#x27;d use ordinary curling irons to wrap hair around, without the clamps. They use this technique for special occasion hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this very much!</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first curling iron/wand ever (besides using a Conair curl &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; which works great but is more for giving a little wave), and I love it! My hair is very straight and has always been hard to curl, but I have been able to make really nice loose curls with this wand and just a little hairspray. It was very easy to learn how to use just by watching a quick YouTube video. The iron heats up quickly and the temperature can be adjusted but do be careful if not wearing a glove - it gets hot!! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but hoping it lasts a while (but for the price, I&#x27;m already glad I got it).</li>
            <li> This is a great iron at a reasonable price. I have shoulder-length hair and use the larger 1-1 1/2 inch version for looser waves. It heats up in 30 seconds as advertised. I have fine hair and am able to get the results I want on a lower heat setting than the max. I had never used a curling wand before, but had no problems after watching a couple of You Tube demos online. I haven&#x27;t found the glove to be necessary. No complaints after a few weeks using.</li>
            <li> I Love this it heats up very quickly I&#x27;m just learning how to use it so I&#x27;m not a pro yet lol but it curls good I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> For the price this is a pretty good wand. I like the conical shape and the color. The change in temperatures is also nice - I like being able to set it very low for my fine hair. I think this would work best on long hair though. It makes large curls and as they fall, they are more just a wave on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled by the numerous positive reviews for this product, which I threw away.  It doesn&#x27;t have a built-in clip, so it is difficult to make your hair stay in place while you&#x27;re trying to curl it.  I didn&#x27;t want to work on trying to improve my motor skills with a burning hot object close to my hands and face.  The glove didn&#x27;t help and does not seem like a practical solution when styling your hair.</li>
            <li> My sister and I absolutely love this Curling Wand. Curls our hair instantly every time and without burning ourselves. Way easier than an iron and can get both of our long hair done within a half hour.</li>
            <li> I own a smaller wand, but this really gives you a nice beach/loose curls that stay on for days! I received endless comments using this wand. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR CURLER! EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;t wait to try as soon as i got this product. I had so much expectation. However, I immediately found it extremely hard to use! You simply can&#x27;t put your hair around the wand since it&#x27;s so smooth and there&#x27;s no way to hold your hair end and curl it up. I had to hold the wand and curl my hair around it from top down. This gave me serious problem: i couldn&#x27;t hold the wand up because i had to use the other hand to do the curling, therefore the wand often got too closer to my chin. I noticed the problem and was especially careful. However, just as i unconsciously moved my head, viola! It gave my neck a kiss so violently that I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;m gonna carry the scar for a life time!!!! Seriously!! You wanna get a life time proof of using it? Do not hesitate!! Buy this product!! Right away!!!!</li>
            <li> These Remington pink pearl hair wands &amp; straighteners are fantastic! They heat up quickly,  don&#x27;t damage my delicate hair, the style (curly or straight) lasts at least 2 days, they leave my hair so silky &amp; smooth and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve used similar products costing over $200 each and they just sit in the drawer because I only use my Remington wands &amp; straightener. I bought the small 1 inch curling wand first &amp; loved it so much I bought the larger wand and the large straightener. These are the only heat tools I need and use.</li>
            <li> We own several of the Remington Pearl items and was looking for one with a larger barrel.  It was a no brainer to add this one to our collection!</li>
            <li> Oh this thing, bless it&#x27;s heart. It tries so hard, yet does absolutely nothing. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my hair- I have fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl very easily- but this curling iron creates a loose, barely-discernible wave that promptly falls out in a matter of an hour or two. My mum tried it when she came to visit and just started laughing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent wand does the job wonderful product! Curls beautifully nice beach wave curls, I bought this wand and a higher end wand by NUME and I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li> Best curling wand I have found! I even came back and bought a different size. Bonus: it&#x27;s pink! I will purchase more from this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty handy with bobby pins, but I have never been able to master the traditional curling iron that comes with a clip.  The introduction of clipless irons a few years back was welcome news.  I have two Jose Eber clipless irons that I bought a few years ago, and I really think that this Remington option is superior to the ones I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel of the Remington is wider toward the base and thinner at the top allowing the user to create curls of different types, which was different from the two Jose Eber irons that I have that are all one width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that compared to the Jose Eber irons, this one also produced better, longer-lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable heat setting is awesome.  The heat glove works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great, especially for the price! I&#x27;ve literally had at least 15 of my friends purchase it after me, because they love my curls!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim - I can never get curls to stay in my hair using a curling iron or flat iron method. The very first time I used it, I got big, bouncy curls that STAYED - and with a little bit of hairspray, they stayed for a LONG time! This tool is easy to use and works perfectly. I would definitely recommend it! Amazing product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The description says that it works with short hair.  I&#x27;m not sure how that is possible because you can&#x27;t wrap short hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this curling wand after my boyfriend&#x27;s sisters and cousins told me how great it was and curled my hair with it. My hair is naturally thick, fine, and stick straight not keep curls easily but when my boyfriend&#x27;s sister curled my hair with hers (and a little hairspray) and the curls held pretty well. I was so excited when I received my own curling wand, but I found it very hard to use on myself. I ended up burning the tips of both of my ears and my hair kept sliding off of the wand as I was trying to curl it. I used it on my sister&#x27;s course, wavy hair and it worked very well. So, in short, this curling wand is great, but it takes a lot of practice to learn how to use it on yourself and works a lot better if you have someone else curl your hair with it.</li>
            <li> I bit awkward to use but I think that is because I don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly. It gets extremely hot, I think you need a heat protector glove for each hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the job when I use it correctly. Overall happy with the tool, but I need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> after doing so many research on curling wand, i decided to get this one. I have never used a iron wand before so I figure I will buy something not too expensive. Overall the wand works great. It&#x27;s very hot and curls my hair fast. The only down side of this wand is that my hair tends to slide down to the small end of the wand and the curls are too tight.</li>
            <li> I got the larger size because I was afraid of ending up with too-small curls.  If I use the very end of the wand then it is just about right for my medium-length hair.  Otherwise I barely get a couple of turns around it and not much curl.  It works perfectly.  If I get a coupon from Ulta then I will buy a smaller size of this same brand.</li>
            <li> Love this curler really amazing , curls stay in your hair for so long (: Definitely purchase this item x</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all. Hair slides down the barrel and the curl doesn&#x27;t stay. Very disappointed. Should have maybe gotten smaller barrel?! I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works very well, fast and gives pretty curls.</li>
            <li> this is a greats wand you should get one&lt;br /&gt;love it and they ship it super fast&lt;br /&gt;and its easy to use</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using traditional curling irons after using curling wands. They make perfect curls that stay all day and do not have a kink in them. There&#x27;s a sharp learning curve regarding how to wrap your hair around it without burning yourself, and how to old it, but once you get it down, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The heated tongs pretty bad siempre.Lo must use the glove is that it is difficult to use and buy it with much illusion but actually does curl as the pictures you had averiguado.La really think it is because one must know how to use either use some product to make waves prior to last you longer</li>
            <li> This curling wand is really easy to use and creates nice, big curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. It works ok but the barrel is too big to curl my chin length hair. I ended up ordering a Numi curling wand. It&#x27;s a little more expensive but it came with 3 interchangeable barrels and it&#x27;s made of titanium. If you check out YouTube beauty gurus like AprilAthena7, Jaclyn Hill or Casey Holms they have coupon codes that give amazing discount&#x27;s on all Numi products!</li>
            <li> I love this wand, it is great that it comes with a glove, however I don&#x27;t use the glove.&lt;br /&gt;The only things that I do not like about this wand are that where the buttons are I tend to press them with my thumb when I am curling. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even realize they were pressed, and then I will continue curling only to find it not working- then I have to turn it back on and let it reheat again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that I think it has an automatic shut-off. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about one from what I read, but after about 30-40 minutes it will shut off. I tend to heat the wand, put on some makeup, curl some hair, put on more makeup, curl some more, get dresses, curl some more, etc. so I need my curling wand to be on for at least an hour at a time without shutting off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this wand does work, and it is a good price, so despite these minor, inconvenient things I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! Works great!</li>
            <li> it heats very fast, i love it came with the glove so you dont burn your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gives my hair beautiful tamed waves!</li>
            <li> It works SO well. Heats up quickly &amp; the curls lasted all night. It&#x27;s going to take some getting used to, as my hair wants to slide down to the slimmer end. BUT that&#x27;s my learning curve, has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> This creates great natural curls that really last!  It heats up really fast and wasn&#x27;t too hard to get the hang of ( without the glove).  I have long hair (mid back length) and the bigger barrel seemed to work fine.  I just use the tip of the wand if I want tighter curls.</li>
            <li> I have picky hair that can sometimes be a pain to curl, but remington curling irons work surprising well for my hair! They get iti to curl and stay all day. Plus, the wands are great, I love how the curls turn out. I have this kind in many sizes. Love and would recommend to anyone! Not to mention, the price is right! I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on other styling products (such as my flatiron) but this works just as well for me!</li>
            <li> I am not savvy with hair tools but I have tried the ceramic rollers from this specific Remington Pearl line so I gave another one of their products a try. It&#x27;s definitely really girly as it has a pearly pink ceramic wand. It&#x27;s easy to use and the control buttons are clear. Look wise, I really like this product. Its simple and dainty/girly. As far as use, I think I still prefer a curling iron over a wand as this can be hard to hold while making sure you aren&#x27;t burning your other hand that&#x27;s holding onto your hair tip.</li>
            <li> I am pretty annoyed that I got a used one, it was send in bubblewrap, so no original packaging and I was not inform that this product was second hand- it had scratches in the black plastic parts. Therefore I wanted to take 2 stars of the review, however this would then be a review of the seller and not the product. So the product gets 5 stars. It works well and fast and makes beautiful curls. I love the thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the shape of small to larger on the curl.  Product is really hard to use without have a clamp on the iron.</li>
            <li> Well, I should have seen that there would be a problem keeping hair on this. I have very thick hair and it won&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is easy to use..  it heats up so fast.. it comes with different levels of heat.. you can adjust the heat by the little screen on the wand.. the result stays for the next day.. i have to say that the glove it comes with is not affective.. it doesn&#x27;t protect your hand from the heat</li>
            <li> My hair never held a curl until this purchase. Very happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size iron for medium length hair. It gives the beach wave look and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great value curling wand. Works great. The only slight downside for me is the design of the handle - I often hit the temp control buttons while I&#x27;m styling. Other than that small inconvenience, it heats up fast. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I read tons of reviews and watched many video tutorials online.  I&#x27;m a pretty dextrous person so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t take much for me to get the hang of using it.  My hair length at the time was about under arm length, so long enough to have a good curl, but not too long that my arm length would &amp;#34;run out&amp;#34;.  Well after trying this several times, I gave up.  First of all, although the unit has little &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; in the center of the unit but the hot end is heavier so that it tilts onto the hot side, even with the cord hanging onto the floor!  And the gloves are pretty useless as I can feel the heat coming through enough that my fingers felt overly hot.  The barrel is very slippery making it difficult to keep my slick Asian hair on the unit.  It&#x27;s EASY to get burned with this unit even when I&#x27;m careful.  I never got my hair with a beachy wave, mine just got curls which I didn&#x27;t want to had that  Shirley Temple look.  It requires too much time and too much work for this gal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users state that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not the curler, it&#x27;s the user&amp;#34;.  But for this lady, there&#x27;s definitely EASIER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 2016:  This cannot compare to the KISS Insta Wave which has pretty much has no learning curve and got perfect waves in about seven minutes.</li>
            <li> Holy freaking grail this things is amazing for 20 bucks definitely a good buy I got the 1 1/2-2 inch barrel and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The order was processed and delivered within five days.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, hair that can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it wants to be wavy or curly. This curling wand has been amazing. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. I use it to curl some of my top layer to help control frizz and make it seem less like I just rolled out of bed. I leave the bottom layers alone and usually just use some curl activator or mousse depending on what I have on hand and how much time I have to get ready. It did take some getting used to in order to get the exact look I wanted (loose waves as opposed to ringlets because since it tapers my hair would go down to the thin end and my curls would be too tight for my taste). But now it can take me 5-10 minutes to look put together as opposed to the hour long ordeal of straightening my hair.  Best of all, I no longer lose hair due to pulling it out because it got stuck on the screw hinge section of the clamp to my old curling iron (I used to wrap it around the outside of the barrel and clamp to get loose waves, trust me....a wand definitely is better than using that approach).</li>
            <li> Although it gets super hot which burned my skin to the touch if your careful it is amazing do not recommend for younger ages</li>
            <li> Very happy with the stylish, natural-looking curls I was able to achieve with this device. I feel like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model when I use it. If you&#x27;re not sure how to use this kind of curling iron, just watch some YouTube tutorials - there are tons of good ones out there. Do be careful not to burn yourself if it&#x27;s your first time using one, though - especially tips of the fingers and back of the neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using the traditional curling iron with the clip, so at first I was hesitate at trying this. I am glad I bought this wand! It does takes some time to get use to getting your hair onto the iron, but looking at few youtube tutorial it was easy to use. I have to say the result if you like to have a soft wavy curl for everyday look then get this, but if you are looking for pageant hair style then this is not the one to get. I am Asia with thick hair and usually when I use the traditional curler I always need some kinda or product to keep it curl all day. Not this wand! My soft wavy curl can last me the whole day without adding extra hairspray. I would recommend this wand to any of my friend and the price is great with awesome result. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clumsy with this because there&#x27;s no handle to grip with my thumb while spinning the curling iron LOL But it makes a great curl once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> I have long needed a clipless curling iron, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought one! This one is good but not great -- my problem is that it tapers into a smaller size at the top which kind of messes up the shape of the curls it creates. That said, everything else about it works! and so does the price!</li>
            <li> This works great.  It really takes some getting used to, you can&#x27;t pick it up and think it&#x27;s going to be easy.  Now that I am used it it I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this - she got it for her 15th b-day. She uses it at least 3-4 times a week. She uses a Remington straightener the rest of the time. She loves them both. She watched a few videos on how to use this prior to getting it. Some complain, but they just don&#x27;t know how to use it. It works well.</li>
            <li> I Love ittttttttttttttttttttttt, but I want to buy more than 3 I want buy 10 there is no choices</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product in Ireland  as it had an American plug and voltage.I tried several places to get a power/voltage converter but was told they were taken off the market as they were unsafe!&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it should be mentioned in description that this product will only work in America!</li>
            <li> It is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve tried, is big enought to make loose curls, besides it gets hot enough to make them very well defined, i would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only used once, but  really liked the results.  I have thick, coarse, wavy, layered hair that goes down just below the middle of my back.  I bought the 1-1 1/2 &amp;#34; size and that was the right size for my length hair.  The wave lasted 3-4 days, until I washed it.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s full potential as I have not used it much, but I look forward to it. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it! I have a lot of really thick hair and this product makes my life easier! It&#x27;s way faster than straightening and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Works great; heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> Omg! Excellent curler for the price I decide to give it a try was a bit worried about other people saying gets too hot but not the case works very nicely! !</li>
            <li> Unable to curl my hair with it and it s really difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I  wasn&#x27;t impressed with this wand. It didn&#x27;t make beautiful curls or maybe its just that i dont know how to use it right( never used a wand before).</li>
            <li> The reason why I ever bought this specific one in the first place is because of all the good things I heard about it on a list of good curling irons; I do not understand how this could even be considered for that list. First off, the wand is slippery and your hair will not stay on it even long enough to be wound up. Second, you&#x27;d think if it&#x27;s so slippery that they would have a clip to fasten your hair to it but they don&#x27;t. Third, for me personally with naturally super straight hair the highest heating setting on this is not high enough to create a curl in my hair just an awkward wave. Also with this I can smell my hair burning so I stopped using this for that reason and the others listed. Trust me you do not want to buy this, it will just add to your collection of crappy styling tools.</li>
            <li> This wand is great! I have always had an issue with my hair holding a curl, so I wanted to try out using a wand vs a curling iron. My curl held for two days before I had to wash my hair! I typically can get away with not washing my hair for about 3-4 days, so I used the wand on day 2 when my hair was dirty enough to hold the curl. I was shocked at how well it did. The wand definitely gets very hot. The glove they supply with it isn&#x27;t anything to great, and it makes it harder to grip your strips of hair, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t help you out. However, once you get the hang of using the wand, you don&#x27;t really need it to fend off the &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; moments of touching the wand! I would definitely but this product again!</li>
            <li> Great curling wand that comes with a glove for those of us who are using a wand for the first time and getting used to the new technique! It did take several attempts at styling before I became comfortable with the wand, but it heats up fast and the handle is comfortable to hold! The cord also does not seem to continuously get tangled like other hair styling appliances I have!</li>
            <li> The curls come out okay. But the black part of the handle heats up between the buttons and the pink part. And, when I say heats up - I mean that it becomes burning hot. That doesn&#x27;t seem right. Also, the glove has no special properties, so it does absolutely nothing to prevent being burn. It&#x27;s a cheap glove you would buy for your kid at a flea market.</li>
            <li> The product is good but a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I did not realize it did not have a clip or clasp so basically you have to use a glove which is provided with it to roll your hair and hold it until it&#x27;s done.  I am too lazy and old school to do it this way, sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wond. Heats up fast and makes nice beach curls.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! Easy to use, perfect pretty curls</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts for my daughters - they both love the curling iron!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! Best value for a wand!! I have seen and used so many brands and for about under $25 you can not beat it.  I was kind of skeptical but after receiving my product and using it almost daily I am very satisfied.  I highly recommend this wand.  I usually have to use very little hairspray because the curl is so good on it.  I have thick hair and it hold very well.  Best wand for your money!</li>
            <li> Best curling wand EVER. Seriously! This thing creates the most beautiful and effortless curls and waves. Once you practice getting used to using the wand, it gets really easy. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful hair. :) I also recommend getting the 1-1 1/2 inch if you have longer hair and the 1/2-1 inch if you have shorter hair. After a year and a half, still works great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! I have had friends curl my hair with a wand and it always looks amazing! I finally bought one myself and love it! I have super long thick hair so that is why I went with the bigger size and it still makes nice loose curls. Heats up quick and is super easy to use. Curls do look better if you hold the want with the tip pointing down towards the floor FYI.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it.  She has long, thick waist length hair.  She has used several times and is always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my teen daughter so I don&#x27;t use it, but she uses it a lot. It&#x27;s easy to use and the glove comes in very handy, as I&#x27;ve seen other curlers like this that don&#x27;t come with a glove and can potentially burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift. The recipient loved it. I would give it 5 stars however, the product advertised a heat resistant styling glove that did not come In the box even though it should have been there. With the styling glove it would have been a perfect 5.</li>
            <li> If a stylist tends to say to you, &amp;#34;you have got a lot of hair!&amp;#34; then this product is probably not ideal for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item produces some nice soft curls. However, I have long and thick hair, so to do my whole head took a good hour to do! And with both hands held up, over, or around your head the entire time, it&#x27;s a very tiring experience. Tried to keep at it and endure, but each session was just more and more annoying. I ended up returning and getting a new clamp iron instead.</li>
            <li> I have long (to my belly button), thick, and wavy hair. I bought this wand because the traditional curling iron just doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair. This wand works great. I am absolutely in love with it. The only thing that annoys me is when I wrap a piece of hair around the barrel, it tries to slide to the very tip because of the conic shape. Other than that, it is amazing. I would recommend to someone who generally knows how to curl their hair because this wand would be too annoying for someone who is learning how to style their hair due to the problem previously stated. You need hair that is at least shoulder-length to be able to actually curl your hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast, and I love the waves I got. My roommate borrowed mine and liked it so much that she got her own. Definitely a good deal for the price!</li>
            <li> This curling iron isn&#x27;t terrible, it gets hot and curls like it is supposed to. The problem I had (I have slick straight hair) was that when I wrapped my hair around the barrel it would just slide to the skinnier end making things very difficult. I tried holding it upwards so the skinny end was at the top but then my hair just slid up to the top. I have very long hair and it was near impossible to get it all on the wand or get a pretty curl.  Many of the good reviews say not to listen to those negative reviews and that the negative people didn&#x27;t take the time to learn how to use the tool so I just felt the need to say that I currently own a wand and use it all the time with no trouble. I got this one to have bigger curls and my hair slips off because the barrel is too slippery. I&#x27;m not saying it is a terrible product! It does what it is supposed to do! BUT it is so hard to use if you have slippery hair. You know your hair best and your level of patience. Before buying this product decide how much effort you want to put into curling your hair every day 20 minutes or 45? You don&#x27;t need to worry about the quality of this product because it is good! Just beware of the difficulty in using it even for an experienced person.  Also the heat protectant glove is NOT heat resistant and if you read about the glove in the instructions it says that. It is just meant to be a barrier so you don&#x27;t burn your skin if you bump the curler.</li>
            <li> I use this tool for my hair ALL OF THE TIME. It&#x27;s been hard finding a perfect curling tool for my hair to achieve a great hairstyle. The curls come out nicely. It&#x27;s also great for people who don&#x27;t know how to curl their own hair because all you have to do is wrap around the wand and hold it for a few seconds! It heats up pretty quickly too. I&#x27;ve had this for a long time and I don&#x27;t have any problems at all.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand gives nice beach waves and big curls. Heats up fast and gets really hot. Beware may burn if not used correctly, did not like the glove it&#x27;s too thick, maybe mine came like that.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and traditional curling irons never worked for me. My curls would always fall. This wand works great! I create big waves with it in my hair and they last TWO days with a little hairspray. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works well on curling my hair, it gets very hot. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> i love the 1.5 inch part, makes big waves</li>
            <li> I want to love this wand, but I&#x27;m still not convinced it&#x27;s that great yet. I have medium length hair and I&#x27;ve tried a regular curling iron, a flat iron, and this wand for adding waves/curls to my hair. I&#x27;m searching for a routine that will be quick so I can do waves more often. I can&#x27;t make consistent waves with this, maybe it&#x27;s the different lengths of my hair (some layers) or maybe it&#x27;s the narrowing wand (sometimes my hair stays on the wider end, or falls to the narrow end). At this point, this takes me longer than the flat iron to create waves, but when I get a good wave, I love the shape of it! I wish I could do it more consistently throughout my whole head. It does get very hot very quickly, so that&#x27;s a plus. But I will have to keep working with it to find more consistency in waves and hopefully get faster with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have the smaller size also. This is the only curling device that works on my thin hair</li>
            <li> My only complain about these wands is that I find it very easy to burn your arms and fingers. I much rather prefer the traditional curling iron</li>
            <li> Takes practice to not get burned.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. Before using it I read and watched a few videos to learn or take some tips.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I use it was kind of difficult to get used to handle it without burning my fingers even though&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a glove I had a hard time because I do not manage to use all this tools at the same time ( comb, wand and glove).&lt;br /&gt;With time you get your own technic and its amazing how this curling wand works.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never mastered the curling iron, and for a serious plain Jane like me, I can actually use this thing and I love it! I thought I was missing the real feminine genes because I can&#x27;t apply makeup or do my own hair but this thing is so simple and awesome! My husband loves my curled hair too!</li>
            <li> This curling iron has done wonders for my hair, its made me rethink hair curlers. In the past I have had my hair curled by various higher end brands and the curl did not even last until they were done curling my entire head. With this iron, my curl lasts up to three days sometimes! Not even joking. I don&#x27;t understand what everybody is complaining about, though everyone has their own opinions. If you have hard to curl hair, and I mean HARD to curl hair, try this out. You will not regret it at all!</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to get used to but then it was easy.  Works great.  Glad they included the glove.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am normally curling iron challenged. So, one would think that I&#x27;d be even worse with something like this... but that&#x27;s not the case at all. I ordered this on a whim (actually got the smaller version first, but wasn&#x27;t a fan of the super curly prom queen look). There was a definite learning curve, but several YouTube videos got me through it and I have yet to burn myself. My curls come out smooth (a huge plus, as they would frizz horribly with traditional irons) and last all day, and through the next if I use enough hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this isn&#x27;t dual voltage and can&#x27;t be used overseas when I travel.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It heats up quickly and evenly, and it&#x27;s very smooth. As most of the reviews state, it takes a few tried before you get the hang of using a wand versus a spring curling iron. It just takes a little practice and patience, but once you get the hang of it, it gives great results!</li>
            <li> About me: Long hair down to my lower back, cut in layers. My hair is very fine and straight. It has been bleached and color treated which has made it a difficult to hold curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first curling wand and I really love it. I have always used the curling iron with the clip, but once you practice a few times with this one it really is easy and fast. I would recommend watching a few YouTube demos so you can really get an idea of how to use it and all the specifications before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand heats up fast and stays hot. (BE VERY CAREFUL! I burned myself twice) There are temperature up and down buttons so you can adjust it to your liking. But I find that the hotter it is, the more defined the curls, the faster it curls and the shinier my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;This wand does not dry out your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives you nice glossy bouncy curls without having to use a ton of products. With other curling methods I would have to use a lot of hairspray to keep my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 1” – 1 ½” wand. I would recommend this wand if you have longer hair and you want beachy curls/ waves or just to add some body to your hair. If you want tighter/ more defined curls I would recommend the smaller wand.&lt;br /&gt;There is a small stand at the bottom of the wand that allows it to sit on any surface without burning or sliding away. But the stand is small enough that it doesn’t get in your way like on some other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a rubber stopper at the end of the wand that prevents your hair from sliding off (this has been a problem with other wands that I’ve used) and it also gives me a place to rest my fingers while I’m holding the tip of my hair. But be careful because if the iron has been on for a while this part can get pretty hot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that (and I don’t know if this is a problem for everyone or just me) the on/off button only works to turn the device on and not off. To actually take itoff I have to unplug it. I don’t know, but for right now it isn’t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted this wand , for big waves ! Which I got sometimes . Most of the time it looks so messed up and I&#x27;m very good with curling wands I have many of them but for some reason this just isn&#x27;t a look for me . I got it from reading how good the reviews are . You&#x27;d think sence the curler is so big you can use big sections of hair but for me I can&#x27;t use big sections or it does not look right . but I defiantly love how it gets hot fast , and you can control your heat settings .</li>
            <li> The pink color was discontinued, so I ordered a like new one off Amazon. It was delivered within days and I was so excited to try it. It does give u a nice curl, however, the hair kinda sticks to the barrel (without any product in hair) and its hard to slide the hair down the barrel to curl it. I have long hair so I need to move the hair down the barrel as I go to make room for more hair (short hair may work just fine) but for my hair it seemed to stick and not enough room on the barrel to wrap n heat. I have since then set this product to the side and went back to my curling iron.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to but I got perfect curls</li>
            <li> This is one the best curling irons I have ever purchased. Wondering where you have been all my life!!! I use this wand everyday, purchased the small barrel wand also. I can not say enough good things about it. This is a wonderful product and for the price Even better! Must have in my eyes</li>
            <li> This iron gets a ton of great reviews, so maybe it&#x27;s me. I have tried several times and I only wind up with burned fingers and uncurled hair. I&#x27;m very used to having good luck with the old clamp-style irons and cannot for the life of me get my hair to stay on the barrel. And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the temp control buttons sit right where your fingers go while styling. For me, that adds even more frustration to an already maddening situation.  I&#x27;ll keep on trying and will update my review if I can ever learn how to use this and get a decent hairstyle out of it. But if you are happy with clamp-style irons, I see no reason to switch to this kind.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! It&#x27;s well worth the price and great quality! Heats up real fast and I love the way it makes my hair curl and feel soft from the ceramic barrel. The 2 inch barrel helps me curl my hair faster then my old wand that has a smaller barrel. I recently bought the matching Remington Straightner! I highly reccommend anyone to buy this Remington Wand!</li>
            <li> I have the smaller one and it works great, got this one for bigger curles. It&#x27;s Fabulous. My sister has super long hair and it curls it all. And works great with my extensions. I&#x27;m a happy girl.</li>
            <li> Heats really fast, only drawback is that there&#x27;s no clamp, so you have to use the glove they provide, which can be a hassle esp when you&#x27;re in a rush. The cone is also really slippery so it&#x27;s a struggle to keep my hair wrapped around it long enough. But, remington is still my fav due to the ease of temp control and how fast it heats up. Also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair as much as other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no pro, but after reading the other reviews, I sort of expected this wand to work miracles on my long hair. It did a great job on one side and then just completely refused to curl the other side. For some reason it seems the functionality of this wand decreases after 15 minutes or so of use. I didn&#x27;t find this any easier to use than a regular curling iron either.</li>
            <li> it could be the type of hair that i have (which is stubbornly straight) but this curler worked well all except my curls would fall flat within half an hour. i used to use a straightner to curl my hair and those curls would stay in long. So while the product is good, i believe the heat isn&#x27;t high enough for people with straight hair. probably works better on people with fine thin hair. I now use a hot tools curling wand and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> good value; comes with a glove to prevent burning  ones fingers</li>
            <li> It works awesome! I love it! Great for thick hair :). Easy to use and makes beautiful big waves. Also good for small curls.</li>
            <li> I was most excited about the price!! Curls perfectly. Great curling wand.</li>
            <li> Takes practice, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these because they work so well. I love how my beachy waves turn out using this curling iron!! Perfect everytime....</li>
            <li> Love it. A lot better than a normal curling iron. Curls last longer.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand! It does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is one amazing wand! The bottom layer of my hair will not hold a curl. However, this wand gives it a curl that lasts all day! It is a very versatile wand that gives wavy and spiral curls. My hair type: long, soft and semi thick. I have also tried this on short hair and  coarse thick hair. It works amazing on all hair types. It was very affordable and my go-to style!</li>
            <li> Can I say hallelujah?!!!!  I&#x27;m Dominiocan with super curly hair and sometimes I want to switch it up with wavy beach curls.  This tool did it for me.  I would wash my hair and air dry for an hour, braid my hair before bed and then take sections of my hair and curl it with this wand.  20 minutes tops!!  I&#x27;ve been doing my hair a lot more often now.  FYI, make sure to deep moisturize since ALL hot tools dry your ends!!!</li>
            <li> The size was quite adequate and i thought that the 410 temp would be hot enough for efficient curls, but didn&#x27;t produce anything more than slight waves which was odd for the amount of time I&#x27;d allowed to pass on each section of hair and the several attempts made.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use. I do not use the glove because it actually gets in the way but I do recommend using it until you get the hang of the wand. It gives very nice waves and is very easy to use. Just be careful that you do not burn you neck (sadly, i had that experience).</li>
            <li> this product is awesome i really love because is very easy to use. my hair is very straight but with this I can finally waves me in the hair. im very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 1 year already and its still going strong. Love how it shuts off after 1 hour, sometimes being in such a rush I forget</li>
            <li> my friend had this curler, I absolutely loved it  and used it every time I was at her place. had to get one for myself. I ordered it and it came three days later. I didn&#x27;t expect it to come so fast, I was very happy about that. the curler itself, works fantastic and I highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron from the same line, so thought I&#x27;d try this curler. It feels cheap compared to the flat iron.  When I tried it out it caught my hair between the barrel and the handle.  Returned.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend - I had long hair and recently cut to just below my collar bone. This size 1-1/2 works perfectly to give me beachy waves. I have also used it on smaller sections of hair to do big bouncy curls that drop into perfect waves. Good price for this product.</li>
            <li> I love this wand! I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for over 2 years without any problems. I stopped using the glove after a few uses once I got the hang of wrapping my hair. Knock on wood, I&#x27;ve never been burnt, but I don&#x27;t curl the very tips of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it was a little longer; I have really long hair and sometimes I have to curl the pieces in 2 parts in order to get all of the hair wrapped around the wand.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love it, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I finally managed to get that wavy great looking all by myself, it takes couple of times until you get used to it. You can check online for some tutorials</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments since I started using this product. I have curly-wavy hair that I usually keep that way or straighten. I was bored of doing both so I decided to get this iron wand to change things up. I&#x27;m obsessed with the way my hair looks. It&#x27;s easy to use, watch a youtube tutorial before using it. I would recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wand for and a year now and I love it. It gives very beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;looks nice&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;looking nice isn&#x27;t the reason I bought this one. I relentlessly try to make products work because monies !This one though, I give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair, with no frizz. somedays limp and somedays just phenomenally smooth and slightly wavy. so yeah ,thats normal right.&lt;br /&gt;I use this one after a nice wash and 75% dry ,thats the one that works the best ,if I can even say that . What I get is something that resembles a wave that lasts for 30 minutes which sadly is before I get dressed and leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;If i try anything too dry it doesn&#x27;t work ,if i try 50,60,70% wet doesn&#x27;t work.mind you, I always towel dry so its not like I take this stick to a wet patch.&lt;br /&gt;Such a poor product in terms of result. Even if you are forgiving about the ridiculous holding positions to make this work , I would continue doing that  if I had any successful result.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return, I never want to see this ever again . I am too late to return the product back. I wish I had. I wish I bought that con air rotating styler . well, darn ..</li>
            <li> This wand makes beautiful perfect beachy curls and ringlets if you hold it correctly. I love love love it! Don&#x27;t forget to use the included glove because it does get VERY hot!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. Makes great curls &amp; I&#x27;ve never had any problems.</li>
            <li> This wand is as great as I thought it would be after reading reviews. Very well priced and really does an amazing job, heats up quick, has a thermometer, and curls hold forever. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a wand because I&#x27;m not good at hair and it looked harder to use than my regular curling iron. I did have to practice a bit, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out how to use (there are tons of YouTube video tutorials), and now this is the only curling iron I use. My curls look WAY better and more natural with the wand, and I feel like my curls hold up better as well. My hair is a little past my shoulders and I got the 1&amp;#34;-1.5&amp;#34; wand.</li>
            <li> I love this product overall and it does a good job, one complaint is that it easily gets that burnt smell on it that stays on the iron and transfers to your hair every time you curl it. Maybe its the material?  Another thing is that the wire could be longer.</li>
            <li> It curls your have and 2 hours later it drops completely. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is very nice for make your own curls at home. It comes with a glove to avoid you from burning. Is very easy to use and you can get your style in no time.</li>
            <li> This is how they make their hair look effortlessly beach-wavy.  I never knew that I could do my own hair this way.  All I needed was the right tool.  There are you-tube tutorial that show how simple it is to use.</li>
            <li> It is a great invention for people with really big and thick hair.  you don&#x27;t have to worry much about missing strands of hair and you can do your hair a lot faster.  The wand&#x27;s heat is very HOT. But that&#x27;s great and its fairly easy to use, plus you can control the heat temperature.  I would recommend it for those that like to do their own hair.</li>
            <li> This is now my second curling wand. My first one is thinner (meant to be for tighter curls) so I wanted to try out a thicker one, and i&#x27;m so happy I did. The price is amazing for what it can do. It heats up very fast and is able to curl hair almost instantly I get compliments on my hair daily asking what product i use. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve tried after watching a Youtube video of a girl doing it with ease! I have thick, curly hair, and I tried this with friend who has fine, straight hair. Bottom line - it worked great for me, not so much for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other reviewers cover the details here, so I don&#x27;t want to repeat a lot, but I think that if you&#x27;ve got fairly long hair, i.e., shoulder or longer, and it&#x27;s not baby fine, it should work for you. The wand is pretty slick/slippery, and most of all it is BIG! Although I could get it to work, I would have had an easier time with a smaller barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove didn&#x27;t protect my fingers when the setting was at 410 degrees, but that&#x27;s really too hot for anyone&#x27;s hair, no matter what anyone tells you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I always use a leave in conditioner, and because my hair has more texture than my friend&#x27;s, it didn&#x27;t slip right off the wand, and with a bit of practice, I was able to create some nice, loose curls. however, it was pretty much useless for the shorter hair on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend was unable to use the product because her hair would just fall right off the wand. She doesn&#x27;t use product in her hair as it usually weighs it down even more, and she plans on sticking with the old school clip style curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty sturdy - I have had many different types of flat irons by different companies, some $ and some $$$. I have always found Remington to be affordable and well made, often lasting longer than much more expensive brands. I don&#x27;t think the price or quality has a real effect on the results with this wand - so don&#x27;t feel the need to spend $$$ to try a wand. This is a great way to start.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING! It works wonders. Just as good as the $200 ones you see in the beauty supply store. Definitely get this one. I got the bigger barrel because I wanted big loose waves and they turn out perfect.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best curling wands I have ever used. It heats up very quickly and take no time at all to curl my hair. And my hair holds the curl for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> Love this! never hooks my hair, and works amazing.</li>
            <li> Simple curling iron that works quickly and effectively. I love this brand for the low price and the high quality.</li>
            <li> I am kind of new to curlers so it might just be me not know how to use it correctly for a good curl. My hair is shoulder length at the moment and I got this to get the messy bob look going but no luck after two tries. I think I need to curl smaller pieces at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this clipless one because the ones with clips always crimp my hair.  I do like that you can set the temperature on this one. I also have to say my hair is so much smoother and shinier after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely wear the glove if you&#x27;re new to this. I burned myself first time out because I was too concentrated on making sure the hair was going on right and not where my hand was with regard to the wand.</li>
            <li> It works well but it does take some learning. The first time I used it, suffered severe burn on my ear. Guess when the danger is this obvious, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I love my new tool, and have had many people ask me how I do my hair... I&#x27;ve shown each one exactly what to buy on amazon. I was happy with the price, size (I bought the bigger one), and look. My hair is very long and it works well. I also like the different heat temperature options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the BIG negative, IT ACTUALLY SCORCHED MY BATHROOM COUNTER! I could hardly believe it. I set it at 392°, and while I was doing makeup I smelled it and picked it up only to find it had scorched my counter by leaving a yellow burn mark. The stand the rod sits on is very shallow and doesn&#x27;t hold the heat far enough away from the surface. Luckily, i was right there and caught it quickly, or i fear it could have been worse.I hope that won&#x27;t happen at your home!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! You can get the ultimate perfect natural curls with this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I FINALLY found something that works!!!! I have tried curling my hair for years... I&#x27;ve spent ridiculous amounts on the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; flat irons and curling irons and nothing ever worked, my hair is very long and thick and I almost gave up hope that my hair would ever hold a curl no matter how much hair spray I used. I decided to try this curling wand out based on the rave reviews. I&#x27;ve had it 2 months now and I am thrilled with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I dont use any hair spray or product and the curls last all day and guess what?! They even hold up well the next day after sleeping!!! Its a miracle. I am so happy I bought this, I love it!!!!! Do yourself a favor and buy it now!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair Down to my waist and I keep it at 360. It really does heat up fast and gives me great waves. For the price and functionality I give 5 stars</li>
            <li> Worked well when it was working but only used a handful of times before it broke - keeps coming up with an error message now and won&#x27;t heat up. Probably the last Remington brand item I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> I JUST GOT MY OWN ONE BEFORE THREE DAYS AND I LIKE THE BOX AND THE CURLING IT IS SOOOO GOD BUT THE GLOVE I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE AT ALL DIDN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL IT IS VERY UNPROTECTED  :(</li>
            <li> This iron is awesome. It makes perfect beachy waves and is very easy to use. Just make sure to be careful with your hands so that you don&#x27;t accidentally burn yourself, which I haven&#x27;t done yet, but I didn&#x27;t use the heat glove that it came with. Love it!</li>
            <li> Im a stylist and it creates nice, loose curls, wand is a little tricky to manipulate on hair but practice makes perfect, use your glove so you don&#x27;t get burned, If you have shoulder length hair and you want it still long but with curl, flat iron first section by your shoulders then curl the rest.</li>
            <li> It takes practice learning how to hold the wand in the most comfortable way (especially when doing the back of your head) but it is very effective.  It heats up very quickly and I don&#x27;t have to leave my hair on it for very long before it produces a curl that will last all day.  My only complaint is that the glove that comes with it doesn&#x27;t help much, as you can still feel the heat through the glove.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Barely curls my hair and is very slippery and difficult to keep my hair on. Im surprised at the great reviews. I only gave it a second star because I have very thick, naturally pin-straight hair which is most likely a factor in the failure of this curling iron so I can&#x27;t entirely fault this device.</li>
            <li> This beautiful wand gives my hair those really amazing loose curls.  It heats up very fast and has a small stand so you can set it down on the counter while you adjust your hair.  Much much better than a curling iron!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron/wand, but the hair always slips down to the bottom of the wand so it doesnt hold a curl close to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product since I finally let my hair grow out and wanted big wazy curls.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is I can not figure out how to use it for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;Im disappointed bc the ends stay straight when I want them curled. I guess Im old fashioned I like my curling iron better!</li>
            <li> I love the Pearl flat iron and I just had to try this curling \\&quot;wand\\&quot;.  I did not read carefully, and I thought I was getting a regular curling iron, but this is not one with the regular clamp.  You are supposed to use the glove instead of having the clamp, and this makes it very hard for me to use.  I think it&#x27;s supposed to make styling easier, but for me it&#x27;s just awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I do like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It gets hot fast.  Not too much waiting.&lt;br /&gt;*Different heat settings for different types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Different thicknesses in one unit, for smaller or larger curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just too bad it&#x27;s not a normal iron.  I don&#x27;t care for the wand style.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and they love it.  They said that it is exactly what they wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it Thank you a lot :)</li>
            <li> The curls produced by this wand last way longer than those from any other curling irons I&#x27;ve ever used. Even with my hair being the typical Asian hair (thick and straight), I can get curls that last all day long. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because every time I use this wand I get some hair strands caught in the spot where the barrel meets the black plastic tip.</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my hair. I recommend that you curl your hair roughly, then brush it for a voluminous look. Regular big banana curls are great too with this. My only issue is the glove gets hot really quick. I&#x27;d get another glove, especially if you have longer/thicker hair and it takes a bit to curl. My fingers often are sore when curling because of this. But love the product itself.</li>
            <li> My first time using this iron it burned my carpet. I have never had a problem with hot irons on my carpet, but this one burned it in less than five minutes while I did my make up. I had to unplug it and let it cool down because there was burnt carpet residue left on the wand&#x27;s barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest that you have a heat resistant pad to set this on during use. Although I only left it on for a few minutes (on the carpet by accident), this has never happened before with any other hair styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the heat-resistant glove that it comes with is so crappy and cheap! It&#x27;s just a normal black glove that you would wear when it&#x27;s cold outside. I will definitely be purchasing better protection when using this product.</li>
            <li> Good little curling wand. Heats up quickly and does a good job if you hold the hair on it long enough. The black part that connects to the pink part (where it connects) pulls the hair if you aren&#x27;t careful in wrapping the hair exactly on the pink barrel. But hey, for this price it doesn&#x27;t really matter!! Great value.</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up fast!</li>
            <li> After struggling with curling irons and flat irons to create consistent curls, I decided to try a curling wand. It took some practice to get the hang of it, but I&#x27;m happy with the results. I have somewhat thin and fine hair that falls just below my shoulders, for reference. I use the lowest temperature setting and it takes me about half an hour to style. The glove doesn&#x27;t protect from the heat completely, but again, it just takes some practice. There might be better products out there, but I think this is a great budget option.</li>
            <li> This works so well!! When I opened it it felt light and almost cheap so I was a little disappointed but when I went to use it, the wand heated up very fast and it worked perfect! My hair DOES NOT curl but this wand got hot enough for my hair to hold a curl all day! I ordered this in the bigger size once I tested it because I liked it so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to take some practice but I had a full head of curls in under 30min which is amazing considering my hair reaches far past the middle of my back. I wish the cord was longer but that&#x27;s nothing an extension cord can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used other curling irons and the curls don&#x27;t last, with this curling iron curls last much longer.</li>
            <li> I tried this beauty appliance on my daughter&#x27;s hair, because my own hair is rather thin, and she has a lovely crown of long, thick hair. Frankly, her hair looks beautiful whatever you do to it, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised it turned out well with this device. Long spiral waves are pretty on a teenage girl. There is more than one way to get the effect, though, and I don&#x27;t think this is the best way.  The curling irons that have a clasp are easier to use than this thing. Putting on a glove and winding the hair around a hot cylinder is not really very much fun. It takes a long time, and even with the glove, it is hot work. The gradient spiral effect is interesting in theory -  you can have curls with a fat curve on one end and a thin curve on the other end. Which end is supposed to be fat? I don&#x27;t know. It didn&#x27;t really work out that way, but maybe I was doing it wrong.  So, I would say too much effort for no particular advantage, and this thing has sat in the drawer for a month now, unused and unloved. My daughter prefers her old-technology curling iron over this one.</li>
            <li> I have this size and the smaller one, I find myself using this larger one so I don&#x27;t poodle myself out. A little bit of a learning curve with these so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. Tried to use glove and it was awkward and really only gave you a little more time to pull hand away before getting a nasty burn; not meant to fully protect. All in all, a nice tool.</li>
            <li> I love it it curls up my hair really quick I didn&#x27;t think it would of stayed being that my hair is really long I got this as a gift and I love it</li>
            <li> Ordered as a Christmas gift. Pretty decent shipping time. Item was as described in new box etc. But was not a shiny purplish color as I expected from photo. Doesn&#x27;t have the pearl tone to the color. Its more a flat pink color. Heats up fast and has very high temp.</li>
            <li> When I first revived this product, I thought it was a piece of #%?&amp;#62; because it wasn&#x27;t curling the way I would see other people who would use curling a wands looked. But, a couple of YouTube videos later and 1-2 practice runs before going out in public, I have mastered the art of the curling wand and getting that beach wavy look! Only gripes I have about the wand is that it takes a while to heat up and that I saw this exact same product at Walgreens a week or so after I purchased it for a couple bucks CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> My hair never holds curl... ever. I have super thick hair that has been problematic since I was little. However, when I curl my hair with this the curl will stay for two days without hairspray!!! This is the most amazing curling wand ever and is at an unbeatable price. Buy this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with how it arrived. They literally stuck the wand itself and the glove and send it to me. It wasn&#x27;t in its original packaging or anything just put in a box. Another thing the glove they sent me was NOT heat proof. Aside from that the wand itself works fine and heats up and gets very hot so that a plus. But the packaging is what disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted loose beachy curls. I have a tapered rod that is 1/4&amp;#34; smaller throughout and the curls were just a tad too tight for my liking... its amazing how much difference 1/4&amp;#34; makes. This makes very very very loose waves... I think i&#x27;ll stick with my hot tools rod instead.</li>
            <li> Finally a descent beachy wave look! Definately the best waves ive ever had!!!! I definately recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li> I almost bought a $130 version of this product but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t! It works great.  There is certainly a learning curve with figuring out how to best style the curls and how to hold it when you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight blonde hair and can&#x27;t usually hold a curl. With this product I can hold a curl without hair spray, but they stay tighter longer if I do.</li>
            <li> 6/10 ...it holds the hair little bit</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to use. First, directions show a tong for use, but there was none. Second, it has a small stand attached to wand but doesn&#x27;t hold it up. Then you can not get hair to stay wrapped around. Plus even with glove, I burned myself. Unless you are a contortionist it is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments when I curl my hair with this wand. I have very long and thick hair and this wand gives me the big, glamorous waves I love!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1-1 1/2&amp;#34; size and really enjoy it. I&#x27;ve used the same technique before with a curling iron, wrapping the hair around the iron rather than clamping it on for a less &#x27;perfect&#x27; curl. Much easier to do with this curling wand and the hair slides right off it! The video shows how to use this product, you can get variety by curling pieces in different directions and/or twisting the hair before wrapping it around the wand. Makes nice, loose beachy waves. I may end up buying the smaller size, too. Great price for the product. Makes it very quick and easy to do your hair. The photo is from my first time using. Pretty straightforward and easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Love product! Product even came with a protective glove because product gets really hot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this size wand- I have very thick, wavy, frizzy, and long hair- to my waist. I have the smaller wand and I love it but since my hair has gotten long, it is just so small to be using and makes it take even longer with a small wand. This wand makes much more loose curls and not so ringlet prom like ones like the smaller one. It is very cute which is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> I truly couldn&#x27;t live without this thing. I have long, thick hair with coarse waves. That means my hair requires a high heat to hold a curl while also straightening out the waves. This heats up to 410 degrees! I get perfect \\&quot;Kim Kardashian\\&quot; loose curls by curling my hair with this wand, spraying it with L&#x27;Oreal Elnett hairspray and then lightly finger combing or brushing it. I use the larger sized wand and it takes about 35-40 minutes to curl my hair, but I have a ton of hair. These curls stay in my hair until I wash it again, though they do fall slightly (I usually try to get at least 2 days wear out of it). The curls also look great in a ponytail. I have tried many curling irons and wands and this one is by far the best! The heating glove that comes with it is the best I&#x27;ve used as well.</li>
            <li> Shipped without safety glove. Contacted Remington and they shipped out glove.  Would recommend to anyone needing a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I burnt my finger a couple times, so wear the gloves. It gets really hot but still doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. The curls are so soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> its great and does the job however cuz its so slippery all the hair bunches to the thiner portion :/</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WAND IT CURLS FAST AND LASTS FOR DAYS. MY HAIR DOSENT FEEL DRY IT FEELS SILKY. JUST LOVE THIS IRON AND PRICE. IT MAKES NICE CURLS.</li>
            <li> This wand is the BOMB!!!!!!! It&#x27;s easy to use and your curls stay in all day. Be carful if it&#x27;s your first time using it because it gets very hot and if you don&#x27;t know what your doing,can burn your fingers, it comes with a glove but i don&#x27;t use it.  Love it, will never use a regular curling iron again.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think my hair is long enough... the product itself is alright i wish they would explain more as to what temperature works best for this type of curl and etc.</li>
            <li> high temperate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This looks like it would be a good product. But it must take lots of practice because I can&#x27;t get any of my curls to look right. They look sort of ok on one side but the other side just looks terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice curing iron, I have just not been able to get use to using a wand, not sure if it is me or just the design. It heats up quickly and gets very hot which I love, I just haven&#x27;t been able to learn how to do more than one style of curl</li>
            <li> Such a good wand!! It curls my hair perfectly. I don&#x27;t use the glove, and I have never gotten burned. The controls and locks are great. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to properly use a curling iron without have those ugly creases at the end of my hair. I read some reviews on this product and figured I&#x27;d purchase the thinner pearl remington. I ended up returning it and buying this one (the thicker one) because the thinner one made the curls too tight and they never fell and loosened up.  This one made perfect curls and was super easy to use. I think this is a great price and the product is great too. I used to be one of those people who thought all the heated hair tools had to cost at least $100 to be good and work great, but apparently they make them better than they used to years ago and the price is very reasonable!!! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like this product and the heat glove that comes with it is helpful as well, my hair rarely holds a curl and even with this, falls flat within 1-2 hours of using it, so I don&#x27;t use it as often &#x3D;( But the product is still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love this iron. You can set and control the temperature levels.. it comes with a nice glove as well. The tapered end at the bottom lets you have tighter, bouncier curls at the bottom and allows you to easily make a curly beach look by brushing them through with your fingers. This is my go to iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update - I&#x27;ve been using this iron since 2012, and it is STILL my favorite curling wand I&#x27;ve found, thus far. I find it has a tendency to &#x27;tip down&#x27; and burn the top of the counter, so I use a stone coaster underneath it and go about my day. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It is just as expected.  Very glad I bought this.  It works well for me.  I would recommend.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> good product good quality care recommended</li>
            <li> Best wand for big bouncy curls! Definitely worth the money. Got here two days after purchased and fell in love after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Need to wear the glove every time using this.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit hard to control,&lt;br /&gt;it is difficult to keep the hair around the wand and don&#x27;t know which direction should start.</li>
            <li> This curling wand concept simply does not work. There is nothing to hold your hair in place so you have to manually wind your hair around a hot instrument wearing a silly glove. My hair rolled right off the wand as I tried to avoid scorching my hands. I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot makes big curls and will also make my hair wavy, i really really really really like it</li>
            <li> This curling wand it&#x27;s really amazing! I have the smaller one, but I absolutely love more this one because my hair it&#x27;s very long. Very good product. My hair look very pretty when I use it and I&#x27;ve got lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> My only problem is I&#x27;m not very good at styling my own hair in the back so I only use this when my sister can help me!</li>
            <li> The style of this curling wand is very awkward. I found it very hard to use, especially because my hair is layered, which makes it very difficult to use this device because it does not have a clip for your hair so it has nothing to keep it in place. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a curling wand and I did some research and this one was pretty well reviewed and for a good price. I used it and I was happy with the results I got. Very pretty waves. :)</li>
            <li> After struggling for over 30 years with this mop on my head, I am finally happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have frizzy hair on shower day, and flat, limp hair the following.  I did learn to make my own hair gel, and that helped tremendously, but the second day still needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes this curling wand and problem solved!  Soooo fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Very Quick shipment . Bought it as a gift, my daughter loves it. I Would recommend, good buy for the money</li>
            <li> I love how this curling iron gives me the flexibility to play around with the size and shapes of my curls and and they look more natural. Make sure to always wear the glove that comes with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really curl my hair... I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my sister loved it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affordable, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do... creates loose curls.&lt;br /&gt;i permed my hair wavy so i think this works better on me than my friend who had really thick straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t used this too long so i&#x27;m not so sure in which direction i&#x27;m supposed to curl my hair... does anyone know where i can look for directions or styling advice with this device? thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1&amp;#34; - 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling wand, as I am not a fan of small, tight curls, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This wand does an amazing job with my hair--it works fast and the curls look very big and natural. I personally find that the glove makes the process more tedious, and I don&#x27;t burn myself while curling my hair without the glove as long as I am careful. The wand really isn&#x27;t too different from a curling iron aside from the clamp, so I can&#x27;t say which I prefer. (For those who complain that curling irons leave a crease in your hair, you just need to curl your hair in the same direction in which you put your hair in the clamp! I have never gotten creases from using a curling iron.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron itself doesn&#x27;t look like much. I was a little surprised by how cheap it looked when I first opened the box. Both the handle and the ceramic wand section feel like very cheaply made plastic, but I guess looks can be deceiving! My curls always come out looking fantastic. The only product I use is spray-on heat protectant beforehand, and the curls last all day! Definitely recommend this curling wand; there&#x27;s no need to pay a ton of money for fancy wands when this one does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and thought I would try it out on the front part of my head. I usually curl my hair with a flat iron. This was so easy to use and took me couple of minutes to do almost half of my head. The iron great up pretty fast. And it&#x27;s been couple of hours and the curls still look amazing. I already recommended a group of moms to getting this. I did not try the glove yet, no need for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1-1.5&amp;#34; wand after wanting nice bouncy curls and not being able to achieve them with a regular curling iron or flat iron. I have long, thick hair that is really hard to curl, and almost impossible to keep curly, even with tons of hairspray. I decided to try this wand after watching some YouTube videos regarding curling wands. My first attempt I did use the glove, and I&#x27;m glad because the wand is really awkward to use when you&#x27;re not used to it, and I probably would have burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the trick is to go behind your head with the wand on the opposite side from which you are curling. You have to wrap the hair TIGHTLY around the wand (with your gloved hand), with the wand facing down to get the best curl and hold it there for at least 5 seconds, if not more, depending on your hair. I started with a temp around 390, but had to go all the way up to 410 for my hair to hold the curl. I sprayed my whole head first with Aussie Sprunch spray, then brushed my hair. After curling one complete side I would again spray with hairspray and leave it. Once my whole head was done I resprayed my entire head, used my fingers to adjust the curls, then used a dry shampoo at the roots to give it more volume, and a shine spray. Sounds like a lot of effort, but the whole business took about 40 minutes, and I believe it will go faster once I start getting used to the process. I ended up with a nice head of loose curly waves with lots of volume, and those Kardashians girls had nothing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would definitely purchase while keeping in mind that the first time may not be a success, so don&#x27;t try it the morning before work. If the hair tends to slip off, use a hairspray first, then brush through your hair and it should help. This is good for those with long, or very thick hair that usually have difficulty getting curls, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> If youre the kind of girl who can curl her hair, then I&#x27;m sure this is the best thing in the world. But for me, it was just okay. I have really long hair, halfway down my back, and have always wanted to curl my hair, but unfortunately it&#x27;s always been too heavy. When I read other reviews on Amazon about this product I was convinced it must be a miracle-worker and surely would turn my luck around. It certainly is a nice hair curler, but performed no better than any other device. I would recommend this product to any of my friends because I really do like it, but in all honesty was hoping for something a little better. The glove doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job of being heat resistant and despite the high quality of the wand, I still have to hold my hair there for about 40 seconds for it to make any difference at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a top-notch wand, but no magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Japanese. When it was hard to use the curling irons with a clip for me and watched this product, I thought that it was very good.&lt;br /&gt;There is not such a product in Japan, I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple and easy to use it. Thank you for making such a splendid product!</li>
            <li> I am a first-time hair curler buyer/user and this thing is really easy to use. I got it down and my whole head curled in under 25 minutes. My only complaint is they sent it to me in a different color than the pink! Also, the tip doesn&#x27;t stay cool so you can&#x27;t really hold it on the end. But ita super easy and quick! The curls hold</li>
            <li> This wand (1 - 1.5 in) is perfect for looser curls or soft waves. The more hair you curl at a time, the looser your curls, so you can do tighter or looser ones depending on the look you are after. My daughter had the smaller diameter wand and the curls were too tight for my long hair. Love this larger one!  Adjustable heat, quick heat up time, and safety auto-shut off are must have features. The pearl finish is super smooth - I used 385 degrees for coarse thick hair and my curls lasted for days without hair spray. Highly recommend this wand - got it quickly from Best Rx.</li>
            <li> not the best, but works okay</li>
            <li> This thing heats up fast and makes beautiful curls. The cool tip is not actually cool, but in my opinion that&#x27;s a happy accident- I have super long hair and tend to run out of iron before I run out of hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the button position- I&#x27;m constantly accidentally pushing them when I&#x27;m curling, and it&#x27;s annoying and distracting. If they solved that and included a better quality glove, this would be perfect. A lot of wands seem to taper way too fast (with long hair, this exacerbates the too much hair too little iron problem), but the shape of this one is nice and seems to make very natural-looking curls. I suggest watching the diamondsandheels video if, like me, you&#x27;re curling challenged.</li>
            <li> I think this wand is absolutely fantastic. Good price, great product, pink (very appealing to girls), long lasting soft curls, fast and easy yo use. I have the 3 versions of curling wands and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!!</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s super cheap, works so well, and comes with a glove to protect your hand. It gets really hot and works with all hair types.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get it! does not work well. I wasted my money. don&#x27;t don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;waste your time. please don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> this product is amazing , and a vary good quality for a small price , i recomend it a lot</li>
            <li> for whom curious about voltage usage it&#x27;s printed on the product and also the manual booklet 120 V - 240 V so I&#x27;m pretty sure you can use it abroad I never try yet but soon and hope it works fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I wish all these hair appliance product print voltage use or non/dual voltage or worldwide voltage on the package so customer will find out easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; add on info I tried this wand abroad with 220 V and worked just fine</li>
            <li> So easy to use and hair is easy to curl!! So far I haven&#x27;t  burned my fingers, unlike the curling iron.  Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> My sister and I were looking for a curling iron like this after having had one used on us at a salon and being wowed by it. Just make sure you use the mitt or it becomes a crazy juggling mess. But without a clamp on the curler there&#x27;s no more of that awful line that be permanently creased into your hair. Make sure you start twirling the strand from the very bottom so the heat gets evenly distributed.It&#x27;s like a quick compromise between a curling iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, and I&#x27;ve been planning for a while to try to add a little more fun to my everyday look with a curling iron.  I was very excited to see this product come up, and I watched several instruction videos to make sure I used it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are several: it heats up quickly and the temperature is easy to control and lock with the digital display.  It&#x27;s very attractive, and the barrel is a good size for several different styles of curls (looser using the base, or tighter at the top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem for me is that you cant&#x27; let go of your hair at any time during the process or it slips right off.  This means that for short hair, you&#x27;re grasping the very tip ends trying to get a wrap around the barrel.  Very challenging and frustrating at times.  It&#x27;s just not a very efficient way to curl short hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have long, thick hair. which I&#x27;m sure totally changes the game, and makes my review null and void for people with short and/or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, pros...&lt;br /&gt;-Makes my hair look GREAT. Since I wrap each section around the wand 4-5 times minimum, it twists around the barrel giving me that beachy/wave look. I have gotten tons of compliments, it looks great. My profile picture is the day after, combed out. It holds, probably because it&#x27;s hellishly HOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons...&lt;br /&gt;-Takes forever. If you have a ton of hair anyway. I&#x27;m use to being able to watch TV or whatever with curling/straight irons. Not with this. It takes longer AND you have to pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;-You have to pay attention because you will burn the crap out of your hand. Yes, it&#x27;s possible without the glove. But I don&#x27;t recommend it. Because it&#x27;s HOT.&lt;br /&gt;-The glove is right handed. Not cool for somebody who has a lifetime of holding styling tools in their right hand. I put it on my left hand and it kinda worked. But is awkward. I basically hate the glove, until I&#x27;m sick of burning my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s slick and tapered. So I start wrapping at the base, but it all ends up bunched up at the tip. For sure the next wand I get will be a straight one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I really hate this horribly impractical beast of a styling tool. But would never return it because of how good my hair looks. So there you are.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a curling iron without the clip feature to hold your hair on it, but I thought this must be the latest and greatest in salon tools to get fabulous results. Nope. It was just weird. Wearing a glove while trying to style your hair is awkward. And then trying to get the hair to stay on was a new technique to have to learn. My question is \\&quot;Why?\\&quot; I don&#x27;t understand how this is an improvement over the type of curling irons we&#x27;ve all be using for years. I did like the smooth \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; barrel, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve never used a curling WAND before (vs. a curling iron), you really need to go to youtube and find a video that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few tips that helped me a lot. My favorite ones came from monicasocal on Youtube; her video is named \\&quot;Beachy curls/waves using Remington curling wand\\&quot; if you want to google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is similar to hers, but not quite as long, and mine is maybe a bit thicker. The highlights: she suggested parting your hair into a low, middle and high level. She suggested STARTING the wand at your chin for your lower hair (bottom of your head, say, ear length); for the middle section, start curling at the top of your lip; and for the top, start curling at the bridge of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much followed those directions, and yes, it turned out great. (monicasocal, thank you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about a curling wand you have to know is that you need the glove, and yes, you&#x27;ll be holding the curl 20 or so seconds (varies with the heat you have the dial turned up to, and the texture of your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other youtube videos suggest shaking your hair; some suggest running your fingers through it to loosen the curls but not destroy the definition. Just remember to let the curls COOL before you touch them, or else you&#x27;ll be coming the curl out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip: when you look for a youtube video to show you how to do this and what your result might be, find a girl who has hair similar to yours. It makes the trial and error part a lot more trial and a lot less error!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want chuncky waves.  It heated quickly and there are quite a few settings. I found it a little ackward to use and the glove is a MUST. It took a few tries to get the look I wanted.  The waves stayed in my hair all day- it gets really hot, so it sets well. This isn&#x27;t my every dasy go-to curling wand, but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> Great product however would rather have a grip than having to wear a glove. If you exclude this factor it does the job perfectly and takes only minutes to heat up.</li>
            <li> curled better than anything i have used. i have very long hair and the curl lasted in my hair all day!</li>
            <li> forget the curling iron!  this is fast!  heats up super fast, digital easy read numbers to set, wrap, hold, and wonderful, soft bouncy curls.  not for young kids.  you need to be careful not to burn your finger tips.  comes with finger protector.  use it!  easy to manage.</li>
            <li> OK. So... I rarely write reviews, but this product is awesome! I have super thick, very long hair. It will take a curl initially but then it falls out within an hour or so. UNTIL THIS curling wand. Now my curls relax a little but last for at least two days.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing.&lt;br /&gt;The (few) negative reviews are very frustrating to read. It&#x27;s obvious that the majority of them come from people who didn&#x27;t bother to learn how to use a curling wand first. If you are used to a traditional iron that clamps your ends to the barrel (and fries them) this is not it. You have to unlearn what you know. I seriously recommend watching a YouTube video for hints as the instructions are very basic and assume you know what you are doing. If you don&#x27;t it will be easy to get frustrated and/or burned.&lt;br /&gt;If you know what you are doing, this wand is a god send. Don&#x27;t try it your first time and assume you&#x27;ll be a pro. Experiment a little, take your time. Before you know it you&#x27;ll be throwing your old irons out and vowing never to use them again, I promise.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a low price product that works at a professional level, this is it. My waist-length, unruly hair curls perfectly and STAYS curled in under 20 minutes. I&#x27;m actually on here to buy the other size as well.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase with confidence, practice and enjoy your new curls!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, but the details provided here on Amazon are NOT accurate. This product does NOT have worldwide voltage, even though it is stated here and on the company website. If you try to use this overseas, you will fry it. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 1 star because of the misleading description. I did not get a chance to try the product on my hair.</li>
            <li> Returned this product - I was aware of the diameter but it is not  the same diameter the length of the barrel.  Returned and sent my neice another one.</li>
            <li> I hate it when people leave negative reviews because they were too retarded to figure out how to operate the product. I have never owned a curling iron that held my curls - and I have looked. I have weird Mediterranean hair, its wavy on top really frizzy and super curly on the bottom; when I try to straighten it with my Chi it takes me at least an hour. When I first bought this I was skeptical because it didn&#x27;t have a clip but my hair comes out flawless soft kink-free and beautiful everytime - if I use hair spray the curls will last the days. Take an hour or two practicing, figure out what feels comfortable. The cord swivels so I find it easiest to spin the barrel while wrapping my hair (it helps me keep my hair on the barrel). Beware of idiots and their uninformed reviews.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this curling iron but was left wishing I didn&#x27;t throw out the packaging to return it.  all the amazing reviews made me buy it but different strokes for different folks.  the tapered barrel is awkward and my hair slides when I wrap my hair around it.  the glove is flimsy and I honestly do better without but VERY carefully.  I now know that I&#x27;m better off with a barrel that is all one width.  I even find myself using my old curling iron with the clip more often.  my hair does look nice after and ppl compliment my toussled look but achieving the look is not effortless.  its just not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Good curling wand for the a great price. It curls my hair really well</li>
            <li> My hair has never been able to hold curl.  By the time I finish curling my hair, the first section I did is already limp :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my sister picked up this styling wand a while back, and I noticed right away from the shape of her curls that it was different than other irons.  Her hair hold curl better than mine, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me, but I was so happy when it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand makes celebrity-like curls.  The smaller smaller-diameter one makes curls like Taylor swift, while this larger barrel one looks more like Giselle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to add even more impact, use dickbill clips to set the curls while they cool.  My curls now not only last all day, they are usually even decent the next day!</li>
            <li> This heats up nicely, has temperature control, and gives really nice curls!  Don&#x27;t need to buy a really expensive one, this one works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems getting curls to stay with my long, thick and heavy hair but this curling iron works great. Heats up fast and the curls lasts more than a day for me. I really like the heat resistant glove as it allows me to focus on getting the curls to look great instead of worrying if I&#x27;m about to burn my fingers!</li>
            <li> I grew up using a straightening iron on my thick, coarse, naturally frizzy hair, and I&#x27;m so glad I made a change and ordered this curling wand.  This is my go-to styling wand, and I get so many compliments on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to either make big curls away from my face, or I sometimes wrap the sections differently and get big waves.  Even though my hair is super thick (I divide it into about ten sections and curl), it only takes 12-15 minutes to get lots of volume and style!  It used to take me about 30-40 minutes to straighten my hair, and I have no idea what I would do without this wand.  Being that it&#x27;s ceramic, the wand smooths the frizz and gives my hair the same silky texture I used to get from the straightening iron—but with BIG curls or waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s silly to say this about a curling wand, but it&#x27;s revolutionized my morning routine!</li>
            <li> THERE NO GRIP AT ALL FOR HAIR, BUT THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT IT HEATS UP REALLY FAST AND ITS REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I thought that it was there was a clip to hold the hair, and didn&#x27;t notice the glove...needless to say I didn&#x27;t know what to do with this.  I pulled it out the box and realized that I am truly clueless regarding this.  Although, I&#x27;m sure an experienced hair stylist will be able to use it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was very disappointed. After practicing how to hold it best (pointing up on one side, and down on the other) and getting the timing right (at least ten seconds per strand), it worked well. The curls don&#x27;t last as long as if I use my fat iron (turn as you go), but they stay better than if I used a reguar curling iron that does not get to 410 degrees like this does.</li>
            <li> This product simply does not make Remington look good - it&#x27;s so cheap, and there is nothing \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; about the barrel even though the photo makes it look pearlescent.  AND, it is difficult to get use to. Wrapping my hair around the barrel was easy when doing the left side of my head, but it was much harder to wrap the hair on the right side (I&#x27;m right-handed). I was forced to curl the hair upward instead of downward.  I returned it. However, as for technique, it may be that my hair is not yet long enough.</li>
            <li> bought because I wanted bigger loose curls. I also have the one by conair and the 1/2&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; size which performs admirably. This one though....meh. You definitely get the loose curling action, which i&#x27;d be satisfied with, if the curls STAYED. they did not. loose curls+no staying power&#x3D; STRAIGHT HAIR. whhhaaaaattt. hairspray on the point of being superglue could not have gotten these to stay.&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly the design is nice and sleek looking, but I&#x27;d have bought a straightener for the results I got.The barrel is also too short. I have hair like 3 inches past shoulders and there was no more room on the barrel for hair past mid-shaft. Curling time was at least 30 seconds, which is venturing into hair fry-dry.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it.  Works GREAT!  I would buy this again for other people</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and produces gorgeous curls. The temperature setting options are a plus for me because my hair doesn&#x27;t usually stay curled. After curling my hair with this iron I had smooth curls that stayed in even after sleeping.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product purchase I have ever made. This wand is worth way more than the advertised price. I paid a little over $22.00, but had I known how well it was going to work I would easily fork over $150.00.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using this wand, I purchased the 1 1/2&#x27;&#x27;, EVERYONE has complemented my hair. Strangers come up to trying to touch it. The curls are perfect and the wand gets so hot that it takes only seconds for each section to produce the perfect curl.&lt;br /&gt;Do your hair a favor and buy this wand!!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy curling!</li>
            <li> The problem is this iron 110 v and my city 220 i didn&#x27;t expect that :(&lt;br /&gt;But the iron gave soo beautiful wavy hair i reallly luvvit!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girl and she cant figure it out i might toss it or give it away</li>
            <li> My daughter has the small barrell wand and wanted the large barrell for Christmas.  She loves and uses them both.</li>
            <li> Love it and enjoy using it to style hair. Fair price and great quality. Very easy to use and enjoy the structure of the curler.</li>
            <li> The quality is too low, can&#x27;t be used, very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought this curler over a year and it&#x27;s still working for me. It does the curls super fast and my curls last me all night. Depending on your hair type it may vary. I would not recommend to buy this product if you have thick hair. The only con about the product is that it leaves your hair smelling like smoke so what i do is use a product that is heat protecter and smells good as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing! love it! The shipping is very fast and very good service Absolutely recommend it to all !! do a spectacular curly... I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> although i burned myself. it will take some getting use to. but the curls come out great with it! just be careful not to burn your ear like i did!</li>
            <li> I really like how the curls come out with this curling wand. The rod is thick so the curls are large, which is what I was looking for. It&#x27;s easy to use and the glove is very useful because the rod can get very hot. My curls also last until I wash my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up very fast, handle is comfortable to hold but sometimes I accidentally press the buttons and change the heat settings. I know there is a way to lock the settings though (I&#x27;m just too lazy to do it). Very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and probably easier to use than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and even saw Youtube video&#x27;s showing how awesome this was. I got it and it did nothing for my hair. My ceramic straightner does better curls than this thing. I have natural wavy hair and have been straightening my hair and wanted to add some waves or curl into it, but this didn&#x27;t do anything to help that matter</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It literally changed my morning routine. Now, i have amazing hair every day and it takes me only 5 min.It does need a practice so don&#x27;t get discourage. Give it a couple times and u will be a pro.  I stopped using the glow after couple uses. i admit glow is annoying but again u wont need it after u learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Good product, natural hair curl</li>
            <li> This product works exactly how it is suppose to. The temperature control is great. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good affordable wand.</li>
            <li> You have to wear a glove and hold your hair around it with your hand! So impractical! It heats up VERY fast.</li>
            <li> Umm just so ya&#x27;ll know Walmart has the same one for 14.95. Glad i seen it cuz this is a total rip off!!!! http://www.walmart.com/ip/Remington-CI9538-Large-Pearl-Ceramic-Professional-Curling-Wand/17470843</li>
            <li> Even though I have long hair, I am not able to wrap hair around curling iron.  Do not like it at all.  Under sink....</li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to my lower back) and was originally nervous about getting the larger barrel, but it works great. The curls are lovely! I usually re-do them the next morning, but my hair is super fine and long so it&#x27;s to be expected! I&#x27;m very happy with the product. If you&#x27;re having trouble YouTube using a curling wand and you&#x27;ll be a pro in no time!!</li>
            <li> I use this product constantly!!!!!!! It&#x27;s so easy and fast! Absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Love this iron!  Works quickly!</li>
            <li> i give it four stars because the barrel is too wide/ big for my hair type but it works great</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with a Croc Straightener for my birthday present. This was exactly as stated it would be. There were no frills with packaging, which was perfectly fine. My glove came with it, and it was perfect as well. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit, as I have bigger hands, but it fits...like a glove (haha)! It stretches so it would fit multiple sizes. I have only tried this once, as I have been straightening my hair, but it was great! Just make sure to use the glove!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this i actually have a twitter reviewing beauty products, its @beautyreviews10 . anyways i recommended this product to my followers! beautiful curls, more like waves but im sure i just have to get the hang of it to make curls! so many styles of waves/curls you can do with it. it leaves a shiny finish to your hair and i didnt even use hair spray and almost 10 hours later i still have wave. ive even been laying on it for hours while on my laptop. i highly recommend. one of the best hair stylers i have ever used. and trust me, i have used ALOT! although mine sis not come in its original packaging. i suspect its not new but i wiped it down with disinfectant and im sure its fine. love!DOES NOT COME WITH THE HEAT PROTECTANT GLOVE THOUGH. i was alittle disapointed about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve missed that this is an product that works in USA. But i&#x27;ve solved it with a converter. My doughter loves this product.</li>
            <li> it is hard to hold my hair in place without burning myself.  I guess if this is not your first time using this, you might like it.</li>
            <li> It was EVERYTHING i expected it to be! Perfect  present for young girls. It heats up in a minute. I suggest buying Hair heat repellent !</li>
            <li> I loved the smaller barrel wand so much that I ordered the larger one as well - these curling wands are amazing. I have long, thin hair which curls relatively easily. The small wand creates perfect, flawless, tight curls within seconds ... I only have to hold the hair for 5-10 seconds in order to create the curl. The larger wand creates beautiful waves and creates volume. I have bought this curling wand for gifts as well, since it worked so great on my hair, and the receivers loved it as well. Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a curling wand that gives pretty beachy curls and this wand gives me the most perfect curl that I&#x27;ve been wanting! I almost bought the conair wand, but I heard the Remington was better and it has not disappointed. The 1-1 1/2 inch curls are really beautiful and it gives me a good mix of having casual looking curls. The wand came with a full glove and the wand is easy to use. I love this curling wand and I can&#x27;t stop using it because I love the curls it gives my hair!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes great soft curls. It has a learning curve but it isn&#x27;t difficult once you try it a few times.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase! My hair is fine and it does great curls. Very affordable. Easy to use. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!!!!!  I get the perfect curl every time. I&#x27;m very happy I saw this on youtube I won&#x27;t go back to a reagular curling iron ever again!</li>
            <li> This product is everything I expected. I am so pleased! It takes a couple times to get the hang of working with the wand, but now I&#x27;m a pro! Also, it comes with a heat protectant glove so u don&#x27;t burn yourself. It heats up and cools down in no time. I love the curls it produces, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love this curing iron. I have no patience to put on the glove every time, although I have burned my finger times a few times hehe. It gives you the nice loose curls instead of those ugly tight ones. I literally do my whole head of hair in 15 mins. I would recommend this item for that like loose curly look!</li>
            <li> I already fell in love with the smaller size to this...and the temperature setting is nice... Love the digital dial and the temperature lock feature... It allows you to focus more on your styling than readjusting your iron...but the Cyprus from this larger sized iron is different from the other size...I recommend trying both sizes...the prices on them are great, and they look pretty in pink.</li>
            <li> The Remington curling wand is a great curling wand once you get used to its difference from curling iron.  Unfortunately the quick heating and high heat element are not just a positive point but also an easy way for the untrained hand to get burned.  Once you get used to using the wand it provides a quick and easy way to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Positive Points: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quick heating&lt;br /&gt;- Digital control with LCD temperature readout make it easy to know how hot it is&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a glove that lets you touch your hot hair as you curl it (though not the wand element).&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Negative Points: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to get burned if you are not careful&lt;br /&gt;- Included glove does not protect your hand from the heating element of the wand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This is a great product that makes it easy to curl your hair.  Just be careful to prevent burns until you are used to using it.</li>
            <li> There are several issues with this curler that make me want to send it back.  1.  the glove that comes with it is not very helpful at protecting your hand from the heat.  If you have fine or thin hair and you wrap your hair around the  barrel you can  burn your hand pretty quick .. which makes you let go.. which leaves loose or ill-formed curls.  2.  You can not put it down once you turn it on because the stands are about a quarter inch.  Unless I have a glass or other heat-proof surface I can not  set this down and I am not  cool with letting it dangle anywhere by the cord.  3.  Design flaw... this really needs something to catch the hair to be able to curl it the right way.  With the glove  not being a huge help there really is no way to hold your hair against the barrel to get curled.  I don&#x27;t know who the heck thought of this design.  It SOUNDS like a good idea but not if you cant hold the hair place long enough to.. you know.. CURL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some items that I feel are good and spared this review a 1 star.  The size of the barrel is great and the fact that you can  turn the thing on and off without having to unplug it are  good too.  Also I like the digital temperature readout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over it this product needs a lot of work.  Either that or I need to look into how to better use this curler.  So far Im not impressed and rather disapointed, actually.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The iron worked as well as an expensive salon iron and it was easy to use. Great value. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is amazing! Love how my curls look and how long they hold all day! It heats up really fast and the pink is so lovely. Love this product and I would definitely recommend this to my girls !</li>
            <li> When I got this the reason I wanted it is because I have extension and they usually don&#x27;t hold a curl very well and I wanted to keep the beach wave look since I hurt my neck I was about to flat iron my hair as much so I wanted something that I could do once and it last me a few days. This did it, it hold my curl and keeps the beach wave look for days. It gets pretty hot and I go so fast I usually try to keep the heat level some where in the middle so I don&#x27;t burn my self as easily but I love it. I use to have a 1/2 in but the 1in is so much better it gives such a fuller look. And the price was really reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! It took some getting used to but I&#x27;ll never go back to an iron with a clamp. It works best for long hair and flowing waves, as opposed to tight curls. It gets extremely hot. I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and it is still working just as well as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> We did not open this package because my daughter had already received a similar  wand prior to opening this gift and there was no need to have two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been itching to get a curling wand for a while but I&#x27;ve been on the fence about which brand to buy. Anyway, I tried this wand out as soon as it came in and I love it!! The only con is the glove. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough protection from the high heat. But overall who cares, this wand leaves me with beautiful long-lasting waves. Just watch your fingers!!</li>
            <li> I have the smaller wand but I didn&#x27;t want bouncy curls, so I purchased this larger one and I really do like it.  My curls are much bigger... more like waves and I like that.  They really don&#x27;t stay throughout the entire day, but long enough for me to look good.  My hair is also really long, to my waist so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, but so far I like...  And for the newbies to wand use, I hated the glove, it made it harder to handle my hair.  But as experienced as I am in doing my own hair for years with a wand, I still inevitably burn myself every once in a while... it just happens.  But if you practice a bit with wrapping your hair around it and get a feel for it (before you heat it up), then you&#x27;ll have more success at not burning the bleep out of your fingers ;)</li>
            <li> This tool provides nice waves for my very straight and fine hair. The glove is a MUST because you do tend to slip and touch the rod and it is extremely hot.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist who spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a good wand that would put curls that would hold in the sleekest of hair. None of the professional brands were getting it done. Then one of my girls&#x27; schoolmates had beautiful curls in her pin straight hair and told me they were 2nd day curls! She said she used a Remington waver so I bought one immediately and have been nothing but happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t curl the way some other wands I own do.</li>
            <li> It was given to my daughter as a gift for Christmas.  So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> Good wand.heats up fast comes with a glove very safe and cute if u like Victoria secret model curls this is what u get OK ,  y&#x27;all don&#x27;t hear me, Yasssss I love it Fabulous curl that last all day even to the morning</li>
            <li> Good product, low price. I find it much easier and quicker to style my (long and thick) hair with this clampless curling wand rather than the one I had previously with the clamp. Curls turn out smooth and even. I have multiple styling tools from Remington and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible at curling my hair. Awful, awful. I usually end up burning my hair, fingers, forehead, ears, etc. I was tired of using the curling irons where you clip your hair inside the barrel (no clue how to better explain that), so I thought I would try out this one. It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first, but I quickly got the hang of it after watching several YouTube videos. The good thing is, you don&#x27;t end up with a crimp in your hair from clipping it on the barrel. You end up with pretty big, natural looking waves - even with my stick straight hair. I just used tons of hair spray both before and after curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons - if you&#x27;re less coordinated (like I am), you&#x27;re most likely gonna burn your fingers while you try to figure this out. I tried using the glove, but found it too difficult to use while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - would recommend, but watch your fingers. And watch lots of YouTube videos!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling wand. I have thick, naturally wavy/frizzy hair. With this wand, I can let my hair air dry into a frizzy mess, and twenty minutes later I can have perfect curls a la Kate Beckett from Castle. Highly recommended. (But wear the glove or fingers beware!)</li>
            <li> Amazing. Received it a few days ago and used some hour or so ago. I consider this my first real curler, since the one I had before is now so old, I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I used it and the result was, if not awful, then something passable at best . This though, this is beyond amazing! As I said, I haven&#x27;t used a curler for a veeery long time, and I lack every practice possible, but with this, even on the first try, my hair looks fabulous. I have thin hair, that don&#x27;t take good to styling, it&#x27;s very hard to do anything with them. This wand did the job! And I imagine with each next time it will only look more beautiful! So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with curling my hair before I purchased this wand, it&#x27;s truly amazing!!! I have fairly fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold hairstyles well and even when I got my hair done professionally for prom years ago, the style didn&#x27;t hold for more than 2 hours. This wand is great because it comes with a glove that protects your hand while your styling your hair, I use it every time. The wand heats up quickly too which is a huge plus, and it has adjustable heat settings. When I curl my hair using this wand, the curls last for at least 24 hours, usually even more than that. I do spray my hair with dry shampoo before I use the wand so that the curl holds more, but this wand is better than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I get compliments on my hair every time I use this product to curl it, and that’s saying something because I’m a bit hair-styling challenged ;) I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product. It arrived promptly as expected. As far as holding my hair, idk. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but after an hour or two of being outside my hair completely drops.. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I cannot unfairly rate this, it could be me and it does give me big beautiful loose curls after I&#x27;m done styling.. Maybe someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, Im not very good with hair so its a little hard to use without the clip but works great, glove is good too.</li>
            <li> This is more of a wave... It is really large. It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Works great was able to finish my look in 15-20 minutes . Recommend any one to purchase this iron is. Great,</li>
            <li> This wand is really for long hair and it heats up nice and hot but it will burn ur scalp if you are not careful. I have wavy hair thats past my shoulders and used it once, without any lasting results. I wasn&#x27;t impressed and ended up buying a smaller one.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls! My hair is naturally curly and goes into small tight curls that get frizzy when exposed to outside. Love this iron because it lessens them and makes them hold outside better.</li>
            <li> I also have the smaller version of this and got the larger to create more of a wave vs a curl look. I have very straight hair that does not take well to any attempts to make it do otherwise. The Remington Pearl curlers are the best though and actually provide lasting texture to my ever straight locks. I set it at the 374 option for fear of burning and it&#x27;s perfect. The glove is a must, that iron is a scorcher!</li>
            <li> It looks kinda cheap, but it heats up quickly and it does its job.</li>
            <li> The lack of a clip made it almost impossible to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite curling product so far!</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for me. You should be skillful in using this item else you will burn your skin like I did :(</li>
            <li> I love this thing, and i now love my hair even more</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!! Creates amazing waves in my hair!!!</li>
            <li> i love it, makes it so much easier to curl hair...although the on/temp buttons are in the way, you try to manipulate the handle and sometimes press the buttons by mistake....</li>
            <li> We bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter and she loves it. Appears to achieve all that she needs it too and the results look good.</li>
            <li> Works great! Heats up very quickly and is so easy to use. I have never really been able to curl my hair with a regular curling iron but this worked very well.</li>
            <li> IItem didn&#x27;t come very mad and all I wanted to do is try it and it didn&#x27;t come really unfair do not buy</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up quickly and sets the wave in my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> The larger barrel and high temperature scale of this curling wand make it the best value for the price that I have found!</li>
            <li> Best curlers I have ever used. They curl your hair really well and the curl stays in tact all night!!</li>
            <li> I had to get use to it, got a nasty burn on my forehead the first time I tried it but it works really well to make beautiful wavy curls or spirals. I like it and the great thing is it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to to use but it curls very well and allows different types of waves and curl that most traditional curlers don&#x27;t. Definitely use the glove!</li>
            <li> i like it but the curls doesnt last too much time or maybe it is because my girls have a really long hair</li>
            <li> Well, it took me awhile to get the hang of using this, but after I finally did I could never go back to a regular curing iron! Anytime I have tried to curl even one section without the glove that came with the wand I have ended up with burned fingers, so I am careful to always use the glove now! I have long, thick, naturally wavy hair that typically takes 30-40 minutes to curl. I can do a quick curling job with this curling want in about 5-10 minutes. If I want my hair to look really great it will still take at least 30 minutes, but it holds the curls way better than a curling iron and looks great the next day even! As the day goes on the curls somehow look better than when I just finished styling my hair! This thing is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Perfect! I had to buy another one because I killed mine in China with the voltage being much higher than here. Anyways, this wand works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this iron! Makes beautiful beach waves! You can make different tightnesses with this iron and you don&#x27;t have to hold it on very long because it heats up so quickly!</li>
            <li> Works great, curls well.  But make sure to adjust your  heat settings as the wand can get very hot and damage your hair!</li>
            <li> Great product overall! Not in original boxing, but that&#x27;s alright!! Works great, high heat holds the curls! Great quality for low price</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; holds curl well. I like the larger iron because I have long hair &amp; it gives me a wavy look instead of the tighter curls from the smaller wands. This is a great value. Delivered very quickly thanks to Amazon prime.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the large hole that was in my thermal glove.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had picked out another color when we were Christmas shopping. I ordered this one online &amp; she liked it even more. Her hair looks adorable :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get used to curling, but it curls faster and cuter than the old style curling iron. Yes, the gloves aren&#x27;t completely heat proof, but then you wouldn&#x27;t have the necessary dexterity. Since it only comes with one glove, I bought 2 barrel sizes, and put both gloves on when I curl.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a year ago and use it a couple times a week.  It heats up quickly and creates great curls. Wen I first started using the product I burned myself quite a few times, because I wasn&#x27;t used to wrapping hair around a barrel, I was used to clamping hair to a barrel and rolling, like you do with a regular curling iron; once I got the hang of it though, I started to really like the way these curls came out, more so than the regular curling iron look I was used to.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it. Great gift for a teenager. Fast shipment and product as described</li>
            <li> Being used to a Chi, it&#x27;s annoying to wait 5 minutes for this iron to be at an effective temperature. However, besides that, this works decently well. I notice that my curls don&#x27;t hold very long, but that might be for lack of product- I&#x27;m not sure. You definitely need the glove that comes with this, so hang on to it. I would recommend this product for an amateur, seldom-hair-styling girl like me, but not for a fashion queen that likes to do her hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is decent. It&#x27;s good for the price, but I&#x27;m not in love with it. I do like the fact that it came with a heat resistant glove though!</li>
            <li> Works great, stays hot!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my grandaughter wanted. Works great on her long hair. She gets just the curls she loves and uses it most every day</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! Very pleased! Cam in time for Christmas too so was very happy about that and loved the price!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair and so I thought that this would be perfect, but the barrel is too large and it is hard to get really nice curls. I think that if they have a smaller barrel version, you&#x27;d be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand! I have long, thick hair and it curls it perfectly. I never use the glove, but you might want to the first couple of uses because it does take some getting used to. Can&#x27;t beat this product and it&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> I gave a Remington Ceramic Curling Iron to my future daughter-in-law as one of her Christmas gifts.  Julie said she loves the curling iron since it curls her hair quickly without burning the hair strands.</li>
            <li> I use the large one for everyday use going to work and if I want super curls, the small one is great. Took a couple of tries getting use to without burning myself but am fine now and don&#x27;t use the glove. I don&#x27;t know if i will ever use a regular curling iron as i like the shape these make better. wish the iron was a little longer to spread out the curls but its fine (my hair is about 2.5 inches past my shoulders). Also, i tend to hit the temperature buttons a lot when curling but it only changes it by one and not every time but for that reason, I am dropping it to 4 stars. definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> JUST SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS SO AWESOME FOR LOOSE CURLS.....I USE IT ALMOST EVERYDAY FOR SCHOOL.. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Purchased this after my stylist used it on my hair. I have human hair extensions and the Remington styler made my fake (and real) hair look fabulous! The curls stayed put all day, even after I brushed my hair throughout the day and were still there the next morning when I woke up. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakage (used to have an Instyler and that caused breakage of my hair) and I use it at the 356 degree setting. I highly recommend getting it, especially for the price, compared to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the curler. It is definitely suited better with long hair compared to medium or short hair since this is 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love my smaller clipless curling iron, so I was excited to find this larger sized one. It works great. Two suggestions: 1) the stand isn&#x27;t very stable. It tends to lean forward and burn my plastic tray I keep it on. 2) the glove is absolutely useless. Ditch the glove and just be extra careful, or buy a glove that would protect you from an actual burn.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to the way it works but the varying temperature control and shape make my hair look great when I curl it.  I don&#x27;t use it much but am pleased with my purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works so well!!!</li>
            <li> Works well but requires small strands of hair in order for them to form and  keep the curls so it takes time. I have wavy, shoulder length hair and it takes me around 50mins.&lt;br /&gt;But the result is great.</li>
            <li> I tried using this curling wand four times, each unsuccessful. The barrel was too large, even though I have long hair and was looking for loose curls. When I tried wrapping my hair around the barrel, my hair naturally twisted. Which made the curls end up kinky and weird. Basically you have to keep the hair section completely flat. Easier said than done. I even watched YouTube videos instructing how to use but it still didn&#x27;t come out right. The box was also smashed up on one side. I contacted the seller, to which they never replied. I wish I could have returned this product.</li>
            <li> This review is for the larger 1-1 1/2 inch wand. I&#x27;m beyond thrilled with this curling wand!! Finally my curls last all day and even into the next day with little or no hairspray. There&#x27;s definitely a bit of a learning curve involved if you aren&#x27;t used to a wand (I had always used one with a clamp) but I became a pro after using it once or twice. This makes curling my long hair a breeze, and I love the look of the curls I get from the larger barrel. Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It worked for a couple of minutes and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> I wanted an affordable and great curling wand for the beach waves look. This styling tool has exceeded my expectations. Don&#x27;t bother over-spending on a expensive name brand. This curling want will fulfill your needs for beautiful wavy hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it but my daughter did so she now has it.</li>
            <li> I love this little curling iron. I have long hair that reaches to the middle of my back; this always give me effortless beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Before I got this curler I did some research!  And I even went on youtube and saw different people use it with all the same results! Beautiful curlers! So I got it and just like I expected perfict curls that lasts. I love that its digital and light wight. You don&#x27;t want any hair tool that is havy, hair dryer, iron or curler. You want professional and light wight! I highly recommend this curler!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product just have to get used to the wand. It is a very slippery barrel. I got to 1-1 1/2 barrel and it makes beutiful curls and am definitely  going to buy the smaller barrel!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, this wand works great. The trick is to point it downward. Also good bang for your buck. I had wanted to try out a cheaper version first before I decided if I needed a pricier one, however I am just going to stick to this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the glove that comes with it does not offer much protection from the heat. I would buy a different glove.</li>
            <li> I love this wand! Once you practice with it, one can really create beautiful loose beach waves. Fast shipping was also a huge plus!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner, and was everything I expected.  It was a gift and well received by the Product recipient.</li>
            <li> I like remington. The box was with some defects.&lt;br /&gt;But I think it was the transportation defects.</li>
            <li> 😍😍😍😍 the work amazing love this product A+++++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with straight, flat hair and I curl my hair a LOT. Before this, I&#x27;ve always used my Hot Tools iron without the clamp so switching to the wand was a piece of cake--basically the same thing. It gets the job done well and it&#x27;s the prettiest shade of baby pink... hehe. Light weight is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to many of the reviews, my curls do NOT stay overnight but I already knew this... With a not so great iron or no hairspray, my hair can easily fall from voluminous curls to completely flat. I&#x27;m sure this completely depends on the behavior of your hair as well as the tightness of the curls, so don&#x27;t expect that to work for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* PRACTICE with the heat off! You need some time to get the hang of it if you&#x27;re new&lt;br /&gt;* Section off your hair in 3-5 layers, dependent on how long/thick your hair is--not only does this help organize the style, it also helps build volume! I twist my hair and clip it on top of my head&lt;br /&gt;* Work from back to front in each half section (left &amp; right side) so your finished curls aren&#x27;t blocking view of your uncurled hair&lt;br /&gt;* Hairspraying after each half section works best for holding my hair&lt;br /&gt;* Hair slips off? I hold the wand upside down (tapered end down) at a slight angle, more towards horizontal. I use the same hand for my entire head&lt;br /&gt;* You can hold the (-) button until a lock icon shows up so it&#x27;s ok to accidentally press buttons while you hold the wand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewers who left a poor rating and complained that it burned your skin... did you expect a hot iron NOT to burn you if you touched it? Any working hot styling appliance will do the same to you. Come on, now!</li>
            <li> This curling wand seemed good quality and did the job, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have fine, HEAVY hair and within an hour of styling the waves drooped and lost their shape.  I don&#x27;t like using product in my hair, and I think I needed to it in order to keep the curls in my hair type, so I ended up returning this item and getting a haircut instead.</li>
            <li> Love it. The best one I ever bought. My hair looks natural, it is already curly but with the Remington curl it take the frizz out of your hair specially if you color your hair. Your hair looks natural, not overdone and it just takes no more than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> very good value for the money,.&lt;br /&gt;much cheaper than retail&lt;br /&gt;daughter loves it</li>
            <li> This is first curling iron I&#x27;ve used that gives my hair long lasting curls! Normally my hair goes flat within an hour. I love that you can change the heat and that it heats up so fast!</li>
            <li> I love this. It gave me perfect bouncy loose curls in about 30 minutes. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking to improve my hair style, I mean, what girl isn&#x27;t? This wand was a little difficult to use, only because I&#x27;ve never used a wand before. Once I got the hang of this, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> This gets 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do. No problems, strong 2-day long curls, super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand, it curls my hair the way I like and it&#x27;s easy to use. Comes with a glove that is very important, I would burn myself without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from my big beachy waves I&#x27;ve created. Just spritz a little bit of sea salt spray and bam! Fab!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!! I have never curled my hair on my own before, but this was surprisingly easy to use. My only complaint is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the little crevice where the actual wand and the handle connect but it&#x27;s no big deal. I think with a little practice I can prevent that from happening. Here are a couple pictures of how my hair turned out. Again, this was my very first time handeling any sort of hair curler but I think it turned out pretty nice! I also included a comparison picture of my natural straight hair vs my curled hair. Overall awesome product :)</li>
            <li> I have to give this product a 1-star, because while the curling iron itself is great, the glove that comes with it is nothing more than a little knit mitten. It DOES NOT protect your hand, at all. I know Remington makes a glove (it&#x27;s on their website) that is heat resistant, but that is not what&#x27;s included with this curling iron. I will keep the curling iron, because I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of returning it; but I&#x27;ll have to go out and buy a glove that actually protects my hand. What a pain.</li>
            <li> after watching a few youtube tutorials on curling wands i decided to order this one paired with great amazon reviews. its been wonderful. my hair has never held a curl with a curling iron, but with this my curls last. also when they get &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34; they still look great, where as with a  curling iron they would look awkward. this gives a nice soft curl when they start to fall loose.</li>
            <li> for the price, it really doesn&#x27;t get better than this!! it heats up super fast, and the swivel cord is a great feature to keep it from getting tangled while you curl.</li>
            <li> This product took a lot of time to get a feel for and learn how to use but once I had experience, I got great curls and was able to do my whole head very quickly. Up until now, I had only used a blow dryer as far as heat tools but now I use this to curl my hair regularly since the result is totally worth the time and effort. I have extremely long hair so this barrel size works great to get nice loose curls in my hair and the tapered barrel makes them look really natural and nice. The price was also great compared to other products of similar quality. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so love love the way the curls stay the wand is just perfect and recommend for others to purchase very affordable</li>
            <li> First off let me say that the iron works very well. It gets hot quickly and is easy to use. I haven&#x27;t read many other review that mention the major issue I have with this product - there is a little know on the end of the barrel that my hair gets caught on and ruins all the curling I just did. The knob is made so that when you place the iron on a surface the hot part stays off that surface. Fine enough, usually you see a metal wire that does the same thing near the base of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is straight and takes a lot to make it curl. I&#x27;ve had great success with other wands like this, but I was looking for a larger barrel. When I curl my hair I have to slide my hair off the barrel, keeping the curl shape intact so it can cool in ringlet form. However when I try to slide the barrel out with this iron my hair gets completely stuck and tangled on the little knob at the end, rendering the curl useless. I end up ruining the curl from trying to get my hair out of the knob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can curl your hair and then unwrap from the barrel with no issue, this is a great tool. If, like me, you need to slide your hair off the keep a curl, DO NOT get this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love wand curling irons and this made big loose curls. My hair looks great after it&#x27;s done!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she also reviewed it. It is very difficult for her to use. It does get very hot and the very cheap and light weight glove does not protect your hand from burns. It appears as though this would be good for someone to use on someone else&#x27;s hair but is difficult to use yourself. My wife has always used the curling iron that has a clip attached adjacent to the barrel that you press, place your hair into, release the lever and wrap your hair around by turning. That type keeps your hair in place, not your hand holding a very hot barrel. Bottom line, it is difficult for her to use. There are a lot of good reviews. It appears to be well made just difficult to use without burning yourself. My wife would recommend something that holds your hair in place other than your hand.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a wand before, it&#x27;s a little odd getting used to it to begin with.  I prepped by watching a few videos, but I think it&#x27;s somehow easier to burn yourself if you&#x27;re not reallyyyyy paying attention.  With that said, it came with a little hair oil bottle, a glove (which I&#x27;ve used once but it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver with) and a cute case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand REALLY curls my hair, and I have naturally stick straight silky hair that never holds a curl.  I don&#x27;t even use gel or hairspray, and the curls last for about 4-6 hours before drooping a little, but the curls stayed until I washed my hair again!  Once you get the technique down, it&#x27;s easy to get the cute barrel curls that are gorgeous with long hair.</li>
            <li> I had first purchased the 1/2 to 1 inch wand and I fell completely in love with it, that is why I recently bought the 1 1/2 inch wand. I have really straight, long, and thick hair and everytime that I would curl my hair with any other curling iron by the time that I was completely finish my hair would began to turn straight once again. I love how I can easily curl my hair and spray a little bit of hairspray and my curls or waves will stay. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It might just be me but I have been curling my hair for years and could not use this one without burning myself.</li>
            <li> its alright, nothing special. does get very hot. the glove doesnt do much. has lasted and didnt short out. impressed but only as an average curler.</li>
            <li> I kinda wish that the barrel was lined with a velvet type of material to get the intended look. The barrel is so slick that when you wrap your hair around it, all your hair slides to the bottom (thin/narrow side of the barrel). Dont get me wrong, I can work with it, but I can see how others may find it frustrating. The barrel gets EXTREMELY hot which is a great option for those with thick/long hair. You can control the heat settings with a push of a button which is convenient to see in the LED viewer on the handle.</li>
            <li> Love it...works fantastic...from small curls to beach waves, this wand will do the trick! Thumbs up..you won&#x27;t regret this purchase..</li>
            <li> I did not like this curling iron&lt;br /&gt;I realized I need one with a clamp&lt;br /&gt;May work well for someone who has more time and easier hair to style</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well and does not damage my hair, but I haven&#x27;t had a brand name curling iron like Chi or NuMe so I can&#x27;t compare this with the pricier ones. It does give me nicely sized curls (I have medium-long length hair) and I am pretty much always pleased with the results. It did take some practice to get the hang of using it though, and I feel like the curls do not stay in for as long as I want them to. Otherwise, great product - especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the straight barrel. The slight cone shape makes it difficult for me to do my hair properly (holding the fatter end closer to my skull) without my hair falling off of the end. I have give it about two months of practice before writing this review. I wish I had bought the straight barrel version that is one width all the way down the shaft. Otherwise, this product would do a great job, it&#x27;s just difficult to use.  I might get rid of this version and buy the straight barrel version from the same brand.</li>
            <li> I like this wand! I actually bought the smaller one first! This one is good for loose curls!</li>
            <li> Love it and the curl stays in my stick straight hair all day! It gets very hot so wear the glove!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t curl my hair with a normal curling iron to save my life.  This curling wand changed my life.  I can now get nice curls always when using this.  I like how hot it gets and you can lock it on that temperature so you don&#x27;t accidentally change it. I would buy it again in a heart beat!</li>
            <li> I guess I could not get the hang of this. Prefer a curling iron with the clamp on it!</li>
            <li> This product does magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got mine today and it works like magic. Love love love it! Love my curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this curling wand a lot. I got the 1-1.5 inch option because I like the beachy wave or large curl effect. Before purchasing, I was using a regular 1-inch curling iron and wrapping the hair around the outside, so the technique of not having a clamp was not difficult to get used to in my case, but it could throw some people off a bit. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the included glove much, but it&#x27;s nice to have in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the slight increase in curl size variety this wand offers over a traditional curling iron or a wand that is all one width. It gets very hot for very fast curling with a lot of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main negative aspect of this product for me is that the barrel of the wand is quite slick, so sometimes the hair slips down to the narrower end while it&#x27;s wrapped around the barrel. I have seen some more expensive models that have a textured barrel to prevent this from occurring. However, for the price, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m willing to put up with and I can prevent the slipping if I adjust the position or hold I have on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend. *Make sure you get the right size option to fit your needs! The smaller wand was ordered for me by mistake, and it appears to create much smaller, tighter curls.</li>
            <li> Works great! The waves/curls produced are gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though! It is VERY easy to burn yourself until you get accustomed to this tool.</li>
            <li> This curling iron will take a few tries to get used to, but it produces great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse hair and so crank this up to the highest temperature.  Even there, I have had no issues with burns because of the included heat-resistant glove.</li>
            <li> This is not for everyone. My wife cannot get her hair to curl to her satisfaction with this type of item. We think it&#x27;s because of her short hair.</li>
            <li> Great item!! Even though it was not in its original box, it was brand new and works great! I love mine!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls. This curling iron works well and with a little hairspray the curls stay in. Temperature is adequate and the surface on the iron is smooth. The only thing I would say is not up to quality is the heat resistant glove. It is very thin and the heat gets through.</li>
            <li> I use this often and finally have the hang of it, but watch out - this thing gets so hot!  This comes with a glove for your hand, but not your face!  I burned myself on the forehead the second time I used it, and it left a mark for weeks.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very good product.  Heats up fast, and makes nice beach curls.</li>
            <li> This is best for super long hair. I have shoulder length hair, and it did not work well. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> The curls only last for a while!</li>
            <li> I must be missing something.  Amazon reviews never steer me wrong.  This curling iron was horrible for me.  I guess my hair is too thin but I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in place as I wrapped it around.  In the process, I got a huge burn on my ear.  I actually threw it in the garbage after finally giving up.  Such a disappointment.  I thought sure that there must be some technique I was missing, but no matter what I tried, it didn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best curler wand I have ever owned! It does the job like more expensive name brands does but for a cheaper price! I have yet to have a problem and it came on a timely manner! This is the perfect wand for that loose but sexy curl that I always wanted (Kim k), so defiantly get it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a curling wand with a wider barrel for ages, this one had fantastic reviews so I ordered. However, as some of the other reviewers suggested, it&#x27;s really difficult to curl your hair barrel down with this without the hair sloping down, basically all my hair winds up at the tip of the barrel anyway so it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m curling with just a regular 1&#x27;&#x27; curler, which I already have. That being said, I&#x27;m just not a fan generally of the tapered design, but it is a sleek wand, easy to read display, heats up super quickly, and was otherwise a fine wand if you don&#x27;t mind the design.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! The handling took a little getting used to but worked great! Really Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand this product.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything technically wrong with it... just strange.  Can&#x27;t figure it out</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong size I intend to purchase the smaller, 1- 11/2 is a very large wand for regular curls purchase 1/2-1 . Heats up quickly, the glove barely protects fingers from burning while curling curl with caution. Use wrapping lotion or holding spray when making curls although the wand curls the hair it wont last on its own. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My best friend had this in a smaller size. When I first started using it, I was awful. Then once I got the hang of it it turned out so much more easier and quicker then your standard curling iron. So I went and bought the bigger size (this) because my hair is shorter and I wanted bigger curls. I love it! It came so quickly. I literarily took it out of the box and used it. If your new to the &#x27;wand&#x27; i recommend you use the glove- I&#x27;ve burned myself multiple times while learning. For new &#x27;wand&#x27; users too, I recommend you tubing a &#x27;how to&#x27; (because it&#x27;s hard to explain how to use it through words.) But that&#x27;s how I learned. Now I use the wand almost everyday- It&#x27;s easier then the blowing out your hair and curling/straightening. It&#x27;s addicting. You need to be careful though it heats up to like 400 degrees... so you will get burned. I also recommend this over conair or any other products. I&#x27;ve had serious issues with other products in the past. THIS IS A DEF!!! If you want huge bouncy curls that can last up to almost 2 days, heavy hair or even the lightest- this is a GOOD product!</li>
            <li> The wand works amazing. It heats up quickly and the curls stay in. Many different ways to style your hair with this if held different. Must buy.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has NO CLAMP.  Which is probably fine for many of you, and perhaps obvious to most of you, but I like a clamp and it&#x27;s not blatantly obvious from the picture or the description that there is no clamp.  Plus, I do not like to feel like Michael Jackson donning one glove every time I want to curl my hair.  Unless the glove is covered in glitter.  Then I might reconsider.</li>
            <li> My wife likes that his curler provides high heat so you get strong curls that last. The coating on the wand provides a buffer so her hair does not burn as fast as on other curlers. The glove is a nice touch to protect your hands from being burned while handling hot hair but my wife only used the glove once because it seemed like it was more trouble than it was worth and not really needed. This has been my wife&#x27;s curler of choice since getting it so much so that her daughter borrowed it and will not give it back.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy way to get beautiful waves. Also shuts off automatically which is nice</li>
            <li> my hair stays curled!!! I do use styling lotion, which helps to protect from the heat of the iron.</li>
            <li> A bit slippery. Hair doesn&#x27;t stay on it when curling around the wand</li>
            <li> Works well. Good curls.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! It leaves my hair in voluminous big curls, if I sleep on them I get loose waves which are also very pretty. I get so many compliments and people ask me what I used to curl my hair. Also, Bethany Mota, a youtuber beauty guru who&#x27;s so sweet, has 7 million subscribers her own perfume, clothing line, bedroom line and will be appearing on dancing with the stars (or so I heard) has recommend this wand over and over. That&#x27;s what originally attracted me to it and I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and am please with my purchase but surprised that no mentioned how easy it is to accidentally change the heat settings while curling your hair. Seriously, it changes every time I hold the handle.  Should be you need to hold it for a couple seconds for it to make the change since the settings are right on the handle. Would get 5 stars otherwise</li>
            <li> this is great it comes in handy, the glove is great it really helps especially when you&#x27;re a beginner with the wand. over all its really good if you want bigger curls. it heats up fast and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that a Remington product would do the trick for my hair sense my hair is CRAZY. My hair is very wavy, puffy, and thick! I used youtube to look up how to use a wand and the results where amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive curling iron if you don&#x27;t have to! This iron works great and the price is just right!!</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s humid and hot..so when I tried it out..surprisingly it worked wonders for my hair. I have thick, curly coarse hair so I was kind of skeptical about it. However it does the job and with some hairspray your hair is beautiful! great item for a great price.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Las pueden usar la he comprado dos veces porque mi madre quiso la primera k compre..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I probably should have gotten the smaller size, but this one works great too! I love how quickly it heats up. Usually I have a hard time holding a curl, but now using this wand I hold my curls much better! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to do some soft looking wavy curls on my hair. But I have really fine straight hair. So not all hair curlers can do the job. I used it, it made nice soft wavy curls and and the curls stayed really good for 2 hours without any spray and then it started to loosen up and got messy, but hey messy beach look. I am sure with the right spray it will stay for hours and hours. I just wanted to see what happens without the spray. So very happy with the purchase. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I love this wand and have recommended it to a lot of friends. Makes the best curls I&#x27;ve ever been able to make in my hair and they last longer and look more natural than with a regular curling iron. It also takes way less time to curl my hair with this too! Heats up quickly and stays hot. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> My hair slips right off the tapered barrel and when I do get it to stay on I have to hold my hair in place forever to get the slightest curl.</li>
            <li> Came in on time with not issues, my wife loves it, thanks. Leaving 15 words is really dumb and stinky</li>
            <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  The glove definitely doesn&#x27;t protect against the heat of the iron completely and the curling bar still needs a clip on it to hold the hair in place no matter if you are using the small end or the larger mid section.  You do not have good results trying to hold the hair on the bar long enough to get a good curl as your hand begins to get to hot. Just a very bad product overall... not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget the glove and follow directions.  Works great and puts a great curl in your hair.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and does not burn my hair. easy styling</li>
            <li> I have owned both the small and now the fat version of this wand. This model is the BEST wand out there. Yes, it does take a while to get used to...but once you commit to learning how to do it without burning yourself, you will never use anyyyyyyythinggggg else for your hair. I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands of wands, and none produce curls like this bad boy! This thing curls hair within seconds, and literally with the right products, my curls hold for 3 days straight with little to no maintenance. When I purchased the small one first, five years ago, my hair was short and straight. Now, although my old one still works (holy cow!), I have also bought the fatter one now that my hair is down to my butt..for more voluptuous curls. Mind you, I had to hunt this thing down after buying 5 other wands that sucked hard core. When I finally found they made a fatter version of this one....I almost cried....but I cried more when they were all out of stock. Twice. Do yourself a favor and buy one....or one of each. And thank me later. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. I had the smaller version of this, but my hair is just too long. This actually gives my hair the loose beachy waves I&#x27;ve been trying to learn how to do. I just love it!</li>
            <li> it does the job but the curls don&#x27;t last too long &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> LOVE this curling wand! I lost my first one and just bought my second one. Couldn&#x27;t find another one that was as good as this one!</li>
            <li> this is a  very good curling wand gets very hot but the glove it comes with is just a little cheap glove that doesn&#x27;t really work that well but 5 stars for the wand</li>
            <li> Love the color. Makes big cute curls</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail about a week ago and I love it! I&#x27;ve only used it once but the results are AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair with a straightener, but I kept burning myself. I was stoked to find this curling wand at a great price! My curls stayed in all day without any hair spray. I did use some argan oil before styling and a salt spray after styling for texture and my curls stayed in all day. They do start to relax after 5 hours, but they don&#x27;t go completely straight.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to manuever but once you got that down, great tool, awersome large curls&amp;#62; Would greatly recommend product</li>
            <li> i was NEVER able to curl my hair before getting this wand. nothing held my curls together, but something about this did the magic. curls come out beautiful, although takes a couple of tries to get used to</li>
            <li> I love this wand! It gives me big waves which is what I wanted. The waves stay the entire day. It does get really hot so make sure you wear the glove that comes included. It has low to high heat settings so you can choose how hot you want it. But the hotter the faster you can style your hair. You can also lock it at the heat setting you like. Overall I really recommend this product especially if you want beach waves.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy thick fine slightly wavy shoulder length  hair. Curling irons have been a difficulty for me. My frizz always got ripped out in the clamp, I had to hold my hair in them forever to get any curl, they made my hair smell unpleasant, so I&#x27;ve been using rollers for years, but my curl falls out in a few hours. My hair has only become more difficult to manage since having a baby and losing a lot of my hair due to hormones. This iron is drastically different than anything I&#x27;ve tried so I bought it. LOVE! Heats up so fast, no wait. I wrapped my hair around it and counted to three got a beautifully sleek spiral. Slept on it and it stayed! That never happens. In love with this iron!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling wand. It heats up fast and makes beautiful, natural looking curls. Just be careful not to burn your self. I don&#x27;t like using the glove and I burned myself a few times a first, but once you get the hang of it you get better at it.</li>
            <li> I love the bigger barrel because you can curl thicker pieces of hair and it makes the process a lot faster. I also like how you can lock your temperature, sometimes I accidently hit the buttons but nothing happens because its locked. Overall this product gives a nice curl.</li>
            <li> product was labeled new but arrived with no packaging.</li>
            <li> Gives a beach wave-y look to my hair instead of curls.</li>
            <li> I personally dont like the clip and this works really well on my hair,never over-heated and I love they have the digital indicator.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because I wanted an alternative to my other Remington wand that creates a smaller curl. It works very well, gets very hot, and even my straight hair will hold the curl. I like that it creates a more natural-looking large curl. Once you get the hang of using a wand, it is very quick and easy to use. Just be careful not to burn yourself like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost daily for years and still works like a dream. Gives a very pretty and soft curl that will fall into a natural wave by the end of the day. It seems great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> The is my first time using one of these and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results. I have long thick hair and it only took about 15-20 minutes to make salon style waves in my hair. Got many compliments on my hair first time using this. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day since I got it. After I blow dry my hair, it takes 5 mins to give it some waves. I was worried that the barrel would too thin to give my hair big waves, but that wasn&#x27;t true. The digital thermometer showing the temperature is really easy to read and adjust up and down. It heats up really fast too. I bought one for my sister and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> Really great curling wand! I just wished I got a smaller one, just for the size of the curls, but it&#x27;s a really nice hair styling tool and I love how easy it is to use. It does come with the glove, but through time I realize that the glove gets in the way and you eventually get used to not using the glove.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! That is Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY ! I have long thin hair &amp; could never find a wand to curl my hair the way I wanted it always ended up with small tight curls &amp; this one just does the trick BIG CURLS just what I wanted ! I&#x27;m in love !! :)</li>
            <li> Using this curling iron is not as easy as you think. It definitely takes a lot longer since you can only use so much hair at a time. I also burned my fingers a couple of times. It does come with a glove but it ends up causing static when I used it. I&#x27;ll stick to my old fashioned curling iron.</li>
            <li> Perfect large loose curls and waves. Easy to do yet looks like salon styled. This is the only tool you will use.</li>
            <li> First time i used this my hair turned out great, and every time I&#x27;ve used it since I&#x27;ve gotten the same results.  Takes a few practices to figure out the different waves and curls you can get.  The glove is very handy, and you save a lot of money having them packaged together.</li>
            <li> I love the loose beautiful curls this makes, hate that it is tapered which makes it a challenge to keep your hair from sliding down the barrel, it makes you nearly run out of curling iron to wrap your hair. But it does make big beautiful curls when you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has this curler for about 3 months now and i still love it! it works very well and i prefer this larger wand over the smaller one of the same size. It heats up very fast and my curls stay all day. make sure you know how to use it before you try (watch tutorials) because it is very helpful!</li>
            <li> And I finally got it based on the reviews. If you know how to use it, it will work for you every time. Such lovely waves and I get compliment on what people think is my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; curl. I have curly hair, but this makes my curly hair fashionable. Also, here&#x27;s a hint: Don&#x27;t be afraid to let the hair twist as you circle it around the barrel. Letting it twist around makes such nice bouncy spirals similar to Taylor Swifts. use the 1 1/2 inch barrel if you want that style and want to do quicker hairstyles. If you use the larger barrel which I have, it takes a little more time and you need longer hair to do it with. Also, I found the larger barrel harder to use as the hair slides off easier. I like both and with long hair I know I will use both. Probably the large more in the winter and the smaller for HUMID weather. In humid weather, my naturally curly frizzy hair responds so well after being styled with the 1 1/2 inch barrel! It&#x27;s so fun!</li>
            <li> Ok, I watch many YouTube beauty/hair gurus &amp; they all have different hair tools of choice. Usually very expensive ones ( often given FREE for a &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; of the product!) . Well, I got new 22inch Remy hair extensions &amp; wanted a curling iron or wand to make the &amp;#34;curls, waves, etc everyone is doing now. I looked at a lot of them. Many way more expensive then this one, but this had great reviews. I received it the other day &amp; tried it out- HOLY MOTHER OF $&amp;&amp;$)!!! It gets HOT!!!! It goes up to 410 deg, other go to 450, I can&#x27;t see WHY anyone would need more heat than THIS??!! I burnt the cr&amp;p out of my finger ( not thinking that &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; needed the GLOVE!) , so it&#x27;s really HOT!! It took seconds to make a nice curl in my super long hair. The curls STAYED IN THE NEXT DAY AS WELL, even after sleeping on them!!  Heats up in a second too!  I really can&#x27;t see how the more expensive wands etc could be any better than THIS ONE! Your paying for the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; &amp; THIER advertising expense !  This is wonderful!! Digital button controls, which I had NO problems with touching or hitting them &amp; changing it or turning it of( u know?)  . The SWIVEL CORD is amazing!! I will never buy another hair tool without one now!!  It also cooled off pretty fast as well, which is a good thing if your in a rush &amp; don&#x27;t have one of those fancy curling iron /blow dryer holders &amp; I DON&#x27;T, lol.  I&#x27;m super pleased with this, would recommend to anyone looking for a wand! I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; , very easy to use &amp; the curls are fabulousness ( and no kink at the end from the clamp!)  I might use the GLOVE , to save my flesh but its not totally necessary , Just for shorter pieces really.  I write reviews for CUSTOMERS, not the &amp;#34;company&amp;#34;!!  With so many bogus, fake reviews now on here, I feel we &amp;#34;true consumers&amp;#34; owe it to ppl to write HONEST reviews!!  I REALLY love this &amp; wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if I didn&#x27;t... I use my REAL name etc.  hope this help someone save some $$. &amp; choose a good product.. Will update if I have any problems with it...  Jenn~someone save some $$. &amp; choose a good product.. Will update if I have any problems with it...  Jenn~</li>
            <li> It curls your hair in seconds good temp  ,a little too thin for my liking get the 1.5  better and wider curls</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand for big barrel curls. It takes a bit to get used to holding it the correct way to get your hair curled, but the result is nice. The included glove is fine, you wouldn&#x27;t want to hold the barrel with your hand, but you can use a couple fingers to hold hair in place if needed. My only issue is that when you&#x27;re holding the handle, your hands are right on the power and temperature buttons, and I frequently turn it off or change temperatures when I don&#x27;t mean to. So that&#x27;s somewhat aggravating. I also prefer the curling wands that aren&#x27;t tapered, but that&#x27;s a personal preference. I like my barrel curls uniform in size all around so I can tousle them but still have them stay more intact. This is a great wand if you are looking for the tapered barrel, though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my product was damaged during delivery so I had to return it.  Ended up buying the remington tstudio silk ceramic wand from wal mart instead.  Reviews said it was a almost as good as the pearl but a cheaper dupe for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll take some practice to get the hang of the curling wand but I did like the results with the first use.  I wish I was able to use to pearl one!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE using it! SO easy so handle, so light but very sturdy, it heats up in SECONDS! and the automatic shut off DOES works! so that is definitely a plus!  I love the pearly finish and the whole look of this want, and most importantly, it gets the job done WONDERFULLY! ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you guys who will buy this to take elsewhere, my country uses 220V and this wand was compatible with it too, so even if the manual does says 120v ONLY, it is actually a dual voltage tool apparently, so its wrongly labeled or something, but yeah. I bought both, the finer one and this one and they both work perfectly!  didn&#x27;t need adapters or voltage converters THANK GOD!  but just in case, always make sure to get a professional&#x27;s advice on it. You don&#x27;t wanna end up burning or messing up your wand!</li>
            <li> wish they would have told me there is no clip on it to hold the hair in place while curling. It is useless to me. I am not cordinated enough to wrap my long hair and hold it with a glove. The box got torn up some trying to open it so i am stuck with a 50.00 curler I cant use.</li>
            <li> Love this wand!! Got the bigger size and it produces big, voluminous curls. Order came quickly!</li>
            <li> I use this curling wand almost daily.  My hair is still shiny and healthy. I also have  a really expensive NuMe and I feel like the curls I get from the Remington wand last longer.  It&#x27;s very easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I must say though that the glove that is included isn&#x27;t the best quality.  I had to use a different one because the one that came with this wand still allows most of the heat through and that can be painful if not used properly.  Other than that, like I said, the wand is really good.</li>
            <li> Good product and Quality A+</li>
            <li> it is NOT a curling tong that you can use with one hand, you have to hold the hair in place with the other hand</li>
            <li> I have been using curling wand for 5 years, and never burn my hand/face before until trying this one.&lt;br /&gt;Returned.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have tried this wand on many of my friends and it works well on them- long hair, short hair, etc.  But for me?  No.  I am light-skinned and I have a very thick hair shaft.  Several &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34; have tried this on me with no avail.  I am happier using a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to make sure the thick-haired girls out there aren&#x27;t too disappointed!</li>
            <li> I received my package 3 days after placing my order and tried it out right away. This wand is amazing! I ordered the wand in the size 1&amp;#34;-1 1/2&amp;#34; because I wanted to get a looser curl, not tight ringlets like the smaller model gives you. I have very thick, very curly and very frizzy hair-no other curling iron has been able to curl my hair. Whenever I did try to curl my hair using a normal curling iron, it would take about 2 hours and a whole lot of hair spray for it to last for only 15 mins. after finishing curling it. This wand only takes about 25 mins to curl my whole head (that&#x27;s a record for me, since I have a head full of hair) and the end result looks A MILLION times better and the curls last all day and into the next day, only requiring some touch ups. The people giving this product a negative review, just don&#x27;t know how to use this product properly. It&#x27;s really no different than how you would use a curling iron, just without the clip, so the glove is useful when wrapping your hair around the wand. I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it ever since it came. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. I get the loose curls I&#x27;ve never been able to do, and they last all day. I definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gives long lasting curl. (It can get really really hot though... watch your fingers!) All in all, I like the bigger curl, wavy look and this does that for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this product quite a few months ago and I&#x27;m still in love with it! Curls hold up great and I love the barrel size since I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Im not very good at using it yet... It&#x27;ll come with time!</li>
            <li> I use this wand every week. It gets really hot and the digital temp display looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wave/curls look natural because of the taper and with a little hairspray, stay in my hair until I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total scorage!</li>
            <li> I definitely love Remington products.  I bought a flat iron first, i liked it and then I decided to buy this curling wand. I have no complaints. It&#x27;s everything as described. It heats up very quickly, curls superbly and eliminate frizz. Great product, I recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> This curl wand is amazing! It takes less than 2 minutes to heat. Could be even less time than that. And it&#x27;s very easy to use! I watched a couples of videos on Youtube on How to Curl with Curl Wands and BINGO! I was good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br /&gt;What they don&#x27;t tell you... CLIP each CURL in place with a Duck Bill Clip (Long Clips). Spray with a flexihold hairspray and remove clips once the hair has COOLED. If you are in a rush, take your blow dryer, set it to cool and blow dry then remove clips. your curls will last all day, if not for a couple.</li>
            <li> Works WAY better on my hair than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> Granted i had to watch an instructional youtube video posted by a teenage girl to figure out how to use this properly, but 5 minutes and two mild burns later i was off and running. It produces the most attractive and natural looking curl i have found, is super easy once you get the hang of it and is easy to maneuver quickly when you&#x27;re in a rush. Don&#x27;t use the weird two finger glove. It just complicates things. I have given 3 of these as gifts subsequently.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something for YEARS that will hold a curl in my hair. I had given up and was just about to cut all of my hair off when I came across this wand. I was reading the reviews and saw that a lot of people with thicker hair that never holds a curl were having success with this. I figured for the price, who cares if it works or not, it is worth a shot! Well, this is the BEST curling product I have ever come across. I can curl my hair on Monday and will still have curls on Wednesday! I wash my hair every other day and use dry shampoo on my non-wash days, and the curls still stay in, even after brushing them multiple times. This is probably my favorite product that I have purchased in the past 5 years, no kidding. If you are thinking about this, just spend the $20+ bucks and try it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The glove that comes with this product is key to not burning your fingers. The tool is not that hard to use (recommend watching a YouTube video for very easy instruction). Sometimes hair slips out when wrapping it, but in general it is not too hard to use. I love the beautiful curls this does without the &#x27;line&#x27; that a standard curling iron can have. My niece loves when I do her hair for party hair/special occasions! This definitely helps create the loose waves that are very popular now.  I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Heats up in seconds.  No complaints :)</li>
            <li> I purchased after reading great reviews. I am sure it works great but this gal could not figure out how to use it correctly . I had the hardest time wrapping my hair around the barrel because it kept slipping (it might be my hair). I used it one day &amp; saw my hair looking like Annie&#x27;s, too much bounce I felt like a child. The following attempt I redid my hair and when I got to my bangs adn i must have leaned on teh barrel &amp; burnt my wrist. I gave up on the machine after this &amp; went back to the original curling iron</li>
            <li> This product is well made, heats quickly and makes nice waves.  The largest part of the barrel has a very wide diameter for making waves not curls.  If you don&#x27;t have long hair, buy a wand with a smaller diameter.  I love this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Heat up fast.&lt;br /&gt;Glove is good size even for my big palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 4 stars because i simply dont know what to do with this after finishing using it. Its hot, i cant place it on any surface from the warning signs. Its indicated clearly that the gloves shouldnt be used to let the curler rest on.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first curler without any &#x27;clip&#x27;. The one i used to have, babybliss, has this hook whereby it can be turned to the front and the whole curler will rest on this metal portion on the table surface etc. For this curler, i have put it on my ironing board when its not as hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when i slowly let the hair drop and press them inside my palm, the heat get distributed and stay on inside the hair for a longer time, making the curls last longer to the next day (dont expect it to be still as curly but still see the curls). Be careful of the hair product used because unsuitable ones will cause the hairs to be heavy and eventually wear off the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you compare enzo milano, they have some edge at the end of the heated area for users to rest against the head. my ear is too big and i accidentally touched my ear with the curler while I am figuring out how to curl my hair :( so be careful if you have protruding ears</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with this at first, not as easy to use as you would think, but once I got the hang of it i love it and the curls are nice and full and they lasted all night on my super fine hair! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You can only use this wand if you live in the US or you have a voltage convertor, because this wand uses the 110 volt system here in The Netherlands we use 220 volt system. I need to by a huge convertor that cost twice the price of this wond and If I try to turn it on without it,  it will burn instantly. There´s nothing written in the advertisement, so I bought it and I haven´t been able to try it yet. :(</li>
            <li> If you saw videos on YouTube about this product and see how wonderful curls the girls get, remember is not that easy, you have to practice a lot with this. I use to get my hair curl with an turmaline iron but some time the curls are not the same size depend on how i get the iron and turn it to the left or right. With this is the same it depend on how you curl the hair around and how high or low you start.And the hot glove is a must it gets really really hot!</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this wand when I meant to buy the smaller size, but Amazon made the exchange incredibly quick and easy. I had the right sized curler in time for Christmas and they picked up the original one for me right at home! The 1\\&quot; works amazing too. Gorgeous curls after an easy exchange.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair look! It&#x27;s very easy to use! However, my product was defective from Day 1. First of all, the on/off button doesn&#x27;t work -- I have to plug it in/unplug it to turn it on or off. Yet, it turns off by itself when I&#x27;m doing my hair! I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;m not hitting the off button (which doesn&#x27;t work anyway), and it just shuts off while I&#x27;m using it. The product has an automatic shutoff feature after 30 minutes (which is great) but, mine turns off after being on for only a minute or two. I&#x27;ll wonder, &amp;#34;Why is my hair suddenly not curling?&amp;#34; and then I notice it&#x27;s turned off for the 5th time in 3 minutes. It&#x27;s done this from the first time I used it. So it&#x27;s pretty annoying to have to turn it on ten different times just to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord is pretty junky looking, and gets tangled very easily. The glove this thing comes with barely covers your hand, so it&#x27;s still very easy to burn your wrist -- I have tons of burn marks now, so make sure to buy a longer heat-resistant glove (and use it) if you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the curler -- it makes my hair look better than it ever has before. BUT, considering all the problems with the product, I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with long straight permed hair, but I crave a little wave.  I have a regular 1 inch curling iron, but can&#x27;t stand the clamp.  Therefore, I ordered this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the glove.  It is a must in my opinion.  Although, the glove is thin and cheaply made.  It gets the job done.  The iron takes a minute or two to warm up to 410, so don&#x27;t expect instant flaming heat.  I sectioned my hair off in four sections, starting from the back bottom.  At first, I was like wth!  Its not working.  All I was getting was limp curls!  Then, half way through two sections, I thought.  Hey, maybe if I hold the curl in my palm for a few seconds, after I release the curl from the wand.  Basically, to let the hair cool in my palm before releasing it.  Well, hello!  This was the ticket!  It worked!  I now was able to curl my thick, straight, chemically treated hair!  And, with relative ease!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention the pink part of the wand is ceramic and slippery.  So, sometimes getting your hair to stay on the wand in a vertical position is tricky.  This may take some getting used too, if you are a total newbie like me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron!!! I had purchased the same one about 4 years ago and used it almost every day. It finally died just recently (cord/wiring had frayed). When I found the same one on Amazon, I was a little surprised at the price - don&#x27;t think I paid that much for it the first time around, perhaps they stopped manufacturing this model? Regardless, I re-ordered because the iron is just THAT good. It gives me beautiful waves that I get complimented on all the time! I like the fact that it is a medium-sized barrel and the taper is not too drastic. I use the highest temperature setting and can create those perfectly-imperfect, jumbo curl/waves in a matter of minutes. Highly recommend this curling iron!!</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of the clamp curling irons, so the wand definitely fit what I was looking for. It took a bit of time to be able to get used to it, but now with enough practice, it&#x27;s quite effortless. I have thick, wavy hair that has terrible frizz most days. This helped make my waves look smooth and beautiful in less than 15 minutes. It heats up pretty quickly and having the glove is very useful. Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever be prepared to not use the glove because accidents happen and they will hurt like heck.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is of the glove. otherwise it heats up super fast and curls hair perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it would have been nice to have had a thicker or more resilient glove, the one that came with it is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t do much to protect your hand from hurtng/burning while you hold your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I learned how to curl my hair using this; its so much easier because it doesn&#x27;t have that clippy thing.  It heats up fast, and works really well.  I can curl my hair with this in about 10 minutes, its so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that you have to be really aware of what you set it down on, because it doesn&#x27;t really prop up the way its supposed to so the hot part will be on the table or wherever you have it set on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, I love this! Works really well and its cute!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, love the glove thing that comes with it. I&#x27;ve never fooled with the temp control, the baseline setting that it starts at is way hot for me.</li>
            <li> First time buying a curler and I&#x27;m in love! Extremely easy to use (not that hard to burn your finger either but you just have to be careful haha) and it&#x27;s pink!!!!</li>
            <li> I watched a multitude of videos on how to use this wand but I couldn&#x27;t adapt to it. I purchased because  so many women said that it even works for thick, straight hair. My experience was that my hair was too straight and slick that I no matter how tight I wound my hair around the barrel it just wouldn&#x27;t adhere long enough to get a tight curl. I would end up having to use my entire gloved hand to hold it in place. And because I had to use the glove, it would create strays/flyaways so each \\&quot;curl\\&quot; was never smooth looking. FYI, I have have long, very thick, very straight, yet textured Asian hair. I really think I have some of the thickest hair, thicker than even the ladies that did all those how-to videos on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I thought I probably should have gotten the larger barrel, so that&#x27;s my mistake.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product didn&#x27;t work for met at all. my hair wouldn&#x27;t keep a curl.i could still feel the heat on my fingers even after i was wearing the gloves</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and a regular curler wasn&#x27;t holding my curls.  My niece recommended this to me so I bought it!  I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times because it is too difficult for me.  I&#x27;m used to a regular curler.  Plus it&#x27;s hard to curl the tips!  And since I have layers in my hair, it is VERY difficult to keep my hair wrapped around it.  And my curls still didn&#x27;t stay with this product either, although the curls were very nice looking.  Gonna give it to my niece!</li>
            <li> i have thick wavy/curly hair down to my mid back and this has cut my curl in time in half. 30 minutes and im done</li>
