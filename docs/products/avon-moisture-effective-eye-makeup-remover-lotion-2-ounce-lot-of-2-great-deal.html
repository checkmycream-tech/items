            <li>This is my favorite makeup remover..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact it is a lotion not an oil based remover.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye remover.</li>

            <li>Glad it is sold at amazon and could ship with my order.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>

            <li>It works great on sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>Just what I expected - great!</li>
            <li>Must be very careful, best applied with a q-tip.</li>
            <li>I like that it takes off all my mascara easily</li>
            <li>It easily removes all my eye makeup</li>
            <li>Easy to use and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy and removes make up easy.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, but quite effective in removing eyeshadow, mascara, and eyeliner (even waterproof).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ecstatic to know I can order this item on my own thanks to amazon..</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>I used to use this because it was so cheap like 99 cents a bottle.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot to get my makeup to come off smoothly.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good product but not made for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Now I use jojoba oil and so far so good.</li>
            <li>removes eye makeup quickly and easily without a lot of rubbing</li>
            <li>It create a great first step followed by your facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh which is nice</li>
            <li>I love this product because its a gentle way remove mascara, eyeliner, shadows, &amp; lip stains.</li>
            <li>My favorite eye makeup remover EVER and on Amazon you can get it cheaper than Avon&#x27;s normal price - though Avon does have them go on sale for $1 every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, can&#x27;t stand none of the wipes, just make my eyes feel sticky, this is soft non-sticky and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes although I rub it all over my eyelids to get mascara out :)</li>
            <li>I would rather spend the extra dollars on Lancome or Bobbi Brown makeup remover because they are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>This eye cream makeup remover is gentle on the eyes, but still gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Used for years won&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
            <li>Gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye make up remover for 20 years, I like it THAT much.  </li>
            <li>Well priced, but it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup gently.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was gentle</li>
            <li>It removes all my eye makeup without me having to tug too much on my eyes, and it never burns.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no scent, it&#x27;s easy on the delicate skin around the eyes, doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in the eyes and takes everything off easily.</li>
            <li>Will finish this bottle and try a different product strong yet gentle for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY face product of any kind that I have used this long.</li>
            <li>all 7 females in our family use this to remove their eye makeup every evening - we cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear much makeup, and I have fairly sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, and this works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>this is the only eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t make you rub and rub - makeup comes off easily and your skin around the eye doesn&#x27;t get stretched.  </li>
            <li>I typically use oil free eye makeup remover which is a clear liquid.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way; this stuff removes makeup very easily.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t ever have any adverse reactions to using this.</li>
            <li>The wipes don&#x27;t remove makeup anywhere near as well and require scrubbing that breaks my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have mildly sensitive skin, and this has never made my skin have any adverse reaction</li>
            <li>Soft and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>works well even on waterproof mascara, and only stings if i get it directly in my eye!</li>
            <li>and it leaves the skin around your eyes moisturized, not dry.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t really remove all my eye makeup, unless I rub a large amount directly on my eyes, and then end up with irritated eyes.</li>

            <li> but it irritates my eyes and leaves a film that over time causes me to develop blepharitis which I&#x27;ve gotten a few times from these types of cream removers.</li>
            <li> It is extremely messy as a cream</li>
            <li> Used on a small cotton square, I manage to take off everything from mascara to liner and shadow.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the past and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find an Avon lady in my area so this worked well for me to buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve used it for YEARS.You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> it never bothers our eyes, yet removes even the worst makeup!</li>

            <li> this is the only eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t make you rub and rub - makeup comes off easily and your skin around the eye doesn&#x27;t get stretched.  I love it..</li>
            <li> all 7 females in our family use this to remove their eye makeup every evening - we cannot live without it! it never bothers our eyes, yet removes even the worst makeup! I hope avon NEVER stops making this item! I cannot recommend it highly enough. (ps we are ages 14 to 70 in case you are wondering)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, can&#x27;t stand none of the wipes, just make my eyes feel sticky, this is soft non-sticky and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes although I rub it all over my eyelids to get mascara out :)</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take make-up off at all.</li>
            <li> Love this! This eye cream makeup remover is gentle on the eyes, but still gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear much makeup, and I have fairly sensitive eyes.

Will finish this bottle and try a different product strong yet gentle for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 30 years and love it. I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t ever have any adverse reactions to using this. It easily removes all my eye makeup and I like the idea of not wasting a makeup remover wipe every day. I&#x27;ve tried multiple items over the years and within days always come back to this. The wipes don&#x27;t remove makeup anywhere near as well and require scrubbing that breaks my eyelashes. I put a small amount of this lotion on my fingertips and gently massage it into my eyes, then wash off. Even waterproof mascara doesn&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> I only personally don&#x27;t like this makeup removed recause it irritates my eyes. But my mom uses it and loves it. So it&#x27;s a good product but not made for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of this!  Ive tried multiple makeup removers and they never fully get my &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; makeup off. This lotion does!  Love!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Cannot find anything better. So inexpensive.  Easy to use and non greasy.  Have tried eye makeup remover pads, cannot compare to this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years. Gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Gentle on the skin, but quite effective in removing eyeshadow, mascara, and eyeliner (even waterproof).  The product isn&#x27;t overly oily and does not leave a residue on my skin.  Even better that it came in a pack of two!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Great product and price, Avon!</li>
            <li> Impulsive purchase and just love it.  It totally removes eye makeup but also feels like it is moisturizing while it removes the makeup with no burning or stinging eyes.  Came in a package of 2 but lost a bottle to my daughter.  I will be purchasing this again!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this eye makeup remover -it melts away even the toughest coats of mascara with no need to tug, and no stinging or eye irritation.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s better than any top brand, I know, I spend money on makeup before food. Get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It works great on sensitive eyes.  All the other products I try make my eyes burn.  Used on a small cotton square, I manage to take off everything from mascara to liner and shadow.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it works really well. I use a cotton ball to take off my eye make up and it can get every last bit of it.  After using it, I rinse my face off and there is no oily residue or anything of the sort. I have mildly sensitive skin, and this has never made my skin have any adverse reaction - I&#x27;ve used it for YEARS.You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good product, none oily, I like it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye make up remover for 20 years, I like it THAT much.  It works very well, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and a little goes a long ways.  This is the ONLY face product of any kind that I have used this long.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup remover.. I used to order it thru an Avon rep all the time. It removes my makeup with a breeze. I have very sensitive eyes, and this works wonders for me. It moistures my eyes while removing all the makeup from my face, including my water proof eye liner and mascara.. I&#x27;m ecstatic to know I can order this item on my own thanks to amazon..</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s been hard to find an Avon lady in my area so this worked well for me to buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Must be very careful, best applied with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> Removes even the toughest water proof make ups. Will never look for any other remover again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Love the fact it is a lotion not an oil based remover.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Well priced, but it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup gently.  You have to use quite a bit of product and scrub if you are removing mascara.  I would rather spend the extra dollars on Lancome or Bobbi Brown makeup remover because they are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye makeup remover EVER and on Amazon you can get it cheaper than Avon&#x27;s normal price - though Avon does have them go on sale for $1 every once in awhile. Lotion - not oily. Soft and leaves no residue. FAVES</li>
            <li> removes eye makeup quickly and easily without a lot of rubbing</li>
            <li> Love this eye remover. So many leave a film if you get it in your eyes if you forget to take your contacts out. Takes very little to really get eye makeup off. Used for years won&#x27;t buy any other kind. Glad it is sold at amazon and could ship with my order.  don&#x27;t have an Avon lady in my area.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the past and will continue to use it. It removes the makeup easily and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Mom was an Avon lady when I was growing up.  I&#x27;ve tried other eye makeup removers but I always end up going back to this one.  Gentle and effective.  Avon products are solid winners in my book.</li>
            <li> I used to use this because it was so cheap like 99 cents a bottle. I thought it was gentle but it irritates my eyes and leaves a film that over time causes me to develop blepharitis which I&#x27;ve gotten a few times from these types of cream removers. Now I use jojoba oil and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I got good products thank you for quick service.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; this stuff removes makeup very easily.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand and product for YEARS! Never disappoints!</li>
            <li> Love love love.  It moisturizes the eye area while removing mascara.  Not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only eye make- up remover I use.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and removes make up easy. I&#x27;ve used this for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected - great!</li>
            <li> I like the creaminess and the smell.  It&#x27;s not harsh which is nice but I find it&#x27;s lacking in effectiveness.  It takes a lot to get my makeup to come off smoothly.</li>
            <li> I typically use oil free eye makeup remover which is a clear liquid.  I decided to try this based on the review.  It is extremely messy as a cream and it was much more difficult to get my mascara off.  Nice price, but I will stick with my liquid over this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product because its a gentle way remove mascara, eyeliner, shadows, &amp; lip stains. It create a great first step followed by your facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye makeup removers i&#x27;ve used. works well even on waterproof mascara, and only stings if i get it directly in my eye!</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup remover for about 15 years now.  I used to use Moisturel lotion upon recommendation of a dermatologist, but about 15 years ago, the formula changed and it started burning my eyes.  A friend had an extra bottle of this Avon and gave it to me to try.  It is perfect for me.  It removes all my eye makeup without me having to tug too much on my eyes, and it never burns.  I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, so I can&#x27;t say how it works for that.</li>
