            <li>OPI nail polish and other OPI products for nails are the best!</li>
            <li>:) my favorite OPI color right now.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, seller.</li>
            <li>It is color enough to see that you have nail polish on and not too bright</li>
            <li>This pink is great for the fall and winter season.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Seems like the only color that stays on my nails nicely for days.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this to my nails, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty Easter color, definitely more pastel than expected</li>
            <li>If you want a great pink with a slight purple tone nail polish this is your color!</li>
            <li>-exactly as described and pictured-appears to be a full bottle never to very little opened.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice dusty rose-pink.</li>
            <li>I only had to apply 2 coats for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>Soft and romantic and girly.</li>

            <li> This color really seems to mix with a lot of the pale summer colors without losing it&#x27;s effect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a manicure last that long.</li>
            <li> Cuuute pink (Sparrow Me the Drama)!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and some pinks are too pink and purples are just not great for me...</li>
            <li> Subtle, but still color.</li>
            <li> The next time I tried it, I put a base coat on my nails.</li>
            <li> ..can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> Excellent color for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this to my nails, I didn&#x27;t like it. I had to use 3 coats and I could still see parts of my nail. The next time I tried it, I put a base coat on my nails. I only had to apply 2 coats for complete coverage. It&#x27;s a very pretty Easter color, definitely more pastel than expected but it looks great with my fair skin and it lasts a while without chipping! Ended up to be a great buy.</li>
            <li> Sparrow me the Drama is the cutest!!! Its soft, like a purple/pink color, really really cute!! I love it. Soft and romantic and girly. :) my favorite OPI color right now.</li>
            <li> OPI has the best polish. I am a nail tech and I know about polishes. This is a great color for summer.</li>
            <li> If you want a great pink with a slight purple tone nail polish this is your color! I have very pale skin and some pinks are too pink and purples are just not great for me... this is a great color for me! It is color enough to see that you have nail polish on and not too bright so you can wear it to the office.</li>
            <li> I have had this color before and was glad I could find it again. Seems like the only color that stays on my nails nicely for days.</li>
            <li> I love this color and hope you will continue having it in stock. OPI nail polish and other OPI products for nails are the best!</li>
            <li> Cuuute pink (Sparrow Me the Drama)! Very nice every day color with a feminine touch. Not too overpowering. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My favorite color and amazon still had it. Thrilled.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this color!  The first time I used this polish was at the nail salon where I go.  I ended up purchasing  a bottle from them.  On one visit, I forgot to tell her it was my bottle after she was done.  I even went back to the salon on my next visit, but never found my polish.  Decided to order it from Amazon.  I put a sticker on the bottle so I can remember to get it back after they&#x27;re done with my pedicure.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! I bought this polish to wear to a wedding, got a manicure and it lasted almosted two weeks. I&#x27;ve never had a manicure last that long. The color is a nice dusty rose-pink. Subtle, but still color.</li>
            <li> I love O.P.I..can&#x27;t go wrong. This is my favorite color..stays on and doesn&#x27;t chip. I would refer to a friend</li>
            <li> Discontinued nail color but I still found it on Amazon. Great all around color.</li>
            <li> This color really seems to mix with a lot of the pale summer colors without losing it&#x27;s effect.  It still stands out.</li>
            <li> I got just about all of the colors of the \\&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean Collection\\&quot; and i love them all.  Even my daughter&#x27;s used them and loves them as well.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent color, came right on time and was just as described. Quick, easy, seller. Great packaging. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the color. This pink is great for the fall and winter season. I recieved my shipment in like two days. They took care not to break the bottles.</li>
            <li> great color-exactly as described and pictured-appears to be a full bottle never to very little opened. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> love the color and no shipping fees</li>
