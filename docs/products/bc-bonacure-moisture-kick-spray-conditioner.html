            <li>I love Schwarzkopf Moisture Kick Spray!</li>
            <li>, I just love this spray!</li>
            <li>it kind of refreshes it and get&#x27;s rid of the smelly hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use this on all four of my kids and on my own hair.</li>
            <li>ive used ALOT of products on my hair, but this one i got for free from my fiance  andi really really liked it!     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true lifesaver!!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I can&#x27;t live without it for the reasons I said, and if others are getting more out of it than I do, well, that&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I used this spray for more than 8 years now, and I would use it even before if I knew it exists :).</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Moisture Kick Spray works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Love most of the products but not this one.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just love it for detangling, I spray it all over my hair (don&#x27;t drench it, just even spray), wait about 60 seconds and</li>
            <li>It smells great and really conditions my hair.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>That works a lot better for my fine hair in combination with the Light Volume Boost shampoo from BC.</li>
            <li>I bought this spray in conditioner because the Light Volume Boost shampoo does not have a matching conditioner and this product was recommended as its match.</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with others here who feel it has great conditioning benefits.  </li>
            <li>It is so light weight</li>
            <li>Great leave in conditioner for my fine dry hair.</li>
            <li>this product was exactly what i was looking for and since i purchased a bundle i was able to save on shipping...</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s just helps detangle, but I don&#x27;t notice that otherwise my hair is really \\&quot;conditioned\\&quot; in any meaningful way.  </li>
            <li>It works OK and very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick and item was exact!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it never fails me!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>A very good choice for someone who&#x27;s hair is hard to brush and needs smoothing.</li>
            <li>I use it right after shampooing and also in between shampoos to \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; my curls.  </li>
            <li>my hair combs right out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years now and it is really amazing!</li>
            <li>It really works and your hair dresser will even notice how \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; your hair looks!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 2 or 3 years and it is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair tangle free, soft, shiny and it has bounce again.  </li>
            <li>I was using Matrix InstaCure, but it only added to the static.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for really dry, lifeless hair and just a couple of spritzes will breathe life back into your tresses.  </li>
            <li>I just started, I think it does make my dry hair more moisturized.</li>
            <li>so i finished my bottle and ordered my 2nd one online, and im almost done with my 2nd, so an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>You can feel your hair getting the necessary moisture and staying smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>they dont do much for my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m concerned I didn&#x27;t get the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Schwarzkopf products work really well</li>
            <li>and it really tames the tangles and frizz.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy, moisturized, &amp; does not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was getting really dry, and this conditioner made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I love how this product protects my ends from future damage and helps heal the current damage my hair has.</li>
            <li>And really, all their products rools for me so far: Igora colors, shampoos, conditioners,</li>
            <li>This conditioner really makes your hair feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>One of the rare products that do actually make a difference</li>
            <li>Long lasting and workes perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>and i get irritated and move to something new</li>
            <li>You will love this product especially if you have dry or damaged hair or if you just need a boost of moisture to make it feel soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times in the past, but the product I received in this order has not been effective at all.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and decided to use this while I was at the beach.</li>
            <li>Even if I did, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again as I like my hair to feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Beware of the seller, as they might ship you old products.</li>
            <li>It never feels too heavy, gives this silkiness to my hair and significantly simplifies brushing and styling.</li>
            <li>but i agree with others, the smell of it is a little bit intense, other tan that is just fine.</li>
            <li>My hair has damage due to hot iron and coloring.</li>
            <li>It is light and non-sticky and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not only is not heavy, it smells really fresh and leaves my hair incredibly soft -- no static and no greasy look.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and thick and I didnt think this leave-in conditioner my friend offered would be able to tackle it.  </li>

            <li> If your hair suffers from severe dryness due to being blown, ironed, curled, colored or any other kind of  over-processing, you will find that Moisture Kick  is fast relief in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> then one day I blowed it dry and used the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;refreshes&amp;#34; my hair sometimes when it is &amp;#34;tired.&amp;#34;  Will use as long as the quality of product remains.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to apply normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> A must have for damaged, brittle, or dry.</li>
            <li> I love MoroccanOil, but it&#x27;s expensive and some of their products are too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair weighted down and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I used it when my hair is wet or dry</li>
            <li> I have hair to my mid back and don&#x27;t like to weigh it down with heavy conditioners every time I wash it.  </li>
            <li> The packing of the bottle looks quite old then the newer ones I have used lately.</li>
            <li> I use this in my daughter&#x27;s hair regularly...perfect for the days that you don&#x27;t need a conditioner but need something to help comb out their wet hair.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to buy this over my other leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like other Schwarzkopf products, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> I like to spray a little on my dry hair before I comb.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, just calms it so it doesn&#x27;t frizz.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, just a little spray.</li>
            <li> I just find annoying the fact that it costs here in the US like 3 times more expensive than in Europe, but it&#x27;s understandable since Schwarzkopf is a German brand...</li>
            <li> I used it a few times, but I had to wash my hair to get rid of the residue.</li>
            <li> I do not wash my hair everyday, so this product is not for me.</li>
            <li> As it usually happens, my hair got dry after coloring and therefore hard to brush.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it does not weigh my hair down!!</li>
            <li> so I gave it a try, even though I had visions of the No More Tears spray of childhood, which neither detangled nor prevented tears.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and as soon as I open this bottle, it was all greasy and bad.</li>
            <li> Not a good product in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with it, so it sits on my shelf.</li>
            <li> My hair felt nasty and thick!</li>
            <li> my stylist used on my hair :(.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s light, at a great price, next time I&#x27;m getting the bigger bottle, I use each time I wash my hair as a leave in, it smells yummy, I&#x27;m a gym goer and I flat iron my hair so I try not to wash it every day, so in between shampoos I spray this on my hair it kind of refreshes it and get&#x27;s rid of the smelly hair. I like the fact that it does not weigh my hair down!! I highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  discovered it when I traveled to Vegas and realized I&#x27;d packed two shampoos and no conditoner.  My hair is long and thick and I didnt think this leave-in conditioner my friend offered would be able to tackle it.  It DID!!  WONDERFULLY!!!  a definite RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> best detangler I have tried. Very hard to find in the stores. Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> I used this spray for more than 8 years now, and I would use it even before if I knew it exists :). As it usually happens, my hair got dry after coloring and therefore hard to brush. My stylist recommended this wonderfull spray and since then I use it every time after I wash my hair. It never feels too heavy, gives this silkiness to my hair and significantly simplifies brushing and styling. I just find annoying the fact that it costs here in the US like 3 times more expensive than in Europe, but it&#x27;s understandable since Schwarzkopf is a German brand... And really, all their products rools for me so far: Igora colors, shampoos, conditioners, Osis creams...    A very good choice for someone who&#x27;s hair is hard to brush and needs smoothing.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome conditioner.  And, it smells great -- I wish that I could find a perfume that smells similar.  This conditioner really makes your hair feel really soft.  My hair was getting really dry, and this conditioner made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  Keeps my hair healthy, moisturized, &amp; does not weigh down my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5yrs.  I like it because it has protein which the hair needs.  I will keep buying it until it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I ordered another one for my sister. She will be so happy when she finds out :)</li>
            <li> I love Schwarzkopf Moisture Kick Spray! Actually, I love all Schwarzkopf products!! Moisture Kick Spray works like magic.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it never fails me! Spray your hair after each wash or when you get out of the pool or ocean.  It really works and your hair dresser will even notice how \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; your hair looks! Price can&#x27;t be beat. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 2 or 3 years and it is my favorite.  I use it right after shampooing and also in between shampoos to \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; my curls.  It is light and non-sticky and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair tangle free, soft, shiny and it has bounce again.  A must have for damaged, brittle, or dry. hair.</li>
            <li> I love how this product protects my ends from future damage and helps heal the current damage my hair has.</li>
            <li> I have used this product successfully for some time, which is why I keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it is really amazing! You can feel your hair getting the necessary moisture and staying smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Smells different than stuff my stylist used on my hair :(. Feels different too, not as conditioning. Won&#x27;t buy online again. Need to smell next bottle before I buy.</li>
            <li> My friend uses this product and very happy with it. I just started, I think it does make my dry hair more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray in conditioner because the Light Volume Boost shampoo does not have a matching conditioner and this product was recommended as its match. It left my hair weighted down and greasy looking. I gave it two stars because it was delivered timely and it may just be an issue with my hair. I started using It&#x27;s a 10. That works a lot better for my fine hair in combination with the Light Volume Boost shampoo from BC.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I like to spray a little on my dry hair before I comb. The smell is a little bit too strong. Anyway, just a little spray. It moisturizes the hair well.</li>
            <li> ive used ALOT of products on my hair, but this one i got for free from my fiance  andi really really liked it!     so i finished my bottle and ordered my 2nd one online, and im almost done with my 2nd, so an amazing product.  I always buy products and never ever finish them bc they dont do much for my hair and i get irritated and move to something new but this product is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times in the past, but the product I received in this order has not been effective at all.  I&#x27;m concerned I didn&#x27;t get the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this stuff!  I was using Matrix InstaCure, but it only added to the static.  I love MoroccanOil, but it&#x27;s expensive and some of their products are too heavy.  This is the best stuff ever.  Not only is not heavy, it smells really fresh and leaves my hair incredibly soft -- no static and no greasy look.</li>
            <li> If your hair suffers from severe dryness due to being blown, ironed, curled, colored or any other kind of  over-processing, you will find that Moisture Kick  is fast relief in a bottle.  It&#x27;s great for really dry, lifeless hair and just a couple of spritzes will breathe life back into your tresses.  It&#x27;s a true lifesaver!!</li>
            <li> Not a good product in my eyes. Didn&#x27;t care for it. Didn&#x27;t do a thing. Love most of the products but not this one.</li>
            <li> this product was exactly what i was looking for and since i purchased a bundle i was able to save on shipping...the cost for this stuff is normally double the amount in the salon so i was so happy i got it for a great price.....the shipping was quick and item was exact!</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner for my fine dry hair. It does not weigh it down. Have been a fan for years.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and I will continue to buy this over my other leave in conditioner. It leaves your hair sooo soft. My hair has damage due to hot iron and coloring. This gives my hair instant moisture. You will love this product especially if you have dry or damaged hair or if you just need a boost of moisture to make it feel soft. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this spray but i agree with others, the smell of it is a little bit intense, other tan that is just fine.</li>
            <li> I have hair to my mid back and don&#x27;t like to weigh it down with heavy conditioners every time I wash it.  Years ago I came across Moisture Kick when my then-hairdresser (Michael Boychuk) recommended it for detangling.  My hair gets so tangled when I wash it and don&#x27;t deep condition so I gave it a try, even though I had visions of the No More Tears spray of childhood, which neither detangled nor prevented tears.  I just love it for detangling, I spray it all over my hair (don&#x27;t drench it, just even spray), wait about 60 seconds and my hair combs right out.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, just calms it so it doesn&#x27;t frizz.  That said, I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with others here who feel it has great conditioning benefits.  For me, it&#x27;s just helps detangle, but I don&#x27;t notice that otherwise my hair is really \\&quot;conditioned\\&quot; in any meaningful way.  Anyway, I can&#x27;t live without it for the reasons I said, and if others are getting more out of it than I do, well, that&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> I use this in my daughter&#x27;s hair regularly...perfect for the days that you don&#x27;t need a conditioner but need something to help comb out their wet hair.  Great product!</li>
            <li> A product that I recommend to my hair stylist.  It &amp;#34;refreshes&amp;#34; my hair sometimes when it is &amp;#34;tired.&amp;#34;  Will use as long as the quality of product remains.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair sticky. I have naturally curly hair and decided to use this while I was at the beach. I wore my hair curly and then one day I blowed it dry and used the flat iron. My hair felt nasty and thick! I was so irritated! I&#x27;m not happy with it, so it sits on my shelf. I used it a few times, but I had to wash my hair to get rid of the residue. I do not wash my hair everyday, so this product is not for me. Even if I did, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again as I like my hair to feel soft and silky. I like other Schwarzkopf products, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner. It does not help with comb through though, so if you need a detangler i recommend [[ASIN:B002SYZLS2 Marrakesh Marrakesh X Dreamsicle Leave-In Treatment and Detangler with Hemp and Argan Oils, 4 Ounce]]....which conditions AND detangles.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Works Great!! Love Schwarzkoph products!! Would reccommend to anyone who&#x27;s hair tangles very easy!!!  I use the regular shampoo and conditioner also.</li>
            <li> Schwarzkopf products work really well, I just love this spray! It smells great and really conditions my hair. I used it when my hair is wet or dry and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Loved it for 15years!! Long lasting and workes perfect for my thin hair. Just leave leave it without washing. Not greasy</li>
            <li> Love it, makes my hair so silky and mistorized.. smells soo good too! One of the rare products that do actually make a difference and I can see the result!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and as soon as I open this bottle, it was all greasy and bad. There was some white color formation side the bottle.  The packing of the bottle looks quite old then the newer ones I have used lately. Beware of the seller, as they might ship you old products.</li>
            <li> I use this on all four of my kids and on my own hair. It is so light weight and it really tames the tangles and frizz.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to apply normal conditioner. It works OK and very convenient.  I like it.</li>
