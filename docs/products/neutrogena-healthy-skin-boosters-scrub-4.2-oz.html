            <li>healthy skin booster scrub</li>
            <li>I had a chance to try this free sample given to me by influenster and neutrogena in exchange for my honest review and did completed my sample.</li>
            <li>as most cleanser do.  </li>
            <li>Usually many scrubs or cleansers break me out</li>
            <li>The Skin Boosters Scrub is a lightly scented cleaner that lathers nicely and uses barely-there particles to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>If you like a more thorough-feeling scrub, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and quick, and your skin will feel great.</li>
            <li>It is more of stimulating your skin.</li>
            <li>For the level of quality in scrub, Neutrogena gives ROC a run for the money and at a better value too.</li>
            <li>And I appreciate that I can use this product and my skin immediately looks better.  </li>
            <li>Also the scent is pleasant and mild, so it&#x27;s fine for men or women.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, and the foam is lovely, but the moisturizing is too much</li>
            <li>, let me very clean and smooth, I own my opinion</li>
            <li>Works great and feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves a super tingly feeling, I&#x27;m pregnant and a lot bothers me but not this one.</li>
            <li>It had a light, sweet, scented smell to it which I loved.</li>
            <li>This skin booster scrub has a nice smell; almost like clean laundry</li>
            <li>I like Neutrogena always worries about the health of our skin, this product received free sample size through influenster, and I liked it, has ingredients like white tea and vitamin E which are very good for the skin, about my skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean afterevery use.</li>

            <li>I loved this product so much!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good not so over powering..  </li>

            <li>Very mild scrub.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling refreshed and I like that the scent is very mild.</li>
            <li>I prefer non scented products, but this one wasn&#x27;t as much as a strong scent.</li>

            <li>I love the scent of this product, I have been looking for a product to use for daily cleaning and when I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free.</li>

            <li>I love the smell , fresh green tea is always refreshing in your face.</li>
            <li>a small amount will do the job great.</li>
            <li>the Combination of white tea and vitamin E is not only great smelling (for a person who prefers the hypo-allergenic products) and</li>

            <li>Tip to the younger person: Begin a good regiment of taking care of your skin early in your life with Neutrogena . .</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so fresh, clean, and soft!</li>
            <li>so it does not exfoliate very much at all.  </li>

            <li>Anyways I really love the idea of white tea and vitamin E.</li>
            <li>But I do recommend to use a exfoliating glove first to take all that nastiest debris caked on your face, then use the Skin Boosters scrub with o\ without the glove.</li>
            <li>it also has vitamin E that nourish your skin leaving your face smooth and soft</li>

            <li>When I tried Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub</li>
            <li>I love that it has white tea extract and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>After the first wash my face felt smoother.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and I will continue using this product daily as part of my skin-caring routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product at night, I first lathered it on my face alone then used a cleansing brush to keep cleaning my face for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>At the first try, i was amazed how my blackheads on my nose were practically gone.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena’s Healthy Skin Boosters daily scrub uses microbeads to exfoliate without overly drying the skin.</li>
            <li>I either break out after washing my face with any product but this one not only made my face feel so smooth but NO BREAK OUTS!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this out because I have a pretty set and regimented skin care routine that I don&#x27;t deviate from often because of my fickle skin.  </li>
            <li>I used this product several times and I absolutely love using it for my face.</li>
            <li>It seems just slightly feminine to me, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and I suspect most buyers are going to be ladies anyway, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and I love this daily scrub also.</li>
            <li>but it packs the same punch of cleanliness with just a bit more creaminess and microbeads to exfoliate your skin with ease.</li>
            <li>Light scent, washes off easily, and the grit is not too rough so you can exfoliate without feeling like you&#x27;re using sandpaper.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and it hasn&#x27;t left my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>This does not dry my skin and it leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I got to test this product complimentary thanks to Influenster, but all these opinions are my own due my testing of the product.</li>
            <li>it left my face feeling smooth and clean which i really like.</li>
            <li>I used it at the end of my day to scrub away all of the makeup that was left and to leave my skin nice and clean for the next morning.</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant, not overwhelming or cloying.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft, sweet smell (not foul to the nose or the face).</li>
            <li>but after a few tries of this scrub my face felt great and the vitamin E definitely left me feeling good.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling very clean without over drying it.</li>
            <li>The smell of product is really nice compared to other washes.</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t even realize this was a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; until I read some other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Wow this facial cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell of white tea is amazing and the vitamin E leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>This scrub has the effect of being a gentle exfoliation while keeping skin soft and smooth and radiant.  </li>
            <li>But the product didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily at all, but rather clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin really clean and soft  ..</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth and not dry like many others face products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>The granules in this product are so fine you will barely notice them.  </li>
            <li>thanks I  tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free,thanks to @influenster</li>
            <li>I really like the neutrogena healthy skin booster facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>I recently started using this product and I love how it leaves my skin fresh and soft!</li>
            <li>This is not an intense scrub - very gentle, so it can be used every day.</li>
            <li>This product dried out my skin more than usual, which may have been okay if it was an effective scrub.  </li>
            <li>The smell to me is light and pleasant, slightly floral/fruity and it doesn&#x27;t linger for long after you&#x27;re done washing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for something positive to say about this product</li>
            <li>does people that have very oily skin and dry at the same time and with this skin booster my fave has not felt and looked more better..</li>
            <li>This product would have been such a big win for me if my skin wasn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Overall Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive when it comes to facial scrubs I didn&#x27;t find it to have enough scrubbing power lol.</li>
            <li>The healthy skin boosters with white tea and vitamin e made my skin feel so fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>are true and completely mine.</li>
            <li>I loved the product, as it usually happens with Neutrogena, what is promise, they do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the kind of product I want to use on my skin, but at least it neither leaves a residue, a strong odor, or strips the skin of its natural oils, so if you want an exfoliating product and haven&#x27;t developed an aversion to non-natural products, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Left my face fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Good product, is light and not greasy, the granule does work well exfoliates without leaving the tight or sensitive skin, it is left fresh and odor agrabable skin.</li>
            <li>After the second and third, I honestly feel like I left Vegas with my skin looking and feeling better than it was before.</li>
            <li>Totally buying the full size when I run out of my sample!</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase full size once I am out of face soap!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes super well and leaves my skin feeling ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>The formula leaves your skin feeling super soft and moisturized without it being oily.</li>
            <li>If I use it more than that my skin gets way too dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li>(my pores are large)</li>
            <li>I use certain face washes.</li>
            <li>I do get better results with a sugar scrub though since my skin is less dry in the summer this would be a perfect product in a few months.</li>
            <li>My new skincare obsession!!</li>
            <li>This cleaner is nice for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>It may not provide as much exfoliation as you need, however, so consider applying it to a dry face if you need more exfoliating power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this new Neutrogena Skin Boosters Scrub left my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cleanser but still gentle enough to use every single day.</li>
            <li>It also smells great and you can use a little in order for it to have a lasting effect.</li>
            <li>I really did enjoy the white tea scent that escape the bottle once I opened it.</li>
            <li>i could feel really getting into my pores</li>
            <li>Having sensitive/acne prone skin, I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to face products.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really feel the granules on my finger.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I started massaging into my face that I really felt them.</li>
            <li>I really like this scrub</li>
            <li>, maybe I need to use the whole line of these together.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product free from influenster to test and give my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>I tested the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters scrub free from @influenster and was surprised at how this facial cleanser actually worked.</li>
            <li>I have really oil skin</li>
            <li>I really like face washes that foam, so</li>
            <li>I used it for a week straight and after the week, my skin felt a lot healthier.</li>
            <li>This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but after one week my &amp;#34;furrowed brow&amp;#34; lines, my crow&#x27;s feet, and my laugh lines were greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I suffer from very oily skin</li>
            <li>It doesn’t have as much exfoliating beads as I’m</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>I really do love this product because it does not feel rough to apply on as you think.</li>
            <li>I used this product when before I went to bed so much of a difference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle for every day use and non-drying.</li>
            <li>It was gentle</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was worried that my skin would feel really oily in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, it had lathering gel texture geland left my skin smooth, no dryness.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really feel the granules on my finger.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I started massaging into my face that I really felt them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my stubborn blackheads.  </li>
            <li>white tea daily scrub has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>this product really does have a fresh scent to it, i have sensitive skin and this helped without damaging my skin</li>
            <li>I do have some-what sensitive skin on my face so even though the label on this states &#x27;daily&#x27; my skin tolerates it much better if I restrict it to once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>The first time i use it make my skin feel like new so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great since I&#x27;ve started using Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub, and my face doesn&#x27;t become greasy after a few hours when I used this product compared to other products.</li>
            <li>The first wash made me feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft right away.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a daily face wash that keeps you feeling fresh for hours!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin because of a very strong acne medication that cleared up my acne but made my skin extremely delicate to pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>Btw love the smell and the texture, is very soft in my face and my face does not feel dry after I rinse it off.</li>
            <li>and the beads were very fine and not super abrasive.</li>
            <li>I could not love this product more!</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product freaked out for the fact that my skin felt so soft!</li>
            <li>It foams slightly but not much, and rinses away cleanly and easily, leaving my skin refreshed and smooth.  </li>
            <li>his scrub is much finer and very suitable for my delicate skin which tend to be very sensitive, I used it in the morning to help my face wake up and get rid of any toxins.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves it so soft!</li>
            <li>my skin feels amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a sample of this facial scrub free in an</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase the full size to see how it really works because the sample size only got me 3 uses.</li>
            <li>Overall, the scrub leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>but I do believe having a clean face will help prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li>It left my skin looking clean</li>
            <li>, it left my skin clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li>Your skin is scrubbed and left clean.  </li>
            <li>This scrub is touted as being suitable for everyday exfoliation.</li>
            <li>This scrub is touted as being suitable for everyday exfoliation.</li>
            <li>After using it one full week I will now go ahead and purchase the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and this product really does do what it says for me.</li>
            <li>this product left my face nice &amp; soft.no dry skin!  </li>
            <li>My face seems less oily and I haven&#x27;t had as many breakouts.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a daily scrub on top of the Neutrogena daily bar !</li>
            <li>This particular product was no exception.</li>
            <li>I bought this in replace of a much more pricer option (origins Ginzing scrub) which ultimately has the same texture.</li>
            <li>good product, i used a few times and i notice a big difference in my face</li>
            <li>Personally, I thought this product was better than the one that uses nut shells as the base, but not quite as good as the department store version (however, the Neutrogena product is a FRACTION of the price, and therefore is far more</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used it three nights in a row, and each following morning my skin has felt smooth and soft but never oily.  </li>
            <li>I love the Neutrogena facial cleanser with white tea and vitamin E</li>
            <li>And while I was hesitant to try this product after receiving it for testing purposes under the concern that it wouldn&#x27;t do much for me, I was completely blown away!</li>
            <li>it has really makes my  skin radiant and soft!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>but I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, even for guys, if you want to get that oil and crud off your face.  </li>
            <li>and it was soft and luscious!!</li>
            <li>Those who need more exfoliation may find the Neutrogena scrub to be a little lightweight.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised by how it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I use it as my daily face wash and it makes my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your skin has been completely stripped of all moisture, but at the same time it feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I felt like it did a decent job of removing my makeup and left my skin feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling so soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I like that my face feels clean, smooth and not dry or tight afterwards.</li>
            <li>Loved this product and my only 2 issues was their wasn&#x27;t any little beads inside to help with the scrubbing of my face and that my sample was too small and I wanted more.</li>
            <li>I also loved that it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li>The scrub leaves my face feeling clean without drying up my already dry areas.</li>
            <li>Received it for free thanks to influester and definitely I will be buying later on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>I normally have problems with &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34; and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li>I normally used it with my cleansing brush</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>i normally have pretty oily and sensitive skin, but this kept it moisturized and clear during the day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already one of my favorite everyday used products.</li>
            <li>So far this is my first complete week using the face wash.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely  will be purchasing  this product just because  it did give me results and did not dried my skin or left any skin  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It has a finely grind scrub that won&#x27;t harm or hurt your skin like other scrubs do.</li>
            <li>UsuaUsually , I am not a big fan of most cleansers, because they dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I only use this when I intend to moisturize right away  </li>
            <li>It smells great thanks to the white tea, which is very subtle.</li>
            <li>This is not my first neutrogena product, so I was already having high expectations and they were definitely met.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for new products to try within the Nuetrogena line.</li>
            <li>My face was so soft and clean and didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li>I also have super dry skin</li>
            <li>Several years ago I purchased [[ASIN:B003BMI628 Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]] to try and did not care for it.</li>
            <li>and I actually like this product much more than I expected to.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is gentle, even though it actually cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;People with sensitive skin will do better with the Neutrogena product as it is not particularly “rough” on the skin and the microbeads are very small and dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this face wash did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster daily scrub ,I must say I usually don&#x27;t buy Neutrogena because I felt its for younger women.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has very sensitive skin as well as it won&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I feel like this cleanser gave my skin a very soft feel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much to wash my entire face.</li>
            <li>My face felt very soft as if I just used a exfoliate.</li>
            <li>The texture is a little thick and gritty which is just perfect for scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I have really oily and sensitive skin that is hard to find a daily scrub that won&#x27;t make me break out even more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and must say I have really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Indeed, the granules in this scrub are much smaller than those in most other scrubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s gental and not harsh on your skin!...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub for the past week</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not specifically made for acne, it definitely helps to soothe skin that&#x27;s been consistently exposed to treatments /for/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>and it actually worked really well in his skin!</li>
            <li>Indeed, the granules in this scrub are much smaller than those in most other scrubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I feel it is a little strong for a face product.</li>
            <li>I used it with warm water, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on the skin and it does not dry our my skin!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this face scrub as a gentle daily cleanser and exfoliant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was concerned because this product says it uses &amp;#34;skin-polishing microbeads&amp;#34; and these little plastic items are contaminating our water and are banned in more and more places; however, after a call to the 1-800 customer care center, I was told that the microbeads in this product are NOT plastic but are a combination of two other inert ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,i use it almost everyday, 4 times a week precisely, really easy to use product,</li>
            <li>My skin looked brighter and fresh but felt really dry.</li>
            <li>Keeping my skin clean and no more dry or dead cells, the white tea and Vitamin E boosts my skin to look &amp; feel beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Fresh feeling of feeling clean and less oily after using this product was a major plus compared to other brands and higher cost of the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very mild, hard to identify fragrance that dissipates fast once you start to scrub.</li>
            <li>It rinsed easily which surprised me since it felt very greasy and thick coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s looks fresh and less tired, smells good</li>
            <li>This is super lightweight and extremely moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The appearance of my skin is even and clear.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and this works well with keeping acne prone areas clear, as well as moisturizing with vitamin E on all my drier areas.</li>
            <li>Somehow Neutrogena created an exfoliate that not only cleans your pores very well but didn&#x27;t leave any sign of redness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a sensitive guy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get a complete 5 stars because this &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t have beads to help exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well from what I have felt so far.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let all that fool you, i have been using it for 3 nights in a row and WOW.</li>
            <li>The scrub feels sandy on the skin because of its \\&quot;skin-polishing microbeads\\&quot; but it is gentle on the face and can be used daily.</li>
            <li>I used this in combination with my Mia face brush and wow.</li>
            <li>It does not make my face oily and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try it since my skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft after I will consider buying this product</li>
            <li>When i saw that this product said it will leave your skin soft, even and radiant</li>
            <li>The only setback was that the first week when I forgot to use it a couple of times, my face was left feeling much more oily than usual.</li>
            <li>I really like the white creamy color and texture.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>After using the scrub my skin feels really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>No harsh scent is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, finding products that are gentle enough for my face is a challenge.</li>
            <li>/clean my face before bed, and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for 4 weeks now and my face looks &amp; feels soft &amp; flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We really like it for using as a daily cleaning scrub.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t felt this soft, smooth, and firm since my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The foaming formula of this daily scrub cleans my face perfectly, specially my T zone that tends to be oily at the end of the day, without leaving it dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had great results with scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past because they have been too gritty and have left my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li>I suggest that if you do NOT have sensitive skin, you put it on dry skin, rub, add a little water, rub some more, then rinse.</li>
            <li>I was just looking for a new cleanser that would not dry out my face.</li>
            <li>This is a decent facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like it as a facial scrub because I don&#x27;t find it that &amp;#34;scrub like&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a decent facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks, and it&#x27;s been really good.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this facial cleanser!!!</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry at all after using it still felt fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li>It  has a light fruity/ flowering scent to it that its not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I already use other Neutrogena products such as the Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar to wash my face, but I must say that this is my next favorite cleanser, because it’s so practical to use it by just squeezing the bottle, without worrying as to where to put the soap bar.</li>
            <li>and it is safe for me to use everyday without it have to dry out my skin!</li>
            <li>and i did notice that it left my skin soft but still pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this to anyone in need of a new face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become a new daily regiment for me.</li>
            <li>but I had not had the chance to try this new daily scrub until I received a sample of it in my Influenster box.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be oily or dry.</li>
            <li>I will be replacing my &#x27;more expensive&#x27; daily scrub for this one because I can get better results with this at half of the price.</li>
            <li>really helps with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE April 11, 2015 - I finally finished this and decided I really dislike this facial scrub, so I lowered my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>For my mixed skin, I thought it took out the extra shininess of my skin without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li>young skin feel soft and radiant as it did when I was younger.</li>
            <li>, a check of the research behind the ingredients shows that &amp;#34;acrylate cross polymer&amp;#34; is a frequent addition to many products but that &amp;#34;prolonged and repeated applications of products containing acrylate cross polymer may cause ... dermatitis.&amp;#34; which means that it can be the very cause of skin irritation you are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>My wife says that this is one of the nicer scrub that she has used, she likes the smell of white tea and the micro-granules that are gentle on the skin, comparable to ROC which she currently uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleanser left my skin feeling very soft and skin.</li>
            <li>Second its very gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Second its very gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>After using the facial cleanser, I used my usual moisturizer from Lush (called Gorgeous) as well as my usual eye cream.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle smell of white tea in it as well.  </li>
            <li>its small enough to fit in my bag for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li>I was given the product to test &amp; try for free and was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li>It left my skin clear and oil-free for about 2-3 hours ( and I have oily skin).</li>
            <li>these wrinkles are barely detectable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the Vitamin E it&#x27;s made with makes you feel as if you are applying this silky soft moisturizer to your face, but you are actually washing it!</li>
            <li>Hoping to see a product similar to this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Well it left my skin soft to the touch</li>
            <li>The directions recommend using it twice a day, but so far I&#x27;m using it only in the evening, after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup and washed my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s possible that if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and you are used to using drugs or products and are not offended by the fragrance, that this product will work well for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with white tea and vitamin E for a nourishing cleanse that leaves skin soft, even and radiant.</li>
            <li>I will definately be purchasing this product in the near future.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This product here left my skin soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>But there is barely any &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li>will say that it did leave my skin soft and felt like it exfoliated well enough</li>
            <li>You can barely feel the granules that supposedly exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>I used my sample for 2 weeks as a little goes a long way causing a rich lather that does not feel like it&#x27;s burning my face or cause a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Plus i&#x27;m really glad to have gotten a chance to try it since i tend to be wary of new products that just come out.</li>
            <li>I love that it contains a bit of Vitamin E to help moisturize the skin, but it does leave me skin feeling just a little tight.</li>
            <li>I compared this to two other exfoliating products that I regularly use: an inexpensive “natural” drug store brand that uses crushed nut shells as the exfoliating ingredient, and a higher end department store brand that bills itself as a “7-day” scrub (meaning gentle enough for daily use).</li>
            <li>My face feels much cleaner and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me as other scrubs do.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new products that won&#x27;t affect my dry skin</li>
            <li>product is gentle enough to use every day, will not leave face red or irritated, and does not overly dry skin.</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have never used this product before or even heard of it, at first i was a little skeptic because it says scrub</li>
            <li>Lastly, I haven&#x27;t had any major zits since I started with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who generally uses facial cleansers that are specifically for acne and acne issues.</li>
            <li>however I was not crazy about it because it did not really stand out from other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested other products that I was really unable to leave a review because it wasn&#x27;t a good product.</li>
            <li>I was so sad because I loved the smell &amp; how it made my face feel but due to overdrying I will not be using.</li>
            <li>The white tea and vitamin e infused product left my skin feeling deeply clean without that tight overly dry feeling.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel really soft and clean, but was not overly drying or irritating.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed my face less oily thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>and I have no dryness really has helped me a lot because black tea makes my detoxify the skin and vitamin E</li>
            <li>The scrub rinsed off easily without leaving behind a residue.  </li>
            <li>It did not dry me out nor left me oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;green tea&amp;#34; smell is not bad, but I was keenly aware of how fake it was, especially as the entire product has the consistency of a gritty shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer something a bit more toned down, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely hydrating and nourishing This get rid of old skin in a way no other cleanser does.</li>
            <li>Only a small dab is needed for a daily cleansing, which makes this an economical option.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin but some areas of my face are a bit rougher than other areas.</li>
            <li>The white tea and vitamin e don&#x27;t dry out my skin and leave it feeling soft and looking radiant.</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant not like those other acne products that have that awful strong chemical smell .</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and sensitive</li>
            <li>(By the end of the day, my skin looks pretty much the same as usual, except I do have somewhat less blackheads).  </li>
            <li>I have skin that tends to be dry, especially in the winter, and most facial scrubs make that worse.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little over a week now and really like it.</li>

            <li> Has a pleasant scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find using it to be all that pleasant an experience.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather to it and a very pleasant scent that I really liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I did because I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It smelled really good.</li>
            <li> i loved this scrub.</li>
            <li> but surprisingly this did the job.</li>

            <li> I also loved it for it use of vitamin E oils.</li>
            <li> I received a sample free from influenster and all opinions are my own!!!</li>
            <li> Not this one, this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re massaging it into your face you could feel the difference it makes I loved the feeling</li>
            <li> and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I also used this product on my fiancé and he loved it as well</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good face wash for a while</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this to all my friends as a standout product, but I would if they had oily skin since it does do a good job cleansing.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I ended up liking this skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> product is a good one to use to start.</li>

            <li> I love that it has vitamin E in it.</li>
            <li> I received the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster Scrub in my Influenster Voxbox to test.</li>
            <li> It also smells so good like a so fresh smell that i love.</li>
            <li> I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products on the market to help my skin feel smoother and look more even</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt more great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how this feels.</li>

            <li> then that it didn&#x27;t cause any more dryness</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reviewed with the help of my spouse, Ann.&lt;br /&gt;For more on environmental issues with microbeads, see a report on NPR from 2014.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product....</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> I think the Vitamin E in this is what helps the most?  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free for testing purposes,  all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> (I received this product free for testing, but all opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but didn&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> healthy skin booster scrub</li>
            <li> I had a chance to try this free sample given to me by influenster and neutrogena in exchange for my honest review and did completed my sample.</li>
            <li> as most cleanser do.  </li>
            <li> Usually many scrubs or cleansers break me out</li>
            <li> The Skin Boosters Scrub is a lightly scented cleaner that lathers nicely and uses barely-there particles to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> If you like a more thorough-feeling scrub, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and quick, and your skin will feel great.</li>
            <li> It is more of stimulating your skin.</li>
            <li> For the level of quality in scrub, Neutrogena gives ROC a run for the money and at a better value too.</li>
            <li> And I appreciate that I can use this product and my skin immediately looks better.  </li>
            <li> Also the scent is pleasant and mild, so it&#x27;s fine for men or women.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very nice, and the foam is lovely, but the moisturizing is too much</li>
            <li> , let me very clean and smooth, I own my opinion</li>
            <li> Works great and feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves a super tingly feeling, I&#x27;m pregnant and a lot bothers me but not this one.</li>
            <li> It had a light, sweet, scented smell to it which I loved.</li>
            <li> This skin booster scrub has a nice smell; almost like clean laundry</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena always worries about the health of our skin, this product received free sample size through influenster, and I liked it, has ingredients like white tea and vitamin E which are very good for the skin, about my skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean afterevery use.</li>
            <li> very clean ... to use every day...</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much!</li>

            <li> I look forward to the fresh scent of it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying it because my skin is very sensitive  </li>
            <li> “Voila”, my face is completely clean, feeling fresh, and with a lovely scent, which I believe comes from the white tea it contains.</li>
            <li> It is also very creamy and rich.</li>
            <li> Any product that requires other products to compensate for its side effects is not something I can say good things about.</li>
            <li> The price is just right too.</li>
            <li> I use this right after the gym as soon as i get home</li>
            <li> The fresh smell was enjoyable and refreshing and I typically use it to remove my makeup at night.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better than an amazing facial cleaners to clean off all that sweat, dirt, and oil that builds up during a long day of partying?</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product, I have been looking for a product to use for daily cleaning and when I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free.</li>
            <li> I have always loved all of neutrogena&#x27;s products and this new facial cleanser</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin or oily leaves your skin smooth and a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> and my face feels super soft, smooth and refreshed.  </li>

            <li> I love the smell , fresh green tea is always refreshing in your face.</li>
            <li> a small amount will do the job great.</li>
            <li> the Combination of white tea and vitamin E is not only great smelling (for a person who prefers the hypo-allergenic products) and</li>
            <li> Its the type of cleanser that leaves your face feeling super clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that have Vitamin E and White Tea, my skin feels so fresh.</li>

            <li> I have to admit to a strong preference for natural products.</li>
            <li> this product not only improved my skin by making it soft and bright</li>
            <li> Clean with out all the dry feeling of most face washes/ scrubs.</li>
            <li> Tip to the younger person: Begin a good regiment of taking care of your skin early in your life with Neutrogena . .</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so fresh, clean, and soft!</li>
            <li> so it does not exfoliate very much at all.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt super soft and had an extra amazing glow to it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the scrub, soft and gentle but it smells clean and my skin feels clean as well.  </li>
            <li> It left my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Neutrogena promises that Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub will boost three signs of healthy-looking skin: softness, evenness, and radiance.</li>
            <li> i tried the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I love to use this at the end of the day to help remove left over makeup.</li>
            <li> the Skin Booster Scrub had me come back for more...</li>
            <li> Anyways I really love the idea of white tea and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> But I do recommend to use a exfoliating glove first to take all that nastiest debris caked on your face, then use the Skin Boosters scrub with o\ without the glove.</li>
            <li> it also has vitamin E that nourish your skin leaving your face smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I got my Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub on my Influenster vox.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that it was me.</li>
            <li> I feel ready to go in the morning just by washing my face!</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> It was very calming but also woke me up !</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of my favorite Daily Scrubs.</li>
            <li> do recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s interested in buying the product.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product about a week ago</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Trying to find a a facial scrub or cleanser that works for combo skin types has been challenging.</li>
            <li> , it was the first time using it</li>
            <li> I really love this daily scrub.</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this product in my free influenster Fresca voxbox and I been using it for a week and it leaves my face smooth and fresh and also the smell is fantastic</li>
            <li> I love White Tea.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser from Influenster in the #frescavoxbox.</li>
            <li> I have no noticed a noticable &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; but I do notice after washing it off that my skin has really soft feel and looks smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different products that says it will improve the healthy of my skin and none have been as noticeable as this one.</li>
            <li> I will still be using this in the future hoping for better results</li>
            <li> When I tried Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub</li>
            <li> I love that it has white tea extract and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> After the first wash my face felt smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and I will continue using this product daily as part of my skin-caring routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product at night, I first lathered it on my face alone then used a cleansing brush to keep cleaning my face for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> At the first try, i was amazed how my blackheads on my nose were practically gone.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena’s Healthy Skin Boosters daily scrub uses microbeads to exfoliate without overly drying the skin.</li>
            <li> I either break out after washing my face with any product but this one not only made my face feel so smooth but NO BREAK OUTS!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this out because I have a pretty set and regimented skin care routine that I don&#x27;t deviate from often because of my fickle skin.  </li>
            <li> I used this product several times and I absolutely love using it for my face.</li>
            <li> It seems just slightly feminine to me, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and I suspect most buyers are going to be ladies anyway, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and I love this daily scrub also.</li>
            <li> but it packs the same punch of cleanliness with just a bit more creaminess and microbeads to exfoliate your skin with ease.</li>
            <li> Light scent, washes off easily, and the grit is not too rough so you can exfoliate without feeling like you&#x27;re using sandpaper.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and it hasn&#x27;t left my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This does not dry my skin and it leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I got to test this product complimentary thanks to Influenster, but all these opinions are my own due my testing of the product.</li>
            <li> it left my face feeling smooth and clean which i really like.</li>
            <li> I used it at the end of my day to scrub away all of the makeup that was left and to leave my skin nice and clean for the next morning.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant, not overwhelming or cloying.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft, sweet smell (not foul to the nose or the face).</li>
            <li> but after a few tries of this scrub my face felt great and the vitamin E definitely left me feeling good.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling very clean without over drying it.</li>
            <li> The smell of product is really nice compared to other washes.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t even realize this was a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; until I read some other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Wow this facial cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell of white tea is amazing and the vitamin E leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> This scrub has the effect of being a gentle exfoliation while keeping skin soft and smooth and radiant.  </li>
            <li> But the product didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily at all, but rather clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really clean and soft  ..</li>
            <li> It left my skin smooth and not dry like many others face products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> The granules in this product are so fine you will barely notice them.  </li>
            <li> thanks I  tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free,thanks to @influenster</li>
            <li> I really like the neutrogena healthy skin booster facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product and I love how it leaves my skin fresh and soft!</li>
            <li> This is not an intense scrub - very gentle, so it can be used every day.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my skin more than usual, which may have been okay if it was an effective scrub.  </li>
            <li> The smell to me is light and pleasant, slightly floral/fruity and it doesn&#x27;t linger for long after you&#x27;re done washing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for something positive to say about this product</li>
            <li> does people that have very oily skin and dry at the same time and with this skin booster my fave has not felt and looked more better..</li>
            <li> This product would have been such a big win for me if my skin wasn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Overall Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive when it comes to facial scrubs I didn&#x27;t find it to have enough scrubbing power lol.</li>
            <li> The healthy skin boosters with white tea and vitamin e made my skin feel so fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> are true and completely mine.</li>
            <li> I loved the product, as it usually happens with Neutrogena, what is promise, they do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the kind of product I want to use on my skin, but at least it neither leaves a residue, a strong odor, or strips the skin of its natural oils, so if you want an exfoliating product and haven&#x27;t developed an aversion to non-natural products, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Left my face fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Good product, is light and not greasy, the granule does work well exfoliates without leaving the tight or sensitive skin, it is left fresh and odor agrabable skin.</li>
            <li> After the second and third, I honestly feel like I left Vegas with my skin looking and feeling better than it was before.</li>
            <li> Totally buying the full size when I run out of my sample!</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase full size once I am out of face soap!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes super well and leaves my skin feeling ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> The formula leaves your skin feeling super soft and moisturized without it being oily.</li>
            <li> If I use it more than that my skin gets way too dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> (my pores are large)</li>
            <li> I use certain face washes.</li>
            <li> I do get better results with a sugar scrub though since my skin is less dry in the summer this would be a perfect product in a few months.</li>
            <li> My new skincare obsession!!</li>
            <li> This cleaner is nice for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> It may not provide as much exfoliation as you need, however, so consider applying it to a dry face if you need more exfoliating power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this new Neutrogena Skin Boosters Scrub left my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleanser but still gentle enough to use every single day.</li>
            <li> It also smells great and you can use a little in order for it to have a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy the white tea scent that escape the bottle once I opened it.</li>
            <li> i could feel really getting into my pores</li>
            <li> Having sensitive/acne prone skin, I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to face products.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really feel the granules on my finger.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I started massaging into my face that I really felt them.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub</li>
            <li> , maybe I need to use the whole line of these together.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product free from influenster to test and give my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> I tested the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters scrub free from @influenster and was surprised at how this facial cleanser actually worked.</li>

            <li> I used it for a week straight and after the week, my skin felt a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but after one week my &amp;#34;furrowed brow&amp;#34; lines, my crow&#x27;s feet, and my laugh lines were greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I suffer from very oily skin</li>
            <li> It doesn’t have as much exfoliating beads as I’m</li>

            <li> I used this product when before I went to bed so much of a difference</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle for every day use and non-drying.</li>
            <li> It was gentle</li>
            <li> I must say this cleanser leaves the sking feeling amazingly fresh and soft.</li>

            <li> I was worried that my skin would feel really oily in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , it had lathering gel texture geland left my skin smooth, no dryness.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really feel the granules on my finger.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I started massaging into my face that I really felt them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my stubborn blackheads.  </li>
            <li> white tea daily scrub has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> this product really does have a fresh scent to it, i have sensitive skin and this helped without damaging my skin</li>
            <li> I do have some-what sensitive skin on my face so even though the label on this states &#x27;daily&#x27; my skin tolerates it much better if I restrict it to once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> The first time i use it make my skin feel like new so soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great since I&#x27;ve started using Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub, and my face doesn&#x27;t become greasy after a few hours when I used this product compared to other products.</li>
            <li> The first wash made me feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft right away.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a daily face wash that keeps you feeling fresh for hours!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin because of a very strong acne medication that cleared up my acne but made my skin extremely delicate to pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> Btw love the smell and the texture, is very soft in my face and my face does not feel dry after I rinse it off.</li>
            <li> and the beads were very fine and not super abrasive.</li>
            <li> I could not love this product more!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product freaked out for the fact that my skin felt so soft!</li>
            <li> It foams slightly but not much, and rinses away cleanly and easily, leaving my skin refreshed and smooth.  </li>
            <li> his scrub is much finer and very suitable for my delicate skin which tend to be very sensitive, I used it in the morning to help my face wake up and get rid of any toxins.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves it so soft!</li>
            <li> my skin feels amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a sample of this facial scrub free in an</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase the full size to see how it really works because the sample size only got me 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Overall, the scrub leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> but I do believe having a clean face will help prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li> It left my skin looking clean</li>
            <li> , it left my skin clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li> Your skin is scrubbed and left clean.  </li>
            <li> This scrub is touted as being suitable for everyday exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This scrub is touted as being suitable for everyday exfoliation.</li>
            <li> After using it one full week I will now go ahead and purchase the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and this product really does do what it says for me.</li>
            <li> this product left my face nice &amp; soft.no dry skin!  </li>
            <li> My face seems less oily and I haven&#x27;t had as many breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a daily scrub on top of the Neutrogena daily bar !</li>
            <li> This particular product was no exception.</li>
            <li> I bought this in replace of a much more pricer option (origins Ginzing scrub) which ultimately has the same texture.</li>
            <li> good product, i used a few times and i notice a big difference in my face</li>
            <li> Personally, I thought this product was better than the one that uses nut shells as the base, but not quite as good as the department store version (however, the Neutrogena product is a FRACTION of the price, and therefore is far more</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used it three nights in a row, and each following morning my skin has felt smooth and soft but never oily.  </li>
            <li> I love the Neutrogena facial cleanser with white tea and vitamin E</li>
            <li> And while I was hesitant to try this product after receiving it for testing purposes under the concern that it wouldn&#x27;t do much for me, I was completely blown away!</li>
            <li> it has really makes my  skin radiant and soft!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this, even for guys, if you want to get that oil and crud off your face.  </li>
            <li> and it was soft and luscious!!</li>
            <li> Those who need more exfoliation may find the Neutrogena scrub to be a little lightweight.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised by how it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I use it as my daily face wash and it makes my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your skin has been completely stripped of all moisture, but at the same time it feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I felt like it did a decent job of removing my makeup and left my skin feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling so soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I like that my face feels clean, smooth and not dry or tight afterwards.</li>
            <li> Loved this product and my only 2 issues was their wasn&#x27;t any little beads inside to help with the scrubbing of my face and that my sample was too small and I wanted more.</li>
            <li> I also loved that it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> The scrub leaves my face feeling clean without drying up my already dry areas.</li>
            <li> Received it for free thanks to influester and definitely I will be buying later on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised how much I like this product.</li>
            <li> I normally have problems with &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34; and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> I normally used it with my cleansing brush</li>
            <li> I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> i normally have pretty oily and sensitive skin, but this kept it moisturized and clear during the day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already one of my favorite everyday used products.</li>
            <li> So far this is my first complete week using the face wash.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely  will be purchasing  this product just because  it did give me results and did not dried my skin or left any skin  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It has a finely grind scrub that won&#x27;t harm or hurt your skin like other scrubs do.</li>
            <li> UsuaUsually , I am not a big fan of most cleansers, because they dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I only use this when I intend to moisturize right away  </li>
            <li> It smells great thanks to the white tea, which is very subtle.</li>
            <li> This is not my first neutrogena product, so I was already having high expectations and they were definitely met.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for new products to try within the Nuetrogena line.</li>
            <li> My face was so soft and clean and didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> I also have super dry skin</li>
            <li> Several years ago I purchased [[ASIN:B003BMI628 Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]] to try and did not care for it.</li>
            <li> and I actually like this product much more than I expected to.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is gentle, even though it actually cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;People with sensitive skin will do better with the Neutrogena product as it is not particularly “rough” on the skin and the microbeads are very small and dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this face wash did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster daily scrub ,I must say I usually don&#x27;t buy Neutrogena because I felt its for younger women.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has very sensitive skin as well as it won&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I feel like this cleanser gave my skin a very soft feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use very much to wash my entire face.</li>
            <li> My face felt very soft as if I just used a exfoliate.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little thick and gritty which is just perfect for scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I have really oily and sensitive skin that is hard to find a daily scrub that won&#x27;t make me break out even more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and must say I have really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Indeed, the granules in this scrub are much smaller than those in most other scrubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s gental and not harsh on your skin!...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub for the past week</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not specifically made for acne, it definitely helps to soothe skin that&#x27;s been consistently exposed to treatments /for/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> and it actually worked really well in his skin!</li>
            <li> Indeed, the granules in this scrub are much smaller than those in most other scrubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I feel it is a little strong for a face product.</li>
            <li> I used it with warm water, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on the skin and it does not dry our my skin!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this face scrub as a gentle daily cleanser and exfoliant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was concerned because this product says it uses &amp;#34;skin-polishing microbeads&amp;#34; and these little plastic items are contaminating our water and are banned in more and more places; however, after a call to the 1-800 customer care center, I was told that the microbeads in this product are NOT plastic but are a combination of two other inert ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,i use it almost everyday, 4 times a week precisely, really easy to use product,</li>
            <li> My skin looked brighter and fresh but felt really dry.</li>
            <li> Keeping my skin clean and no more dry or dead cells, the white tea and Vitamin E boosts my skin to look &amp; feel beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Fresh feeling of feeling clean and less oily after using this product was a major plus compared to other brands and higher cost of the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very mild, hard to identify fragrance that dissipates fast once you start to scrub.</li>
            <li> It rinsed easily which surprised me since it felt very greasy and thick coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s looks fresh and less tired, smells good</li>
            <li> This is super lightweight and extremely moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> The appearance of my skin is even and clear.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this works well with keeping acne prone areas clear, as well as moisturizing with vitamin E on all my drier areas.</li>
            <li> Somehow Neutrogena created an exfoliate that not only cleans your pores very well but didn&#x27;t leave any sign of redness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a sensitive guy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get a complete 5 stars because this &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t have beads to help exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well from what I have felt so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let all that fool you, i have been using it for 3 nights in a row and WOW.</li>
            <li> The scrub feels sandy on the skin because of its \\&quot;skin-polishing microbeads\\&quot; but it is gentle on the face and can be used daily.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with my Mia face brush and wow.</li>
            <li> It does not make my face oily and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try it since my skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft after I will consider buying this product</li>
            <li> When i saw that this product said it will leave your skin soft, even and radiant</li>
            <li> The only setback was that the first week when I forgot to use it a couple of times, my face was left feeling much more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> I really like the white creamy color and texture.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> After using the scrub my skin feels really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> No harsh scent is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, finding products that are gentle enough for my face is a challenge.</li>
            <li> /clean my face before bed, and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 weeks now and my face looks &amp; feels soft &amp; flawless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> We really like it for using as a daily cleaning scrub.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t felt this soft, smooth, and firm since my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foaming formula of this daily scrub cleans my face perfectly, specially my T zone that tends to be oily at the end of the day, without leaving it dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had great results with scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past because they have been too gritty and have left my skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> I suggest that if you do NOT have sensitive skin, you put it on dry skin, rub, add a little water, rub some more, then rinse.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a new cleanser that would not dry out my face.</li>
            <li> This is a decent facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like it as a facial scrub because I don&#x27;t find it that &amp;#34;scrub like&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This is a decent facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks, and it&#x27;s been really good.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this facial cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry at all after using it still felt fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li> It  has a light fruity/ flowering scent to it that its not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I already use other Neutrogena products such as the Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar to wash my face, but I must say that this is my next favorite cleanser, because it’s so practical to use it by just squeezing the bottle, without worrying as to where to put the soap bar.</li>
            <li> and it is safe for me to use everyday without it have to dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> and i did notice that it left my skin soft but still pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this to anyone in need of a new face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become a new daily regiment for me.</li>
            <li> but I had not had the chance to try this new daily scrub until I received a sample of it in my Influenster box.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I will be replacing my &#x27;more expensive&#x27; daily scrub for this one because I can get better results with this at half of the price.</li>
            <li> really helps with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE April 11, 2015 - I finally finished this and decided I really dislike this facial scrub, so I lowered my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> For my mixed skin, I thought it took out the extra shininess of my skin without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li> young skin feel soft and radiant as it did when I was younger.</li>
            <li> , a check of the research behind the ingredients shows that &amp;#34;acrylate cross polymer&amp;#34; is a frequent addition to many products but that &amp;#34;prolonged and repeated applications of products containing acrylate cross polymer may cause ... dermatitis.&amp;#34; which means that it can be the very cause of skin irritation you are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> My wife says that this is one of the nicer scrub that she has used, she likes the smell of white tea and the micro-granules that are gentle on the skin, comparable to ROC which she currently uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleanser left my skin feeling very soft and skin.</li>
            <li> Second its very gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Second its very gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> After using the facial cleanser, I used my usual moisturizer from Lush (called Gorgeous) as well as my usual eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle smell of white tea in it as well.  </li>
            <li> its small enough to fit in my bag for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li> I was given the product to test &amp; try for free and was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> It left my skin clear and oil-free for about 2-3 hours ( and I have oily skin).</li>
            <li> these wrinkles are barely detectable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the Vitamin E it&#x27;s made with makes you feel as if you are applying this silky soft moisturizer to your face, but you are actually washing it!</li>
            <li> Hoping to see a product similar to this for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Well it left my skin soft to the touch</li>
            <li> The directions recommend using it twice a day, but so far I&#x27;m using it only in the evening, after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup and washed my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and you are used to using drugs or products and are not offended by the fragrance, that this product will work well for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with white tea and vitamin E for a nourishing cleanse that leaves skin soft, even and radiant.</li>
            <li> I will definately be purchasing this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product here left my skin soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> But there is barely any &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li> will say that it did leave my skin soft and felt like it exfoliated well enough</li>
            <li> You can barely feel the granules that supposedly exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> I used my sample for 2 weeks as a little goes a long way causing a rich lather that does not feel like it&#x27;s burning my face or cause a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Plus i&#x27;m really glad to have gotten a chance to try it since i tend to be wary of new products that just come out.</li>
            <li> I love that it contains a bit of Vitamin E to help moisturize the skin, but it does leave me skin feeling just a little tight.</li>
            <li> I compared this to two other exfoliating products that I regularly use: an inexpensive “natural” drug store brand that uses crushed nut shells as the exfoliating ingredient, and a higher end department store brand that bills itself as a “7-day” scrub (meaning gentle enough for daily use).</li>
            <li> My face feels much cleaner and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me as other scrubs do.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new products that won&#x27;t affect my dry skin</li>
            <li> product is gentle enough to use every day, will not leave face red or irritated, and does not overly dry skin.</li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before or even heard of it, at first i was a little skeptic because it says scrub</li>
            <li> Lastly, I haven&#x27;t had any major zits since I started with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who generally uses facial cleansers that are specifically for acne and acne issues.</li>
            <li> however I was not crazy about it because it did not really stand out from other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested other products that I was really unable to leave a review because it wasn&#x27;t a good product.</li>
            <li> I was so sad because I loved the smell &amp; how it made my face feel but due to overdrying I will not be using.</li>
            <li> The white tea and vitamin e infused product left my skin feeling deeply clean without that tight overly dry feeling.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel really soft and clean, but was not overly drying or irritating.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed my face less oily thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> and I have no dryness really has helped me a lot because black tea makes my detoxify the skin and vitamin E</li>
            <li> The scrub rinsed off easily without leaving behind a residue.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry me out nor left me oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;green tea&amp;#34; smell is not bad, but I was keenly aware of how fake it was, especially as the entire product has the consistency of a gritty shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer something a bit more toned down, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hydrating and nourishing This get rid of old skin in a way no other cleanser does.</li>
            <li> Only a small dab is needed for a daily cleansing, which makes this an economical option.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin but some areas of my face are a bit rougher than other areas.</li>
            <li> The white tea and vitamin e don&#x27;t dry out my skin and leave it feeling soft and looking radiant.</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant not like those other acne products that have that awful strong chemical smell .</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and sensitive</li>
            <li> (By the end of the day, my skin looks pretty much the same as usual, except I do have somewhat less blackheads).  </li>
            <li> I have skin that tends to be dry, especially in the winter, and most facial scrubs make that worse.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin depending on the weather, but I usually use normal because oily skin products dry out my skin in my T zone.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the Vitamin E being a main ingredient; since my skin is oily.</li>
            <li> I used a clean cotton swab with toner and did not have any makeup residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Is not rought like other booster scrubs , this one does the job but is soft in your skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but I could achieve something similar and less expensive by adding a smidge of baking soda to my own cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would hold up with my acne prone skin over a long period of time, but I think it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d be willing to give a try for a couple of weeks to see how it goes.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about using this new product, especially on my face.</li>
            <li> For me personally, it did not really bring anything new to other exfoliators.</li>
            <li> This product I myself can&#x27;t use on a daily only cause it leaves my skin dry after.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and usually wake up oily.  </li>
            <li> but I never last long with them.</li>
            <li> It contains vitamin E and white tea, along with water, glycerin and a number of ingredients with long, scientific names.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not wild about is the scent.</li>
            <li> Compared to other daily scrubs it did not dry my face and it was hydrated.</li>
            <li> However, I felt that it left my skin feeling dry even though it claims it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My actual skin has shown minimal improvement, but remember its only been three days</li>
            <li> ou can’t deny the importance of exfoliation, especially after a long winter when skin can be dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I struggle with overly dry and red skin so when it comes to skin care I have to be extra careful as to what I put on my face and</li>
            <li> But, that is an expensive product, and so when I got a chance to try this Neutrogena Scrub for free, I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I have seen similar products with Aveeno minus the fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and firm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any long term effects aside from a momentary smoothness to my skin after using it but as a result it probably is helping to keep acne away.</li>
            <li> And I can still see acne (relatively minor but still visible and unattractive) in the areas where I tend to breakout, so this is not a cure-all for me.</li>
            <li> This product also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin where I have small cuts, and I am able to use it both in the morning and night without it overdrying or irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I applied a very small amount ( a little goes a long way with this scrub) and then washed it off with cool water.</li>
            <li> It has a silky texture with little microbeads for gentle scrubbing, and a little is all that is required.  </li>
            <li> so therefore its a real hassel for me when it come to cleanser products that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry like the Dead Valley!!</li>
            <li> I had no dryness like other facial cleansers that I have tried</li>
            <li> it must be due to calming effects from the white tea in the product.</li>
            <li> and you only need a little to wash your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> and you need only a little amount to wash your entire face</li>
            <li> I suppose once you start using natural products it becomes hard to go back.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin &amp;</li>
            <li> Not over dry or sticky...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face to dry</li>
            <li> It  does not strip my skin or dry it out.</li>
            <li> Its not so dry anymore</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t leave it dry.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; in some areas and dry flaky in others.</li>
            <li> I noticed that if I did not put lotion afterwards my face would begin to feel and look so dry.</li>
            <li> have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry/sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products, but I worried that my face might dry out with this scrub.</li>
            <li> I have between oily &amp; too dry skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> It also didnt feel my skin dry or oily at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry like some scrubs.</li>
            <li> but I am just going to avoid applying it over my dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always follow up with a moisturizer unless it&#x27;s summer, if I don&#x27;t my skin does feel rather dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your face dry or oily.</li>
            <li> This scrub unlike others does not make my skin dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave it over dry or oily.</li>
            <li> facial scrub helps to exfoliate dead skin and she uses facial scrub 1-2 times a week so that her face will be cleanse at a deeper level.</li>
            <li> I usually just wash my face with water and apply serum to it for the soft feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> so I hardly use scrubs let alone anything new.</li>
            <li> I felt like this gave me a decent scrub, but I still think it might be too harsh for everyday use.</li>
            <li> it has and does everything i was looking for even down to the vitamin E and white tea.</li>
            <li> I felt like this gave me a decent scrub, but I still think it might be too harsh for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry at all!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling refreshed and doesn&#x27;t dry it up what so ever!</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> My skin was clearer, less red, retained moisture and glowed.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use moisturized after, and my skin STILL feels moisturized from it.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps ease the burn and soothes dry skin without any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have only been usuing the product day and night for a little over a week and already it has eleviated my dryness and flakiness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in Orlando Florida and between the hot muggy weather and the dry unrelenting heat ,you face can be left feeling dried out and tight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other product with it, which felt odd, especially not using moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product that shocked me completely as it is an exfoliate with non-abrasive microbeads or even heavy scents.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t rough like some scrubs can be.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday when I woke up, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It dispenses clear and not to thick or runny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would not really recommend this product because of the ingredient issues, but some people might think I am being too cautious.</li>
            <li> Its also a little thin, which doesn&#x27;t effect how it feels on the face, but be careful dispensing it - it comes out fast!</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel less dry.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It does it all without leaving my skin feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day in order to not try out my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is so luxurious and it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> it does leaves my skin a bit drier than other</li>
            <li> so I usually use Aveeno in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> but the beads did not breakdown like other products</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and some scrubs and other cleaners will make my skin even oilier.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my face and other scrubs</li>
            <li> this nurturing this product is two on each other</li>
            <li> I usually use it in the morning for a boost to my skin and the freshness will last though out the day.</li>
            <li> I will probobably start buying this scrub and be using this once in a while instead of my other yea too scrub.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena scrub is just like all their other products.</li>
            <li> but a little dry.  </li>
            <li> , it felt a little dry after the scrub.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;d give it was that it slightly irritated a couple dry spots that I had on my face but other</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t use it daily since it is a bit harsh to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few face washes that doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li> Floridians wear a lot of sunblock and its kinda hard to get off especially off your face.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time rinsing it off my face as it felt gelatinous to me and took effort for me to rinse it all</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the perfumey scent, otherwise I give this daily scrub two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Further, this product did not cause any dryness or interact negatively with any of my acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to put my usually after shower facial moisturizer because my skin wasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> If your cleanser doesn&#x27;t help protect your face then its not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is too watery.</li>
            <li> I feel like I break out less.</li>
            <li> There has been a slight improvement on my blackheads</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m not comfortable recommending something that feels like smearing thick gloppy shampoo on my face, with a fragrance I don&#x27;t like, that dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> and my black heads are disappearing.</li>
            <li> All opinions previously mentioned are mine.</li>
            <li> daily and an expensive exfoliant, Dermalogica Daily Exfoliant, twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The microbeads in it are a little less harsh than in other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I did not feel the typical tight, dryness</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never really had bad skin in the first place.</li>
            <li> I usually feel with other Neutrogena face washes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I used it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> i just got a little sample to review this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably wind up mixing it with just a little of the rougher scrub.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating grit is also so small that one needs to be very careful not to get it into one&#x27;s mouth or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and after one day of using this, i noticed the inflammation went down a lot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the front label says it is made with &amp;#34;white tea and vitamin e&amp;#34;, but a check of the ingredients shows that these are the very last - so the very least - ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For anyone who suffers from acne or skin that is oily to the touch, I think this product really helps to keep those issues at bay.</li>
            <li> And no allergic breakouts after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and maybe it&#x27;ll become part of my everyday skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The non harsh chemicals treat my skin well</li>
            <li> also dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes me want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> this product has changed my face drastically within just a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I have just a few days using it</li>
            <li> , i just put it on when im in the shower, lather it onto my face in circles, wait a few minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I used a dime size amount everyday for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Look forward to continue using this product as part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> It is a product that I wouldn&#x27;t use everyday but would add to my beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a scrub to take off lots of dead skin once a week, go with something else.</li>
            <li> It dried out my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to remove the dead skin in a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> I have seen less blackheads these past days</li>
            <li> It is a thin formula and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I like that it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Being an avid Vegas goer, I knew that I was going to have to suffer through some serious heat and crazy weather.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t have a nasty smell to it like some facial products do so that also was a major plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I switch from using my noraml expensive department store facial regimen and almost immediately notice results.</li>
            <li> I purposely usually buy things with Vitamin E to nourish my skin and this did just that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this irritated my skin and caused me to have a red looking rash on my face for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use anything on my face.</li>
            <li> usual scrubs do.</li>
            <li> While I do have a problem with acne, I Found that my problem areas healed faster than usual and it did not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> (blotchiness is my usual problem).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Not sure what the tea and the vitamin E do</li>
            <li> that they were small and didn’t irritate my skin from washing</li>
            <li> This scrub has replaced both my facial cleansing bar AND my weekly expensive exfoliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually prefer to have a scrub every day but with this I don&#x27;t feel like I need it.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> so I usually stick to</li>
            <li> am not sure what this product is designed to do.  </li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson and the Neutrogena brand names have usually been associated with quality products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I come late from work</li>
            <li> I use this product usually for my night time routine and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> this is an expensive product that is way over-priced for what you get: cleansing, but no exfoliation, and no benefits at all over other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I seriously didn&#x27;t have a problem with this product</li>
            <li> so my skin wouldn&#x27;t feel tight and uncomfortable but</li>
            <li> I used it to remove my master drama eyeliner, which is a little difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s very hard to find a face scrub.</li>
            <li> skin is a tough case.</li>
            <li> make my skin burn and make my eczema worse but not this product.</li>
            <li> I hate how it states it does not over dry</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent doesn&#x27;t over power while you wash.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this cleanser out because I was scared it would be over drying.</li>
            <li> The gel is so difficult to wash off</li>
            <li> It was difficult for me to change scrubs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> have used it night and day for a week, and I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I hate those nasty things!</li>
            <li> and I keep feeling horribly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a sample of this and I fell in love! It leaves my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Very nice scrub. Light scent, washes off easily, and the grit is not too rough so you can exfoliate without feeling like you&#x27;re using sandpaper. I like it!</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser.  It has a silky texture with little microbeads for gentle scrubbing, and a little is all that is required.  It cleans well, has a pleasant not-overpowering scent and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem to cause blemish problems despite what someone speculated.  I normally have problems with &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34; and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub&#x27;s ability to cleanse the skin but not irritate it.  I&#x27;ve used dozens of exfoliates on my skin, many were great.  But all left the skin a bit red from the cleaning.  Somehow Neutrogena created an exfoliate that not only cleans your pores very well but didn&#x27;t leave any sign of redness.  I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin so I was amazed that Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub didn&#x27;t even make me blush.  Also the scent is pleasant and mild, so it&#x27;s fine for men or women.  I didn&#x27;t feel too girly.  And no allergic breakouts after a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve always been a sensitive guy.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product and glad that I tried it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells so good! I enjoyed washing my face with this product. I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves it so soft! It is a big bonus that it has vitamin E and we can&#x27;t forget the white tea! I use this product usually for my night time routine and it works wonders! :) I tested Neutrogena for free but these are my own opinions about the product!</li>
            <li> Wow this facial cleanser is amazing. OnceI applied to my hands to spread on my face I saw the rich formula. I was amazed on how smooth &amp; silky it was.I have really dry skin &amp; this product left my face nice &amp; soft.no dry skin!  I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters for free. This was my honest opinion &amp; Im definitely going to keep purchasing this amazing cleanser.</li>
            <li> I tried the daily scrub and it&#x27;s pretty awesome. I washed my face with warm water and used the scrub with my konjac sponge. It smelled really good. Must&#x27;ve been the white tea? The scrub rinsed off easily without leaving behind a residue.  I also loved that it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight. I followed up with my nightly moisturizer. I will continue to use it and maybe it&#x27;ll become part of my everyday skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> So, I received this cleanser to test out for free from Influenster, and I really love it! I love that it contains a bit of Vitamin E to help moisturize the skin, but it does leave me skin feeling just a little tight. As I was rubbing the cleanser in, after wetting my face, the scrub was making my skin feel so clean &amp; fresh! It smells really, really nice, too! I do recommend for you try it out for yourself. I would use it daily, but maybe add a moisturizer to my face after cleansing it with the scrub! Now, I did test Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are completely MY own!</li>

            <li> Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser has a very nice plesant smell. It has a gel like feeling and when you put it on your face it makes your face feel so soft and healthy. I had no dryness like other facial cleansers that I have tried and I instantly noticed a big difference with my skin. I will continue using this cleanser from now on. I am very happy that I got this sample from Influenster to try out and am giving my honest opinion on this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Good product, is light and not greasy, the granule does work well exfoliates without leaving the tight or sensitive skin, it is left fresh and odor agrabable skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product was very excited when i found out they came out with a new product ! i have always used Neutrogena products for my acne and oily skin,it has always worked for me. when i got a sample of the Healthy skin booster Scrub and i applied it i could feel really getting into my pores (my pores are large) it left my face feeling smooth and clean which i really like. The smell was pleasant not like those other acne products that have that awful strong chemical smell . i would highly recommend this product it is worth the try.</li>
            <li> i received the healthy skin booster in my influenster box to try and I love it. It cleans my skin including all of my makeup. It has a really nice floral fruity fragrance that is not too much. I would definitely buy this for myself in the future. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Loved how this product made my face feel ! The vitamin E makes your skin feel silky smooth after each use! It doesn&#x27;t get a complete 5 stars because this &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t have beads to help exfoliate.  I tested out neutrogena healthy skin boosters daily scrub for free but this is truly MY opinion.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free in order to review it, and I loved it! My skin feels great since I&#x27;ve started using Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub, and my face doesn&#x27;t become greasy after a few hours when I used this product compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I like it because of the white tea and how it leaves my skin after I use it,I&#x27;m happy with the scent ant texture.&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really liked this face scrub. The fresh smell was enjoyable and refreshing and I typically use it to remove my makeup at night. It easily removed all of the makeup I had on during the day. It did not dry me out nor left me oily.&lt;br /&gt; I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive/acne prone skin, I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to face products. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and must say I have really enjoyed it. I like that my face feels clean, smooth and not dry or tight afterwards. I&#x27;m also happy to report that I have not had any breakouts or irritation. My one complaint is the perfumey scent, otherwise I give this daily scrub two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I honestly liked it when I started using it because it smells lovely.  I loved the smell because it is very refreshing especially with my scene problems. I saw the results very fast so my testing experience was overall excellent. It makes my skin feel great with the antioxidant white yes ingredients. I tester this product for free and o really do recommend it for anyone. I did enjoy testing this product out.</li>
            <li> This is a decent facial scrub. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s at the upper end of drugstore scrubs. It has a wonderful fruity scent- it smells like watermelon to me. This scrub is touted as being suitable for everyday exfoliation. Indeed, the granules in this scrub are much smaller than those in most other scrubs I&#x27;ve used. I couldn&#x27;t really feel the granules on my finger. It wasn&#x27;t until I started massaging into my face that I really felt them. I felt like this gave me a decent scrub, but I still think it might be too harsh for everyday use. I&#x27;m sticking to a couple of times a week. If you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic scrub, this one should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, all the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this in my influenster box for free to review but all my opinions are my own. That being said...I love this face wash. My skin can get really oily and this face wash did a amazing job at helping with that without drying my skin out. It has a light fresh scent nothing overpowering. All in all for someone with oily skin it&#x27;s perfect!  It has a light fresh scent nothing overpowering. I would highly recommend this facial cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the new neutrogena cleanser it has helped my skin  feel a lot smoother and glowing I also noticed my skin looks more even toned. I&#x27;m enjoying washing my face each night and leaving my skin smelling great!!!</li>
            <li> i loved this scrub. For starters, it smells delicious, very fruitty but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. It is also very creamy and rich. I love how my face feels after washing it, very smooth and I can see how healthy and good my skin looks. The vitamin E does wonders and my face is clearer, smoother, and it has it&#x27;s own glow.I used this product in the mornings right after waking up, I had a great experience with it. I tested this product for free and I have already purchased the product.</li>
            <li> This is the second Neutrogena product I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to test and review. Neutrogena promises that Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub will boost three signs of healthy-looking skin: softness, evenness, and radiance. I am happy to announce that my face is much softer, even toned, and more radiant than ever before. Further, this product did not cause any dryness or interact negatively with any of my acne treatments. It is a fantastic product that shocked me completely as it is an exfoliate with non-abrasive microbeads or even heavy scents. I used my sample for 2 weeks as a little goes a long way causing a rich lather that does not feel like it&#x27;s burning my face or cause a tingling sensation. I thoroughly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. However, this review is solely my experience.</li>
            <li> Just received my free sample from Influenster and I am so in love! Just purchased from Walgreens this week!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub my skin feels amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe I need to use the whole line of these together.</li>
            <li> I just received this product from @influenster in my #freshvoxbox as a free sample to test and review. I was just looking for a new cleanser that would not dry out my face. i tried the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser and my face was left feeling smooth and silky without the over dryness that most cleaners give. My daughter is trying to snatch this up from me... No way! I&#x27;m out to getting the full size product. Great job Neutragena. I love your products! I&#x27;m even more excited that it includes Vitamin E which I&#x27;m always on the hunt for. -</li>
            <li> This product cleanses well and has a nice scent. However, it has both methylparaben and sodium laureth sulfate. According to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database, SLS is a &amp;#34;moderate hazard&amp;#34;. It also says it contains microbeads, which are a hazard to lake and ocean waters, but it does not contain polyethylene, so the microbeads may not be the plastic kind that cause problems.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this cleanser out because I was scared it would be over drying. The cleanser left my skin feeling very soft and skin. I did not feel the typical tight, dryness I usually feel with other Neutrogena face washes.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel less dry. I have used it like 3 times in one week and I can feel the difference. I normally used it with my cleansing brush so it helps me better. Awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this product was send free for me, but my reviews are 100% honest.</li>
            <li> This cleanser literally cleanses my skin without drying my skin out, which I love. I love to use this at the end of the day to help remove left over makeup. And come on, it is dermatologist tested. I trust Neutrogena. I did receive this product free from influenster to test and give my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> This is super lightweight and extremely moisturizing.  I tried it once and got hooked on iT. The price is just right too. You get the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> I tested the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters scrub free from @influenster and was surprised at how this facial cleanser actually worked. I switch from using my noraml expensive department store facial regimen and almost immediately notice results. Now with this reasonably price and effective facial scrub my skin feels soft and smooth and effectively taking care of my acne. the Combination of white tea and vitamin E is not only great smelling (for a person who prefers the hypo-allergenic products) and my skin just feels great. I have only been usuing the product day and night for a little over a week and already it has eleviated my dryness and flakiness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this product, it&#x27;s really cleanses my skin which I like. I&#x27;m using 3 times a week at morning and I noticed how vibrating it make my face looks. I Love the freshness I felt right after using it. It was definitely the best skin regiments that&#x27;s why I trust in Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a sample of this facial scrub free in an Influenster Voxbox.&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is AMAZING!!!!! It has a very soft, sweet smell (not foul to the nose or the face). The scrub leaves my face feeling clean without drying up my already dry areas. It works well on all skin types (I have combo skin). I would recommend this product and I will be buying this. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have really oil skin so therefore its a real hassel for me when it come to cleanser products that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry like the Dead Valley!! I do have some great experience with Neutrogena but I never last long with them. BUT!! the Skin Booster Scrub had me come back for more... Well from what I have felt so far. Ahaha! Anyways I really love the idea of white tea and vitamin E. Since both leave your skin so smooth and also rejuvenates your skin cells. But I do recommend to use a exfoliating glove first to take all that nastiest debris caked on your face, then use the Skin Boosters scrub with o\ without the glove. I used with the glove!  Also I receive this awesome super duper product complimentary from Influenster for review and testing purposes.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure that I liked this product. I really like face washes that foam, so I know they are working. This product didn&#x27;t need to foam up. It felt great on my skin and after I was finished washing my face my felt great. Not over dry or sticky...but great. I used a clean cotton swab with toner and did not have any makeup residue left behind. I will buy this product again!!! I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Really nice product , you feel really soft skin</li>
            <li> Refreshing for sure! I usually just wash my face with water and apply serum to it for the soft feel on my skin. Well after washing my face with the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster Scrub I no longer need to apply my serum so far its great! I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and I like it so far! The scent if very refreshing as soon as you apply you feel it working! Thanks to the Influentser team I got to try this product for free! My opinion is my own!</li>
            <li> I saved this product specifically for the Vegas trip I was planning on taking over Memorial Day Weekend. Being an avid Vegas goer, I knew that I was going to have to suffer through some serious heat and crazy weather. What&#x27;s better than an amazing facial cleaners to clean off all that sweat, dirt, and oil that builds up during a long day of partying? I was definitely not disappointed. The first wash made me feel like a new person. My face was so soft and clean and didn&#x27;t feel dry at all. After the second and third, I honestly feel like I left Vegas with my skin looking and feeling better than it was before. I will definitely purchase this product in the future. Thanks Neutrogena for making a product that is perfect for me! *I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters for free, but all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I recently got this via Influenster VoxBox and I must say I love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face to dry and it isn&#x27;t rough like some scrubs can be. I like how it leaves my skin and the smell is amazing. One of the best scrubs I ever used. I will be buying this one soon!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. Left my face fresh and clean. It smells amazing as well. Would definitely recommend it for use of just removing make up it works well.</li>
            <li> great product, works very well for blemishes!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and smelling great. I used it for a week straight and after the week, my skin felt a lot healthier. It is a great product for a great price. I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub for free but all opinions are my own.!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but after one week my &amp;#34;furrowed brow&amp;#34; lines, my crow&#x27;s feet, and my laugh lines were greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Now these wrinkles are barely detectable. I use it *every day*and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;This works better than wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve used that cost upwards of $100.00. I love it!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Health skin Booster facial cleanser is one of the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used !!..its nice and sweet fragrance  of white tea that&#x27;s gental and not harsh on your skin!...it also has vitamin E that nourish your skin leaving your face smooth and soft you are going to love it I did!!..I was chosen  to test this product (Neutrogena Health skin Booster Daily scrub for free and all opinion are my own)</li>

            <li> The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster scrub has been great on my sensitive skin. I use it nightly to remove my make-up and it does a great job without stripping my skin like other scrubs can. The scent is also very pleasant. I got it free to try out but will be purchasing it as soon as my sample runs out</li>
            <li> Skin Feels Great after using this product for a month!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it every other day in order to not try out my skin. I tried this product for free from Influenster, too! Double score.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it leaves my face feeling nice and fresh!! I suffer from very oily skin so it helps alot.</li>
            <li> After trying the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub I have to say I’m impressed. It wasn’t too exfoliating which can sometimes trigger my acne.  It doesn’t have as much exfoliating beads as I’m used to in a scrub but surprisingly this did the job. My face felt very clear and soft after use and the smell is great! I purposely usually buy things with Vitamin E to nourish my skin and this did just that. After using it one full week I will now go ahead and purchase the larger bottle. I did receive this product complimentary to test and review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! It leaves my skin feeling flawless and beautiful. The non harsh chemicals treat my skin well and it is safe for me to use everyday without it have to dry out my skin! I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends because it treats my skin well and it is one of a kind just like me. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this cleanser in an influenster frescavoxbox. I really liked how well this lathered and it smells amazing. I have very sensitive skin and it did not break me out. I also have super dry skin and i did notice that it left my skin soft but still pretty dry. I am going to purchase the full size to see how it really works because the sample size only got me 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Love the complimentary sample i received of Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub from Influenster. After i used it the first time my skin feels fresh and smoth. Btw love the smell and the texture, is very soft in my face and my face does not feel dry after I rinse it off. Plus it contains white tea and vitamin e, wich are great for your skin, the vitamin e is a plus in my face cleaning and musturizing routine.</li>

            <li> I got my Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub on my Influenster vox. I have never used this product before or even heard of it, at first i was a little skeptic because it says scrub but yet you can&#x27;t see or feel any beads. Don&#x27;t let all that fool you, i have been using it for 3 nights in a row and WOW. My skin feels so clean, fresh and smooth. The best part is it&#x27;s has vitamin E so i know i got to bed every night with clean and healthy looking skin. Thanks Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I just received a free sample of this face wash and didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I was wrong! This face wash is amazing. I&#x27;m guessing the Vitamin E it&#x27;s made with makes you feel as if you are applying this silky soft moisturizer to your face, but you are actually washing it! I love how it makes my skin feel fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Recently received this product to review from Influenster. This product would have been such a big win for me if my skin wasn&#x27;t so sensitive. Unfortunately this irritated my skin and caused me to have a red looking rash on my face for a while. It was however, a very refreshing feeling while washing my face. Hoping to see a product similar to this for sensitive skin. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub for the past week and I like this product.  The clear scrub lathers nicely and and smells great!  I received a free sample and I definitely recommend.  Overall, the scrub leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I recently try the product for free and I could truly say that I like the product and felt good in the face and I could actually feel how it was penetrating my pore. I use it for 3 days however I would notice how my face will be extra oily after just an hour. At first I thought that it was me. But then I realize it was the product. Like it but my face didn&#x27;t. But I would recommend this to everyone. Specially those that are not combination skin or to oily.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product, I have been looking for a product to use for daily cleaning and when I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free.

            <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say that this face cleanser is the best product I&#x27;ve ever fallen in love with. Literally. Its the type of cleanser that leaves your face feeling super clean &amp; soft. I like how it also exfoliates your skin. I use it in the morning and at night. And I must say, the results are amazing. I also like that it contains white tea and vitamin E, which keeps your skin moisturized. I love the feeling of having healthy skin! I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, with Influensters, but all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> I got this as a sample from Influenster and I fell in love with it! It leaves my skin so fresh, clean, and soft! The smell of the cleaner is also so delicious! I feel ready to go in the morning just by washing my face! No make-up just my healthy skin Thanks to this product! I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing ! Highly recommended leaves my skin so soft and it has a great smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who generally uses facial cleansers that are specifically for acne and acne issues. And while I was hesitant to try this product after receiving it for testing purposes under the concern that it wouldn&#x27;t do much for me, I was completely blown away! While it&#x27;s not specifically made for acne, it definitely helps to soothe skin that&#x27;s been consistently exposed to treatments /for/ acne. It definitely helps ease the burn and soothes dry skin without any harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ll definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster daily scrub ,I must say I usually don&#x27;t buy Neutrogena because I felt its for younger women. But I was pleasantly surprised by how it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I live in Orlando Florida and between the hot muggy weather and the dry unrelenting heat ,you face can be left feeling dried out and tight. Floridians wear a lot of sunblock and its kinda hard to get off especially off your face. The Healthy Skin Booster removed the oily feeling of the sunblock and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling like my face had been sandblasted . I didn&#x27;t even need to put my usually after shower facial moisturizer because my skin wasn&#x27;t dried out. Loved this product and my only 2 issues was their wasn&#x27;t any little beads inside to help with the scrubbing of my face and that my sample was too small and I wanted more. Guess I&#x27;m off to the store to buy my own larger size bottle. I would and am definitely recommending this product to all my friends over 35.</li>
            <li> Defiantly  one of my favorite cleansers. I love Neutrogena products, and I loved that this contained Vitamin E which is great for protecting my skin from everyday harm! If your cleanser doesn&#x27;t help protect your face then its not worth it in my opinion. It also has a very pleasing fragrance, kind of helps with waking you up in the morning. I used it with warm water, a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry at all! I have normal skin. I also got the chance to try this product out free, but these are my own opinions from this experience!</li>
            <li> i love love love this product. i normally have pretty oily and sensitive skin, but this kept it moisturized and clear during the day. i received this product via influenster for testing purposes. i also tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but the opinions i stated above are in fact my own.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product because it does not feel rough to apply on as you think. It feels more like a cream than a scrub. Smells good and easy to apply. My skin feels so soft right away. I tried this as a free sample.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I purchased [[ASIN:B003BMI628 Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]] to try and did not care for it. Since then I have been using their [[ASIN:B00113HO90 Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel- 40 oz (Mega Size)]] twice per day on my face.  I love their body wash so I figured I&#x27;d give another Neutrogena face product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This white tea daily scrub has a nice fragrance.  It is the fragrance and the mild exfoliation that I like. The scrub feels sandy on the skin because of its \\&quot;skin-polishing microbeads\\&quot; but it is gentle on the face and can be used daily. The recommendation is to use twice daily.  My face did feel softer after using this.  However, I did not like the texture of the scrub when mixed with water.  I had such a hard time rinsing it off my face as it felt gelatinous to me and took effort for me to rinse it all away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE April 11, 2015 - I finally finished this and decided I really dislike this facial scrub, so I lowered my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  The gel is so difficult to wash off it feels like I have slime on my face.  This is definitely not a product I would buy and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great and feels clean and fresh. Love how it leaves your skin feeling after you&#x27;ve used it. Great to use for everyday use.</li>
            <li> So i completely love Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub. I used this in combination with my Mia face brush and wow. My skin felt super soft and had an extra amazing glow to it. I also loved it for it use of vitamin E oils. If you have any sort of scarring from acne or blemishes of any kind then vitamin E is super good for helping to clear them up. I did get this scrub for free, but everything is of my own thoughts. Plus i&#x27;m really glad to have gotten a chance to try it since i tend to be wary of new products that just come out.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a daily scrub on top of the Neutrogena daily bar ! i loved the refreshing feeling it gave my face. It was very calming but also woke me up ! I have also been using this product after i do my workout to keep my face feeling fresh after a good sweat!, After a couple days of using this product the vitamin E made my face felt brighter and my skin tone looked more even! I would recommend this product to women of all ages.  I have very sensitive skin and this worked perfectly for me. i received a sample size of this product complimentary of influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I have skin that tends to be dry, especially in the winter, and most facial scrubs make that worse. This one doesn&#x27;t. It leaves my skin with a nice tingly feeling, but not dried out. It contains vitamin E and white tea, along with water, glycerin and a number of ingredients with long, scientific names. Still, Neutrogena has a reputation for making quality products, so I feel confident in using this one. The directions recommend using it twice a day, but so far I&#x27;m using it only in the evening, after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup and washed my face. It has a light, floral scent.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used for my face. It does not make my face oily and makes my skin soft. It is fairly priced and well worth purchasing. I received my to try as a sample and went to purchase it immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has white tea and vitamin e, both of which are great antioxidants. They are also great for removing dead cells off the skin and allow for healthy cell growth. Moreover, they do wonders for collagen and skin elasticity. I used it to remove my master drama eyeliner, which is a little difficult to remove. It is a thin formula and a little goes a long way. Plus, it smells great. I tested Neutrogena healthy skin boosters daily scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a week now and really like it. I use this every night on my combination dry/oily skin and have noticed an improvement! My face seems less oily and I haven&#x27;t had as many breakouts. I really liked the scent and the Vitamin E in the scrub. Thanks to Influenster for giving me a free trial of it! The opinions voiced in this review are all my own.</li>
            <li> I could not love this product more! My skin feels very clean afterevery use. It  does not strip my skin or dry it out. I can noy wait to buy the full size product! I received a sample free from influenster and all opinions are my own!!!</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of my favorite Daily Scrubs. I use it at night and in the morning and let me tell you, I can see an improvement on my skin. I feel like I break out less. There has been a slight improvement on my blackheads but I think I have to keep using the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;These are my opinions of the product and I&#x27;m testing it for free.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s interested in buying the product.</li>
            <li> I often avoid using drugstore brands of cosmetic products, because many of them have a weird underlying chemical fragrance underneath the perfumes they put in to make it smell like white tea or whatever. This was no exception, and I felt that I was washing my face with a cheap drugstore shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also dried out my skin. After using the facial cleanser, I used my usual moisturizer from Lush (called Gorgeous) as well as my usual eye cream. I&#x27;ve been sitting here at my desk for an hour now and I keep feeling horribly itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and you are used to using drugs or products and are not offended by the fragrance, that this product will work well for you. I did like the tiny microbeads for exfoliation. They had a nice texture. But overall, I&#x27;m not comfortable recommending something that feels like smearing thick gloppy shampoo on my face, with a fragrance I don&#x27;t like, that dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; per se; it&#x27;s more of a lightly textured cleanser. It rinsed easily which surprised me since it felt very greasy and thick coming out of the tube. I also reviewed the Healthy Skin Boosters cleanser and had an issue with my skin not feeling evenly rinsed clean when I was done and I had the same problem with this product. I liked it much better and I liked the very mild exfoliating effect but I could achieve something similar and less expensive by adding a smidge of baking soda to my own cleanser.</li>
            <li> this product really does have a fresh scent to it, i have sensitive skin and this helped without damaging my skin,i use it almost everyday, 4 times a week precisely, really easy to use product, its small enough to fit in my bag for traveling purposes. i tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! I just received a free product sample from #Influenster #VoxBox. I used this product when before I went to bed so much of a difference my face was soft and refreshed and smells great. I am buying it as soon as I run out ! - See more at: http://www.neutrogena.com/product/healthy+skin+boosters+daily+scrub.do?sortby&#x3D;ourPicks#sthash.pyPsqVAh.dpuf</li>
            <li> I am testing this product and I absolutely love it. I must say that I have only used this product a couple of times but I already feel the difference in my face. Its not so dry anymore and it feels cleaner. Thank you Influenster for giving me this product to test.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely  in Love with this facewash. The scent is so luxurious and it lathers extremely well. The ingredients in this product are very impressive. After ringing I could noticeably are my skin evening and it was soft and luscious!! My new skincare obsession!! I did get to test this product but the review is truly my own!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Neutrogena products! I first started using this product about a week ago and it&#x27;s already one of my favorite everyday used products. I have acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for new products to try within the Nuetrogena line. This products smells SO nice and refreshing with the hint of the White Tea. The texture of the product is also great with it&#x27;s  non-harshening micro-scrubers and Vitamin E. I was a little worried about the Vitamin E being a main ingredient; since my skin is oily. But the product didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily at all, but rather clean and soft. I am only about a week in into this product but my skin is already noticeably clearer, softer and glowing. I love this product and WILL be purchasing it on my own. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> So far this is my first complete week using the face wash. I like the way it feels on my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave it dry. Feels smooth and soft, I like that I can go with out touching up makeup.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser: I LOVED this. As a long-time user of the Neutrogena line I can attest it never disappoints. This particular product was no exception. Like most Neutrogena products I tried my skin was left feeling clean, fresh and healthy after one use. The formula is clear and light with a nice lather and a fantastic scent! It&#x27;s made with white tea and vitamin E for a nourishing cleanse that leaves skin soft, even and radiant. It&#x27;s gentle for every day use and non-drying. Overall Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products free of charge in exchange for an honest review. I was not financially compensated to write these reviews. All opinions stated are entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I was impressed. My skin is conflicted. It doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be oily or dry. Trying to find a a facial scrub or cleanser that works for combo skin types has been challenging. Skin Booster Daily scrub cleaned my face and made my skin feel so good. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; in some areas and dry flaky in others. Great stuff. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own. I&#x27;ve tested other products that I was really unable to leave a review because it wasn&#x27;t a good product. Not this one, this is good stuff. Go get it !</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about using this new product, especially on my face. I don&#x27;t usually use anything on my face. I have to say that I liked this face scrub. My skin was softer and healthier looking. I would definitely recommend this product and will be using it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tested the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster Scrub for free from influenster but all of the opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own and 100% honest. I absolutely loved Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub. It smells wonderful and feels so silky when you apply it. It leaves your skin feeling soft. I attribute all the great results to the white tea and vitamin e  formula to boost the 3 signs of healthy skin. The appearance of my skin is even and clear. It cleansed my skin without over-drying it. It was gentle yet it gave me a nice deep clean feeling, removing all dullness from my face. Loved it! I used it for a little over a week and I totally saw a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Neutropenia Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub helps to remove the dry flakly skin especially associated with winter.follow us usage with a really good body wash (Dove, Philosophy) and you&#x27;re sure to get good results. I use with a wash cloth or tulle scrubbie. I do get better results with a sugar scrub though since my skin is less dry in the summer this would be a perfect product in a few months.</li>
            <li> I was able tl try this product for free thanks to Influenster. I must say this cleanser leaves the sking feeling amazingly fresh and soft. It also has a great scent! I will definately be purchasing this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> I recently got a sample of this product and I decided to try it since my skin is so sensitive and I really like it. While you&#x27;re massaging it into your face you could feel the difference it makes I loved the feeling and it smells so good. My skin felt so soft after I will consider buying this product</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it was the first time using it and it make my face feel clean an fresh..&lt;br /&gt;I also like it because it has Vitamin E . It was a sample from Influenster ( all products send by  Influenster are free and for testing only ) </li>

            <li> I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free because of Influenster. Although I was so loving this product at the beginning I noticed that if I did not put lotion afterwards my face would begin to feel and look so dry. I hate how it states it does not over dry but in my case it deff. did. I deff. have dry skin so I was hoping this product would work for me but it did not..  I was so sad because I loved the smell &amp; how it made my face feel but due to overdrying I will not be using. I would advise people with oily skin to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Is a great product for the face..I got a small sample of this product in my free influenster Fresca voxbox and I been using it for a week and it leaves my face smooth and fresh and also the smell is fantastic</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub from Influenster and I have to say I love the way it makes my face feel clean. The product smells great and it hasn&#x27;t left my skin feeling dry. I love White Tea.</li>
            <li> I love the way this scrub smells! Maybe its the white tea, I don&#x27;t know but it smells fantastic. It makes me want to use it everyday. It also leave my skin feeling clean and fresh. I don&#x27;t particularly like it as a facial scrub because I don&#x27;t find it that &amp;#34;scrub like&amp;#34; so I use it as a facial cleanser and use a different facial scrub 3-4 times a week. If you have sensitive skin then this is a good facial scrub for you but since my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive when it comes to facial scrubs I didn&#x27;t find it to have enough scrubbing power lol. Either way it&#x27;s a nice facial cleanser and I would use it again.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product freaked out for the fact that my skin felt so soft! i couldn&#x27;t believe it! i use it every morning!&lt;br /&gt;I received this awesome product complimentary from Influenster for testing &amp; reviewing purposes. these are MY own honest opinion towards the product</li>
            <li> I love !!! This product is amazing it leaves your skin so smooth and refreshed. Works great on oily skin absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li> When i saw that this product said it will leave your skin soft, even and radiant i figured i&#x27;d let the product speak for itself. I used it at the end of my day to scrub away all of the makeup that was left and to leave my skin nice and clean for the next morning. I used about a quarter size amount of the product and lathered it on my damp skin. The white tea and vitamin e infused product left my skin feeling deeply clean without that tight overly dry feeling. The best part was that it actually left my skin radiant! I had a beutiful glow to my skin. I recieved this complimentary product from Influenster to test and give my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel so silky smooth. I use it everytime i shower and i just love it. I love how it does not dry out my skin like usual scrubs do. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> this product has changed my face drastically within just a few days of using it. i use it in the shower almost every day, and follow it with a coffee scrub. i had some irritation on the left side of my face from pollen allergies (im guessing) and after one day of using this, i noticed the inflammation went down a lot! i could still see it but it was definitely not as noticeable as it was before i used this face wash. it must be due to calming effects from the white tea in the product. definitely recommend! * i received this product complimentary from Influenster, but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Just got a sample of this via Influenster to try out and I can say that it is super nice!  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot as it lathers up a lot!  The smell of white tea is amazing and the vitamin E leaves my skin so soft.  I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate it at all! I would recommend this to anyone who has very sensitive skin as well as it won&#x27;t irritate it.  I will definitely be putting this on my list of go tos for my face wash routine!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for two weeks and its great! I got this as a sample to try from Influester At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying it because my skin is very sensitive  but this is now one of my favorite products! It left my skin feeling so fresh and clean. My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry at all after using it still felt fresh the next morning. It also as a nice light scent to it so I like that it&#x27;s not strong at all. You don&#x27;t even need alot of the product a small amount will do the job great.</li>
            <li> I got this complimentary from influenster and absolutely loved how the scrub left my face feeling. It left my face feeling soft and refreshed. I used it everyday when I woke up, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Since the first time I used this scrub I was pretty satisfied. I applied a very small amount ( a little goes a long way with this scrub) and then washed it off with cool water. My face immediately felt very fresh and clean. I felt some tingling but experienced no redness. I did not experience much change with the blemishes that I had at the time but I do believe having a clean face will help prevent future breakouts. I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m pretty impressed, I like how clean and fresh I feel after I use it. Received it for free thanks to influester and definitely I will be buying later on.</li>
            <li> I have just a few days using it and I absolutely love it, wonderful, I can feel the difference already and my black heads are disappearing. I received the items free for trying and reviewing purposes thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 days now and I&#x27;m surprised how much I like this product. The white tea and vitamin e don&#x27;t dry out my skin and leave it feeling soft and looking radiant. It&#x27;s become a new daily regiment for me. I did get this product for free from Influenster for testing but, these are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> I just started using this about four days ago and I was already very satisfied with the initial result. My face felt so fresh and clean after the first wash. This is not my first neutrogena product, so I was already having high expectations and they were definitely met. My actual skin has shown minimal improvement, but remember its only been three days and I&#x27;ve never really had bad skin in the first place. This is great for prevention, as it has white tea in it, I was so excited about that.&lt;br /&gt;I actually received this for in order to review but my opinions are my my own and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a daily face wash that keeps you feeling fresh for hours!</li>
            <li> Received a sample of Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser from Influenster in the #frescavoxbox. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I am very pleased with it! My skin feels softer and less dry. While I do have a problem with acne, I Found that my problem areas healed faster than usual and it did not cause any breakouts. Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in replace of a much more pricer option (origins Ginzing scrub) which ultimately has the same texture. This one has a pleasant smell being that is has white tea in it. I have had a conditioner from John Frieda with white tea in it and this reminds me of the same smell. Neutrogena does not disappoint once again. This scrub has the effect of being a gentle exfoliation while keeping skin soft and smooth and radiant.  There is no bit of tightness or dryness to the skin. I have no noticed a noticable &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; but I do notice after washing it off that my skin has really soft feel and looks smooth.  I like this and would repurchase instead of the Origins scrub. If i was feeling like spending money I would go with the Origins but this will do for now.</li>
            <li> A must have. Love the way it smells. Love how it makes my skin feel soft n smooth.</li>
            <li> This is great as a daily cleanser, it great at removing dead skin. It leaves your doing feeling squeaky clean, without over drying. It&#x27;s extremely hydrating and nourishing This get rid of old skin in a way no other cleanser does. I got a free sample in my influenster box to sample and review. I have had to buy a full size one. I feel like this is a dupe for my estee lauder one which retails $25.00.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I&#x27;m one of does people that have very oily skin and dry at the same time and with this skin booster my fave has not felt and looked more better.. I really do recommend it.</li>

            <li> Lately my main skin concern has been redness and immediately upon washing my face with Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub, I noticed a difference. My skin was clearer, less red, retained moisture and glowed. It looked refreshed. I&#x27;ve started incorporating it into my daily routine. I was given the product to test &amp; try for free and was skeptical at first.

            <li> I really, really like this product! It&#x27;s a good cleanser but still gentle enough to use every single day. I&#x27;m obsessed with this. I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I use and this has been nothing but amazing. I highly recommend it. I was sent a sample of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub to test out, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I prefer non scented products, but this one wasn&#x27;t as much as a strong scent. I really did enjoy the white tea scent that escape the bottle once I opened it. Fresh feeling of feeling clean and less oily after using this product was a major plus compared to other brands and higher cost of the price.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks, and it&#x27;s been really good. I like Neutrogena products, but I worried that my face might dry out with this scrub. This product does the opposite. It moisturizes super well and leaves my skin feeling ridiculously soft. The only setback was that the first week when I forgot to use it a couple of times, my face was left feeling much more oily than usual. Overall it smells great, does a great job at eliminating blackheads and acne, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. A lot of people keep telling me I look like I&#x27;m glowing or that my foundation looks great, when in fact I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup, so the scrub is clearly working.

            <li> I love this product. It made my skin feel really soft and clean, but was not overly drying or irritating. I used this daily for over a week and you only need a little to wash your entire face and neck. It has a nice lather to it and a very pleasant scent that I really liked. I will definitely continue to use this product as part of my daily skin care routine.

            <li> The healthy skin boosters with white tea and vitamin e made my skin feel so fresh and soft. I love how gentle it is, i just put it on when im in the shower, lather it onto my face in circles, wait a few minutes and then rinse. Within a couple of minutes i can start to feel my skinf getting more clean and soft. I have always loved all of neutrogena&#x27;s products and this new facial cleanser does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a free sample courtesy of influenster for testing purposes, my opinions are genuine and my own.</li>

After 2 weeks my skin looks more even toned and not blotchy (blotchiness is my usual problem).  I really like the white creamy color and texture.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like my skin is getting scratched or irritated my this product.  So far I love the results I see from using this scrub.

            <li> I loved this product so much! I had never tried it before , I had never seen this product before ether. I&#x27;m so glad influenster gave me the opportunity to have this product. I was really happy the way it feels on your skin 😁 I really like it and I recommend it very much ! It&#x27;s super affordable as well 😁👌</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it makes my skin feel soft and it smells great! I have normal skin and this product really does do what it says for me. I have tried lots of different products that says it will improve the healthy of my skin and none have been as noticeable as this one. I received a free sample of this Daily Scrub from Influenster but I have already purchased myself a full sized product and I can&#x27;t wait to see how amazing my skin will continue to feel.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product and I love how it leaves my skin fresh and soft! My skins feels great aftee each time I use it especially after I had used makeup.

            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I have very oily skin, and usually wake up oily.  But with this skin booster scrub, I woke up feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is nice for sensitive dry skin. The formula leaves your skin feeling super soft and moisturized without it being oily. I tested this product for free but this is my honest opinion. I will be buying this for everyday use. I loved it.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it smelled and also liked how it included vitamin E and tea. its supposed to leave your skin feeling very smooth after you use it but that didn&#x27;t really work on me. I have very sensitive skin and I still had to hydrate my skin after using it. what I did like was that you don&#x27;t have to use a great amount on your face and it does the job. after though my skin did have a nice glow to it and it looked very flawless. I will still be using this in the future hoping for better results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product thanks to Influenster and all opinions are true and completely mine.</li>
            <li> I love anything that will make my face feel smoother and hydrated. When I tried Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub I automatically gave it a 10! Compared to other daily scrubs it did not dry my face and it was hydrated. I suffer from oily skin and this scrub did the trick. I love that it has white tea extract and Vitamin E. I was able to try this product thanks to influenster for the free testing. All opinions previously mentioned are mine.</li>
            <li> After using this scrub I really like it. I like the smell of the scrub, soft and gentle but it smells clean and my skin feels clean as well.  After using the scrub my skin feels really soft and silky. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> This smelled nice and left my face feeling clean and soft; would recommend to others ! :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing. It smells great and leaves a super tingly feeling, I&#x27;m pregnant and a lot bothers me but not this one. Also when I use it at night I don&#x27;t feel oily in the morning like with most face washes. This product is great if you want a fresh feeling. Personally I liked it and I received it in my fresabox from influenster and once I finish it I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll purchase it.</li>
            <li> So in love with this product!!! Gentlest cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product for reviewing purpuse via Influester. I loved the product, as it usually happens with Neutrogena, what is promise, they do. It leaves your skin totally fresh and awake, sort ot speak, and it&#x27;s was very good on my oily skin, leaving it soft too.  Disclaimer: Althought i recevied this for free, this is my personal and opinión regarding the product.</li>
            <li> All my life I struggle finding the perfect face scrub for my skin type. I have between oily &amp; too dry skin. This product here left my skin soft and glowy. It has a Nice scent once you apply on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This was sent to me for free to try out from Influenster, this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> So i had to try this once i got it! The smell of it smelled so great. I really loved this product i was actually surprised, but it made my skin feel soft and it made my redness go lighter which i was happy about. I seriously didn&#x27;t have a problem with this product and i really do recommend it.</li>
            <li> i use this evey morning when and love how much it refreshes my face and how it makes my face look so much brighter.</li>
            <li> one of the  best scrubs i have tried on my skin. it leaves it silky smooth and smelling fresh! the best product yet.</li>
            <li> Amazing product making my skin feel soft and smooth and love the ingredients especially vitamin e which help my skin looking great and glowing</li>
            <li> Really the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Leaves my skin soft and fresh.  Got this for free to try and I know this will be part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing product great for all age, remove completely the make up from my face, without leaving my face dry.  Thanks to Influenster I have the opportunity to try this great product.</li>
            <li> I used a dime size amount everyday for 2 weeks. After the first wash my face felt smoother.  After 1 week, my skin became more even and radiant. I love the smell and I will continue using this product daily as part of my skin-caring routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my skin more than usual, which may have been okay if it was an effective scrub.  But there is barely any &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to it so it does not exfoliate very much at all.  The scent was okay, but it wasn&#x27;t great.  I&#x27;m looking for something positive to say about this product but I can&#x27;t.  Any product that requires other products to compensate for its side effects is not something I can say good things about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had great results with scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past because they have been too gritty and have left my skin too dry.  Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub has a much more fine texture and rinses well.  Only a small dab is needed for a daily cleansing, which makes this an economical option.  No harsh scent is an added bonus.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. *Update* My skin feels very smooth, and I am impressed with this scrub after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> This scrub leaves my skin so soft, I find myself unconsciously touching my face over and over to enjoy the feel. The grit/abrasive is super-fine, like powdered sugar. Smells pleasant, not overwhelming or cloying.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 weeks and I am very impressed. I have been using it as my daily routine and my skin has improved. My face is a combination oily/dry skin and since I have been using this product it has helped. My face feels much cleaner and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me as other scrubs do. I really like the product. I was able to test this product free from influenster and it was amazing to be able to use something that helped improve my skin.</li>
            <li> good product, i used a few times and i notice a big difference in my face it&#x27;s looks fresh and less tired, smells good and you need only a little amount to wash your entire face, It has a white tea and vitamin e good products to take care of our skin&lt;br /&gt;i received this product a sample for testing purpose</li>
            <li> I like the product becouse it s contains antioxidant White Tea and Vitamin E ,,and its smell great .  Leaves my skin really clean and soft  .. but a little dry.  I recomended and I will buy it.  I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It thoroughly cleanses, and has noticeably improved my skin texture.i do recomend this product i saw results and i will continue to buy this skin booster scrub! thanks I  tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free,thanks to @influenster</li>
            <li> Never used this product before. After using it I fell in love with the product. This does not dry my skin and it leaves it nice and soft. It could be because of the white tea and the vitamin e that&#x27;s in it. I tested this product for free and I am glad i did.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild scrub.  Has a pleasant smell, not too strong and is not too abrasive. It left my skin looking clean and I felt a nice tingle.  Not sure what the tea and the vitamin E do but I&#x27;m sure they do no harm.</li>
            <li> I used this product at night, I first lathered it on my face alone then used a cleansing brush to keep cleaning my face for about 5 minutes. I used a toner and repairing lotion after as well as I do with every cleanser. I feel like this cleanser gave my skin a very soft feel. I have very dry skin, and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use moisturized after, and my skin STILL feels moisturized from it. I love that it has Vitamin E in it because Vitamin E is something I&#x27;ve found that has always helped my skin keep its natural glow, so it&#x27;s nice that its in this cleanser. This cleanser also has tea tree oil. Ive used tea tree oil before to get rid of acne and it helped my skin a lot, the fact that its in this cleanser along with the vitamin E makes it an all in one product! I also used this product on my fiancé and he loved it as well and it actually worked really well in his skin! I received this product for free to test, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 3 days ago and I really liked how it turned out!  The smell is pretty good not so over powering..  It leaves my face feeling refreshed. And all nice and smooth I have been using it twice a day because I love how refreshed I feel all day and I like that at night also. I have seen less blackheads these past days and that&#x27;s awesome! I hate those nasty things! I have also noticed my face less oily thanks to this product. Thanks Neutrogena you always make great products! I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster Daily Scrub for free and all of these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant scent, not overpowering. Makes your skin look radiant and it&#x27;s not drying.  It brightens and cleans. Has a nice lather. A little goes a long way.  What I like about it is it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your skin has been completely stripped of all moisture, but at the same time it feels clean and refreshed.  I would buy this product in the future. #HealthySkinBoosters  I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Perfect face wash for everyday use!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about this product but it surprised me!!. It left my skin smooth and not dry like many others face products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so this product is just perfect for me, but without overdrying my skin. Sometimes, I come late from work and I don’t do my daily cleansing routine as I always do, so I just apply it, wash my face, and “Voila”, my face is completely clean, feeling fresh, and with a lovely scent, which I believe comes from the white tea it contains. I already use other Neutrogena products such as the Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar to wash my face, but I must say that this is my next favorite cleanser, because it’s so practical to use it by just squeezing the bottle, without worrying as to where to put the soap bar. Oh, and did I mention it contains Vitamin E?. This is a PLUS in a cleanser, since Vitamin E softens and hydrates the skin. I’ll give this product five stars!.&lt;br /&gt;I receive this from @Influenster for testing purposes #HealthySkinBoosters</li>
            <li> I really liked this face wash and am very picky. My face will get a rash of I use certain face washes. It left my face feeling clean and smooth. I thought it had a nice smell. I revived this as a free trail sample from influenster and i would buy it and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to being on telling you guys how amazing this stuff is! I had been looking for a good face wash for a while and i finally found it. it has and does everything i was looking for even down to the vitamin E and white tea. It leaves your skin feeling super healthy and smooth! this stuff is excellent, i actually was sent this to test it out and didn&#x27;t think i was gonna like it but its been awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! It is so gentle on the skin and it does not dry our my skin! I use it twice a day, day and night to remove my makeup and wash away overnight oil! It is very clean and refreshing and smells great! I love the Vitamin E for healthy skin! *I tested this product for free and this review is my HONEST OPINION</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow. Gentle. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Great value.&lt;br /&gt;This scrub does a nice job of cleansing and exfoliating my skin. The microbeads in it are a little less harsh than in other products I&#x27;ve used but they still get the job done. I only use this when I intend to moisturize right away  it does leaves my skin a bit drier than other scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very mild, hard to identify fragrance that dissipates fast once you start to scrub. Its also a little thin, which doesn&#x27;t effect how it feels on the face, but be careful dispensing it - it comes out fast! tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product! For my mixed skin, I thought it took out the extra shininess of my skin without drying it out too much. For anyone who suffers from acne or skin that is oily to the touch, I think this product really helps to keep those issues at bay. It also smells great and you can use a little in order for it to have a lasting effect. I got to test this product complimentary thanks to Influenster, but all these opinions are my own due my testing of the product.</li>
            <li> This formula cleansed my skin without over drying it.  Leaving my skin looking softer and radiant.  Look forward to continue using this product as part of my everyday routine. I tested this product for free as part of my #Influester Fresca Vox, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I like to use this product while I am taking a shower to cleanse my face. It had an amazing scent and it feels really good. I have acne prone skin and this product has been amazing so far. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of receiving Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own. I think this product is great. It leaves your face clean and looking healthy. It also smells great! I tend to get a bit of oily skin around this time of season and this cleanser did a great job removing the oil. However, I felt that it left my skin feeling dry even though it claims it won&#x27;t. I recommend this product to someone who has really oily skin. Overall it&#x27;s still a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> The product smells great! A lil to watery for me. This product I myself can&#x27;t use on a daily only cause it leaves my skin dry after. My skin looked brighter and fresh but felt really dry. I love that it has vitamin E in it. A lil goes a long way. I tested NeutrogenaMHealthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster Scrub in my Influenster Voxbox to test. I have somewhat sensitive skin so I usually use Aveeno in my daily routine. I have normal to oily skin depending on the weather, but I usually use normal because oily skin products dry out my skin in my T zone. I am very particular in my scrubs because I like them to be light and not oily since my skin can easily breakout. The scent was very light and not overpowering which is nice and the beads were very fine and not super abrasive. The beads were mixed with me because I did like that they were small and didn’t irritate my skin from washing but the beads did not breakdown like other products might and I did catch a bead in the corner of my eye…OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it did leave my skin soft and felt like it exfoliated well enough however I was not crazy about it because it did not really stand out from other products I have used. The smell was nice but I have seen similar products with Aveeno minus the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this to all my friends as a standout product, but I would if they had oily skin since it does do a good job cleansing. For me personally, it did not really bring anything new to other exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I really like the neutrogena healthy skin booster facial cleaner. The first time i use it make my skin feel like new so soft and fresh. It also didnt feel my skin dry or oily at all. It also smells so good like a so fresh smell that i love. I definately reccomend this product.I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub and was satisfied.  It did leave my skin feeling clean and smooth however, it felt a little dry after the scrub.  I used an additional moisturizer so my skin wouldn&#x27;t feel tight and uncomfortable but it gets the job done.  My skin smelled nice and healthy.  It is a product that I wouldn&#x27;t use everyday but would add to my beauty routine.  I tried this sample for free but was satisfied with how it worked.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products on the market to help my skin feel smoother and look more even and this product by far has done the best at helping me get the results that I seek!  I used this product as directed by the packaging and within a week I noticed healthier softer looking skin.  My skin has never felt more great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena always worries about the health of our skin, this product received free sample size through influenster, and I liked it, has ingredients like white tea and vitamin E which are very good for the skin, about my skin, let me very clean and smooth, I own my opinion</li>
            <li> Love how this feels. It smells great thanks to the white tea, which is very subtle. I love how it does not feel like it has tons of chemicals. At the first try, i was amazed how my blackheads on my nose were practically gone. It cleared up face and made it look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love how this scrub left my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I hardly use scrubs let alone anything new. but after a few tries of this scrub my face felt great and the vitamin E definitely left me feeling good. Didn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry like some scrubs. the product was pretty gentle on my skin didn&#x27;t cause any reaction, which tells me that it has a good formula for those with sensitive skin. I like this product  and i would recommend it. I received healthy skin boosters for free by influenster and this is my own opinion of the product!!!</li>
            <li> When using this product you can automatically feel the difference. I love the smell and everything. I think it has a lot to do with the white tea and vitamin E. I was really lucky to try  Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free from influenster but this review is entirely based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> I use some products to help clean and control my oily face, but i didnt see the result i wanted. Then i started using Neutrogena Healthy Skin Booster once a day, for three days. I started to notice that my friends and family started saying that my face look cleaner. Now i used it every day because it keeps your face smooth and oil-free and it has a nice aroma. It has vitamin A and white tea. What i like about this product is that i got it free and definitely would continue buying this product!!</li>
            <li> I was already a huge fan of Neutrogena products but I had not had the chance to try this new daily scrub until I received a sample of it in my Influenster box. I was not disappointed again. The foaming formula of this daily scrub cleans my face perfectly, specially my T zone that tends to be oily at the end of the day, without leaving it dry afterwards. I love the subtle smell of white tea in it as well.  I have been using it every day now and I like it a lot. I will be replacing my &#x27;more expensive&#x27; daily scrub for this one because I can get better results with this at half of the price.</li>
            <li> If I could I&#x27;d give this product 4.5 stars! I really liked it, it made my skin feel so soft! It definitely didn&#x27;t have a nasty smell to it like some facial products do so that also was a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;d give it was that it slightly irritated a couple dry spots that I had on my face but other then that it didn&#x27;t cause any more dryness then I already have.&lt;br /&gt;I still plan on using this product but I am just going to avoid applying it over my dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product for free to test and these opinions are 100% my own!*</li>
            <li> What can I say about this amazing product. It has a finely grind scrub that won&#x27;t harm or hurt your skin like other scrubs do. It dispenses clear and not to thick or runny. I like the ingredients it has white tea for antioxidants and has vitamin E. It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin or oily leaves your skin smooth and a healthy glow. I was sent this product to test out for free by Influenster.</li>
            <li> I do have some-what sensitive skin on my face so even though the label on this states &#x27;daily&#x27; my skin tolerates it much better if I restrict it to once or twice a week.  If I use it more than that my skin gets way too dry and irritated.  In between using the scrub I use the Healthy Skin Boosters Cleanser gel that they also make and is great for daily cleansing.  The scrub is great for occasional deep-down cleansing, using gentle micro-beads to help scrub away oil, dirt and dead skin cells. The smell to me is light and pleasant, slightly floral/fruity and it doesn&#x27;t linger for long after you&#x27;re done washing.  It foams slightly but not much, and rinses away cleanly and easily, leaving my skin refreshed and smooth.  I always follow up with a moisturizer unless it&#x27;s summer, if I don&#x27;t my skin does feel rather dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have to admit to a strong preference for natural products. I use [[ASIN:B001V9LUO4 Dr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream, 1.7-Ounce Box]]when I want a facial scrub. But, that is an expensive product, and so when I got a chance to try this Neutrogena Scrub for free, I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it left my skin clean without being stripped. However, I didn&#x27;t find using it to be all that pleasant an experience. The &amp;#34;green tea&amp;#34; smell is not bad, but I was keenly aware of how fake it was, especially as the entire product has the consistency of a gritty shampoo. The exfoliating grit is also so small that one needs to be very careful not to get it into one&#x27;s mouth or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never thought about the actual consistency and content of exfoliators before using this product.  I&#x27;d never been concerned about getting any into my mouth or eyes when I&#x27;ve used a product that uses oatmeal or almond for exfoliation. I suppose once you start using natural products it becomes hard to go back. Still, this facial cleanser does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s not the kind of product I want to use on my skin, but at least it neither leaves a residue, a strong odor, or strips the skin of its natural oils, so if you want an exfoliating product and haven&#x27;t developed an aversion to non-natural products, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent doesn&#x27;t over power while you wash. This is not an intense scrub - very gentle, so it can be used every day. If you are looking for a scrub to take off lots of dead skin once a week, go with something else. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel. My face hasn&#x27;t felt this soft, smooth, and firm since my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT ME&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a tough case. I&#x27;m in my 40s, I have rosacea, and I&#x27;m allergic to makeup and sulfates in soaps. As you can imagine, finding products that are gentle enough for my face is a challenge. Before I tried this scrub, I was using Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar (the see-through orange bar) daily and an expensive exfoliant, Dermalogica Daily Exfoliant, twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- This scrub has replaced both my facial cleansing bar AND my weekly expensive exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;- My face feels so soft and firm. It&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;- The scrub smells wonderful. I look forward to the fresh scent of it.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t have to use very much to wash my entire face. The tube has lasted a month and still has about a third of the tube to go.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s extremely gentle. It doesn&#x27;t trigger my rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this face scrub as a gentle daily cleanser and exfoliant.</li>
            <li> ou can’t deny the importance of exfoliation, especially after a long winter when skin can be dry and flaky. We all want that “Spring glow” and the best way to get that is via an exfoliating product. Neutrogena’s Healthy Skin Boosters daily scrub uses microbeads to exfoliate without overly drying the skin. I compared this to two other exfoliating products that I regularly use: an inexpensive “natural” drug store brand that uses crushed nut shells as the exfoliating ingredient, and a higher end department store brand that bills itself as a “7-day” scrub (meaning gentle enough for daily use). The Neutrogena product held up well next to both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with sensitive skin will do better with the Neutrogena product as it is not particularly “rough” on the skin and the microbeads are very small and dissolve quickly. Those who need more exfoliation may find the Neutrogena scrub to be a little lightweight. I suggest that if you do NOT have sensitive skin, you put it on dry skin, rub, add a little water, rub some more, then rinse. If you have sensitive skin, wet your face before applying the product. Personally, I thought this product was better than the one that uses nut shells as the base, but not quite as good as the department store version (however, the Neutrogena product is a FRACTION of the price, and therefore is far more economical.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is gentle enough to use every day, will not leave face red or irritated, and does not overly dry skin. It may not provide as much exfoliation as you need, however, so consider applying it to a dry face if you need more exfoliating power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed with the help of my spouse, Ann.&lt;br /&gt;For more on environmental issues with microbeads, see a report on NPR from 2014.</li>

            <li> I love this product. I recieved it in a fresca vox box and i was so happy because my skin has been on the fritz. I go to gym a lot and ive been breaking out and my skin has been oily. I use this right after the gym as soon as i get home and my face feels super soft, smooth and refreshed.  So happy i came across this.</li>
            <li> really helps with dry skin.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I usually prefer to have a scrub every day but with this I don&#x27;t feel like I need it. I got this as a sample to try for free and I am never going back! My skin is brighter, more even toned, and it smells really good too!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product free from Influenster but all of the following opinions are my own. With that being said, I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week or so and I am loving the results. I have normal skin but some areas of my face are a bit rougher than other areas. After use of this product I noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin. My whole face has a nice, smooth, even texture. I also really liked the smell of this product as well. It had a light, sweet, scented smell to it which I loved. Not too strong at all. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.. I either break out after washing my face with any product but this one not only made my face feel so smooth but NO BREAK OUTS! Although I only got to try a sample through influenster I am eager for my bi weekly beauty products shopping! This is definitely on the list..the vitamin e makes my skin feel so refreshed !</li>
            <li> After using this scurb my skin felt amazing!  Not only does it smell great but it leaves your skin feeling smooth and very clean.  I think the Vitamin E in this is what helps the most?  Not sure but I highly recommend this.  I have oily skin and it worked out nicely.  I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. It left my skin clear and oil-free for about 2-3 hours ( and I have oily skin). I felt no scrub properties whatsoever. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free during a promotion but this are my own opinions about the product. Will definitely purchase full size once I am out of face soap!</li>
            <li> I tested  Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free and I loved it!  The antioxidant White Tea &amp; Vitamin E it has really makes my  skin radiant and soft!  I recommend it to anyone works great with all skin types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product I loved is gentle with your skin and very soft... no irritable your skin and leave the skin radiant and glowing ... very clean ... to use every day... in the morning with my cleaner routine ... try it ... with vitamin e and white tea... great! I receive this product free !! By influenster and neutrogena! Thanks</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for free for testing purposes,  all opinions are my own. I have combination skin, and this works well with keeping acne prone areas clear, as well as moisturizing with vitamin E on all my drier areas. Great cleanser, gentle, and smells great thanks to the white tea ingredient. A must try!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and some scrubs and other cleaners will make my skin even oilier. This didn&#x27;t seem to affect it either way. I prefer a non scented product, but this one wasn&#x27;t overly powerful in the fragrance department. It&#x27;s good for a scrub, and washed off cleanly.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this out because I have a pretty set and regimented skin care routine that I don&#x27;t deviate from often because of my fickle skin.  I decided to try it out at night to remove my makeup/clean my face before bed, and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  I didn&#x27;t use any other product with it, which felt odd, especially not using moisturizer.  I was worried that my skin would feel really oily in the morning.  But I&#x27;ve used it three nights in a row, and each following morning my skin has felt smooth and soft but never oily.  I felt like it did a decent job of removing my makeup and left my skin feeling fresh.  I&#x27;m not sure how this would hold up with my acne prone skin over a long period of time, but I think it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d be willing to give a try for a couple of weeks to see how it goes.  Overall I liked this product.  The smell was nice, and the results were good.  A win in my book! (I received this product free for testing, but all opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but didn&#x27;t . It dried out my face. It smells amazing though. I go this for free for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
            <li> This product is made by Neutrogena it&#x27;s an incredible facial cleanser. My skin is very dry and sensitive so I can&#x27;t use just anything. I have used this product for 4 weeks now and my face looks &amp; feels soft &amp; flawless.&lt;br /&gt;It contains moisturizing #vitamine and #whitetea which is a plus. Does not leave your face dry or oily. My fav is Dermatologist tested. I really recommend this product. The best. This product was sent to me free by Influenster for contests &amp; testing purposes. These opinions stated here in my review are my very own opinions.  healthy skin booster scrub</li>
            <li> I was so glad I was able to try this product thanks to Influenster and Neturogena. All opinions are indeed my own. I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin. This scrub unlike others does not make my skin dry or irritated. I have eczema on my face and other scrubs make my skin burn and make my eczema worse but not this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser is an amazing product. I have super sensitive skin because of a very strong acne medication that cleared up my acne but made my skin extremely delicate to pretty much everything. I struggle with overly dry and red skin so when it comes to skin care I have to be extra careful as to what I put on my face and this product not only improved my skin by making it soft and bright but it also did not irritate it or leave redness which is a big plus for me! The Vitamin E in this cleanser helps soften my skin and the White Tea helps sooth any irritation I might have had. Overall this is a great product to won. I will definitely be including this product into my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free for testing/review purposes from Influenster however the opinion stated above is my own.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! The smell of product is really nice compared to other washes. It makes the skin feel nice and refreshed, but with that glow. After using this product, given to me by Influenster for free to test, my skin has been a lot better. If you have acne or just something to wash your face this is it.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this product it is amazing. I love the smell and how soft it leaves my skin. The white tea smell is so soothing and the vitamin E is definitively a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Overall I loved this product. I have really oily and sensitive skin that is hard to find a daily scrub that won&#x27;t make me break out even more! This was amazing it left my skin feeling so soft &amp; clean. Even after a couple of hours my face is not as oily! I love how fresh my nice my face feels and looks! You should try it!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s very hard to find a face scrub. This is great though! It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin it makes it feel amazing and the smell is great too! I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful on my skin, I have combination skin and with air conditioning there are parts of my face that is dried and lifts my skin but since I&#x27;m using this no longer happens to me that I have my softer skin and I have no dryness really has helped me a lot because black tea makes my detoxify the skin and vitamin E me this nurturing this product is two on each other I love Neutrogena Healthy Skin boosters daily scrub has given me free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product! Leaves my face feeling refreshed and doesn&#x27;t dry it up what so ever!</li>
            <li> I received this scrub free for testing purposes in my Influenster Fresca VoxBox and I actually like this product much more than I expected to. It left my face feeling so clean and soft. It did not dry out my skin at all. The only thing that kinda bothers me is the smell. I feel it is a little strong for a face product. It smells similar to shampoo, but it doesn’t bother me enough to stop me from buying the product in the future.</li>
            <li> I used this product several times and I absolutely love using it for my face. I usually use it in the morning for a boost to my skin and the freshness will last though out the day. It also smells really great plus it&#x27;s great for my skin because it has skin caring ingredients like Vitamin E. I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I had a chance to try this free sample given to me by influenster and neutrogena in exchange for my honest review and did completed my sample. UsuaUsually , I am not a big fan of most cleansers, because they dry my skin.  Surprisingly, I ended up liking this skin cleanser. It works  great on my skin,  cleaned my face, it had lathering gel texture geland left my skin smooth, no dryness. It  has a light fruity/ flowering scent to it that its not overwhelming.  I will most definitely  will be purchasing  this product just because  it did give me results and did not dried my skin or left any skin  irritation- as most cleanser do.  I honestly  recommend  this  for anyone  who has sensitive  skin as it did work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice pleasant smell. Feels great on my oily skin. Didn&#x27;t leave it over dry or oily. My face felt very soft as if I just used a exfoliate. I recommend this product to all .</li>
            <li> Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub is awesome your skin feels soft and smooth. Clean with out all the dry feeling of most face washes/ scrubs. My skin is very picky and when I got to try this for free it was amazing. Thanks influenster!! Defiantly a keeper and will continue to use in my sail routine.</li>
            <li> I got this wonderful skin scrub for a free trail thanks to the influenza team! I decided to have a go with this. Usually many scrubs or cleansers break me out so I usually stick to the yes too line. But after trying this scrub I found that my skin was super amazing it didn&#x27;t break me out or dry me me out whatsoever, which I found to be quiet wonderful. I will probobably start buying this scrub and be using this once in a while instead of my other yea too scrub. Note that my skin is a combination of oily and dry so this scrub is good for both.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products never disappoint. The Skin Boosters Scrub is a lightly scented cleaner that lathers nicely and uses barely-there particles to exfoliate your skin. If you like a more thorough-feeling scrub, this is not for you. I&#x27;m a fan of a more enthusiastic exfoliation (think Glamglow or Exfolikate), but it is true you don&#x27;t need that kind of &#x27;work&#x27; every time you want to get rid of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice change of pace. It rinses cleanly and quick, and your skin will feel great. I&#x27;ll definitely keep this in the exfoliating rotation!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at all the favorable reviews ... until I saw that ALL the reviewers got this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at full price, hoping to get a nice gentle cleanser that also had an exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it night and day for a week, and I&#x27;m not impressed.  It is fair/OK at cleansing, but does nothing for exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what this product is designed to do.  I was looking for a gentle cleanser that also exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a nice subtle scent and is pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is an expensive product that is way over-priced for what you get: cleansing, but no exfoliation, and no benefits at all over other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;Will not but again and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a decent facial scrub. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s at the upper end of drugstore scrubs. It has a wonderful fruity scent- it smells like watermelon to me. This scrub is touted as being suitable for everyday exfoliation. Indeed, the granules in this scrub are much smaller than those in most other scrubs I&#x27;ve used. I couldn&#x27;t really feel the granules on my finger. It wasn&#x27;t until I started massaging into my face that I really felt them. I felt like this gave me a decent scrub, but I still think it might be too harsh for everyday use. I&#x27;m sticking to a couple of times a week. If you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic scrub, this one should do the trick.</li>
            <li> Years ago, when I was younger and had acne, I used to use scrubs that had almond and those tiny plastic beads (or whatever they were) in them, but as I got older I didn&#x27;t need them anymore, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re good for my face. But I kind of miss that feel you get after using a scrub.  So when I got a chance to try this (free as a Vine reviewer) I was hoping that it would be something that would be like a very mild scrub, and it turns out to be almost what I hoped it would be. If you want a real scrub, this is probably too mild, but if you want a &amp;#34;kind of scrub&amp;#34; then this may be perfect. At first,  thought this was perfect, but for me, as a guy, I could have used just a little bit more abrasion. I&#x27;ll probably wind up mixing it with just a little of the rougher scrub. Sounds like a pain, but since I don&#x27;t use it every day it&#x27;s fine.   The only thing I&#x27;m not wild about is the scent. It seems just slightly feminine to me, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and I suspect most buyers are going to be ladies anyway, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This smells great.  It feels great.  Your skin is scrubbed and left clean.  Neutrogena is gentle, even though it actually cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, even for guys, if you want to get that oil and crud off your face.  The scent is wonderful as you drift off to sleep.</li>
            <li> I love the Neutrogena facial cleanser with white tea and vitamin E and I love this daily scrub also. It comes in a tube instead of a pump but it packs the same punch of cleanliness with just a bit more creaminess and microbeads to exfoliate your skin with ease. I intend to use the scrub when I wash my face at night and the facial cleanser in the morning thus using both on a daily basis even though both could stand alone. The daily scrub would be easier to use while traveling because of it coming in a tube. I like the way it makes my 65 years young skin feel soft and radiant as it did when I was younger. Tip to the younger person: Begin a good regiment of taking care of your skin early in your life with Neutrogena . . .this product is a good one to use to start.</li>
            <li> Wow! Old skin can look better! This foaming wash has tiny Micronesia that exfoliate and cleanse. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin! I give this five stars and a big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have been using scrub from St Ives [[ASIN:B00GTC1HG4 St Ives Scrub, Even &amp; Bright Pink Lemon &amp; Mandarin Orange 6 Ounce]]. It is inexpensive and effective. But I don&#x27;t use it daily since it is a bit harsh to use it everyday. This Neutrogena scrub is just like all their other products. It is very mild and refreshing. I would say it is a borderline scrub. Don&#x27;t expect it to remove the dead skin in a couple of washes. It is more of stimulating your skin. The scent is very light and pleasant. My only complaint is that it is too watery. It spills out easily. They probably should package it in a pump not a tube.</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson and the Neutrogena brand names have usually been associated with quality products. For some, this Healthy Skin Booster daily scrub might be good, but for me it was not. The smell is very nice, and the foam is lovely, but the moisturizing is too much My skin felt great right after use, but within two hours my face was too oily and I had to re-wash with something else. Also, there are ingredient issues with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the front label says it is made with &amp;#34;white tea and vitamin e&amp;#34;, but a check of the ingredients shows that these are the very last - so the very least - ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a check of the research behind the ingredients shows that &amp;#34;acrylate cross polymer&amp;#34; is a frequent addition to many products but that &amp;#34;prolonged and repeated applications of products containing acrylate cross polymer may cause ... dermatitis.&amp;#34; which means that it can be the very cause of skin irritation you are trying to avoid. Furthermore, there are online references to the ingredient tetrasodium EDTA as a cancer causing agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned because this product says it uses &amp;#34;skin-polishing microbeads&amp;#34; and these little plastic items are contaminating our water and are banned in more and more places; however, after a call to the 1-800 customer care center, I was told that the microbeads in this product are NOT plastic but are a combination of two other inert ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not really recommend this product because of the ingredient issues, but some people might think I am being too cautious.</li>
            <li> My wife says that this is one of the nicer scrub that she has used, she likes the smell of white tea and the micro-granules that are gentle on the skin, comparable to ROC which she currently uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial scrub helps to exfoliate dead skin and she uses facial scrub 1-2 times a week so that her face will be cleanse at a deeper level. For the level of quality in scrub, Neutrogena gives ROC a run for the money and at a better value too.</li>
            <li> Very mild scrub.  To be honest I didn&#x27;t even realize this was a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; until I read some other reviews.  The granules in this product are so fine you will barely notice them.  This would be a perfect scrub for someone who has trouble with courser scrubs on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product did a good job of cleaning and my face felt smooth and soft after each use.  I thought the scent was wonderful. Neutrogena products always seem to work well for me and this product is no exception.  Good quality product that delivers on what it promises.</li>
            <li> I kind of love this stuff. I use this as my morning cleanser while I&#x27;m showering. I like that it has a semi citrus scent yet it isn&#x27;t over powering in any way. The texture is a little thick and gritty which is just perfect for scrubbing. My face feels super clean every morning after I use this. I have sensitive skin and this did not make me breakout at all.</li>
            <li> This skin booster scrub has a nice smell; almost like clean laundry it&#x27;s such a fresh smell. My wife uses to clean up her skin from makeup and any oil buildup from the day. I don&#x27;t notice any long term effects aside from a momentary smoothness to my skin after using it but as a result it probably is helping to keep acne away. It&#x27;s one of the few face washes that doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin. We really like it for using as a daily cleaning scrub.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that the scrubbing texture leaves my skin feeling smooth and maybe even slightly moisturized.  And I appreciate that I can use this product and my skin immediately looks better.  (By the end of the day, my skin looks pretty much the same as usual, except I do have somewhat less blackheads).  This product also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin where I have small cuts, and I am able to use it both in the morning and night without it overdrying or irritating my skin.  Lastly, I haven&#x27;t had any major zits since I started with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the strong fragrance.  I can&#x27;t smell it after I wash it off, but it is a bit strong on the nose.  Thus, if you like products that wake you up, then this may be a good choice for you.  I&#x27;d prefer something a bit more toned down, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my stubborn blackheads.  (I&#x27;ll need to try a mask for that).  And I can still see acne (relatively minor but still visible and unattractive) in the areas where I tend to breakout, so this is not a cure-all for me.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling refreshed and I like that the scent is very mild. It&#x27;s a stretch to call this an exfoliating scrub, however. You can barely feel the granules that supposedly exfoliate your skin. It does clean you skin and although it&#x27;s not that easy to rinse off, I do like how it cleans.</li>
