            <li>but that&#x27;s fine..</li>
            <li>After Christmas, I ordered a huge haul of products from their website; including this brush.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy the brush though, and it works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and covers so evenly.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush and honestly it chews the Bare Minerals kabuki brush&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>I love this brush soooooooo much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for this so called &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brush because it isn&#x27;t a true Kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>and I even compared it to another TRUE kabuki brush</li>
            <li>The bristles are VERY soft, they pick up the right amount of product and it&#x27;s just so nice when you apply the product to your face.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazingly soft, offers great mineral coverage, and it never sheds.</li>
            <li>For years I have used Bare Minerals \\&quot;Handy Buki\\&quot; brush to apply my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>For not being super expensive this brush is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay that price.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>this is soft and brushes mineral makeup on smoothly end evenly.  </li>
            <li>It is super soft on the cheek!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding and the bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li>I mean, super soft and so pleasant to use as a brush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s one I can&#x27;t really do without.</li>
            <li>Better than any of the more expensive brushes I have bought, like Chanel or Dior..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>just something new and shiny always catches my eye).</li>
            <li>Very soft brush.</li>
            <li>Just not as white when I first got it if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Over the past few months I have researched other mineral makeup companies and quickly fell in love with Everyday Minerals eye catching products and very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>The brush is incredibly soft, holds up to washing well, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>It does everything it claims and is amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>It is so velvety soft.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft this one was.  </li>
            <li>My old brush was prickly...</li>
            <li>but overall I really like the brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are to soft for a mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought it in a set with a few other brushes and I absolutely love them all!</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals and their brush began to shed almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Bare Minerals Kabuki brush and it was torture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 5 years with regular washings (probably every 1-3 weeks) and it still looks brand new each time</li>
            <li>I had some bristle loss, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a new brush.</li>

            <li> This brush has natural fibers, is very soft and thick enough to distribute evenly mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, once I left that job I no longer received my fabulous discount.   </li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Everyday Minerals makeup and needed some new brushes found this seller and purchased this brush which has delivered.</li>
            <li> The bristles are kinda long</li>
            <li> But this brush has continued to be used every single day with all kinds of things.</li>

            <li> I purchased this brush in 2008 or 2009 and have been using it ever since for applying loose powder and pressed (MAC Studio Fix).</li>
            <li> I only went with this brush because it was $20.00 less than what I had been looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristle are not full enough to be considered a kabuki!</li>
            <li> It was so rough and poky.  </li>
            <li> Not as wide in circumference as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Only thing that is unfortunate is that the mineral foundation can get built up in the brush bristles in the middle and clump after awhile.</li>
            <li> I initially got it for my mineral makeup, but have long since stopped wearing mineral makeup (not because something&#x27;s wrong,</li>
            <li> I spent close to 3 years working retail in the cosmetics industry and have become fully addicted to pricey makeup.</li>
            <li> Over the years that brush started irritating my face, shedding, and generally being difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this line of makeup seeing as my makeup was full of nasty chemicals that I was trying to stay away from.  </li>
            <li> bad, you get what you pay for... a really bad brush not described correctly.  </li>
            <li> Misleading information! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because this was a gift</li>

            <li> I purchased this brush in 2008 or 2009 and have been using it ever since for applying loose powder and pressed (MAC Studio Fix). I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding and the bristles are super soft. The best part is it&#x27;s 100% vegan. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush! I bought it in a set with a few other brushes and I absolutely love them all! The bristles are VERY soft, they pick up the right amount of product and it&#x27;s just so nice when you apply the product to your face. The brush washes off very easily, the handles are sturdy and fit perfect in the hand. I LOVE this brush and honestly it chews the Bare Minerals kabuki brush&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush! I bought it to apply my mineral foundation, it&#x27;s really great for that. But I also find myself reaching for this brush to apply blush and bronzer as well. The brush is incredibly soft, holds up to washing well, and doesn&#x27;t shed. Whenever I use mineral makeup I find that this is the only brush I use. I definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am a self confessed beauty products junkie. I spent close to 3 years working retail in the cosmetics industry and have become fully addicted to pricey makeup. Unfortunately, once I left that job I no longer received my fabulous discount.   For years I have used Bare Minerals \\&quot;Handy Buki\\&quot; brush to apply my mineral foundation. Over the years that brush started irritating my face, shedding, and generally being difficult to work with. A replacement of that brush would have cost me $40 and I just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay that price. Over the past few months I have researched other mineral makeup companies and quickly fell in love with Everyday Minerals eye catching products and very reasonable prices. After Christmas, I ordered a huge haul of products from their website; including this brush. This brush is amazingly soft, offers great mineral coverage, and it never sheds. Also don&#x27;t forget to check all of their lovely eye colors! For all you mineral make up addicts this is a must have product!</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this line of makeup seeing as my makeup was full of nasty chemicals that I was trying to stay away from.  I tried it and I love it.  My skin is starting to look and feel better.  I have changed my entire beauty regimen to include this line of products.  I also love that on the company website they offer a free kit to try our your color.  It is a great feature and I really love the products.    The brushes and equipment for this line of beauty products is absolutely amazing.  The brushes give great coverage!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.. Its Silky smoothe, easy application. The bristles are kinda long but that&#x27;s fine.. I love this brush! I might but more from this brand. :)</li>
            <li> Very soft brush. Good for applying my foundation. Had medium fallout when I first started using but the \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; I guess are so thin they don&#x27;t leave lines on your face. My makeup kind of stained it too. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the kind of material that soaks up a bit after each application but it&#x27;s still white on the tip. Just not as white when I first got it if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush. It&#x27;s really soft and not scratchy at all. the handle is nice and comfortable to use. I took one star off though because it does shed when I wash it. It I wouldn&#x27;t have taken off a star if it was one or two fibers, but it&#x27;s several. I still enjoy the brush though, and it works well. If you don&#x27;t mind the shedding, it&#x27;s a good buy. It&#x27;s kept its shape well and works great.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush.  So soft and wonderful to feel. Works great for mineral makeup or finishing powder.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day for my mineral foundation. Amazingly soft. I mean, super soft and so pleasant to use as a brush. Works well for applying mineral foundation. Only thing that is unfortunate is that the mineral foundation can get built up in the brush bristles in the middle and clump after awhile. Even after washing, it will still happen. But it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice quality brush, however it&#x27;s not a Kabuki brush. The bristle are not full enough to be considered a kabuki! But it is a nice brush and will work just fine for me. :)</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this brush based on reviews on the MakeUp Alley website.  It does everything it claims and is amazingly soft.  Doesn&#x27;t shed hairs either.  I use Bare Minerals and their brush began to shed almost immediately.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This brush has natural fibers, is very soft and thick enough to distribute evenly mineral foundation. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush soooooooo much. I love make-up and I was on the search for a brush that doesn&#x27;t shed and that doesn&#x27;t waste so much mineral powder. I must say my search is over. I found the best brush ever &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my studio fix powder to finish my make up.  It gives me extra coverage and a flawless look.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful.  It is so velvety soft.  I used to use the Bare Minerals Kabuki brush and it was torture.  It was so rough and poky.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft this one was.  I wish I had changed ages ago.</li>
            <li> I should just go ahead and order a life-time supply of this brush!  It&#x27;s so smooth and covers so evenly.  Easy to clean and comfortable to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 5 years now and it&#x27;s one I can&#x27;t really do without. I initially got it for my mineral makeup, but have long since stopped wearing mineral makeup (not because something&#x27;s wrong, just something new and shiny always catches my eye). But this brush has continued to be used every single day with all kinds of things. I have used it in a pinch for blush and bronzer and all over powder, basically for anything on my face that doesn&#x27;t require precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 5 years with regular washings (probably every 1-3 weeks) and it still looks brand new each time and I have yet to witness a single hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Everyday Minerals makeup and needed some new brushes found this seller and purchased this brush which has delivered. it was received in the time promised great price and would purchase from this seller again. Recommend to all who use mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Better than any of the more expensive brushes I have bought, like Chanel or Dior.. Washes well, without bristle loss.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  I love it.  My old brush was prickly...this is soft and brushes mineral makeup on smoothly end evenly.  I use it for my base/foundation daily.  No hair loss on brush after a year of use.</li>
            <li> Not as wide in circumference as I&#x27;d like but overall I really like the brush.  It is super soft on the cheek!</li>
            <li> For not being super expensive this brush is awesome. I had some bristle loss, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a new brush. I use it for applying Mac studio fix, not mineral makeup. They also sent samples!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this so called &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brush because it isn&#x27;t a true Kabuki brush.  The bristles are to soft for a mineral foundation. This brush is more like a blush brush. I&#x27;m very disappointed because this was a gift and it wasn&#x27;t what I was led to believe it was.  I read ALL the information about this brush because it was a gift for a specific make-up - it&#x27;s description was everything I wanted and I even compared it to another TRUE kabuki brush and they stated the same description.  I only went with this brush because it was $20.00 less than what I had been looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad, you get what you pay for... a really bad brush not described correctly.  Misleading information! :(</li>
