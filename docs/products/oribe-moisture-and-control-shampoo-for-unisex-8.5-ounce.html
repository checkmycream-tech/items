            <li>It spells very good but that is about it.</li>
            <li>This one, and the Oribe Conditioner was a real nice looking bottle in my trash can.</li>
            <li>My hair is so beautiful now that I use the Oribe line of products.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell something delicious while washing your hair buy this shampoo, if you want your hair look good, don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li>GREAT SHAMPOO</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>

            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair smell!</li>
            <li>I also love the bottle design!</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments now!</li>
            <li>Seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a good Oribe shampoo :)</li>
            <li>but this shampoo (along with the conditioner) has transformed my fine, curly hair to a glorious shining, flowing mane!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bumble &amp; Bumble and recently switched to organic brands to minimize exposure to toxins, but I have to say this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t believe how silky and healthy our hair is after using the Oribe products.  </li>
            <li>wish they have a better design for the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love Oribe  products they work well for my hair</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Matching conditioner was less impressive.</li>
            <li>This is the wonderful shamppo for people who need moisture and little control on the hair.</li>
            <li>to keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>this is great for when my hair is really dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, straight hair and couldn&#x27;t believe how full it made it, which you wouldn&#x27;t think with my fine hair and it being a moisturizing shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping my 3a 3b curl would love this, but it did not.  </li>
            <li>It does smell good and my hair is a lot softer and feels healthier than when I would use basic shampoo from the supermarket.</li>
            <li>The smell is also very pleasant, floral with a slight, slight earthy undertone (my bf always says how good my hair smells).</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo my hair has drastically changed from frizzy and in a permanent ponytail from shiny and soft and easy to manage!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money as you get what you pay for in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my hair and leaves it fresh and fragrant</li>
            <li>you can feel the difference right after from the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I remember the first time I used this.  </li>
            <li>(even so it supposed to be bring &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Everyone that try&#x27;s this shampoo wants it!</li>
            <li>He loves it so much that when I offered to find a cheaper alternative to save money, he said no, that he wanted me to keep using Oribe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a difference when comparing conditioners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>No matter how much product I&#x27;d use my hair would always look greasy instead of shiny</li>
            <li>Provides enough moisture to leave my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated which makes the high price tolerable.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use a good conditioner afterwards your hair will be a total mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ship from buyer was little slow, but the price was very good!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the extra dough, I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair</li>
            <li>It does not weigh it down at all, but instead makes it full and shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable even without conditioner</li>
            <li>I will be needing to use this alot in the Summer since the humidity  does major damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>have thick, but fine hair that needs washing every day because I have oily roots.</li>
            <li>They will last a long time and are worth EVERY dollar spent.</li>

            <li> Love Oribe!  The smell is just excellent!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the way this shampoo smells. He loves it so much that when I offered to find a cheaper alternative to save money, he said no, that he wanted me to keep using Oribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, but fine hair that needs washing every day because I have oily roots. This shampoo moisturizes just enough, but it never feels oily or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive! But I&#x27;ve used it for several years now, and I think I am hooked...and my husband is too!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo. Very concentrated which makes the high price tolerable.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable even without conditioner and I love the way it makes my hair smell!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Friends and coworkers noticed right away how great my hair looked when I started using this stuff! Even the boyfriend is loving my hair! It all started with a sample and I was immediately hooked!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping my 3a 3b curl would love this, but it did not.  I consider myself to be rather selective with hair products.  This one, and the Oribe Conditioner was a real nice looking bottle in my trash can.</li>
            <li> I remember the first time I used this.  Actually, my hair stylist used it on me.  I have super fine, straight hair and couldn&#x27;t believe how full it made it, which you wouldn&#x27;t think with my fine hair and it being a moisturizing shampoo!  It does not weigh it down at all, but instead makes it full and shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo... I was shocked how little you need and my hair is curly and colored. It does what it says without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I just tried a sample of this shampoo and conditioner - I am blown away! I&#x27;ve used Bumble &amp; Bumble and recently switched to organic brands to minimize exposure to toxins, but I have to say this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. My color treated hair, that felt like straw at the ends, after ONE use just an hour ago feels like silk. My ends are soft and smooth - I&#x27;m almost confused how this could&#x27;ve changed my hair texture so drastically! It&#x27;s so expensive, so I don&#x27;t know if I can afford it month after month, but maybe to use in between other shampoo &amp; cond. to keep my hair smooth. Seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to Oribe products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. My hair is so beautiful now that I use the Oribe line of products. I highly recommend them. Yes, the products are expensive but you only need a tiny bit of product when you use them. They will last a long time and are worth EVERY dollar spent.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in hair texture in shower while hair is still wet. Very lightweight. A little bit goes a long way. Matching conditioner was less impressive. I did not notice much of a difference when comparing conditioners.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as promised &amp; is awesome!</li>
            <li> My Mother and I were turned on to Oribe products via our Hair Stylist.  We couldn&#x27;t believe how silky and healthy our hair is after using the Oribe products.  And our hair smells so good!!!  Definitely worth the money as you get what you pay for in this stuff.  G-Dallas, TX</li>
            <li> I have hair that is frizzy and poofy and prone to dryness/roughness, and have searched for years on end for a shampoo that will make my hair silky.  This one actually works!  It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the wonderful shamppo for people who need moisture and little control on the hair. you can feel the difference right after from the first time using it. wish they have a better design for the bottle. It is not that use to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;The ship from buyer was little slow, but the price was very good!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a  few months now. If you don&#x27;t use a good conditioner afterwards your hair will be a total mess. It makes my hair dry (even so it supposed to be bring &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;).  It spells very good but that is about it. If you want to smell something delicious while washing your hair buy this shampoo, if you want your hair look good, don&#x27;t purchase it. I am still looking for a good Oribe shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Everyone that try&#x27;s this shampoo wants it!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s quality over quantity. I have to use very small amounts of this stuff because I don&#x27;t want to run out of it for how much it cost. It does smell good and my hair is a lot softer and feels healthier than when I would use basic shampoo from the supermarket. I also love the bottle design!</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo my hair has drastically changed from frizzy and in a permanent ponytail from shiny and soft and easy to manage! The smell is also very pleasant, floral with a slight, slight earthy undertone (my bf always says how good my hair smells). The biggest difference you can tell immediately is the shine it adds to your hair! No matter how much product I&#x27;d use my hair would always look greasy instead of shiny but this shampoo (along with the conditioner) has transformed my fine, curly hair to a glorious shining, flowing mane! WELL worth the extra dough, I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair and I get so many compliments now!</li>
            <li> I love Oribe  products they work well for my hair this is great for when my hair is really dry and frizzy.Provides enough moisture to leave my hair smooth and manageable. I will be needing to use this alot in the Summer since the humidity  does major damage to my hair. GREAT SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It is worth every penny!! Conditioner is equally good!! I have recommend to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Shampoo arrived in perfect condition and was exactly as promised--BRAVO!</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair and leaves it fresh and fragrant</li>
