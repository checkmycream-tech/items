            <li>I had hoped this would be too, but my hair seemed fly away, did not straighten easily with blow drying, and frankly I did not see any difference in terms of looking healthier, &amp;#34;just cut,&amp;#34; or sleek</li>

            <li>anymore i get as much cut off</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m too uncoordinated to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Every other split end product weighed my hair down too much, made it greasy and so on.  </li>
            <li> only problem is that this product is extremely thick (obviously, since it is basically just glue) and too much will you hair feeling pretty stiff and thick with product, so that it doesn&#x27;t move much and is hard to run you fingers through.</li>
            <li> (I have LONG red hair past my mid back).</li>
            <li> This, used with a condenser on my dryer works as well, I guess, as can be expected without a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everytime I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and course and this particular lotion has straighten my hair without the use of heat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s become pretty thin.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it doesn&#x27;t have a better smell to it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m extremely attached to my length, so basically what I do is grow it forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if you straighten after you blow dry, some of the product will evaporate and it won&#x27;t be as tough, but its definitely not silky</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that i regularly blow dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucksss, I had used the product the other day and all it did is drid and destroy my hair.</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried that it would make my hair feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but it does not at all.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and this product definitely helps with the mess.  </li>
            <li> If anything it made my hair feel heavy and damaged.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, waste of money.</li>
            <li> No more splitting, brittle  un-manageable hair.</li>
            <li> But it sorta does help the look of split ends, as long as they&#x27;re not SUPER bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  I have dry, coarse hair that is very prone to breakage.  Every other split end product weighed my hair down too much, made it greasy and so on.  Not Nexxus Promend straightening lotion.  It does a great job of taming my hair down, with no split ends, thickens my hair and smells great.  I am a big fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to help tame and straighten my unruly wavy and frizzy hair and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m too uncoordinated to use a flat iron. This, used with a condenser on my dryer works as well, I guess, as can be expected without a flat iron. The product feels just like moisturizing lotion you use on your skin so I was a little worried that it would make my hair feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but it does not at all. I use this for straightening and then use the Nexus Oil Treatment, Frizz Defy afterward and the combination works very well together. Don&#x27;t expect straightening and frizz control like you get with flat ironing, but for me, it&#x27;s the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I like Nexxus products and the straightening spray is excellent. I had hoped this would be too, but my hair seemed fly away, did not straighten easily with blow drying, and frankly I did not see any difference in terms of looking healthier, &amp;#34;just cut,&amp;#34; or sleek which is what I was looking for. There are high reviews so glad to know others are finding this product is meeting their individual needs.</li>
            <li> Put it in your hair while its damp at night and when you get up in the morning your hair is shiny and tamable. I saw results in my split ends the very next day. So if you have fine hair or bad split ends, this IS for you, love this.</li>
            <li> I Love the product,it works really good on my hair.  I was shocked that it doesn&#x27;t have a better smell to it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would make styling of my hair easier but it did not. I had more frizziness to deal with Hair wasn&#x27;t left as soft as I thought it should be.</li>
            <li> This is a great smoothing and split end binding product; not to mention it smells great.  The price was perfect and WAY less than in the big box stores. I will be ordering this as needed.</li>
            <li> I love the product is worth your money and it works greatwill order more I love Nexus products the best</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO STRAIGHTEN, TO PROTECT, TO HAVE A VOLUMINOUS HAIR AND SHINNY HAIR.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucksss, I had used the product the other day and all it did is drid and destroy my hair. Im african and american with relaxed healthy hair by the way or did have healthy hair  it went to soft to rough , and it completely damaged my ends.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work for others but it destroyed my hair after blow drying and straighting it.</li>
            <li> I have some of the worst split ends you&#x27;ve probably ever seen. I have super curly hair, but because I&#x27;ve been blowdrying and straightening it nearly every day of my life since 5th grade (i&#x27;m a college freshman now) it&#x27;s become pretty thin. Since my hair is red, my split ends stand out like a sore thumb - the ends of my hair are almost entirely white with split ends. I know I should cut it, but I&#x27;m extremely attached to my length, so basically what I do is grow it forever (it doesn&#x27;t grow much obviously) and when I finally can&#x27;t stand looking at my split ends anymore i get as much cut off i can handle (which granted isn&#x27;t much and still leaves lots of split ends) and do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the point! I use this product every time I blow dry my hair. You obviously can&#x27;t actually reverse split ends, but this product will minimize the look of them. I found that if I use 2.5 pumps, you basically can&#x27;t even see my split ends anymore, which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that this product is extremely thick (obviously, since it is basically just glue) and too much will you hair feeling pretty stiff and thick with product, so that it doesn&#x27;t move much and is hard to run you fingers through. I&#x27;ve found that if you straighten after you blow dry, some of the product will evaporate and it won&#x27;t be as tough, but its definitely not silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to invest in a silkening shine spray, however, which I think will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you have split ends and don&#x27;t want to cut your hair, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and this product definitely helps with the mess.  Wish I would&#x27;ve found it sooner!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, excellently priced (I pay around $10 for it in the stores) on here I paid 4.99 I think.. or close to it. I&#x27;ve gone from using hair conditioner to using this after washing my hair. It makes my hair much smoother and more manageable (I have LONG red hair past my mid back). It actually lets me be able to wear my hair down and straight without it getting all frizzed or tangled. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE - LOVE - LOVE - This does help restore the split ends and adds fullness to hair. Try this with the other Nexxus Pro-Mend series and I have faith that it will help your hair feel and look so much better. I was very sick and lost my hair from treatments. The Pro-Mend selection from Nexxus has brought my hair back to silky and fullness from root to tip.</li>
            <li> Great price, works well enough, not too noticeable in the improvements.  Softening, I think.  I keep it around, use it on occasion.</li>
            <li> On the box, the product will claim that it will leave your hair looking like you got a fresh haircut- that&#x27;s a bit of an exxageration. But it sorta does help the look of split ends, as long as they&#x27;re not SUPER bad. I have thin, wavy, fine hair, which I straighten most every day, and I use this product before I blow dry, and when I&#x27;m done, I hardly have to straighten my hair. It keeps my hair straight all day. I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. I have never been impressed with Nexxus, other than their split end cream. This just did nothing for my hair. If anything it made my hair feel heavy and damaged. For such a cheap price, you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t buy it, waste of money. Instead buy Miracle 7 leave in mist from Sally&#x27;s. I LOVE that leave in conditioner. A bit pricey but is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> The use of Nexxus ProMend Straightening Lotion has improved my hair quality. My split breaking ends seemed to have been mended with the first use of this product. My hair is thick and course and this particular lotion has straighten my hair without the use of heat. No more splitting, brittle  un-manageable hair. YES!  I love Nexxus products.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that i regularly blow dry. This product leaves my hair poofy yet greasy feeling. did not work for me</li>
            <li> I love this product by Nexxus. It is lightweight which I love because I have fine hair.  I use it everytime I blow dry my hair and it looks like I just walked out of salon!</li>
