            <li> I have always loved this fragance from VS. When I knew it was discontinued,  I was really disappointed.  Fortunately, IFound it here for an excellent price. Although there was a little problem with the shipment bc I didnt received it on time, however, they solved it quickly by sending me again the same product. Finally, when I received the second shipment,  I ended up keeping those two perfumes too. The products were in excellent conditions,  as described . I recommend buying here. They are really good at solving any inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if some of their batches are worse than others or what, but it smelled so cheap.  I&#x27;ve had decent Victoria Secret scents before, &amp;#34;Heavenly&amp;#34; I think, but this one &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; is yuk.  To be fair I will say I did not buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Elegant, soft, sexy &amp; long lasting!! This is hands down my favorite Victoria Secret perfume. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> She loved it.  It&#x27;s one of them items that if we get it in Alaska, it&#x27;s a treat for us</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review because I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this due to the last review on this perfume by this seller. Well I&#x27;m glad I went against my better judgement and bought it because I received my order today and it is a genuine Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels perfume. Mine came sealed in the original cellophane wrapping with an original price sticker on the bottom. The box was different than the other bottle I already have but I believe it is just the updated packaging that they had before it was discontinued. I have a tiny bit left of the perfume so I wanted to make sure  they smelled the same and, sure enough, they do!!! I am very pleased with my purchase and worried about where I&#x27;m going to find this again when I run out. I love this perfume! The smell is so light and pretty that I get compliments all the time.</li>

I know this because I have half a bottle left from the original bottle I bought from a Victoria Secret store. Very disappointed. I can&#x27;t recommend this purchase it&#x27;s not the original.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this perfume as a gift for my mom and is not even the same as the one from Victoria Secret, the box was damaged and the bottle was scratch and in bad conditions. The smell is really strong like if they just add a bunch of alcohol to it and it&#x27;s not even compare to the original smell. I&#x27;m so disappointed from the seller and the product, I feel like more information should it be included regarding the product conditions.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the scent. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It smell too powdery. not my cup of tea.  I think Heavenly has a better smell than this.</li>
            <li> LOVE! My ABSOLUTE FAV</li>
