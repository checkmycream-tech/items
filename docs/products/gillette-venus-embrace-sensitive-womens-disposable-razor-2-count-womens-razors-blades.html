            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>There’s a huge difference between the 5 and 3 blade Gillette razors!!!</li>
            <li>This blade is the best one I have ever had, and Amazon has better price.</li>
            <li>I love these blades, they are the best.</li>
            <li>, just keep an eye out for a good price and go for</li>
            <li>A bit pricy for my taste, but it is a good razor</li>
            <li>Did the job for a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li>Good price, and</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I always like this kind of raiser because it needs no soap.</li>
            <li>well sadly......the whitest, most translucent skin on earth.....</li>
            <li>No cuts, rashes...simply smooth!</li>
            <li>got this razor free to test and review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>very useful, I like it!</li>
            <li>Have used once so far and found to be smooth and very good.  </li>
            <li>But when they&#x27;re new they do a great job.</li>
            <li>They ask me to keep an eye out for good deals, and the current sale price for the two for six bucks (delivered) and a 75 cent coupon too was a fairly good price for these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work good, but I still find disposable blades to not be quite as good as regular ones</li>
            <li>The ladies in the household love this razor - smooth, works well, no irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor that gives a smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li>Great razor, smooth and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats the Venus 5-blade for a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and removes all hair follicles in its way.</li>
            <li>and i get silky smooth legs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time, they work great and really get</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go over an area as many times to completely rid all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the close shave I got, how smooth my legs feel for days and how I don&#x27;t get the red bumps after a shave.</li>
            <li>Well, I purchased these due to good reviews.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they gave me ingrown hairs and surprisingly, I&#x27;ve used cheaper razors that were better.</li>
            <li>cause razor burn, knicks, can&#x27;t believe I used them for so long and thought they were ok.</li>
            <li>so I suppose I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I go fast, even over knees and ankles, and I miss spots.</li>
            <li>These razors worked really well and were protecting of my skin.</li>
            <li>So even though they cost more than other razors, they&#x27;re still a decent value.</li>
            <li>razors are expensive these days,And it works great.</li>
            <li>Also, I normally cut my knees/</li>
            <li>Truly.......it only took one and the better part of an hour to remove the inch long growth from my hibernated legs revealing.....</li>
            <li>I can use them maybe twice for bikini zone before I have to switch to a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only am I not bleeding all over the shower stall, but these razors are capable of getting a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin, this razor doesn&#x27;t leave me itchy or bumpy.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of these and used one of my old razors-</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I received the Venus Embrace Sensitive that is refillable, instead of the disposables, and tried it on my legs.</li>
            <li>So, these aren&#x27;t worth the extra blades or the extra $</li>
            <li>armpits are very sensitive to razors, so much so that I can&#x27;t apply deodorant for at least 30 minutes after shaving, but these get such a close shave without irritation that there&#x27;s no sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I always like this kind of raiser because it needs no soap.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor that gives a smooth shave every time! Also, I normally cut my knees/ankles when shaving my legs, but with this one I haven&#x27;t. A bit pricy for my taste, but it is a good razor so I suppose I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Have used once so far and found to be smooth and very good.  Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I agree with the person who said it&#x27;s hard to cut yourself with these. I haven&#x27;t once yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just admit that I am a bad shaver. I do it every day and I&#x27;ve been doing it for over 20 years, but I am bad at it all the same. I lack the patience to properly soap and then slowly and meticulously shave an area. I go fast, even over knees and ankles, and I miss spots. I inevitably cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only am I not bleeding all over the shower stall, but these razors are capable of getting a very close shave. I don&#x27;t have to go over an area as many times to completely rid all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits are very sensitive to razors, so much so that I can&#x27;t apply deodorant for at least 30 minutes after shaving, but these get such a close shave without irritation that there&#x27;s no sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I will never buy another razor again if I can possibly help it.</li>
            <li> They only last about two weeks I use them about 2 to 3 times a week, and I have cut myself to her three times with these shavers</li>
            <li> Best razor! Minimal irritation and no stubbly knees. It is a bit expensive but lasts FOREVER befoe going dull. I ran out of these and used one of my old razors- they DRAG, cause razor burn, knicks, can&#x27;t believe I used them for so long and thought they were ok.</li>
            <li> very useful, I like it!</li>
            <li> Great razor, smooth and sensitive. No red bumps left from shaving. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and so these are perfect because they dont cause me to have a reaction and i get silky smooth legs</li>
            <li> This blade is the best one I have ever had, and Amazon has better price.</li>
            <li> Did the job for a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time, they work great and really get that close shave I want.</li>
            <li> This razor works as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. I prefer the gel edges.</li>
            <li> Good price, and I like this product.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors on earth. Truly.......it only took one and the better part of an hour to remove the inch long growth from my hibernated legs revealing.....well sadly......the whitest, most translucent skin on earth.....but the smoothest legs on earth. Now about that mustache.....</li>
            <li> Got these because they were on sale.  They work good, but I still find disposable blades to not be quite as good as regular ones</li>
            <li> Just the same as in the store.  Great razor.</li>
            <li> One of the BEST razors I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I can definitely recommend giving this product a try.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> razors are expensive these days,And it works great.</li>
            <li> These razors worked really well and were protecting of my skin. I would be hesitant to order again because for the price of 2 disposable razors I could get 4-5 refills.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those with sensitive skin. There’s a huge difference between the 5 and 3 blade Gillette razors!!! I always used Gillette razors with 3 blades. I am sold on these now. No cuts, rashes...simply smooth! Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I love these blades, they are the best. They ought to be for the price you pay for them.....</li>
            <li> I usually use a mens razor because it gets a close shave without the bumps. I received the Venus Embrace Sensitive that is refillable, instead of the disposables, and tried it on my legs. Love the close shave I got, how smooth my legs feel for days and how I don&#x27;t get the red bumps after a shave. I will be purchasing refills for this razor. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor free to test and review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Perfect for bikini area but they don&#x27;t last as long as others. I&#x27;m not sure why. I prefer Dorco brand to these. Dorco has 6 blades and these have 5. Plus Dorco is way cheaper through their website. I&#x27;ve only ever bought Gillette razors and wanted to give these a last try. I can&#x27;t knock them stars just because I prefer a different brand, but they are definitely not my favorite anymore. I can use them maybe twice for bikini zone before I have to switch to a new one. But when they&#x27;re new they do a great job. Hope this helps!</li>
