            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that other than a mild scent</li>

            <li> the only thing is, (and this is true of all sunblocks to some degree)  that it does leave a shine on the face, which causes me to have to dust a wee bit of face powder over it, and I HATE MAKEUP.</li>

            <li> At first I thought I just got some bad product from a seller, but even after I started buying it in the store this would often happen, even when the product was brand</li>
            <li> It appears to work as a UV accelerator and that&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
            <li> If you perspire and it gets into your eyes, it burns like crazy, but again, protection from the sun is unequalled by any other brand.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible sunscreen, no where near 100 SPF protection at all.  </li>
            <li> , this does leave the face feeling weird.  </li>
            <li> You may as well just apply some random skin lotion with no SPF.  </li>
            <li> Being oily from lotion or sunscreen can make what we do very dangerous because we do a lot of people balancing and pyramid building where people have to climb on you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my go to product for protection from UV rays.  I&#x27;ve been in sun for hours with it on and no burn, and over the years my freckles have faded to the point that people don&#x27;t even know I have them.  I can apply my makeup over it without it getting wiped off, and it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my medium sized purse.  Now for the cons....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t always go on evenly.  There have been times when I have been out for hours only to notice white smudges on my face.  I&#x27;m pale, so they actually blended in pretty well, but on someone with normal skin this would show.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this does leave the face feeling weird.  Not greasy, but there is a soft filmy feeling that does take time to get used to.  And it does leave the face a bit shiny, which is why I apply powder after.&lt;br /&gt;The last problem I have had is that this product can separate quickly.  I can&#x27;t count the number of times I squeezed some of the sunblock out only to get a handful of clear oil with chunks of white in it.  At first I thought I just got some bad product from a seller, but even after I started buying it in the store this would often happen, even when the product was brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still plan to keep using it because to me, the pros outweigh the cons.  I just buy it in the store now so I can easily return it if it is bad.</li>
            <li> Very good sunblock, keeps my skin from tanning/burning. However, pay attention to the directions-you need to put it on fifteen minutes before sun exposure for it to work. The protection lasts for about two hours before you have to reapply. Like others have said, it feels and looks a bit greasy immediately upon application but that goes away within five minutes.</li>
            <li> I really like the feeling of being so well-protected, the product doesn&#x27;t gross me out with a heavy greasy feeling to put it on, I trust the brand.  The only drawback to the product in my case is that it has a slightly white, powdery cast even even afer absorbing.  Everyone is different of couse but to my logic, somebody needing an SPF like one hundred probably can do WITHOUT a whiter-looking face.</li>
            <li> Presumably the 100+ SPF offers more protection than earlier versions (though there seems to be considerable controversy about the real value of the SPF ratings). In any case, the cream goes on surprisingly easily. The only downside: because the protection is partially based on physically blocking the sun with metallic oxides, it never entirely disappears on your skin.</li>
            <li> works  wonderful for all those people out there with skin cancer or dont want to get skin cancer.  cant ever have enough SPF</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my body but have also used it on my face.  So far the best texture which is not so dry it is hard to get onto your skin but absorbs quite quickly so you are not left so sticky.  Unscented smell is still slightly sunblock-chemical but not as strong as others I have tried and prefer it to be as unscented as possible to not clash with cologne.</li>
            <li> Very good price. I ride bicycle at everyday, I need this every every riding.&lt;br /&gt;The smells good, feels good, colors good.</li>
            <li> Both of my parents have had skin cancer twice, so it&#x27;s very important for me to have effective sunscreen. I applied this sunscreen every morning on a two-week trip to India in the middle of summer during which I was outside for 8 hours a day, and I didn&#x27;t even get a tan. It&#x27;s light enough that other than a mild scent you&#x27;ll barely know that it&#x27;s on. The high concentration of protective chemicals does cause it to leave a faint white residue, but if you have pale complexion it isn&#x27;t noticeable. This is now the only sunscreen I buy.</li>
            <li> this is one of the most effective sunscreens that I found. The quality is excellent and the best part is that after application does not leave a greasy appearance. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Excellent product, helps my kids delicate skin to avoid sunburn at school during breaks. It is a daily obligated treatment for them.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for being one of the best full spectrum sun blocks, we use this faithfully. It does the job we asked of it, &amp; we don&#x27;t have any problems with our skin any longer!</li>
            <li> My girl friend allways get burned in the sun.  Got this product and it work out awsome. She did not have to run around like a chicken trying to cool down after a sun burn. Product work very well.</li>
            <li> As you know, Sun block cream does good work for women&#x27;s skin.  It give me very moist and protection from dry skin.  I have good skin but still under an air conditioner or heater in office, my skin get dryer.  It is not cheap but does blocking from sun and give me a good skin.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well and allows my skin to breath. The only complaint I have is that I leave white fingerprints everywhere.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because it blends in well when applied to face. There is no white overcasting left on the skin when applied.</li>
            <li> This product is the best in the beach. I use it all the days to protect me of the UV</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the best sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know why I spected them to be bigger, but whatever its ok.</li>
            <li> the product is everything that it says it is. will be ordering form here again if i need more sunscreen</li>
            <li> Gift requested by a friend.  Just what she wanted!  And it was unavailable from the manufacturer, so this was perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible sunscreen, no where near 100 SPF protection at all.  You may as well just apply some random skin lotion with no SPF.  Save your money and get a different brand.</li>
            <li> I fully agree with the comment/rating left by L. Croker. This product DOES NOT WORK! I&#x27;m the kind of person who tans quickly and easily. Blame it on genetics. My wife, on the other hand, is extremely fair. A few months ago, I purchased 3 tubes of the 100SPF sunscreen at our local retailer because (a) it was marked $5.99 and (b) it was on sale for 25% off (they&#x27;ve since raised the price to $10.99). After trying it, my wife (who gardens) stated that it didn&#x27;t work. I decided to test the product myself and applied a liberal amount to my face (which is very brown). After 2 hours in the pool with my 6-year-old, with minimal water contact to my face and no sweating, I came in looking like I&#x27;d been at the beach all day with no sunscreen at all - very red. My wife&#x27;s reaction - \\&quot;SEE?!!!\\&quot; It appears to work as a UV accelerator and that&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has to limit her exposure to sun for medical reasons and we were going on a vacation to Jamaica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time finding SPF 100 locally so I ordered it from Amazon.  I was a little surprised to see the size of the bottles (they are small) but we quickly realized that a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  One bottle was easily enough for two people for an entire week in Jamaica with multiple reapplications and sharing with others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily at all and when you put it on you don&#x27;t feel it at all.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product sells itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like getting sun burned. This goes on dry and stays dry so I do not have to deal with &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; stuff as with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can backpack all day with this and not get harmful UVA or UVB radiation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;….</li>
            <li> Very nice. It dries very fast and feel silky smooth to the touch. I put it on under my moisturizer and make-up and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen you can get. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a ginger with VERY fair and sensitive skin along with an armature acrobat. This product is the only non greasy sunscreen I trust for outdoor performances. Being oily from lotion or sunscreen can make what we do very dangerous because we do a lot of people balancing and pyramid building where people have to climb on you. I also use this as a daily face moisturizer and it does wonders! My skin always looks great and because it&#x27;s not oily, my makeup will actually stick to my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just a great sunblock. It&#x27;s not very greasy feeling and very easy on your skin. It&#x27;s great for tattoos as well</li>
            <li> My mom was looking for a skin protector with a high SPF for the clime and temperature of our city and this one is just what she want.</li>
            <li> This material keeps my alabaster skin from  even light freckling, which is EXCELLENT. I live in a place with fierce sunlight. And I am exceedingly pale...the only thing is, (and this is true of all sunblocks to some degree)  that it does leave a shine on the face, which causes me to have to dust a wee bit of face powder over it, and I HATE MAKEUP. However, were it not for that one small flaw, I would say this is the best sunblock I have ever used;  I also put it on the backs of my hands, on any exposed skin, when I venture out into the intense UV of my part of Southern California. If you perspire and it gets into your eyes, it burns like crazy, but again, protection from the sun is unequalled by any other brand. So I would get it if I wanted this total protection.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, purchasing it at a local drugstore or big box store. The sunblock I received is not the same quality I am used to having from my Neutrogena Sunblock. Normally it squeezes out of the tube appearing creamy. The product appears to be defective, part &amp;#34;oily/watery,&amp;#34; as though components are separated. I will never purchase it again online. This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon that has been disappointing.</li>
            <li> Indispensable en estos tiempo...sobre todo si se anda al aire libre&lt;br /&gt;y más en el caribe... no es muy grasosa..&lt;br /&gt;la compraria nuevamente.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was expecting!!! It arrived on time. Its the best sunblock I have used and I wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything.</li>
            <li> Use this on a daily basis on my face and neck and it really is non-oily and non-comodogenic in practice.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena 100 times the sunscreen effect is very good, riding a summer, the skin moist, very comfortable.</li>
