            <li>I love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>I love that I can wake up in the morning and just &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; it and go.</li>
            <li>I love it.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the amplifier for refreshing curls when I go with silicones.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This cream works great for me, so far!</li>
            <li>I received this product as a trial test (4.22oz) and it works just as good as the AG recoil product I have been using, but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I received this product to try for free as I&#x27;m a Bzz agent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper for me and also has a light fragrance that&#x27;s not annoying.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was being biased since I am accustomed to all natural products (my hair is very healthy), so I gave it to my neighbor to try.</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for my hair product :-)</li>
            <li>I tried a couple of the TIGI Curlesque products and thought they worked VERY well, for those okay with silicones (ie, not strict Curly Girl method folks).</li>
            <li>Will totally buy more!</li>
            <li>Similar products of the same brand were priced about  $5 higher in the store,  so extremely great price too :-)  </li>
            <li>The trick is to find the right amount for your hair.</li>
            <li>and super fast shipping too,</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores and it works very well with my hair!</li>
            <li>Really makes your hair fun.</li>
            <li>This is only okay if you don&#x27;t mind sticky hair.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several of my friends looking for more lively hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>Apply to damp hair (better to ere on the side of wet here).</li>
            <li>This is great stuff that textures even thin hair</li>
            <li>I really like the curl</li>
            <li>It really worked well and recoiled my spiral perm that I had 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li>This calms and defines my curls not only on the first day, but my hair looks just as great and tame on day 2, as well!  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>After conditioning hair, I apply a small amount of this cream to my hair, then begin with hair gel for more control.</li>
            <li>and the product easily washes out, so not like heavy, ethnic products at all.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally semi-wavy hair and have tried to find something that amplified it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it, and I have lovely soft curls that last for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;******If</li>
            <li>I also have major allergies to hair products, etc.</li>
            <li>It has completely brought my curly hair back to life.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it would be good for thin hair or hair that&#x27;s not textured, but just a guess.  </li>
            <li>This product gave some body to  my short straight hair, ruffled my hair with my hands and got some  slight waves.</li>

            <li> This product gave some body to  my short straight hair, ruffled my hair with my hands and got some  slight waves.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product for people with really curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once a week as it&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> I got it about 3 days earlier than was expected.</li>
            <li> I use them together, so it&#x27;s hard to say how this product works on its own, but it will give your curly hair some sheen and hold, but you need a spray for serious hold and separated curls unless you have a very tight curl pattern.  </li>
            <li> Also dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I rub some in hands then apply it on my hair in a scrunching way and use the diffuser to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> well if I apply a generous amount to my damp hair after I use the TIGI Bed Head leave-in conditioner as well as their Glaze Haze serum, then letting my hair air dry</li>
            <li> and I run a line of cream down the length of my middle finger.</li>
            <li> (i.e. go to sleep with my wet hair).</li>
            <li> I have short above the shoulder hair that is THICK</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and my hairstylist used this cream and a curl spray from another line on my hair, but I bought Tigi&#x27;s spray.  </li>
            <li> I cant say for sure that the dry frizzies were all due to this product because i also used the bedhead shampoo with it, which i also hated.</li>
            <li> your hair is frizzy, you probably need to apply it when your hair is slightly wetter</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t waste any money on this.</li>
            <li> Then emulsify the product in your hand for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> makes hair a little stiff when it dries.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair again after using and start all over with my usual products.</li>
            <li> No frizz at all until at least day 3.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thick</li>
            <li> I have wavey medium to thin hair.</li>
            <li> it restores luster, shine and bounce to tired curls.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just what I desperately needed.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Love it for the curly look. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy!</li>
            <li> I received this product to try for free as I&#x27;m a Bzz agent so I didn&#x27;t waste any money on this. This product actually took all the curl out of my hair and made it very gross feeling. Also dry and frizzy. I cant say for sure that the dry frizzies were all due to this product because i also used the bedhead shampoo with it, which i also hated. I had to wash my hair again after using and start all over with my usual products. I thought maybe I was being biased since I am accustomed to all natural products (my hair is very healthy), so I gave it to my neighbor to try. She came over after using it and looked like she had been electrocuted. She said she didn&#x27;t like it either. I got a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li> Finally something keeps my curls without being sticky</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for my hair product :-) I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores and it works very well with my hair! Similar products of the same brand were priced about  $5 higher in the store,  so extremely great price too :-)  and super fast shipping too, wow! I will Definitely be ordering again from you in the future! Thanks again</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Put my hair back in order.</li>
            <li> It has completely brought my curly hair back to life. The trick is to find the right amount for your hair. I have short above the shoulder hair that is THICK and I run a line of cream down the length of my middle finger. Then emulsify the product in your hand for a few seconds. Apply to damp hair (better to ere on the side of wet here). I scrunch until almost all the product is off my hands. That&#x27;s it, and I have lovely soft curls that last for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;******If it&#x27;s sticky, you are using too much******&lt;br /&gt;******If your hair is frizzy, you probably need to apply it when your hair is slightly wetter******</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product and I had to try it.  I have not been disappointed.  It works well taming my curls and keeping my hair from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> This cream works great for me, so far! I have wavey medium to thin hair. I do feel that I use a lot, but then again, I am always over using product. I rub some in hands then apply it on my hair in a scrunching way and use the diffuser to dry my hair. Work great for me!</li>
            <li> I have naturally semi-wavy hair and have tried to find something that amplified it. This product smells great and seems to work well if I apply a generous amount to my damp hair after I use the TIGI Bed Head leave-in conditioner as well as their Glaze Haze serum, then letting my hair air dry (i.e. go to sleep with my wet hair). I have recommended this product to several of my friends looking for more lively hair.</li>
            <li> I personally do not like it...makes crunchy curls! Smells great tho!</li>
            <li> Great to get your wave to behave!! Really makes your hair fun.</li>
            <li> Very fast and great price</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just what I desperately needed.  It&#x27;s my favorite curly hair product!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is the BEST product that I have used for my curls! I didn&#x27;t need a lot, so it will last me for a while. I got it about 3 days earlier than was expected. I love it and will order it again. And the price is right!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff that textures even thin hair</li>
            <li> This product gave some body to  my short straight hair, ruffled my hair with my hands and got some  slight waves. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> FINALLY...the PERFECT solution for my girly headed daughter. This stuff is AMAZING. It leaves my daughter with beautiful, smooth, ringlet girls with no frizz in sight.  My search is over!</li>
            <li> Love this for my curly hair- works great with hair gel- After conditioning hair, I apply a small amount of this cream to my hair, then begin with hair gel for more control.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading a review on nymag. Received the product and it&#x27;s greasy, does not separate curls well, and looks frizzy anyway. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> makes hair a little stiff when it dries. It is stick while putting it on so only use a pea size amount and work thru hair.</li>
            <li> This calms and defines my curls not only on the first day, but my hair looks just as great and tame on day 2, as well!  Unbelievable product for people with really curly hair.  No frizz at all until at least day 3.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! It makes&lt;br /&gt;My curls like ringlets and I love it!! Will totally buy more!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for curly hair. It is especially good for a touch up at the end of the day - it restores luster, shine and bounce to tired curls.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and my hairstylist used this cream and a curl spray from another line on my hair, but I bought Tigi&#x27;s spray.

            <li> My curly hair is always looking good with this product. I love that I can wake up in the morning and just &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; it and go. I&#x27;ve used if for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Love that product, perfect results every time</li>
            <li> Great product....I love it.....</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of the TIGI Curlesque products and thought they worked VERY well, for those okay with silicones (ie, not strict Curly Girl method folks). I really like the curl amplifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG, it&#x27;s so sticky. It knotted up my curls. Not touchable. I had to put in a bunch of amplifier to soften up the recall gloopiness and detangle with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, no. This is only okay if you don&#x27;t mind sticky hair. And I like my hair touchable.  I&#x27;ll stick with the amplifier for refreshing curls when I go with silicones. (I go with Curl Junkie or Spiral Solutions when I want to cowash and avoid silicones.)</li>
            <li> I received this product as a trial test (4.22oz) and it works just as good as the AG recoil product I have been using, but much cheaper.  I did not have any sticky residue in my hair like someone else stated.  It really worked well and recoiled my spiral perm that I had 6 months ago.  You might want to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Cost 20.00 at salon. On line 11.00. SCORE!!!!</li>
            <li> Great frizz control. South Georgia humidity turns curly hair into frizz hair.  Tigi Bed Head Rebound Curl keeps frizz in check.</li>
