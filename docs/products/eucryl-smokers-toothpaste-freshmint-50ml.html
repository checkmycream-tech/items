    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>Taste is quite nice as well!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste</li>
            <li>It is pleasant but not overly flavored.  </li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>While advertised primarily as a \\&quot;smoker&#x27;s\\&quot; toothpaste, we have found that this works wonderfully against tea</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce the stains and the flavor is good too.</li>
            <li>Good taste too.</li>
            <li>okay but not as good as topol toothpaste!</li>
            <li>But I can say that I notice a positive difference in color after giving my teeth a good scrub with this!</li>
            <li>My husband love this toothpaste</li>
            <li>I will says most of the stains are gone</li>
            <li>However wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the whitening.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than any whitening toothpaste and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Great product just like the tooth powder works very well.</li>
            <li>My wife says my teeth are more than 100% whiter.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and I haven&#x27;t had any gum problems so far, so I just ordered 3 more tubes as my wife wanted a tube for herself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly considering it comes from abroad.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it works to fight cavities and help with sensitivity because that&#x27;s the job of my primary toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this often because we use floride free toothpastes at home and this contains that.</li>
            <li>The tooth paste is far superior for my needs.</li>
            <li>Since I am a smoker, and enjoy both coffee and tea, this toothpaste is great for providing a sparkling white smile.  </li>
            <li>This gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much and recommend for easy whitening.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>you no longer need white strips which is a huge savings!!</li>
            <li>This item was shipped fast and securely.</li>
            <li>Made my mouth extremely fresh.</li>
            <li>The taste is just as good as my other t-paste</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not smokers but I purchased this toothpaste for dental stains from coffee and tea and it works really well!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works better than any I have found at local stores.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is exactly as named:  freshmint, and the texture is not at all \\&quot;gritty\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and she said it would be ok to use but not daily since it could strip the enamel from teeth so in between</li>
            <li>I just finished my first tube of Eucaryl and my wife says my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>We certainly will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li>My crest vivid white toothpaste works better.</li>
            <li>but it does work really well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Bummer really at a lost of what to say bout this product.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My whole family (which includes 2 pre-teen boys) LOVES this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I really like both products.  </li>
            <li>I just found that the amount for the price was a bit too much.</li>
            <li>but I would not say it whitens any more than my other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t notice it Comes from the UK, which is why shipping is high.</li>
            <li>I have been using this instead of my normal toothpaste and notice visibly whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>Maybe a bigger tube normal size would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I will finish it because I paid for it, but other than that, that is all it does; clean teeth.</li>
            <li>right to the point, I know what other viewers have said, but that has not been my experience.</li>
            <li>, the seller British Goodies shipped quickly and I received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I guess a professional dental cleaning will only work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smoke for a long time already and hope this toothpaste will help me to keep my teeth in normal condition</li>
            <li>If you use the powder also really, really clean or at least you teeth</li>
            <li>I have not seen any major improvements over my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting some sort of miracle, hahaha, but this is just plain old toothpaste.</li>

            <li> I guess I was expecting some sort of miracle, hahaha, but this is just plain old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Also, I use this at least once a day and have had no ill effects or pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> You can tell a difference after just one use but for it to take a permanent effect you really need to use it for at least 6 months...</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be helping with the tea stains I have from going overboard with teas in recent months.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered a week earlier expected date.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Simply use it as you would any other toothpaste, twice per day, and you stop &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; and start whitening.  </li>
            <li> which obviously this small tube would not last.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; between my dentist&#x27;s appointments (which are not very often).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and is shipped from England, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Will take a period of time to know if it works on brightening my enamel due to nicotine stains.</li>
            <li> They look whiter to me also, not dazzling white but about 50% less yellow and stained than they were.</li>
            <li> I like to keep an extra tube of toothpaste in my shower, so this is my secondary toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as effective as I would have thought, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste along with with the Eucryl powder and an electric toothbrush after my professional teeth cleaning left my teeth still feeling dirty.  </li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker and getting stains out of my teeth can be a trial.  </li>
            <li> I specifically tequested the Eucry Smokers Toothpaste and received the Eucryl Tooth Powder of which I ordered once before and disliked it.</li>
            <li> It has decreased the appearance of discoloration in just a matter of a week or two.</li>

            <li> I bought this toothpaste hoping it would remove brown stains on my teeth caused by a mouthwash.  The stains did not even fade.  I guess a professional dental cleaning will only work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the seller British Goodies shipped quickly and I received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I like to keep an extra tube of toothpaste in my shower, so this is my secondary toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t know how well it works to fight cavities and help with sensitivity because that&#x27;s the job of my primary toothpaste.  But I can say that I notice a positive difference in color after giving my teeth a good scrub with this! The taste is just as good as my other t-paste and it does NOT cause sensitivity, which was a concern I had.</li>
            <li> My husband love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> This along with the tooth powder.....you no longer need white strips which is a huge savings!!</li>
            <li> This item was shipped fast and securely. The product works. I have been using this instead of my normal toothpaste and notice visibly whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t that great but it does work really well. It even lasts a couple of days inbetween my regular toothpaste. I would suggest any smoker to use this.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting some sort of miracle, hahaha, but this is just plain old toothpaste. My crest vivid white toothpaste works better. I have not seen any major improvements over my regular toothpaste. It has a pleasant taste but I would not say it whitens any more than my other toothpaste. I will finish it because I paid for it, but other than that, that is all it does; clean teeth.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE ORDERED THIS AND I NEVER WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference. Not size of regular size of  tube of toothpaste. Bummer really at a lost of what to say bout this product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not smokers but I purchased this toothpaste for dental stains from coffee and tea and it works really well!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly considering it comes from abroad. I like it very much and recommend for easy whitening.  It works good.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Just reordered for my son. If you didn&#x27;t notice it Comes from the UK, which is why shipping is high.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product, I have not noticed a difference.  That&#x27;s it plan and right to the point, I know what other viewers have said, but that has not been my experience. Will not be buying it again. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker and getting stains out of my teeth can be a trial.  This toothpaste works better than any I have found at local stores.  Taste is quite nice as well!</li>
            <li> My whole family (which includes 2 pre-teen boys) LOVES this toothpaste.  While advertised primarily as a \\&quot;smoker&#x27;s\\&quot; toothpaste, we have found that this works wonderfully against tea (they boys and I) and coffee (my husband) stains.  The flavor is exactly as named:  freshmint, and the texture is not at all \\&quot;gritty\\&quot;.  We certainly will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to in hopes to remove some coffee stains from Teeth and to my surprise it worked ,i did bring this to my Dentist before i started using this and she said it would be ok to use but not daily since it could strip the enamel from teeth so in between i use my regular toothpaste.I will says most of the stains are gone i have this along with the powder they make and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Made my mouth extremely fresh. However wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the whitening.</li>
            <li> okay but not as good as topol toothpaste!</li>
            <li> No big deal. Not nearly as effective as I would have thought, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste along with with the Eucryl powder and an electric toothbrush after my professional teeth cleaning left my teeth still feeling dirty.  I really like both products.  I just wish this tube of toothpaste were a bit larger!</li>
            <li> It was delivered a week earlier expected date.&lt;br /&gt;I smoke for a long time already and hope this toothpaste will help me to keep my teeth in normal condition&lt;br /&gt; between my dentist&#x27;s appointments (which are not very often).</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce the stains and the flavor is good too. I don&#x27;t use this often because we use floride free toothpastes at home and this contains that. But it works.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been whiter and brighter! This stuff is better than any whitening toothpaste and lasts longer. I drink coffee all day and smoke and ALL the stains are gone! Also, I use this at least once a day and have had no ill effects or pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Great product just like the tooth powder works very well. I use it with the powder and my teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li> This gets your teeth clean.  If you use the powder also really, really clean or at least you teeth feel super clean.  I know mine do.</li>
            <li> Since I am a smoker, and enjoy both coffee and tea, this toothpaste is great for providing a sparkling white smile.  Simply use it as you would any other toothpaste, twice per day, and you stop &amp;#34;yellowing&amp;#34; and start whitening.  Good taste too.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first tube of Eucaryl and my wife says my teeth are noticeably whiter. They look whiter to me also, not dazzling white but about 50% less yellow and stained than they were. The taste is pleasant and I haven&#x27;t had any gum problems so far, so I just ordered 3 more tubes as my wife wanted a tube for herself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/20/12. I have been using this for a couple of months and it&#x27;s time to reorder. My wife says my teeth are more than 100% whiter. I like the taste and have had no problems with sensitivity of teeth or gums. I guess this is my brand now. Excellent product. It&#x27;s expensive and is shipped from England, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I just found that the amount for the price was a bit too much. Maybe a bigger tube normal size would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I like it that it is not a toothpaste that overwhelms you with flavors.  It is pleasant but not overly flavored.  So far it seems to be helping with the tea stains I have from going overboard with teas in recent months.  It has decreased the appearance of discoloration in just a matter of a week or two.</li>
            <li> Just received this product.  Will take a period of time to know if it works on brightening my enamel due to nicotine stains.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to. No complains. You can tell a difference after just one use but for it to take a permanent effect you really need to use it for at least 6 months... which obviously this small tube would not last.</li>
            <li> I specifically tequested the Eucry Smokers Toothpaste and received the Eucryl Tooth Powder of which I ordered once before and disliked it. The tooth paste is far superior for my needs. Therefore I have disposed of this product and will resubmit for the toothpaste.</li>
