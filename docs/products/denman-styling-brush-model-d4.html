            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Denman brush before and loved it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best brush I own.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been thinking about buying my own.</li>
            <li>This was a perfect replacement for my old Denman brush.  </li>
            <li>and I love using it when I am doing roller sets.</li>
            <li>Love it so does my daughter</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>I will forever love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love how the bristles are removable.</li>
            <li>I love the way it glides through my curls with ease and helps to get any product evenly distributed into my hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair brush in the world.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is an ok brush.</li>
            <li>The best hair brush that will last for many years.</li>
            <li>This brush gets a strong hold of my hair, which I like.</li>
            <li>Love, Love,  Love my new brush!</li>
            <li>: Gives good curl definition on my WET hair WITH some kind of product in it eg.</li>
            <li>I used 48 hours after receiving it and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The head is significantly heavier than the handle, which leads to muscle fatigue quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I thought i would be able to detangle like the natural women on youtube - but no-</li>
            <li>However, it does give good &#x27;curl definition&#x27; on wet</li>
            <li>But it seemed to work ok on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>am debating on trying either the heavyweight handle version or the wooden one to see if either one is more balanced &amp; comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush is heavier than most, which isn’t exactly a con, but coupled with the two design flaws listed above, I have no idea how people get through a full blow-out using</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
            <li>Detangling is much easier with the DENMAN brush.</li>
            <li>It really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Good product for detangling curly thick hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very sturdy so they make it much easier to blow out my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally brush my hair and</li>
            <li>when used on WET detangled hair with product,I still found that there were too many strands left in the Denman brush (I think the teezer is &#x27;softer&#x27; than the Denman though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a really good job detangling, with a little less hair loss for me.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as soft as the youtubers make it seem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would NOT buy this again and would NOT recommend it to a &#x27;natural&#x27; sista.</li>
            <li>Personally, I am an African American with natural hair of 4B  </li>
            <li>I have very thick curly hair that knots easily, and it reduces my breakage so much compared to other styling tools.</li>

            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I have to be careful because the stiffness of the bristles sometimes scrapes my scalp.</li>
            <li> : Do NOT use this on DRY hair.</li>
            <li> It detangles my wet/ dry hair with minimum snagging.</li>
            <li> I did however modify it (see youtube for details on this) and removed every other row.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use my other combs or brushes anymore.</li>

            <li> tou everyday routine</li>
            <li> I got this one to replace the one I had that was wearing out, but I should have bought the heavy duty version.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this one were harsher on my scalp than the heavy duty brush I had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too stiff or harsh, but will go through the thickest hair, and the bristles will make your scalp feel like it was just massaged.</li>
            <li> im not sure if I will add this time</li>
            <li> I will wait until my next cold wash and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are flaws in the design that make brushing my hair less than enjoyable:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> - The handle feels  ½ - 1 inch short, making feel awkward &amp; uncomfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> I thought i would be able to detangle like the natural women on youtube - but no- i can&#x27;t get this thing through my 4b hair no matter what. well made - just not for me.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as soft as the youtubers make it seem. I would not have bought it if I had known that. However, it does give good &#x27;curl definition&#x27; on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the &#x27;naturals&#x27; out there, I have &#x27;4a&#x27; type hair, low density (fine/thin hair) and low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Gives good curl definition on my WET hair WITH some kind of product in it eg. Cantu shea butter cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Do NOT use this on DRY hair. It will break your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even when used on WET detangled hair with product,I still found that there were too many strands left in the Denman brush (I think the teezer is &#x27;softer&#x27; than the Denman though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would NOT buy this again and would NOT recommend it to a &#x27;natural&#x27; sista. To me, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brush I own.  It detangles my hair well and I love using it when I am doing roller sets. A couple brushes through and my hair is smooth, and my roller sets are perfect.</li>
            <li> The 1st time I used this brush to detangle (4a curly hair) I had the best hairday ever.  I did however modify it (see youtube for details on this) and removed every other row.  So amazing!</li>
            <li> If u have curly hair u need this brush. I&#x27;ll never buy another brush ever again.</li>
            <li> Love, Love,  Love my new brush! Along with finger-combing, my Denman helps me distribute my products in my hair. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Good product for detangling curly thick hair. Only problem rubber part may detach and come off handle</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter she loves it! I also tried it and I&#x27;m very impressed, I&#x27;ve been thinking about buying my own.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another Denman Brush which had lasted for 30 years.  It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews about this product. I&#x27;m transitioning (8 months post relaxer) I&#x27;ve been using it on my relaxed hair and it was getting tangled all over. But it seemed to work ok on my natural hair. Will give it a try when I big chop</li>
            <li> I looove this brush!! I don&#x27;t even use my other combs or brushes anymore. I have very thick curly hair that knots easily, and it reduces my breakage so much compared to other styling tools. Buy one!!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Had so much trouble prior to getting this brush with my daughters very thick hair.  Got the brush and modified it so it had about 5 rows.  Wonderful.  She doesn&#x27;t even cry anymore.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect replacement for my old Denman brush.  I used 48 hours after receiving it and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it so does my daughter</li>
            <li> I would recommend this DENMAN brush to anyone with any hair type. Personally, I am an African American with natural hair of 4B  and I LOVE this brush. Detangling is much easier with the DENMAN brush. The Shipper is also  excellent with getting the product delivered to the customer on time. I got my DENMAN brush in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally brush my hair and im not sure if I will add this time tou everyday routine but I do like it.  I will wait until my next cold wash and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> This brush gets a strong hold of my hair, which I like. It does a really good job detangling, with a little less hair loss for me. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I have to be careful because the stiffness of the bristles sometimes scrapes my scalp.</li>
            <li> I will forever love this brush. I love how the bristles are removable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen numerous curly girls on YT talking about this brush and have been wanting one for a while.  I love the way it glides through my curls with ease and helps to get any product evenly distributed into my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair brush in the world.&lt;br /&gt;This is all I will buy. It&#x27;s not too stiff or harsh, but will go through the thickest hair, and the bristles will make your scalp feel like it was just massaged. I&#x27;ve had similar brushes, but usually the bristles are a little too sharp. The Denman is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I was using a knock off version that I got from Sally&#x27;s and finally just decided to purchase one.  It really made a difference.  The bristles are very sturdy so they make it much easier to blow out my natural hair.  My hairstylist swears by this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush does its job well. It detangles my wet/ dry hair with minimum snagging. Unfortunately, there are flaws in the design that make brushing my hair less than enjoyable:&lt;br /&gt;1. Unbalanced - The head is significantly heavier than the handle, which leads to muscle fatigue quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Short Handle - The handle feels  ½ - 1 inch short, making feel awkward &amp; uncomfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is heavier than most, which isn’t exactly a con, but coupled with the two design flaws listed above, I have no idea how people get through a full blow-out using it.&lt;br /&gt;I am debating on trying either the heavyweight handle version or the wooden one to see if either one is more balanced &amp; comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an ok brush.</li>
            <li> I have 5 girls who each have a different texture of hair. This brush saves my life with each of them.</li>
            <li> still intact and makes my hair curl and funk YAAAAAASSSS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Denman brush before and loved it. I got this one to replace the one I had that was wearing out, but I should have bought the heavy duty version. The bristles on this one were harsher on my scalp than the heavy duty brush I had. I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
            <li> The best hair brush that will last for many years.</li>
