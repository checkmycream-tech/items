            <li>Great buy !!</li>
            <li>I placed the cap on my head  on my head and relaxed,  thinking I was getting an awesome treatment.  </li>

            <li>Love it !!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>no complaints so far!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I would also use a very good conditioner with this, hair quality does improve.</li>
            <li>This is really a good product!  </li>
            <li>, I get great distribution if plug it in and watch TV for an hr.</li>
            <li>I am so happy.</li>
            <li>I have it on the highest setting (3 dots) and it is warm at best.  </li>
            <li>But anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great substitue as to salon treatment in terms of the price and convenience.</li>
            <li>Worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great light-weight option for heating products on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was great the box was not dented or ripped in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cap heats up great for the maximum time of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is a great heat cap, I read all the reviews and decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>great for removing cuticles also.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still nice and toasty!    </li>
            <li>my hair stylist freaked out like I have the most awesome hair ever.</li>
            <li>One thing about it is if it&#x27;s on your head you will have to find a good position because it irritates and heats your ear too.</li>
            <li>The service was good</li>
            <li>or the seller paid someone to write those good comments?\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>So I just come here and add another good comment.</li>
            <li>I will however keep the cap as I think it does a good job of providing heat</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely great at getting the job done:-)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the result over the years.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the cap.</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It does get hot, you do have to adjust it to your head, and medium was the best set.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have had this for over a year and it works wonderfully, it does get nice and hot.</li>
            <li>and it still warm for a while.</li>
            <li>This makes me wonder how effective my conditioning treatment will be.  </li>
            <li>Good luck getting the Hot Tools piece of stuff to heat up at all!!!    </li>
            <li>and i Love it, it does what it says, nice size cap,</li>
            <li>so it hair doesn&#x27;t get as warm on the top as it should.</li>
            <li>it feels more warm than anything.  </li>
            <li>I just believe if you are going to make an effective heating cap for your customers make sure it does the job in all sections</li>
            <li>I can also expect the same great results as before because this thermal heat cap works great.</li>
            <li>It really kept my head warm and neck warm which feels good.</li>
            <li>Works just fine, the material is good and the three heat settings make it easy to control the heat.</li>
            <li>However, as noted in point 2, most of the hair is on top and that is where the heat goes</li>
            <li>*  8-)</li>
            <li>piled up my hair so most of my hair would be where the heat is concentrated and let it sit for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>I use Ojon with it and have fallen in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li>so I will deal with just getting the top and sides heated.</li>
            <li>I think this product is better than sitting under the dryer, because there is no space for air to escape.</li>
            <li>and I was glad because I don&#x27;t like things like that.</li>
            <li>I love my cap.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is an excellent value, since I&#x27;ve seen the Mastex cap in beauty supply stores for double the price.     </li>
            <li>My hair is more healthy since using this cap.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that as a result of using this product, I am able to sport healthy hair in a combat environment.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with it.</li>
            <li>But, for the most part, it does the job.  </li>
            <li>My hope was that I would be more diligent with conditioning with heat if I had something more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s where most of the heat goes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I just love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reviewing comments others have made and I must say I&#x27;m not all that pleased.</li>
            <li>and my hair is getting better with each application.</li>
            <li>I love the cap because as it heats it relaxes me too, I like to relax when I wear it.</li>
            <li>So, despite the drawbacks, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing.</li>
            <li>The top of the cap has a lot of space between hair and cap.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>This cap fits perfectly into my hair regimen, and I love that it&#x27;s not bulky like a standard dryer.</li>
            <li>its okay i wish it would get hotter</li>
            <li>Heats up all over and is very easy to use, not to mention easy to store because it&#x27;s not bulky or space consuming like others.</li>
            <li>I have the Hot tools Cap - and it takes FOREVER to heat up!!!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and will fit most head sizes.</li>
            <li>she loved it so much that I had to get one for myself!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and does a good job.</li>
            <li>i am truly thrilled with the product and the super service.</li>
            <li>The cap gets very hot, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Very good buy, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>This thermal cap is a great product, I hope it last for many more years to come.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li>But other than that great heating cap!</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy fix:</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to take this with you anywhere</li>
            <li>But now everything is easy because of this product.</li>
            <li>The directions were easy to read and she still uses the product a lot.</li>
            <li>product would be great if the heat was distributed evenly around the cap and it came in different sizes as opposed to having the huge space on top.</li>
            <li>The cap took about 15 minutes to warm up and it does get hot if the cap makes contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>The cap seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>First, the cap fits perfectly, and second, my hair texture has improved already.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly!</li>
            <li>Just give it a twist and smooth it over your head.    </li>
            <li>I give it three stars because it stays secure to your head</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the cap will fit my head, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wipe clean inside and out.</li>
            <li>works great for deep conditioning my hair</li>
            <li>The cap is comfortable to wear, however, I do recommend that you use ear protectors from the heat.</li>
            <li>The shape of the cap allows for a snug fit to the head without covering your face.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good temporary fixed but would never compare with my dryer.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m definitely in love with it right now.</li>
            <li>I feel it is still fairly workable w/o strapping it down and try to put most of my arm pit length hair on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and does exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the seller I originally bought this from (my receipt says USA Vitamins?), but wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s evident that the cap was made to condition the ends (oldest and most susceptible to breakage) of your hair.</li>
            <li>It would be interesting to see what readings people get with a thermometer that has a higher range.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this cap and was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I made sure no one was around the first time I used it, and recommend this product to anyone looking for a heat cap.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that at first I saw so many 5 star rate, I was thinking:\\&quot;are all of those true?</li>
            <li>Ordered product and received it in 3 days; which was such a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact it is notice free, it gets very hot very quite.</li>
            <li>A true Godsend.  </li>
            <li>I think it would also be good to use with extra conditioning products.  </li>
            <li>which dries out my hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Also, the seller delivered this quickly and effeciently.</li>
            <li>Heats evenly and quickly, temp.</li>
            <li>My hooded dryer finally gave out, and I decided I wanted something that would allow more flexibility when using (i.e. not having to place the hooded dryer on a table top and be confined to a chair).</li>
            <li>When I stuff all of my hair into the weird top space in the cap, the cap fits perfectly and the heat is warmest in that space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I put my hair up high on top of my head and put a plastic can to hold it.  </li>
            <li>It still gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>The cap does get very hot, which I like, because I have a lot of hair to heat and the heat penetrates all the way to my scalp.</li>
            <li>When the heat cap first arrived, I thought OMG, how does this thing fit on my head?</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the new cap for the first time today,  It takes a minute to heat up, but still a very good purchase that I hope last another 20 years!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this heating cap and I think its pretty good for the fact that it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be aware of the direction that the hose is coming in because it could get rather warm or if on high hot.</li>
            <li>The best part is that I now get to comfortably dry my hair without the noise and without being stuck in the same position in a chair for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this cap for three or four years and until recently had amazing hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural for over a year now and needed some better routines for my hair.    </li>
            <li>my hair  is only WARM.  </li>
            <li>The cap does not get warm enough.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>it heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>it gets very hot, and stays hot.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>This heating cap gets warm very fast and it warms my entire head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes thats right</li>
            <li>Very useful and easy to deal, my hair came back to life!</li>
            <li>But overall the product is great, now I don&#x27;t have to spend money in the beauty salon paying for a deep conditioning treatment, I&#x27;ll do that at home!</li>
            <li>I was using a plain heating pad prior to this for henna application, so I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>A friend said she slips a turbie twist type towel on first.  </li>
            <li>I do a hot oil treatment a minimum of once a month.  </li>
            <li>* I still use this heating cap and it still works like it did when I first received it.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a month for my hot oil treatment (olive oil and coconut oil).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Helping (I pray) get my hair back to its healthy, shiny state.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has multiple settings and it&#x27;s way better than Gold N Hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>surprised they aren&#x27;t available in tons of stores.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t too hot.  </li>
            <li>I will try this a second time, but will most probably return it.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot, but not uncomfortable so.  </li>
            <li>Will get hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hot at all.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I read many that said they had a problem with heating in the back</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I think I drifted off to sleep in it</li>
            <li>Its my first heating cap.  </li>
            <li>use it at the hottest adjustment because though it gets warmer than my body the plastic cap keeps it from getting uncomfortably hot.</li>
            <li>: Add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil -heat</li>
            <li>definitely brings out the aroma more.</li>
            <li>just got this, and am wearing it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I love using this product especially when I do my hair treatment.</li>
            <li>Also, be aware that the heat is so soothing that you just may fall asleep.</li>
            <li>I can do the same thing as with the hooded dryer but while relaxing on the couch and tuning into my favorite tv show/movie.</li>
            <li>Felt most of the heat on top, heat does rises, had to press the back of the head to make sure there was heat back there, there was, guess my long hair was in the way.  </li>
            <li>I love the product because it heats up very well, the second notch is the highest that I will go.  </li>
            <li>Awesome...after I used it..my hair becomes shiny and soft...just noticed, not enough heat at the back of it...but its still good...</li>
            <li>This conditioning cap heats up fast and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Mastex thermal heat cap after reading a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Despite that minor problem I still use the heating cap and will continue to do so until it doesn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had no problems, the only thing is that it heats more on the top of the crown, so you may have to put your hair on a high pony tail if is long...</li>
            <li>Now back to this review the top and sides are hot, the back is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>The heat is not as strong in the very back of the cap but that&#x27;s not anything that a plastic cap wont solve.  </li>
            <li>The heat output is good and as long as you are aware that this product is not designed to DRY your hair.</li>
            <li>If I need to step away a couple minutes - it stays warm for a little while.    </li>
            <li>I also stopped doing the heating cap as regularly and noticed a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really thirsty.    </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>so my ears do not touch the cap too much.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing after taking a shower to have the cap on my head-</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better,healthier than before.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I use heat when I need the condish to penetrate fast.</li>
            <li>really works well.  </li>
            <li>Well made and the results are much cheaper than going to a salon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have that much hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover whole head</li>
            <li>but I do have a whole lota hair on my head.</li>
            <li>off I received this really quick,which is an A+ in my book.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still it gets much hotter than my head would if I just wrapped it with plastic and a scarf.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pluses: silent; medium heat seting is comfortable; long cord; pretty comfortable to wear; can wear in the tub; couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:</li>
            <li>It was cheaply made and did not heat up at all in the back.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice heavy cord.  </li>
            <li>I love going back and looking at old reviews to see what I can update.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hot when it&#x27;s on my head, and the cap is cool at all the outside edges where it might come in contact with skin (around the hairline).  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t warm up on the back of your head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and my hair feels really nice for a few days after I do a treatment.</li>
            <li>But after trying it once, my hair condition really improved much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It was too warm in the cap for my digital thermometer to read the temperature so it definitely gets over 107 degrees.</li>
            <li>Good product, like other reviewers, the back did not heat as well, so I had to rotate the hat around.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that other people wrote in with their review, and me reading it before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>The back of the cap had two creases from the way they fold it in its original box...</li>
            <li>It gets really hot without being uncomfortable and has given my deep conditioning sessions an awesome boost in effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It is so much more convenient than my other tools.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough for effective deep conditioning; the heating coils are not distributed far enough to the edge of the cap to heat the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I actually have one that is about 20 years old &amp; is still going strong, this one was a back-up just in case...</li>
            <li>There is a cool spot in the nape area; I just part my hair in the middle and clip on either side of my head before applying the plastic cap--this way, all of my strands receive the benefits of the heat.</li>
            <li>The cons: 1)It can get pretty hot on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>control seems to adjust quickly and evenly between high, med. and low temps.  </li>
            <li>On some days it seems to warm up stronger on the first setting than other days and based on the other reviews that I have read for this product, I have yet to determine if the heat is distributed to other areas aside from just the top (crown) of your head.</li>
            <li>I am currently in Iraq where the weather is very hot</li>
            <li>heat is high and adjustible.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>so sticks up too high on head</li>
            <li>sometimes when I do use high heat</li>
            <li>and I did put the setting on high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that the bottom of the back does not get warm, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shaped a little goofy.  </li>
            <li>sized to fit enormous heads; doesn&#x27;t heat much of the back of head; goes over ears, which burns on high heat; chin strap doesn&#x27;t fasten easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that I can unplug it and run downstairs and do a few things</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of nice when the house is a bit chilly - instead of wearing a hat indoors, i can condition my hair!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this because many others have left reviews stating the same fact.  </li>
            <li>Put your hand on the back of your head right now--</li>
            <li>and I set the cap on high and kept checking the hair at the back/lower part of my head and after a few minutes my hair in the back was quite warm.</li>
            <li>I was eager to use my new product</li>
            <li>So, my first reaction was that this blank company sent me a used product, but when I opened it the product was new.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the cap gets really hot but the back stopped working.  </li>
            <li>However, the back of the cap does  not get hot.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I usually leave henna on for an hour or more</li>
            <li>The cap gets really hot in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Anyway, no burns, but it&#x27;s definitely hot enough.</li>
            <li>But only the front of the cap was  hot.  </li>
            <li>Be careful, it really does get hot.</li>
            <li>And my hair was so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I did not mention that the reason why I do not go above 2, is because it is too much heat for my ears.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just have a giant head, but I would think even my giant head wouldn&#x27;t be larger than a smaller head with more hair.</li>
            <li>If so, I will look into a soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my deep conditioning regimen every week  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft even after washing out the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle heat on low, and can seemingly be worn indefinitely.  </li>
            <li>This cap has completely replaced my hooded dryer for me.</li>
            <li>The product arrived early.</li>
            <li>This steam cap is a good product for steaming hair if you don&#x27;t want to purchase expensive steamers.</li>
            <li>it could have been a little bigger to fit better on my head, or maybe my head could be a little smaller ??  </li>
            <li>I use the second notch because the third notch is way to hot.  </li>
            <li>but it is necessary to get the back hot.  </li>
            <li>I have low porosity hair, so deep conditioning or hot oil treatments with this cap helps me improve the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a small head so there was extra room at the top, but It did not change the heat distribution.</li>
            <li>The cap wasn&#x27;t hot enough for my hair and it only warmed the front and sides of my head.</li>
            <li>I also turn the hat around half way through my deep conditioning and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I am using it as I write this review, the cap is definitely hot if used on high, so hold tight as I adjust the temperature.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone especially those that have no space for a hard hat hair dryer and want to do effective deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only given this 4/5 stars because it&#x27;s still fairly new and who knows how it will perform 6 months from now</li>
            <li>i have thick, course hair and deep conditioners just lay on top of it but don&#x27;t penetrate.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like the size of the cap because it is hard to fit over my head, but it seems to do what it says it should do.</li>
            <li>For black hair, it is a battle just making sure that my hair has enough moisture, but this product has definitely eliminated the problem of \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item to help deep condition my natural hair.</li>
            <li>so I barely used it.</li>
            <li>I know we all talk about using too much heat can cause heat damage to the hair, at the same time this does not generate enough heat for my deep conditioning weeks.  </li>
            <li>Ok a few comments have been made about not much heat at the back.  </li>
            <li>just be careful with the third setting because it can get really hot.    </li>
            <li>I figured I would have to do this based on other reviews I read, and would have been willing to make this compromise if the cap heated/worked well enough.  </li>
            <li>One downfall to this product is that it fails to heat the back part of your hair, so what I end up having to do is section my hair up high on top of my head</li>
            <li>would most likely only need the second level unless you have thick hair.    </li>
            <li>When I first received the package the box was a little bent up.</li>
            <li>I have since then used it every first of the month give or take a few days.  </li>
            <li>I preheat the cap on the highest setting and then turn it down when I&#x27;m ready to use it.  </li>
            <li>You gotta have a small head and not a lot of hair to get this thing to even stay on your head right.</li>
            <li>This helped my deep conditioners penetrate even better and helped my 4b extra tight curled African American hair make it through the harsh Korean winters.</li>
            <li>As another review says if you have a very large head this is probably a small cap, I didn&#x27;t have a problem</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit frustrated when I noticed it doesn&#x27;t heat at the back/lower part of the head, so I took it off and plunked all of my hair on top of my head and then put the cap back on.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that this cap is so snug, it will not fit over larger hair styles ( I like to condition my braids with hot oil...)</li>
            <li>The shape and color are really weird, a light cobalt blue that&#x27;s shaped like the guards hats at Buckingham Palace, or the Cone head family on Saturday Night Live.  </li>
            <li>As a Massage Therapist, I was looking to use this for a purpose other than what it&#x27;s sold for...read about someone using it to put wet towels for hot compresses as a mobile massage therapist, but it didn&#x27;t seem to heat up enough, even on highest settings so will be returning it.</li>
            <li>My problem has always been very dry hair which makes my curls unruly, fly away and just makes my hair look bad.</li>
            <li>Hence I now look like a little boy, but after many tears I am in the process of deep conditioning my hair at least three times a week.  </li>

            <li> Great buy !!</li>
            <li> I placed the cap on my head  on my head and relaxed,  thinking I was getting an awesome treatment.  </li>

            <li> I would also use a very good conditioner with this, hair quality does improve.</li>
            <li> This is really a good product!  </li>
            <li> , I get great distribution if plug it in and watch TV for an hr.</li>
            <li> I am so happy.</li>
            <li> I have it on the highest setting (3 dots) and it is warm at best.  </li>
            <li> But anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great substitue as to salon treatment in terms of the price and convenience.</li>
            <li> Worked great.  </li>
            <li> Great price.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great light-weight option for heating products on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was great the box was not dented or ripped in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cap heats up great for the maximum time of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a great heat cap, I read all the reviews and decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> great for removing cuticles also.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still nice and toasty!    </li>
            <li> my hair stylist freaked out like I have the most awesome hair ever.</li>
            <li> One thing about it is if it&#x27;s on your head you will have to find a good position because it irritates and heats your ear too.</li>
            <li> The service was good</li>
            <li> or the seller paid someone to write those good comments?\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> So I just come here and add another good comment.</li>
            <li> I will however keep the cap as I think it does a good job of providing heat</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely great at getting the job done:-)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the result over the years.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the cap.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It does get hot, you do have to adjust it to your head, and medium was the best set.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year and it works wonderfully, it does get nice and hot.</li>
            <li> and it still warm for a while.</li>
            <li> This makes me wonder how effective my conditioning treatment will be.  </li>
            <li> Good luck getting the Hot Tools piece of stuff to heat up at all!!!    </li>
            <li> and i Love it, it does what it says, nice size cap,</li>
            <li> so it hair doesn&#x27;t get as warm on the top as it should.</li>
            <li> it feels more warm than anything.  </li>
            <li> I just believe if you are going to make an effective heating cap for your customers make sure it does the job in all sections</li>
            <li> I can also expect the same great results as before because this thermal heat cap works great.</li>
            <li> It really kept my head warm and neck warm which feels good.</li>
            <li> Works just fine, the material is good and the three heat settings make it easy to control the heat.</li>
            <li> However, as noted in point 2, most of the hair is on top and that is where the heat goes</li>
            <li> *  8-)</li>
            <li> piled up my hair so most of my hair would be where the heat is concentrated and let it sit for 30 mins.</li>
            <li> I use Ojon with it and have fallen in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li> so I will deal with just getting the top and sides heated.</li>
            <li> I think this product is better than sitting under the dryer, because there is no space for air to escape.</li>
            <li> and I was glad because I don&#x27;t like things like that.</li>
            <li> I love my cap.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is an excellent value, since I&#x27;ve seen the Mastex cap in beauty supply stores for double the price.     </li>
            <li> My hair is more healthy since using this cap.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that as a result of using this product, I am able to sport healthy hair in a combat environment.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with it.</li>
            <li> But, for the most part, it does the job.  </li>
            <li> My hope was that I would be more diligent with conditioning with heat if I had something more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s where most of the heat goes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reviewing comments others have made and I must say I&#x27;m not all that pleased.</li>
            <li> and my hair is getting better with each application.</li>
            <li> I love the cap because as it heats it relaxes me too, I like to relax when I wear it.</li>
            <li> So, despite the drawbacks, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing.</li>
            <li> The top of the cap has a lot of space between hair and cap.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This cap fits perfectly into my hair regimen, and I love that it&#x27;s not bulky like a standard dryer.</li>
            <li> its okay i wish it would get hotter</li>
            <li> Heats up all over and is very easy to use, not to mention easy to store because it&#x27;s not bulky or space consuming like others.</li>
            <li> I have the Hot tools Cap - and it takes FOREVER to heat up!!!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and will fit most head sizes.</li>
            <li> she loved it so much that I had to get one for myself!</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and does a good job.</li>
            <li> i am truly thrilled with the product and the super service.</li>
            <li> The cap gets very hot, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Very good buy, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This thermal cap is a great product, I hope it last for many more years to come.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> But other than that great heating cap!</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy fix:</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to take this with you anywhere</li>
            <li> But now everything is easy because of this product.</li>
            <li> The directions were easy to read and she still uses the product a lot.</li>
            <li> product would be great if the heat was distributed evenly around the cap and it came in different sizes as opposed to having the huge space on top.</li>
            <li> The cap took about 15 minutes to warm up and it does get hot if the cap makes contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> The cap seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> First, the cap fits perfectly, and second, my hair texture has improved already.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly!</li>
            <li> Just give it a twist and smooth it over your head.    </li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it stays secure to your head</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the cap will fit my head, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wipe clean inside and out.</li>
            <li> works great for deep conditioning my hair</li>
            <li> The cap is comfortable to wear, however, I do recommend that you use ear protectors from the heat.</li>
            <li> The shape of the cap allows for a snug fit to the head without covering your face.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good temporary fixed but would never compare with my dryer.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m definitely in love with it right now.</li>
            <li> I feel it is still fairly workable w/o strapping it down and try to put most of my arm pit length hair on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and does exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the seller I originally bought this from (my receipt says USA Vitamins?), but wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s evident that the cap was made to condition the ends (oldest and most susceptible to breakage) of your hair.</li>
            <li> It would be interesting to see what readings people get with a thermometer that has a higher range.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this cap and was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I made sure no one was around the first time I used it, and recommend this product to anyone looking for a heat cap.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that at first I saw so many 5 star rate, I was thinking:\\&quot;are all of those true?</li>
            <li> Ordered product and received it in 3 days; which was such a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact it is notice free, it gets very hot very quite.</li>
            <li> A true Godsend.  </li>
            <li> I think it would also be good to use with extra conditioning products.  </li>
            <li> which dries out my hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Also, the seller delivered this quickly and effeciently.</li>
            <li> Heats evenly and quickly, temp.</li>
            <li> My hooded dryer finally gave out, and I decided I wanted something that would allow more flexibility when using (i.e. not having to place the hooded dryer on a table top and be confined to a chair).</li>
            <li> When I stuff all of my hair into the weird top space in the cap, the cap fits perfectly and the heat is warmest in that space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I put my hair up high on top of my head and put a plastic can to hold it.  </li>
            <li> It still gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> The cap does get very hot, which I like, because I have a lot of hair to heat and the heat penetrates all the way to my scalp.</li>
            <li> When the heat cap first arrived, I thought OMG, how does this thing fit on my head?</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the new cap for the first time today,  It takes a minute to heat up, but still a very good purchase that I hope last another 20 years!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this heating cap and I think its pretty good for the fact that it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be aware of the direction that the hose is coming in because it could get rather warm or if on high hot.</li>
            <li> The best part is that I now get to comfortably dry my hair without the noise and without being stuck in the same position in a chair for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this cap for three or four years and until recently had amazing hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural for over a year now and needed some better routines for my hair.    </li>
            <li> my hair  is only WARM.  </li>
            <li> The cap does not get warm enough.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> it heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> it gets very hot, and stays hot.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> This heating cap gets warm very fast and it warms my entire head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes thats right</li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to deal, my hair came back to life!</li>
            <li> But overall the product is great, now I don&#x27;t have to spend money in the beauty salon paying for a deep conditioning treatment, I&#x27;ll do that at home!</li>
            <li> I was using a plain heating pad prior to this for henna application, so I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> A friend said she slips a turbie twist type towel on first.  </li>
            <li> I do a hot oil treatment a minimum of once a month.  </li>
            <li> * I still use this heating cap and it still works like it did when I first received it.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a month for my hot oil treatment (olive oil and coconut oil).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Helping (I pray) get my hair back to its healthy, shiny state.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has multiple settings and it&#x27;s way better than Gold N Hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> surprised they aren&#x27;t available in tons of stores.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too hot.  </li>
            <li> I will try this a second time, but will most probably return it.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot, but not uncomfortable so.  </li>
            <li> Will get hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hot at all.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I read many that said they had a problem with heating in the back</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I think I drifted off to sleep in it</li>
            <li> Its my first heating cap.  </li>
            <li> use it at the hottest adjustment because though it gets warmer than my body the plastic cap keeps it from getting uncomfortably hot.</li>
            <li> : Add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil -heat</li>
            <li> definitely brings out the aroma more.</li>
            <li> just got this, and am wearing it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I love using this product especially when I do my hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Also, be aware that the heat is so soothing that you just may fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I can do the same thing as with the hooded dryer but while relaxing on the couch and tuning into my favorite tv show/movie.</li>
            <li> Felt most of the heat on top, heat does rises, had to press the back of the head to make sure there was heat back there, there was, guess my long hair was in the way.  </li>
            <li> I love the product because it heats up very well, the second notch is the highest that I will go.  </li>
            <li> Awesome...after I used it..my hair becomes shiny and soft...just noticed, not enough heat at the back of it...but its still good...</li>
            <li> This conditioning cap heats up fast and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mastex thermal heat cap after reading a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Despite that minor problem I still use the heating cap and will continue to do so until it doesn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had no problems, the only thing is that it heats more on the top of the crown, so you may have to put your hair on a high pony tail if is long...</li>
            <li> Now back to this review the top and sides are hot, the back is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> The heat is not as strong in the very back of the cap but that&#x27;s not anything that a plastic cap wont solve.  </li>
            <li> The heat output is good and as long as you are aware that this product is not designed to DRY your hair.</li>
            <li> If I need to step away a couple minutes - it stays warm for a little while.    </li>
            <li> I also stopped doing the heating cap as regularly and noticed a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really thirsty.    </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> so my ears do not touch the cap too much.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing after taking a shower to have the cap on my head-</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better,healthier than before.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I use heat when I need the condish to penetrate fast.</li>
            <li> really works well.  </li>
            <li> Well made and the results are much cheaper than going to a salon.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have that much hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover whole head</li>
            <li> but I do have a whole lota hair on my head.</li>
            <li> off I received this really quick,which is an A+ in my book.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still it gets much hotter than my head would if I just wrapped it with plastic and a scarf.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pluses: silent; medium heat seting is comfortable; long cord; pretty comfortable to wear; can wear in the tub; couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made and did not heat up at all in the back.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice heavy cord.  </li>
            <li> I love going back and looking at old reviews to see what I can update.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hot when it&#x27;s on my head, and the cap is cool at all the outside edges where it might come in contact with skin (around the hairline).  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t warm up on the back of your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and my hair feels really nice for a few days after I do a treatment.</li>
            <li> But after trying it once, my hair condition really improved much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It was too warm in the cap for my digital thermometer to read the temperature so it definitely gets over 107 degrees.</li>
            <li> Good product, like other reviewers, the back did not heat as well, so I had to rotate the hat around.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that other people wrote in with their review, and me reading it before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The back of the cap had two creases from the way they fold it in its original box...</li>
            <li> It gets really hot without being uncomfortable and has given my deep conditioning sessions an awesome boost in effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It is so much more convenient than my other tools.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough for effective deep conditioning; the heating coils are not distributed far enough to the edge of the cap to heat the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I actually have one that is about 20 years old &amp; is still going strong, this one was a back-up just in case...</li>
            <li> There is a cool spot in the nape area; I just part my hair in the middle and clip on either side of my head before applying the plastic cap--this way, all of my strands receive the benefits of the heat.</li>
            <li> The cons: 1)It can get pretty hot on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> control seems to adjust quickly and evenly between high, med. and low temps.  </li>
            <li> On some days it seems to warm up stronger on the first setting than other days and based on the other reviews that I have read for this product, I have yet to determine if the heat is distributed to other areas aside from just the top (crown) of your head.</li>
            <li> I am currently in Iraq where the weather is very hot</li>
            <li> heat is high and adjustible.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> so sticks up too high on head</li>
            <li> sometimes when I do use high heat</li>
            <li> and I did put the setting on high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the bottom of the back does not get warm, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaped a little goofy.  </li>
            <li> sized to fit enormous heads; doesn&#x27;t heat much of the back of head; goes over ears, which burns on high heat; chin strap doesn&#x27;t fasten easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that I can unplug it and run downstairs and do a few things</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kind of nice when the house is a bit chilly - instead of wearing a hat indoors, i can condition my hair!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this because many others have left reviews stating the same fact.  </li>
            <li> Put your hand on the back of your head right now--</li>
            <li> and I set the cap on high and kept checking the hair at the back/lower part of my head and after a few minutes my hair in the back was quite warm.</li>
            <li> I was eager to use my new product</li>
            <li> So, my first reaction was that this blank company sent me a used product, but when I opened it the product was new.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the cap gets really hot but the back stopped working.  </li>
            <li> However, the back of the cap does  not get hot.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I usually leave henna on for an hour or more</li>
            <li> The cap gets really hot in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, no burns, but it&#x27;s definitely hot enough.</li>
            <li> But only the front of the cap was  hot.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, it really does get hot.</li>
            <li> And my hair was so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I did not mention that the reason why I do not go above 2, is because it is too much heat for my ears.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just have a giant head, but I would think even my giant head wouldn&#x27;t be larger than a smaller head with more hair.</li>
            <li> If so, I will look into a soft bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my deep conditioning regimen every week  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft even after washing out the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle heat on low, and can seemingly be worn indefinitely.  </li>
            <li> This cap has completely replaced my hooded dryer for me.</li>
            <li> The product arrived early.</li>
            <li> This steam cap is a good product for steaming hair if you don&#x27;t want to purchase expensive steamers.</li>
            <li> it could have been a little bigger to fit better on my head, or maybe my head could be a little smaller ??  </li>
            <li> I use the second notch because the third notch is way to hot.  </li>
            <li> but it is necessary to get the back hot.  </li>
            <li> I have low porosity hair, so deep conditioning or hot oil treatments with this cap helps me improve the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a small head so there was extra room at the top, but It did not change the heat distribution.</li>
            <li> The cap wasn&#x27;t hot enough for my hair and it only warmed the front and sides of my head.</li>
            <li> I also turn the hat around half way through my deep conditioning and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I am using it as I write this review, the cap is definitely hot if used on high, so hold tight as I adjust the temperature.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone especially those that have no space for a hard hat hair dryer and want to do effective deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only given this 4/5 stars because it&#x27;s still fairly new and who knows how it will perform 6 months from now</li>
            <li> i have thick, course hair and deep conditioners just lay on top of it but don&#x27;t penetrate.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the size of the cap because it is hard to fit over my head, but it seems to do what it says it should do.</li>
            <li> For black hair, it is a battle just making sure that my hair has enough moisture, but this product has definitely eliminated the problem of \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item to help deep condition my natural hair.</li>
            <li> so I barely used it.</li>
            <li> I know we all talk about using too much heat can cause heat damage to the hair, at the same time this does not generate enough heat for my deep conditioning weeks.  </li>
            <li> Ok a few comments have been made about not much heat at the back.  </li>
            <li> just be careful with the third setting because it can get really hot.    </li>
            <li> I figured I would have to do this based on other reviews I read, and would have been willing to make this compromise if the cap heated/worked well enough.  </li>
            <li> One downfall to this product is that it fails to heat the back part of your hair, so what I end up having to do is section my hair up high on top of my head</li>
            <li> would most likely only need the second level unless you have thick hair.    </li>
            <li> When I first received the package the box was a little bent up.</li>
            <li> I have since then used it every first of the month give or take a few days.  </li>
            <li> I preheat the cap on the highest setting and then turn it down when I&#x27;m ready to use it.  </li>
            <li> You gotta have a small head and not a lot of hair to get this thing to even stay on your head right.</li>
            <li> This helped my deep conditioners penetrate even better and helped my 4b extra tight curled African American hair make it through the harsh Korean winters.</li>
            <li> As another review says if you have a very large head this is probably a small cap, I didn&#x27;t have a problem</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit frustrated when I noticed it doesn&#x27;t heat at the back/lower part of the head, so I took it off and plunked all of my hair on top of my head and then put the cap back on.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that this cap is so snug, it will not fit over larger hair styles ( I like to condition my braids with hot oil...)</li>
            <li> The shape and color are really weird, a light cobalt blue that&#x27;s shaped like the guards hats at Buckingham Palace, or the Cone head family on Saturday Night Live.  </li>
            <li> As a Massage Therapist, I was looking to use this for a purpose other than what it&#x27;s sold for...read about someone using it to put wet towels for hot compresses as a mobile massage therapist, but it didn&#x27;t seem to heat up enough, even on highest settings so will be returning it.</li>
            <li> My problem has always been very dry hair which makes my curls unruly, fly away and just makes my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> Hence I now look like a little boy, but after many tears I am in the process of deep conditioning my hair at least three times a week.  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled by the results of my hot oil and deep conditioning treatments w/ this heating cap</li>
            <li> Ill stick with it as long as I can. :)</li>
            <li> Tried to use this and at first it was hot, 10 minutes later the back went cold.</li>
            <li> The only negative aspect is that the straps for the neck is uncomfortable and my entire head does not get a good heat treatment without it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times now for deep conditioning of my dry, coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ll do different next time is to use some round cotton pads to cover my ears because my ears were a little itchy after use, meaning they go too hot under the cap.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of this at first after reading some negative reviews, but gave it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li> The long back hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me or the elastic fastener.</li>
            <li> Within 5 more minutes the entire cap was cold.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair salon-bleached from dark blonde to platinum blonde and this product is saving my abused hair.  </li>
            <li> Unless I pull down very tight, it leaves quite a large space at the crown of my head, as though it were made for a conehead, not a human.</li>
            <li> only other drawbacks are being stuck to the distance of the cord which in total is about 73 inches long</li>
            <li> It should really come in at least two sizes.</li>
            <li> , it is strange.  </li>
            <li> Had to try twice to get all my long hair in the cap.   </li>
            <li> I have not had it too long (</li>
            <li> I have a hooded hair dryer that I would sit under for over an hour when I did deep conditioning or wet sets on my hair.</li>
            <li> Tired of using the blow dryer on my plastic cap, or sleeping with a plastic cap all night - I purchased this cap after much research so that I could deep condition my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the shape of the cap doesn&#x27;t fit my head, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I read a couple of reviews and my only advice (even though it says NOT TO) is to place it on level 1 or 2 and lay down</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t so bad after the first time I used it, because it heats up fast and is efficient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far easier to get 2 - 15 minute sessions per week with it than trying to get at least 1 hour long session each week with out it.  </li>
            <li> Cap not comfortable because it is too long in the back</li>
            <li> It has 3 heat settings and I usually just put it on the 2nd level, the 3rd level would burn my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not heat up fully at the back of the cap.</li>
            <li> The back of my head practically dried out.</li>
            <li> and I wear a size 7 1/2 in military headgear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer than a blow-dryer, because I can just relax and watch TV, and my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  </li>
            <li> I am a kinkier curly natural with ultra thick \\&quot;fight</li>
            <li> My previous cap was too long</li>
            <li> and I wish I had gotten this sooner ,  before I spent money on other things.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was desperate for a conditioning heat treatment so after a week of looking at it, I took the plunge and ordered plastic caps per their instructions to cover your head to keep the cap clean.</li>
            <li> The heat is ok, a little uneven and tends to leave my nape cold, though that could be because of the cone-head issue.</li>
            <li> Other than that, built well.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> The other day I gave my self a &amp;#34;spa day&amp;#34; and wrapped my feet in plastic wrap after lathering on caster oil and shea butter, the effect was just like the salon....</li>
            <li> I had to keep pushing the cap down to make contact with my head.</li>
            <li> It looks ridiculous but it totally works.</li>
            <li> less than 3</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting something a little less bulky..?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who usually stays on low or medium heat when I&#x27;m using a heating cap or heating bonnet, yet even when I have it pre-heating for at least 15 minutes and place my hand inside the cap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a little long/tall which causes it to ride up a little.  </li>
            <li> The design is a little wierd.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so moisturized with little frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coily  hair and deep conditioning treatments are a must.</li>
            <li> So, unless someone has thin hair and doesn&#x27;t take the precautions necessary to protect ears, etc.</li>
            <li> uneven heating dont do it</li>
            <li> Cap does not fit well.  </li>
            <li> The size is a bit small, and the shape is odd, at least on me.</li>
            <li> I usually have it on my head for about an hour.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it on the hottest setting and have had no problems (burns, melted plastic,etc that people have described).</li>
            <li> It seems that It has some effect though I am not sure if the effect is coming from my conditioner.</li>
            <li> The final drawback is that the heat adjustment switch has to rest on your body because it&#x27;s only 13 inches away from the base of the cap.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe I had it 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> the back was cold as ice.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair</li>
            <li> Chin strap makes you look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I seriously wondered if I I could be electrocuted but</li>
            <li> This does work well, but if you have long thick hair, you may be a bit frustrated.</li>
            <li> My only issue is to keep the cap on snug you have to use the neck strap which to me can feel annoying against my neck, like a choking feeling.</li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier that I hate using the straps</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sandy and dusty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li> Literally, when I clasp both hands behind my head, none of that part of the cap is warm--it&#x27;s cold.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Suddenly my expensive hair potions work miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely returning this crap!!!</li>
            <li> As much as I hated sitting under the hooded dryer, at least I would reap the benefits of well-conditioned hair.  </li>
            <li> It could be dangerous if care is not taken to adapt the cap to the UK system.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A DANGEROUS ITEM AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND NEONE TO GET IT</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I was the burnt hair freak recovering from a bad dye job.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No I would not:(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had this for over a year and it works wonderfully, it does get nice and hot. I love that I can unplug it and run downstairs and do a few things and it still warm for a while.</li>
            <li> heat is high and adjustible. worked for me .. I have medium to thick hair</li>
            <li> Works just fine, the material is good and the three heat settings make it easy to control the heat. Very good buy, definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I purchased this heat cap!  It&#x27;s far easier to get 2 - 15 minute sessions per week with it than trying to get at least 1 hour long session each week with out it.  It heats up very quickly.  I have type 1c/2a silvering hair so it&#x27;s really thirsty.    The cons: 1)It can get pretty hot on the low setting.  Easy fix: A friend said she slips a turbie twist type towel on first.  It&#x27;s perfect fix!  Just give it a twist and smooth it over your head.    2) It&#x27;s shaped a little goofy.  It&#x27;s made a little long/tall which causes it to ride up a little.  @@@ For this reason I gave it 4 stars. @@@   I feel it is still fairly workable w/o strapping it down and try to put most of my arm pit length hair on top of my head.  Heat rises so even if there is an air space up there - it&#x27;s still nice and toasty!    ***  Ok a few comments have been made about not much heat at the back.  Yes, I noticed that too.  However, as noted in point 2, most of the hair is on top and that is where the heat goes so I don&#x27;t consider this a problem.    It has a nice heavy cord.  I used it when reading or at the computer.  If I need to step away a couple minutes - it stays warm for a little while.    ****   I would definitely buy this item again.  *****  8-)</li>
            <li> This product really works. I agree that it there is close to no heating at the back but if you sort of pile up your hair which actually is where you want to deep conditioning to work - then you get what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish there was heating at the back too.&lt;br /&gt;I piled up my hair so most of my hair would be where the heat is concentrated and let it sit for 30 mins. And my hair was so soft and shiny I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the size of the cap because it is hard to fit over my head, but it seems to do what it says it should do.</li>
            <li> This works just as it should. Heats up all over and is very easy to use, not to mention easy to store because it&#x27;s not bulky or space consuming like others. My only issue is to keep the cap on snug you have to use the neck strap which to me can feel annoying against my neck, like a choking feeling. Other than that it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> I received the product on time. Works extremly well. I&#x27;m able to save $100 monthly from going to the salon!!!</li>
            <li> I figured after a year of use, I can finally write a review.  I love the product because it heats up very well, the second notch is the highest that I will go.  I do a hot oil treatment a minimum of once a month.  I have used it with deep conditioning treatment and henna.  The only negative aspect is that the straps for the neck is uncomfortable and my entire head does not get a good heat treatment without it.  Despite that minor problem I still use the heating cap and will continue to do so until it doesn&#x27;t work any more.  *************************Update********************************** I still use this heating cap and it still works like it did when I first received it.  It is now 09-10-2010, so about 10 months since my last review.  I have since then used it every first of the month give or take a few days.  I have also used it with olive oil and honey.  I have even put the heating cap on the lst notch and took a nap with it on.  I now only use the 3rd notch during the winter time if I only want to be under the cap for 15 to 20 minutes.  I usually have it on my head for about an hour.  *********************update 2************************************* It is July 8, 2015.  I love going back and looking at old reviews to see what I can update.  I still use this heating cap.  It is hard to believe I had it 6 years.  I use it once a month for my hot oil treatment (olive oil and coconut oil).  I have gotten used to the straps.  It still gets very hot.  I use the second notch because the third notch is way to hot.  My hair is bra strap length so I put my hair up high on top of my head and put a plastic can to hold it.  This thermal cap is a great product, I hope it last for many more years to come. *****************************update 3**************************************** It is now June 19, 2017.  After 8 years, the heating cap no longer works in the back.  The rest of the cap gets really hot but the back stopped working.  I will have to look for another heating cap.  I hope the newer ones work as well as this one did.  I mentioned earlier that I hate using the straps but it is necessary to get the back hot.  I did not mention that the reason why I do not go above 2, is because it is too much heat for my ears. I stopped using the straps and started using the third notch but I cannot remember when I made that transition.  I just position it so my ears do not touch the cap too much.  I also stopped doing the heating cap as regularly and noticed a huge difference in my hair.  I went about 7 months not using the cap and my hair is very dry.  I have low porosity hair, so deep conditioning or hot oil treatments with this cap helps me improve the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this cap for three or four years and until recently had amazing hair.  Just recently my hair dresser and I experimented, as a result we burnt my hair, where I have had to cut it all off.  Hence I now look like a little boy, but after many tears I am in the process of deep conditioning my hair at least three times a week.  I read a couple of reviews and my only advice (even though it says NOT TO) is to place it on level 1 or 2 and lay down, I get great distribution if plug it in and watch TV for an hr. or so with the cap on and my head on the pillow.    I would highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s Helping (I pray) get my hair back to its healthy, shiny state.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help deep condition my natural hair. I have been natural for over a year now and needed some better routines for my hair.    The cap gets very hot, which is nice. It is very soothing after taking a shower to have the cap on my head-I could have fell asleep:)You would most likely only need the second level unless you have thick hair.    The design is a little wierd. I have a small head so there was extra room at the top, but It did not change the heat distribution.</li>
            <li> i have thick, course hair and deep conditioners just lay on top of it but don&#x27;t penetrate. This cap works wonders. Suddenly my expensive hair potions work miracles. After just one treatment with the cap my hair stylist freaked out like I have the most awesome hair ever. I became a spectacle at the salon. 3 years ago I was the burnt hair freak recovering from a bad dye job. This this is awesome. I use Ojon with it and have fallen in love with it all over again. Totally recommend. Also, if you&#x27;re into nurturing your hair, try using Wen with it as your cleanser.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I use it at least once a week. Only got it because I&#x27;m working on location away from home for two months (which has my hooded dryer.) I thought this would be a good temporary fixed but would never compare with my dryer. It&#x27;s not the same but it&#x27;s definitely great at getting the job done:-)</li>
            <li> I been using this heating cap for almost 3 years now.It works awesome.I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.I am very pleased with the result over the years.It&#x27;s hardwork.You have to conditioned it regularly.I am so happy.My hair looks so much better,healthier than before.I would definitely recommend this to everbody.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased my thermal heat cap three days ago and got it in the mail today. I was eager to use my new product but unfortunately I was very disappointed. The cap took about 15 minutes to warm up and it does get hot if the cap makes contact with your skin. The cap wasn&#x27;t hot enough for my hair and it only warmed the front and sides of my head. The back of my head practically dried out. Would I recommend this product to a friend? No I would not:(</li>
            <li> I just open the box, plug the cap in and giving myself a treatment. However, the back of the cap does  not get hot. Don&#x27;t feel like sending it back so I will deal with just getting the top and sides heated.</li>
            <li> When I first received the package the box was a little bent up.So, my first reaction was that this blank company sent me a used product, but when I opened it the product was new.  So, if I was judging the company they would have received a 3 but regarding to the product. Wow! It does get hot, you do have to adjust it to your head, and medium was the best set.  I am glad that other people wrote in with their review, and me reading it before purchasing this product. After 20 minutes under the cap, you will feel a difference in your hair. No Joke! My hair feel healthier and thicker. I think this product is better than sitting under the dryer, because there is no space for air to escape. So you get a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Thank heavens I found this heat cap! I recently had my hair salon-bleached from dark blonde to platinum blonde and this product is saving my abused hair.  Twice a week I use both a hydrating hair mask mixed with a anti-brassiness conditioner (I like Aveda Blue Malva) and get 85% of the results I get with a $40 salon-conditioning treatment at home!  My hair has visibly improved since I started using this thermal cap to restore my hair, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Mastex Thermal Heat Cap twice since I received it and it works very well. This is an excellent product and does exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the seller I originally bought this from (my receipt says USA Vitamins?), but wanted to write a review. I used the cap for a henna treatment and I really like it. At first I was a bit frustrated when I noticed it doesn&#x27;t heat at the back/lower part of the head, so I took it off and plunked all of my hair on top of my head and then put the cap back on. I usually leave henna on for an hour or more and I set the cap on high and kept checking the hair at the back/lower part of my head and after a few minutes my hair in the back was quite warm. The cap does get very hot, which I like, because I have a lot of hair to heat and the heat penetrates all the way to my scalp. I didn&#x27;t need to use the strap to keep it in place and I was glad because I don&#x27;t like things like that. The only thing I&#x27;ll do different next time is to use some round cotton pads to cover my ears because my ears were a little itchy after use, meaning they go too hot under the cap. So, unless someone has thin hair and doesn&#x27;t take the precautions necessary to protect ears, etc., I don&#x27;t see how someone can be burned by the cap. I love my cap. I was using a plain heating pad prior to this for henna application, so I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> I use this cap when I deep condition my hair or henna it. It looks ridiculous but it totally works. it gets very hot, and stays hot. The only thing I dislike about the product is the chin strap. It was very uncomfortable so I barely used it. I never found a need to wear it anyway.</li>
            <li> The cap seem to work fine.  My only complaint is that it does not heat up fully at the back of the cap.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about two months now and i Love it, it does what it says, nice size cap, no complaints so far!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cap not comfortable because it is too long in the back so sticks up too high on head so it hair doesn&#x27;t get as warm on the top as it should.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It heats up quickly! just be careful with the third setting because it can get really hot.    stella from sacramento</li>
            <li> The Mastex heat cap is really wonderful...it heats up quickly and stays hot. I&#x27;ve used it on all 3 heat settings, and they each work well. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the heat cap burning my ears, and I like that it allows my products to penetrate fully. Very easy to use, and will fit most head sizes. The price on Amazon is an excellent value, since I&#x27;ve seen the Mastex cap in beauty supply stores for double the price.     There is a cool spot in the nape area; I just part my hair in the middle and clip on either side of my head before applying the plastic cap--this way, all of my strands receive the benefits of the heat.</li>
            <li> I know we all talk about using too much heat can cause heat damage to the hair, at the same time this does not generate enough heat for my deep conditioning weeks.  I&#x27;m a person who usually stays on low or medium heat when I&#x27;m using a heating cap or heating bonnet, yet even when I have it pre-heating for at least 15 minutes and place my hand inside the cap it feels more warm than anything.  The front part of my hair and sides do get some heat sometimes when I do use high heat it works like it&#x27;s on medium, I know, it is strange.  I just believe if you are going to make an effective heating cap for your customers make sure it does the job in all sections so I won&#x27;t feel like I am not wasting my money.  I give it three stars because it stays secure to your head and I can adjust the core so it will not be in my way if I have to move around.</li>
            <li> i am truly thrilled with the product and the super service. thank you very much and i would give you ten stars.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  My hair is more healthy since using this cap.  My scape gets the deep conditioning it so needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mastex Thermal Heat Cap because I use it for a scalp treatment(Regenix). On some days it seems to warm up stronger on the first setting than other days and based on the other reviews that I have read for this product, I have yet to determine if the heat is distributed to other areas aside from just the top (crown) of your head. I will do a follow up review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  I am currently in Iraq where the weather is very hot and it&#x27;s sandy and dusty which dries out my hair tremendously.  I use the Mastex Thermal Heat Cap about 3 times a week to deep condition my hair and I must say that as a result of using this product, I am able to sport healthy hair in a combat environment.  For black hair, it is a battle just making sure that my hair has enough moisture, but this product has definitely eliminated the problem of \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot;.  I had no issues with the size of the cap and I wear a size 7 1/2 in military headgear.  I would recommend this to everyone especially those that have no space for a hard hat hair dryer and want to do effective deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this big plastic thing with a cord running from it.. I guess I was expecting something a little less bulky..?  Well, it does work!  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times now for deep conditioning of my dry, coarse, curly hair.  I found that the highest setting is perfect.  It&#x27;s not too hot when it&#x27;s on my head, and the cap is cool at all the outside edges where it might come in contact with skin (around the hairline).  I plan to use this once a week if I can keep up with it.  Especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I use heat when I need the condish to penetrate fast. This heating cap gets warm very fast and it warms my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has multiple settings and it&#x27;s way better than Gold N Hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product undamaged in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the cord were longer. Order one today!</li>
            <li> The liner it comes with is a regular shower cap.   Had to try twice to get all my long hair in the cap.   The back of the cap had two creases from the way they fold it in its original box... it poked me! Other than that, built well. Felt most of the heat on top, heat does rises, had to press the back of the head to make sure there was heat back there, there was, guess my long hair was in the way.  Pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have the Hot tools Cap - and it takes FOREVER to heat up!!!  This conditioning cap heated up within 90 seconds! Good luck getting the Hot Tools piece of stuff to heat up at all!!!    My only concern is that this cap is so snug, it will not fit over larger hair styles ( I like to condition my braids with hot oil...) otherwise - this would get 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The cap gets really hot in a short amount of time. I use it to deep condition with oils and conditioner. One thing about it is if it&#x27;s on your head you will have to find a good position because it irritates and heats your ear too. But other than that great heating cap! I just wear ear protectors to avoid heat on them.</li>
            <li> This conditioning cap does just what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I&#x27;ve got dyed and bleached hair, and before I bought this cap, I had to deep condition just to get the effects it took with fifteen minutes of the conditiong cap! A true Godsend.  Also, the seller delivered this quickly and effeciently. I&#x27;d buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This comes with a shower cap so you don&#x27;t need to buy extras.  My mother used to have a similar product 40 years ago, it was a monthly ritual to &#x27;deep condition&#x27; our hair on beauty night... really works well.  Heats evenly and quickly, temp. control seems to adjust quickly and evenly between high, med. and low temps.  Well made and the results are much cheaper than going to a salon.  surprised they aren&#x27;t available in tons of stores.</li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to deal, my hair came back to life! I use togheter with neutrogena recovery mask for hair, excellent!</li>
            <li> Ordered product and received it in 3 days; which was such a pleasant surprise.  I am very satisfied with product.  I have short hair and I did put the setting on high and it wasn&#x27;t too hot.  The long back hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me or the elastic fastener.</li>
            <li> The size is a bit small, and the shape is odd, at least on me. Unless I pull down very tight, it leaves quite a large space at the crown of my head, as though it were made for a conehead, not a human. I don&#x27;t even have that much hair. Perhaps I just have a giant head, but I would think even my giant head wouldn&#x27;t be larger than a smaller head with more hair. The heat is ok, a little uneven and tends to leave my nape cold, though that could be because of the cone-head issue. But, for the most part, it does the job.  It should really come in at least two sizes.</li>
            <li> My hooded dryer finally gave out, and I decided I wanted something that would allow more flexibility when using (i.e. not having to place the hooded dryer on a table top and be confined to a chair). My hope was that I would be more diligent with conditioning with heat if I had something more convenient to use.  I am using this heat cap as I type this review.  It gets 2 stars because I&#x27;ve been using this for an hour and my hair  is only WARM.  I have it on the highest setting (3 dots) and it is warm at best.  This makes me wonder how effective my conditioning treatment will be.  As others have noted, it DOES NOT HEAT IN THE BACK AT ALL!  I had to turn it sideways in an attempt to get the back of my head conditioned. I figured I would have to do this based on other reviews I read, and would have been willing to make this compromise if the cap heated/worked well enough.  As much as I hated sitting under the hooded dryer, at least I would reap the benefits of well-conditioned hair.  I will try this a second time, but will most probably return it.  (Maybe I received a defective one.) If so, I will look into a soft bonnet dryer. The search continues...</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mastex thermal heat cap after reading a lot of positive reviews.  However, upon receiving my item, it started to make noise when I put on my head.  Then, I noticed a beggining of burnt!  I contacted the seller who promptly replied and suggested that I either send it back for a refund or for an exchange.  I sent it for refund and I am yet to receive feedback.  It could be dangerous if care is not taken to adapt the cap to the UK system.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. Tried to use this and at first it was hot, 10 minutes later the back went cold. Within 5 more minutes the entire cap was cold. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this heating cap and I think its pretty good for the fact that it gets very hot.  It has 3 heat settings and I usually just put it on the 2nd level, the 3rd level would burn my scalp.  One downfall to this product is that it fails to heat the back part of your hair, so what I end up having to do is section my hair up high on top of my head cause that&#x27;s where most of the heat goes.</li>
            <li> I AM WRITTING ON BEHALF OF THIS ITEM I BOUGHT I AM FROM THE UK AND ORDERED MY ITEM IT SAYS GIVE THE ITEM TIME TO HEAT UP I PUT MY CONDITIONER ON AND THEN THE SHOWER CAP I CAME BK TO THE HEATED CAP WHICH I HAD LEFT FOR LITERALLY THREE MINUTES ON SETTING THREE (HIGHEST) AND MY HAT HAD BURNED ALL THE RUBBER AND STUCK TOGETHER AND I JUS DRED TO THINK WOT WUD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD THIS ON MY HED WHILST THE RUBBER ALL BURNT. THIS IS A DANGEROUS ITEM AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND NEONE TO GET IT</li>
            <li> Good product, like other reviewers, the back did not heat as well, so I had to rotate the hat around.  I would also use a very good conditioner with this, hair quality does improve.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about this product. I don&#x27;t know if the cap will fit my head, etc. But after just 1 use, my concerns are gone. First, the cap fits perfectly, and second, my hair texture has improved already. Now the ultimate test is the durability of it. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see. But anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great substitue as to salon treatment in terms of the price and convenience.</li>
            <li> Tired of using the blow dryer on my plastic cap, or sleeping with a plastic cap all night - I purchased this cap after much research so that I could deep condition my hair.  I have been very pleased with the cap. It gets hot, but not uncomfortable so.  I agree with other reviewers that the bottom of the back does not get warm, so (like others&#x27; do) I also turn the hat around half way through my deep conditioning and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The service was good but I think that the  thermal cap does not heat the head uniformly. The back part of the head does not heat at all. I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the heat. My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t warm up on the back of your head. I would have given this a 5 star if it does.</li>
            <li> Will get hot. Will burn the ears. Chin strap makes you look ridiculous. Chin strap not necessary. Doesn&#x27;t cover whole head</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s convenient and my hair feels really nice for a few days after I do a treatment. It&#x27;s not too hot at all. I usually use it on the hottest setting and have had no problems (burns, melted plastic,etc that people have described). I think those are caused by people using it in Europe which has 220V instead of 120V. Anyway, no burns, but it&#x27;s definitely hot enough. You can break a sweat in there &#x3D;) I personally use it with the Shiseido Tsubaki treatment.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of this at first after reading some negative reviews, but gave it a shot anyway. I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and it works beautifully! It gets really hot without being uncomfortable and has given my deep conditioning sessions an awesome boost in effectiveness. Even if this one stops working I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thermal heat cap.    Simple as that. It won&#x27;t make your hair grow longer or turn into silk but if you push the knob on this thing it will heat up. It works!</li>
            <li> Twice now you have asked me to review a product that I paid for but never received.Yes thats right you got my money I got nothing. you promised to send me another an upgrade and I never got that either.How can I get my money back? Please dont ask for any more reviews!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Was exactly what I was looking for.  I am VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Initially bought one for my mother...she loved it so much that I had to get one for myself!</li>
            <li> What can I say...I just love this thing.  I have used a hood dryer , a steamer and now this.  It is so much more convenient than my other tools.  Great price.  The heat is not as strong in the very back of the cap but that&#x27;s not anything that a plastic cap wont solve.  It works very well on my deep conditioning regimen every week  and I wish I had gotten this sooner ,  before I spent money on other things.  Great buy !!</li>
            <li> uneven heating dont do it</li>
            <li> THis cap does not heat evenly and I have had to turn it around and wear backwards on my head in order to get the heat to penetrate all areas of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is really a good product!  It gets really hot and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reviewing comments others have made and I must say I&#x27;m not all that pleased. I read many that said they had a problem with heating in the back but I assumed - should have no problem flipping it around should it not heat well there.     You gotta have a small head and not a lot of hair to get this thing to even stay on your head right. I don&#x27;t have a humongous noggin but I do have a whole lota hair on my head. I am a kinkier curly natural with ultra thick \\&quot;fight the power\\&quot; tresses and I have found it difficult to get the back treated as well as the front and top.     Be careful, it really does get hot. The first time I used it, I think I drifted off to sleep in it (it was that relaxing) but if you don&#x27;t protect your skin, you can get burned. That hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet. If you order this product, see if you can contact the seller for different sizes. Its my first heating cap.  Ill stick with it as long as I can. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the Regenix hair treatment program.  I like that there are 3 heat settings.  I preheat the cap on the highest setting and then turn it down when I&#x27;m ready to use it.  I think it would also be good to use with extra conditioning products.  It&#x27;s easy to wipe clean inside and out.</li>
            <li> Used this as my heating cap while living overseas in South Korea. This helped my deep conditioners penetrate even better and helped my 4b extra tight curled African American hair make it through the harsh Korean winters.</li>
            <li> My problem has always been very dry hair which makes my curls unruly, fly away and just makes my hair look bad. I cover it in coconut oil (not for acne skin, use sunflower oil if you have acne) and put this heating cap on for 20-30 minutes once per week and my hair is getting better with each application. I love the cap because as it heats it relaxes me too, I like to relax when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I got this and tried to use it.  I didnt even get a chance to use it one time and the thing didnt even work.</li>
            <li> Love it !!! Just watch the setting.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;First off I received this really quick,which is an A+ in my book.  I am using it as I write this review, the cap is definitely hot if used on high, so hold tight as I adjust the temperature.  Now back to this review the top and sides are hot, the back is cool to the touch. I have 50 mins. left to use for the final results. So stay tuned!</li>
            <li> I come from Asia. I bought this hat 2 days earlier and tried it immediately. I have to admit that at first I saw so many 5 star rate, I was thinking:\\&quot;are all of those true? or the seller paid someone to write those good comments?\\&quot;     But after trying it once, my hair condition really improved much more than I expected. So I just come here and add another good comment. The only bad thing is the shape of the cap doesn&#x27;t fit my head, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome...after I used it..my hair becomes shiny and soft...just noticed, not enough heat at the back of it...but its still good...</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers who mention that it does not heat up in the back are correct. Put your hand on the back of your head right now--yep, that&#x27;s about the amount of hair that won&#x27;t receive any heat. Literally, when I clasp both hands behind my head, none of that part of the cap is warm--it&#x27;s cold.&lt;br /&gt;The only other drawbacks are being stuck to the distance of the cord which in total is about 73 inches long (so it&#x27;s about 10 inches longer than me and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6). The final drawback is that the heat adjustment switch has to rest on your body because it&#x27;s only 13 inches away from the base of the cap. Heat isn&#x27;t distributed evenly in the cap, some parts are warmer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s evident that the cap was made to condition the ends (oldest and most susceptible to breakage) of your hair. When I stuff all of my hair into the weird top space in the cap, the cap fits perfectly and the heat is warmest in that space.&lt;br /&gt;Still it gets much hotter than my head would if I just wrapped it with plastic and a scarf.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at the hottest adjustment because though it gets warmer than my body the plastic cap keeps it from getting uncomfortably hot. It was too warm in the cap for my digital thermometer to read the temperature so it definitely gets over 107 degrees. It would be interesting to see what readings people get with a thermometer that has a higher range.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to take this with you anywhere you go compared to sit-under hair dryers that get hotter but are bulky and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This product would be great if the heat was distributed evenly around the cap and it came in different sizes as opposed to having the huge space on top. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great light-weight option for heating products on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil -heat definitely brings out the aroma more.</li>
            <li> This steam cap is a good product for steaming hair if you don&#x27;t want to purchase expensive steamers. I have not had it too long (less than 3 months)but it works well each time I use it. It leaves my hair feeling soft even after washing out the conditioner. Shipping was great the box was not dented or ripped in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 4 stars because I cannot yet comment on durability.</li>
            <li> The cap does not get warm enough.</li>
            <li> Pluses: silent; medium heat seting is comfortable; long cord; pretty comfortable to wear; can wear in the tub; couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Minuses: sized to fit enormous heads; doesn&#x27;t heat much of the back of head; goes over ears, which burns on high heat; chin strap doesn&#x27;t fasten easily.&lt;br /&gt;I just got this, and am wearing it for the first time.  It&#x27;s so much nicer than a blow-dryer, because I can just relax and watch TV, and my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  It&#x27;s a gentle heat on low, and can seemingly be worn indefinitely.  It&#x27;s also kind of nice when the house is a bit chilly - instead of wearing a hat indoors, i can condition my hair!  So, despite the drawbacks, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This conditioning cap heats up fast and gets pretty hot. The only issue is that it does not seem to have heat coils in the back. I wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this because many others have left reviews stating the same fact.  I will however keep the cap as I think it does a good job of providing heat and I don&#x27;t need to lug my hair dryer out just to do conditioning treatments anymore.</li>
            <li> I just tried it several times. It seems that It has some effect though I am not sure if the effect is coming from my conditioner.</li>
            <li> This cap was not made to conform to a human head!  It was cheaply made and did not heat up at all in the back.  I would advise anyone considering purchasing this to reconsider.</li>
            <li> Still have this product and use it on a regular basis.  The vinly is starting to tear and scratch my neck.  I put a towel around my neck to get through this proble,.  The cap heats up great for the maximum time of 20 minutes. Only draw back is that it operates on an electric cord.</li>
            <li> As a Massage Therapist, I was looking to use this for a purpose other than what it&#x27;s sold for...read about someone using it to put wet towels for hot compresses as a mobile massage therapist, but it didn&#x27;t seem to heat up enough, even on highest settings so will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled by the results of my hot oil and deep conditioning treatments w/ this heating cap but it&#x27;s decent. Better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love using this product especially when I do my hair treatment. When I do my hair treatment before I used a blow dryer for heating my hair under a shower cap. But now everything is easy because of this product.</li>
            <li> works great for deep conditioning my hair</li>
            <li> Anyone who might have problems drying their hair with a hand dryer; holding your arms up and moving back and forth; this heat cap  works so well for me because I wear a short hair fashion and I slao have difficulty with hand dryers. I highly recommend this cap. You do have to be aware of the direction that the hose is coming in because it could get rather warm or if on high hot.</li>
            <li> This is a neat lil cap / hat. Love the fact it is notice free, it gets very hot very quite.</li>
            <li> This is a great heat cap, I read all the reviews and decided to try it myself. As another review says if you have a very large head this is probably a small cap, I didn&#x27;t have a problem but my head is not too big. But overall the product is great, now I don&#x27;t have to spend money in the beauty salon paying for a deep conditioning treatment, I&#x27;ll do that at home!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had no problems, the only thing is that it heats more on the top of the crown, so you may have to put your hair on a high pony tail if is long... other wise the ends wont get the heat... aside of that... I like a lot</li>
            <li> I never write reviews,  but I  just can&#x27;t let this one skip through the cracks. I purchased this cap and was excited to use it. I have very thick coily  hair and deep conditioning treatments are a must. I placed the cap on my head  on my head and relaxed,  thinking I was getting an awesome treatment.  But only the front of the cap was  hot.  the back was cold as ice.  I&#x27;m definitely returning this crap!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cap does not fit well.  The top of the cap has a lot of space between hair and cap.  I had to keep pushing the cap down to make contact with my head.</li>
            <li> the back stopped heating after one use. you can turn it around -but what a hassle. Searching for replacement.</li>
            <li> When the heat cap first arrived, I thought OMG, how does this thing fit on my head? The shape and color are really weird, a light cobalt blue that&#x27;s shaped like the guards hats at Buckingham Palace, or the Cone head family on Saturday Night Live.  I seriously wondered if I I could be electrocuted but that obviously didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate for a conditioning heat treatment so after a week of looking at it, I took the plunge and ordered plastic caps per their instructions to cover your head to keep the cap clean. It really isn&#x27;t so bad after the first time I used it, because it heats up fast and is efficient. It really kept my head warm and neck warm which feels good. I made sure no one was around the first time I used it, and recommend this product to anyone looking for a heat cap.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement purchase for the one I had for over twenty year.  It still works, but now has a hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the new cap for the first time today,  It takes a minute to heat up, but still a very good purchase that I hope last another 20 years!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anyone. I have used the heating cap weekly since I received it. My hair has never felt so moisturized with little frizz. This cap fits perfectly into my hair regimen, and I love that it&#x27;s not bulky like a standard dryer. This product makes it a breeze to relax while caring for my hair. The cap is comfortable to wear, however, I do recommend that you use ear protectors from the heat. Also, be aware that the heat is so soothing that you just may fall asleep. The instuctions do advise not to wear the cap while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I use this for conditioning my hair, with a plastic cap.  The other day I gave my self a &amp;#34;spa day&amp;#34; and wrapped my feet in plastic wrap after lathering on caster oil and shea butter, the effect was just like the salon....great for removing cuticles also.</li>
            <li> I have a hooded hair dryer that I would sit under for over an hour when I did deep conditioning or wet sets on my hair. This cap has completely replaced my hooded dryer for me. I can do the same thing as with the hooded dryer but while relaxing on the couch and tuning into my favorite tv show/movie. I can also expect the same great results as before because this thermal heat cap works great. The best part is that I now get to comfortably dry my hair without the noise and without being stuck in the same position in a chair for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and now i wonder why i didn&#x27;t get it sooner! The shape of the cap allows for a snug fit to the head without covering your face. The heat penetrates the hair on the sides and back of the head. My previous cap was too long so if i wanted to see anything i&#x27;d have to lift the cap above my eyes but lifting the cap meant the heat didn&#x27;t reach the entire head. Also it heats up in no time at all. I&#x27;ve only given this 4/5 stars because it&#x27;s still fairly new and who knows how it will perform 6 months from now but i&#x27;m definitely in love with it right now.</li>
            <li> This does work well, but if you have long thick hair, you may be a bit frustrated. The cap will basically not hold your hair well. The heat output is good and as long as you are aware that this product is not designed to DRY your hair. It is supposed to provide deep, penetrating heat which increases results when deep conditioning, dying your hair, or protein treatments, etc..</li>
            <li> I actually have one that is about 20 years old &amp; is still going strong, this one was a back-up just in case...it could have been a little bigger to fit better on my head, or maybe my head could be a little smaller ??  wouldn&#x27;t be without one so had to have a back-up !</li>
            <li> its okay i wish it would get hotter</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my sisters birthday. The product arrived early. The directions were easy to read and she still uses the product a lot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough for effective deep conditioning; the heating coils are not distributed far enough to the edge of the cap to heat the back of my head.</li>
