            <li>/&gt;It worked great on me.</li>
            <li>but they give your hair some great volume.</li>
            <li>This multi pack comes with a great variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>What I dislike about it is that it pulls your hair and gives your hair this staticky fly away look.</li>

            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a very good way to curl your hair :)</li>

            <li>The rollers are good for the price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product &amp; the time it took for me to receive it.</li>
            <li>I like flex rods better!</li>
            <li>LOVE them!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very comfortable to sleep with, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, very good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blow drying buys me 2 days of nice bouncy shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that these look nice when I take the rollers out</li>
            <li>Good experience with this purchase--prompt and satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li>The plastic zipper case they come in is nice to keep them stored away.</li>
            <li>These rollers are handy for me as I&#x27;m growing out my hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have so many options for size.</li>
            <li>I can set my hair early in the morning, do some housework and have great looking hair without being attached to an electrical outlet!</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Having said that they&#x27;re not horrible either.</li>
            <li>and how many multi-packs would I</li>
            <li>when I try to remove them they break many hair strands.</li>
            <li>These stick on to your hair so neatly, I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Curling irons have never been my favorite hair styling tool.  </li>
            <li>When I unroll them, my hair has more body, which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Also, there are lots of rollers included - way more than I use.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>, i love the way it curls my hair</li>
            <li>Should have known better.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I didn&#x27;t do more than one.</li>
            <li>Love the ease, and the body they add to my hair.</li>
            <li>They tangle up pretty good.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Now I lightly dry my hair and apply these rollers for an awesome style everytime!</li>
            <li>These are better for my hair, easy to pack (compact), and leaves no marks in hair.  </li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t work as well as hot rollers do, but they are still a pretty good buy!</li>
            <li>and I use rollers to smooth, add volume and give me cute waves/</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other brands of velcro rollers that have a &amp;#34;thermal core&amp;#34; and I find them to have the best staying power.</li>
            <li>Found them easy to take off with my hair type.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use</li>
            <li>These rollers are light weight and easy to sleep on at night</li>
            <li>If my hair was shorter, I believe they would work fine.</li>
            <li>Best if used in hair that is slightly damp.</li>
            <li>They are fine...</li>
            <li>Love the super clips too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will use a hair dryer to smooth my hair out after I take them out -&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>and my hair was caught in the rollers for a few minutes and it didn&#x27;t feel great taking them out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with all the different sizes that come with this kit.</li>
            <li>These rollers are cute and colorful.</li>
            <li>Yes they are cheap</li>
            <li>I used Bobby pins to secure them.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re free to experiment with our hair styles.</li>
            <li>They keep hair smooth and give a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>These curlers are conveniently packed in their own storage case which is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>This product is not for people who like to have smooth hair.</li>
            <li>light weight and</li>
            <li>these really are great, and come in different sizes,so you can curl your hair in so many styles..</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>i roll mine while still damp,when dry its all curled and looks great..</li>
            <li>most of the time I just brush it out and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>but the curl falls out within minutes/hours, even when I&#x27;ve heated them for up to 30 mins and allowed them to cool for 2h before removing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good variety of rollers for different size curls.</li>
            <li>great deal: 31 diverse rollers for just about 12 bucks (compared that to other velcro rollers on</li>
            <li>Having the Conair Super clips I ended up tightening up 3 out of 12 Goody velcro rollers I used.  </li>
            <li>Several sizes of curlers included, which is perfect for my hair, which is layered and needs different degrees of curl.</li>
            <li>I love my new rollers.</li>
            <li>Rarely have I&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>THESE WORK GREAT FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO HAS FLAT LIFELESS HAIR.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who has a challenge with keeping their hair styled, or has fine</li>
            <li>I suppose it depends upon the length and thickness of one&#x27;s hair; I find that these curlers work just right for me.</li>
            <li>What size rollers would be appropriate for my length (barely shoulder length hair)</li>
            <li>I was happy to find these self-grip rollers that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have fine soft hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about several things, but this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These curlers are made really well!  </li>
            <li>I have to warn you to make sure that you put enough hair into the roller and when your taking them out to go in one line.</li>
            <li>At least my bangs looked great .....</li>
            <li>First, the rollers do not stay in unless they are clipped, a step I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I felt I was doing.  </li>
            <li>After getting the first one out I noticed that my ends were like cotten candy.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the sizing more closely, but I had to buy another pack of bigger rollers.  </li>
            <li>However, these work exactly as they should</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to use these it took forever to get the rollers apart.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a long time for&lt;br /&gt;these curlers and so glad I found them here.  </li>
            <li>This is best for who (a)just wants to add body and volume to your hair without risking the high heat use of electric tools (note that those velcro rollers are not a curling tool, though they do create a slightly wavy hair look), or (b) simply wanna pull up that vintage look which women wore back in the old days :)</li>
            <li>The Velcro certainly keeps them in place, but also makes it pull the hair when removing the rollers.</li>
            <li>Imagine trying to unwrap/unravel them, one at a time, creating more loose hair that gets stuck to the pieces you still haven&#x27;t gotten out.</li>
            <li>These rollers produce a nice curl, but they do not get tight when putting them in.</li>
            <li>They really do cling to your hair.</li>
            <li>Does the velcro really make the roller cling?&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves your hair VERY frizzy</li>
            <li>there is no metal or ceramic threads inside, so they don&#x27;t heat up much when I use a blow dryer with them.</li>
            <li>If you put larger sections of hair on the roller I recommend using a hair clip to secure it while setting.</li>
            <li>Ready at a moment&#x27;s notice.  </li>
            <li>The velcro on these rollers grip your hair and will not let go until you are ready to take them out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I love velcro curlers because I can put them in and then walk around doing other things, while my hair dries.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and to blow it dry just damages it.  </li>
            <li>I have used these rollers in the past and really liked that they come out of my hair without tangling.</li>
            <li>It took me 30 minutes just to unroll the top half of my hair.</li>
            <li>When I wash and wear (think beachy), without product or appliances, looks decent for about 12 hours</li>
            <li>However, I did also buy Conair Super Clips based upon an outside suggestion.</li>
            <li>vibrant colors</li>
            <li>seriously no clips?  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;can use a bigger size for more &amp;#34;puff or bounce&amp;#34; , but I like the smaller ones because there is a wave and curl in my&lt;br /&gt;hair with them.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are several different sizes, and even with my super-thick hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, make sure you know how to use them right, at least have a hang on it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on these unless your into pain and don&#x27;t mind losing most of the hair you have on your head.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found these curlers here on Amazon since they are not available in any of the stores that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Was definitely a good investment to my hair styling arsenal; I use a little bit of curling cream/mousse in each section of hair before I roll it, blow dry for a couple minutes, and it holds ALL DAY, even in Florida humidity!</li>
            <li>I was looking for larger curlers and should have looked more carefully at the measurements.</li>
            <li>With all the different sizes I can easily create volume and a touch of curl by putting these in when my hair is damp, then letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>l grew up with blow dryers and hot curlers, but I still remember using (way back) those old style rollers.  </li>
            <li>Some of them were way to big (which I expected), but what I can use is just fine.  </li>
            <li>Love the highly brushed effect you get on thin hair when you first take these out!  </li>
            <li>naturally curly/wavy thicker hair and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old.  </li>
            <li>They hold very well without any clips, but I will occasionally use bobby pins to keep them in place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 6 pieces - 1.5&amp;#34;  (hot pink)  - 1.5&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I took one star off because the velcro can be too strong sometimes and the rollers will be hard to get out without affecting the style.</li>
            <li>I have barely shoulder length hair, that I need to wash  every 2-3 days or it looks greasy (with</li>
            <li>From the really large to the really small my whole head is covered with lots left over.</li>
            <li>Hot rollers works in a pinch but essentially leave my hair looking flat as it starts to loose a curl.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with bouncy, full hair, with very little effort on my part.</li>
            <li>and I used pink and yellow on my whole head, waited for 20mins......</li>
            <li>If you are African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>No more hot rollers for me!  </li>
            <li>for my full and thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine, thin hair.  </li>

            <li> Rarely have I&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> THESE WORK GREAT FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO HAS FLAT LIFELESS HAIR.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who has a challenge with keeping their hair styled, or has fine</li>
            <li> I suppose it depends upon the length and thickness of one&#x27;s hair; I find that these curlers work just right for me.</li>
            <li> What size rollers would be appropriate for my length (barely shoulder length hair)</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these self-grip rollers that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have fine soft hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about several things, but this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These curlers are made really well!  </li>
            <li> I have to warn you to make sure that you put enough hair into the roller and when your taking them out to go in one line.</li>
            <li> At least my bangs looked great .....</li>
            <li> First, the rollers do not stay in unless they are clipped, a step I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I felt I was doing.  </li>
            <li> After getting the first one out I noticed that my ends were like cotten candy.  </li>
            <li> I should have read the sizing more closely, but I had to buy another pack of bigger rollers.  </li>
            <li> However, these work exactly as they should</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use these it took forever to get the rollers apart.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long time for&lt;br /&gt;these curlers and so glad I found them here.  </li>
            <li> This is best for who (a)just wants to add body and volume to your hair without risking the high heat use of electric tools (note that those velcro rollers are not a curling tool, though they do create a slightly wavy hair look), or (b) simply wanna pull up that vintage look which women wore back in the old days :)</li>
            <li> The Velcro certainly keeps them in place, but also makes it pull the hair when removing the rollers.</li>
            <li> Imagine trying to unwrap/unravel them, one at a time, creating more loose hair that gets stuck to the pieces you still haven&#x27;t gotten out.</li>
            <li> These rollers produce a nice curl, but they do not get tight when putting them in.</li>
            <li> They really do cling to your hair.</li>
            <li> Does the velcro really make the roller cling?&lt;br</li>
            <li> leaves your hair VERY frizzy</li>
            <li> there is no metal or ceramic threads inside, so they don&#x27;t heat up much when I use a blow dryer with them.</li>
            <li> If you put larger sections of hair on the roller I recommend using a hair clip to secure it while setting.</li>
            <li> Ready at a moment&#x27;s notice.  </li>
            <li> The velcro on these rollers grip your hair and will not let go until you are ready to take them out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I love velcro curlers because I can put them in and then walk around doing other things, while my hair dries.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and to blow it dry just damages it.  </li>
            <li> I have used these rollers in the past and really liked that they come out of my hair without tangling.</li>
            <li> It took me 30 minutes just to unroll the top half of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I wash and wear (think beachy), without product or appliances, looks decent for about 12 hours</li>
            <li> However, I did also buy Conair Super Clips based upon an outside suggestion.</li>
            <li> vibrant colors</li>
            <li> seriously no clips?  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;can use a bigger size for more &amp;#34;puff or bounce&amp;#34; , but I like the smaller ones because there is a wave and curl in my&lt;br /&gt;hair with them.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are several different sizes, and even with my super-thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, make sure you know how to use them right, at least have a hang on it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these unless your into pain and don&#x27;t mind losing most of the hair you have on your head.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found these curlers here on Amazon since they are not available in any of the stores that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Was definitely a good investment to my hair styling arsenal; I use a little bit of curling cream/mousse in each section of hair before I roll it, blow dry for a couple minutes, and it holds ALL DAY, even in Florida humidity!</li>
            <li> I was looking for larger curlers and should have looked more carefully at the measurements.</li>
            <li> With all the different sizes I can easily create volume and a touch of curl by putting these in when my hair is damp, then letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> l grew up with blow dryers and hot curlers, but I still remember using (way back) those old style rollers.  </li>
            <li> Some of them were way to big (which I expected), but what I can use is just fine.  </li>
            <li> Love the highly brushed effect you get on thin hair when you first take these out!  </li>
            <li> naturally curly/wavy thicker hair and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old.  </li>
            <li> They hold very well without any clips, but I will occasionally use bobby pins to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 6 pieces - 1.5&amp;#34;  (hot pink)  - 1.5&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I took one star off because the velcro can be too strong sometimes and the rollers will be hard to get out without affecting the style.</li>
            <li> I have barely shoulder length hair, that I need to wash  every 2-3 days or it looks greasy (with</li>
            <li> From the really large to the really small my whole head is covered with lots left over.</li>
            <li> Hot rollers works in a pinch but essentially leave my hair looking flat as it starts to loose a curl.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with bouncy, full hair, with very little effort on my part.</li>
            <li> and I used pink and yellow on my whole head, waited for 20mins......</li>
            <li> If you are African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> No more hot rollers for me!  </li>
            <li> for my full and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Unrolling them was so hard it took any pretty curl it would have made out because the velcro brushed it out.  </li>
            <li> variety of size (small, medium, large circumference)&lt;br /&gt;(2).</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, &amp; i use them on my dry hair for a few minutes after heat styling to help set the shape.</li>
            <li> then it falls flat.  </li>
            <li> I had to pinch the hair closest to my scalp and forcefully rip off the strand because it&#x27;s impossible to &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; them out nicely.</li>
            <li> Before I bought these, i was using toilet tissue roll cores to give my hair lift.</li>
            <li> do hold hair, yet still need support from additional hair clips (I use long bobby pins</li>
            <li> these rollers are not for really long hair.  </li>
            <li> The barrels of the curlers are much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews for these rollers from people with long hairs as to how these add volume to their hairs.</li>
            <li> if u have really long</li>

            <li> Nevertheless, I recommend them to everyone needing extra volume with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> It comes with 6 of the jumbo (purple), 6 large (pink), 5 medium (yellow), 9 small (blue), and 5 extra small (orange).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had the wrong idea about these or what, but I ended up with just a little more volume than normal.</li>

            <li> After they are in, spray then blow dry and leave in until cooled down.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can use&lt;br /&gt;the rollers, spray whatever I desire on my rollers and hair, wait to dry, and</li>
            <li> I used to use a hair dryer and a small round brush, but my toddler has become too interested in my hair dryer, so I thought I would try these out.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money, I would not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> You must be careful taking them out of your hair because its like velcro.</li>
            <li> I wan simple and this is..</li>
            <li> While taking the curlers out, my hair got extremely tangled in the velcro like material, and broke my hair.</li>
            <li> It can be used for loose waves or tight barrel curls.</li>
            <li> these were just not worth the struggle of velcro in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Velcro hasn&#x27;t worn down at all.  </li>
            <li> I just put them in when my hair is slightly damp</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that does not easily hold a curl.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the rollers are so tightly packed it&#x27;s hard to get them apart for the initial use.</li>

            <li> I completely dried my hair and put the rollers in.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with my hair getting caught.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>

            <li> Yeah, right, this was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Second, they are nested into each other and are difficult to separate.</li>
            <li> In the past, velcro rollers never worked because my hair was too heavy</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick, frizzy/wavy hair</li>
            <li> They are packed very tightly, nested inside one another.  </li>

            <li> Think hard plastic and tons of pins.</li>
            <li> I have really REALLY REALLY thick hair, and I knew these rollers wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;self-hold\\</li>

            <li> The price was not great for how poor of a product this is.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try these because I hate clipping in the other rollers.</li>

            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; is a stalwart name in hair care and one I trust, therefore I was disappointed after using this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> 2 Stars because I imagine it would work for people with thinner hair.  I have naturally curly/wavy thicker hair and these were just not worth the struggle of velcro in my hair.  I got these to define the curls I already had but I returned them after two uses.  Unrolling them was so hard it took any pretty curl it would have made out because the velcro brushed it out.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have fine soft hair.  Going to try a hard curler.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, so I  will have to reserve judgment until she has a chance to use them.  I will log back in and post additional comments if she is not happy with the product.  I was just happy that it was in stock and arrived before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Okay. I like flex rods better! Get stuck in hair too. Having said that they&#x27;re not horrible either.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.  These are great!  They really do cling to your hair. Love the highly brushed effect you get on thin hair when you first take these out!  Found them easy to take off with my hair type.  I&#x27;m 49 years old.  l grew up with blow dryers and hot curlers, but I still remember using (way back) those old style rollers.  Think hard plastic and tons of pins. I have barely shoulder length hair, that I need to wash  every 2-3 days or it looks greasy (with dry shampoo can go 4 days).  When I wash and wear (think beachy), without product or appliances, looks decent for about 12 hours then it falls flat.  Clips and hair accessories tend to slide off my hair easily in a short time.  Blow drying buys me 2 days of nice bouncy shiny hair.  Hot rollers works in a pinch but essentially leave my hair looking flat as it starts to loose a curl.  Not good, especially as my hair is beginning to thin as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came upon these Goody velcro rollers and figured I&#x27;d try them. I wasn&#x27;t sure about several things, but this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Does the velcro really make the roller cling?&lt;br /&gt;Answer:  Yes.  However, I did also buy Conair Super Clips based upon an outside suggestion. Having the Conair Super clips I ended up tightening up 3 out of 12 Goody velcro rollers I used.  Love the super clips too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) What size rollers would be appropriate for my length (barely shoulder length hair) and how many multi-packs would I need?&lt;br /&gt;Answer:  Only 1 pack&lt;br /&gt;The Goody pack comes with 31 rollers in 5 sizes:&lt;br /&gt;- 6 pieces - 2&amp;#34;  (purple)  - 2&amp;#34; were too big&lt;br /&gt;- 6 pieces - 1.5&amp;#34;  (hot pink)  - 1.5&amp;#34;  - PERFECT- Used all&lt;br /&gt;- 5 pieces - 1.25&amp;#34; (lime green)  - 1.25&amp;#34; - PERFECT- Used all&lt;br /&gt;- 9 pieces - 1&amp;#34;  (blue)  - Only used 1 piece of the 1&amp;#34; size for my bangs&lt;br /&gt;- 5 pieces - 0.5&amp;#34;  (beige)  - 0.5&amp;#34; were too small</li>
            <li> About the velcro rollers:&lt;br /&gt;(1). variety of size (small, medium, large circumference)&lt;br /&gt;(2). vibrant colors&lt;br /&gt;(3). do hold hair, yet still need support from additional hair clips (I use long bobby pins and they work fine.)&lt;br /&gt;(4). carried in a convenient travel size bag.&lt;br /&gt;(5). great deal: 31 diverse rollers for just about 12 bucks (compared that to other velcro rollers on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great on me. I didn&#x27;t use hairspray, blow dryer or flat/curling iron but it turned out to have added lots of volume, creating a bouncy look.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, consider wisely if this product will benefit you. This is best for who (a)just wants to add body and volume to your hair without risking the high heat use of electric tools (note that those velcro rollers are not a curling tool, though they do create a slightly wavy hair look), or (b) simply wanna pull up that vintage look which women wore back in the old days :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, make sure you know how to use them right, at least have a hang on it. Walking through some videos on youtube is a good way to start. This will help prevent you from entangle your hair with the velcro material.</li>
            <li> These curlers are made really well!  Some get stuck in my hair but these do not.  Been looking for a long time for&lt;br /&gt;these curlers and so glad I found them here.  I have medium length hair and I just wash it and pop these in and&lt;br /&gt;let them dry - and I get volume!  Sometimes I will use a hair dryer to smooth my hair out after I take them out -&lt;br /&gt;but most of the time I just brush it out and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> I love my new rollers. They give my hair great volume! I have to warn you to make sure that you put enough hair into the roller and when your taking them out to go in one line. I didn&#x27;t and my hair was caught in the rollers for a few minutes and it didn&#x27;t feel great taking them out! I&#x27;m happy with all the different sizes that come with this kit. From the really large to the really small my whole head is covered with lots left over. My hair is about to my shoulders and it&#x27;s layered for reference. Happy styling!</li>
            <li> My hair is fragile and heat from curling iron wasn&#x27;t helping. Now I lightly dry my hair and apply these rollers for an awesome style everytime!</li>
            <li> These do not work. Total waste of money, I would not recommend purchasing this item. The price was not great for how poor of a product this is.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nexk length hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers are light weight and easy to sleep on at night and you do not need roller picks with them.</li>
            <li> these rollers are not for really long hair.  They tangle up pretty good.  I also have to use Roller clamps to get them to stay put.  If my hair was shorter, I believe they would work fine.</li>
            <li> The barrels of the curlers are much smaller than I expected.  I was looking for larger curlers and should have looked more carefully at the measurements.</li>
            <li> Pulled out my hair.  I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Imagine several tubular pieces of velcro fully embedded - and stuck - in your hair. Imagine trying to unwrap/unravel them, one at a time, creating more loose hair that gets stuck to the pieces you still haven&#x27;t gotten out. Yeah, right, this was a bad idea. 20 minutes of [evaporating] patience later, all you&#x27;ve got is a matte of frizzy tangled hair that looks like it&#x27;s been backcombed. And now you get to brush all the curls out.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK GREAT FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO HAS FLAT LIFELESS HAIR. I USE THEM IN THE CROWN OF HER HAIR AND THEY GIVE GOOD VOLUME FOR HAIRSTYLES THAT MAKE HER HAIR LOOK FAB!</li>
            <li> These rollers are cute and colorful. I&#x27;m not sure if I had the wrong idea about these or what, but I ended up with just a little more volume than normal. No curl, wave, bounce, etc. Also its was gigantic pain in the you-know-what to put them all in. God forbid you actually have any product in your hair! That made everything a billion times worse/painful. This was one hair-tangling, bathroom cussing, arm tiring experience. At least my bangs looked great .....</li>
            <li> No more hot rollers for me!  These are better for my hair, easy to pack (compact), and leaves no marks in hair.  LOVE them!</li>
            <li> These work great! I have straight hair, &amp; i use them on my dry hair for a few minutes after heat styling to help set the shape.</li>
            <li> I like them, they do what there meant to, although they are very hard to sleep in...but they give your hair some great volume.</li>
            <li> These rollers suck! Yes they are cheap, yes they come in variety of sizes but seriously no clips?  I&#x27;m sorry but your hair is NOT going to hold this roller just by itself. I used Bobby pins to secure them. Also they tangled my hair like crazy!  I brushed and smoothened my hair and every time I used those (4 times)  I had to literally ripped them off my head with handful of hair :( threw them out and won&#x27;t ever regret. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews for these rollers from people with long hairs as to how these add volume to their hairs. But I am amazed to see how they set my short hairs. I have bob style and I used pink and yellow on my whole head, waited for 20mins...... And my hair are looking like I am returned from a salon... :)&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended I get Velcro rollers to help keep my hair out of my eyes (I have shoulder length strands) and to help bulk up the volume when I wanted a slightly different look. &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; is a stalwart name in hair care and one I trust, therefore I was disappointed after using this product. First, the rollers do not stay in unless they are clipped, a step I was trying to avoid. Second, they are nested into each other and are difficult to separate. In fact, I have a couple &amp;#34;nests&amp;#34; I cannot pull apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they do the job, just not as well as I would expect from Goody.</li>
            <li> leaves your hair VERY frizzy</li>
            <li> I have used these rollers in the past and really liked that they come out of my hair without tangling.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair. The rollers cling in my hair so well when I try to remove them they break many hair strands. They work too well.</li>
            <li> These rollers use a plastic core- there is no metal or ceramic threads inside, so they don&#x27;t heat up much when I use a blow dryer with them. I have very long, very thick, frizzy/wavy hair and I use rollers to smooth, add volume and give me cute waves/curls not frizz. I&#x27;ve found that these look nice when I take the rollers out but the curl falls out within minutes/hours, even when I&#x27;ve heated them for up to 30 mins and allowed them to cool for 2h before removing.&lt;br /&gt;There are other brands of velcro rollers that have a &amp;#34;thermal core&amp;#34; and I find them to have the best staying power.</li>
            <li> These stick on to your hair so neatly, I love it. They don&#x27;t hurt or tear as your hair so it&#x27;s a very good way to curl your hair :)</li>
            <li> If you are African American with natural hair. I wouldnt recommend these rollers. It ripped some of my hair out. Try the conair magnet rollers</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all come in different sizes so we&#x27;re free to experiment with our hair styles.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  I am still learning how to use them.  The Velcro certainly keeps them in place, but also makes it pull the hair when removing the rollers.</li>
            <li> These rollers will *not* come out of your hair. I completely dried my hair and put the rollers in. Waited 30 minutes and tried to take the rollers out. They would NOT UNROLL. It took me 30 minutes just to unroll the top half of my hair. I had to pinch the hair closest to my scalp and forcefully rip off the strand because it&#x27;s impossible to &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; them out nicely.</li>
            <li> Rollers were just as described.  Some of them were way to big (which I expected), but what I can use is just fine.  Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Does not  get caught in my hair. Nice to have so many options for size. Good value.</li>
            <li> Not well made,hardly grip at all</li>
            <li> These are par for the course Velcro rollers. If you&#x27;ve never used them, you just roll them up in your hair and they &#x27;stick&#x27; on their own-no clips required. These add volume, not curl. Best if used in hair that is slightly damp. After they are in, spray then blow dry and leave in until cooled down.&lt;br /&gt;This set is inexpensive and has a variety of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for people with shoulder length hair or shorter.</li>
            <li> Curling irons have never been my favorite hair styling tool.  I was happy to find these self-grip rollers that I have used in the past.  They are packed very tightly, nested inside one another.  I finally just stopped un-nesting the ones I wasn&#x27;t going to use, used them nested and the curlers still held!  No more curling irons.  I can set my hair early in the morning, do some housework and have great looking hair without being attached to an electrical outlet!</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE!  if you want to keep the hair on your head, do not, I repeat do not purchase these rollers.  Imagine putting your hair in between 2 sheets of velcro and then twisting it up. Next you&#x27;ll want to try and get your hair removed from in between those 2 strips without pulling every head of hair you have out.  This is exactly what I felt I was doing.  it took me 2 hours to get these curlers out of my hair and let me tell you, it was painful.  After getting the first one out I noticed that my ends were like cotten candy.  All fuzzy and bushy.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these unless your into pain and don&#x27;t mind losing most of the hair you have on your head.</li>
            <li> I have been using Goody Styling  Rollers for years.  I have fine hair, and to blow it dry just damages it.  I can use&lt;br /&gt;the rollers, spray whatever I desire on my rollers and hair, wait to dry, and my hair always looks good.  Rarely have I&lt;br /&gt;used a hair dryer.  I take them with me when I get my hair cut and or colored, My hairdresser loves using them on&lt;br /&gt;my hair.  I use the smaller ones, but got a variety pack just to see how it would work as I am growing out my hair.  I&lt;br /&gt;can use a bigger size for more &amp;#34;puff or bounce&amp;#34; , but I like the smaller ones because there is a wave and curl in my&lt;br /&gt;hair with them.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a challenge with keeping their hair styled, or has fine&lt;br /&gt;hair.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product &amp; the time it took for me to receive it.</li>
            <li> These rollers work well. I have shoulder length, fine, thin hair.  I also don&#x27;t have a lot of time in the mornings.  I used to use a hair dryer and a small round brush, but my toddler has become too interested in my hair dryer, so I thought I would try these out.  They are perfect.  They are easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with my hair getting caught.  I just put them in when my hair is slightly damp and I don&#x27;t use pins.  When I unroll them, my hair has more body, which is what I wanted.  I shoot them with the hair dryer if possible, or just leave them in for about 10-15 minutes.  Also, there are lots of rollers included - way more than I use.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try these because I hate clipping in the other rollers. These rollers produce a nice curl, but they do not get tight when putting them in. You must be careful taking them out of your hair because its like velcro. Overall, I like the look I get on my African-american hair after styling with these rollers.</li>
            <li> This multi pack comes with a great variety of sizes. It can be used for loose waves or tight barrel curls. It comes with 6 of the jumbo (purple), 6 large (pink), 5 medium (yellow), 9 small (blue), and 5 extra small (orange). They hold very well without any clips, but I will occasionally use bobby pins to keep them in place. For the price, it is a great set!</li>
            <li> Good experience with this purchase--prompt and satisfied with product.  I am pleased with this purchase. Would recommend to anyone wanting to roll hair without heat damage.</li>
            <li> They keep hair smooth and give a lot of volume.  The Velcro hasn&#x27;t worn down at all.  But they don&#x27;t work as well as hot rollers do, but they are still a pretty good buy!</li>
            <li> The rollers are good for the price. they stick well to short hair (bangs) but u need a clip to  make hem stay if u have really long hair.&lt;br /&gt;overall, i love the way it curls my hair</li>
            <li> Product arrived as ordered.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very comfortable to sleep with, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, very good results.&lt;br /&gt;Large quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Good for my full and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have really REALLY REALLY thick hair, and I knew these rollers wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;self-hold\\&quot; very long in my hair, so I use them with duckbill clips.  I love that there are several different sizes, and even with my super-thick hair they do self-hold up to about halfway up the hair shaft.  Was definitely a good investment to my hair styling arsenal; I use a little bit of curling cream/mousse in each section of hair before I roll it, blow dry for a couple minutes, and it holds ALL DAY, even in Florida humidity!</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy!  I put these in my daughter&#x27;s hair....easy to put in but unable to get out!  I literally had to cut some of them in order to get them out.</li>
            <li> These curlers are conveniently packed in their own storage case which is very convenient.  I suppose it depends upon the length and thickness of one&#x27;s hair; I find that these curlers work just right for me. I do use roller pins to keep them in place. It all depends upon one&#x27;s preference to use pins or not.  My curls are beautifully formed and styling is a breeze from that point on. I am so glad to have found these curlers here on Amazon since they are not available in any of the stores that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all! Should have known better. Could have gotten it at a store.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough clips or rollers for one head.</li>
            <li> This product is not for people who like to have smooth hair. While taking the curlers out, my hair got extremely tangled in the velcro like material, and broke my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t give this to my worst enemy to use.</li>
            <li> I should have read the sizing more closely, but I had to buy another pack of bigger rollers.  However, these work exactly as they should</li>
            <li> Waste of my money. My hair is too thick to hold these rollers.</li>
            <li> These did nothing to curl my hair or give it volume. Pain to set those rollers. You need several pins to keep the roller in place. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good variety of rollers for different size curls. If you put larger sections of hair on the roller I recommend using a hair clip to secure it while setting. For the standard hair section, the rolls seem to hold on well. You can&#x27;t go running errands and do your yoga in them, but for moderate activity around the house I don&#x27;t worry about them falling out. The plastic zipper case they come in is nice to keep them stored away.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair. I used the smallest roller on a section of my hair. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t do more than one. I almost had to cut my hair off, as I couldn&#x27;t get the hair out of the curler.</li>
            <li> This Product does hold by it&#x27;s self as long as you roll your hair once or twice on it. What I dislike about it is that it pulls your hair and gives your hair this staticky fly away look. Also it will cause breakage because it pull out your hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use these it took forever to get the rollers apart. The rollers stick together so I still can&#x27;t even use some of these. Then it stuck to my hair so I couldn&#x27;t get them back out. After finally getting them out, I had no way to put them back in the same packaging so they went into a bag and haven&#x27;t been taken out again.</li>
            <li> Before I bought these, i was using toilet tissue roll cores to give my hair lift. So it&#x27;s an upgrade from that. They are fine...light weight and kinda narrow. I didn&#x27;t expect them to hold my hair without clips (and they don&#x27;t, but hair is coarse and stubborn) but they get the job done when used with these clips: [[ASIN:B008VIKDN2 Charmvit Salon Jumbo Hair Section Long Clip - Steel]]</li>
            <li> these really are great, and come in different sizes,so you can curl your hair in so many styles..i roll mine while still damp,when dry its all curled and looks great..no problem, curls stay longer too..</li>
            <li> These rollers are handy for me as I&#x27;m growing out my hair.  I wan simple and this is..no tangling, no heat.  Ready at a moment&#x27;s notice.  My one complaint is that the rollers are so tightly packed it&#x27;s hard to get them apart for the initial use.</li>
            <li> Great rollers. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that does not easily hold a curl. In the past, velcro rollers never worked because my hair was too heavy and they wouldn&#x27;t stay in. With these curlers, I don&#x27;t have any problems. The velcro on these rollers grip your hair and will not let go until you are ready to take them out. I have slept with these in and worn them while doing housework. With all the different sizes I can easily create volume and a touch of curl by putting these in when my hair is damp, then letting my hair air dry. I usually prep my hair with mousse or a lightweight gel before putting the rollers in. After I take the rollers out I&#x27;m left with bouncy, full hair, with very little effort on my part. I took one star off because the velcro can be too strong sometimes and the rollers will be hard to get out without affecting the style. Nevertheless, I recommend them to everyone needing extra volume with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> I Hate these, they get stuck in my hair. Waist of money</li>
            <li> I love velcro curlers because I can put them in and then walk around doing other things, while my hair dries.  Then brush it out and I&#x27;m ready to go.  Several sizes of curlers included, which is perfect for my hair, which is layered and needs different degrees of curl.</li>
            <li> Love the ease, and the body they add to my hair.</li>
