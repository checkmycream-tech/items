            <li>It&#x27;s been quite a while since I&#x27;ve had that kind of reaction to a man&#x27;s cologne :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I popped off the top and gave her a spray.</li>
            <li>I caught a lingering whiff of his cologne and couldn&#x27;t help myself, blurting out \\&quot;Wow, you smell good!  </li>
            <li>Ok but seems not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>its such a GREAT MAN SMELL :)</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne and with my personal experience, I can guarentee that it is a head-turner.</li>
            <li>When you say its RSVP, it makes them smile :)  </li>
            <li>At $55 it wasn&#x27;t cheap, but you don&#x27;t need alot.  </li>
            <li>this is one the best products in market, better than any other brand in terms of scent, smell, bottle size - very potable can fit in any pocket or any side pocket in a carry on or a hand bag..</li>
            <li>He was surprised that I was even able to find it.  </li>

            <li>It was discontinued in the states and I was lucky enough to find it from a seller in Germany thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Ok, long story short, we evicted a roommate and after he was gone i found an unopened bottle of this in a closet.</li>
            <li>Unless it concentrates over time, the new bottle is noticably weaker.</li>

            <li> Ok but seems not as strong as it used to be. I compared with some I still have from about 5 years ago. Unless it concentrates over time, the new bottle is noticably weaker.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne and with my personal experience, I can guarentee that it is a head-turner. I personally got 7 positive comments till today(collectively; all from the feminine crew) everytime I used it. When you say its RSVP, it makes them smile :)  No exaggeration but simply truth. I don&#x27;t understand why KC discontinued this...</li>
            <li> this is one the best products in market, better than any other brand in terms of scent, smell, bottle size - very potable can fit in any pocket or any side pocket in a carry on or a hand bag.. scent last for almost 3days and its very cheap and affordable by any one... #5STARPRODUCT</li>
            <li> I was at work, getting a cup o java at the community pot, when a guy was walking away with his.  I caught a lingering whiff of his cologne and couldn&#x27;t help myself, blurting out \\&quot;Wow, you smell good!  What are you wearing?\\&quot; He smiled and replied \\&quot;R.S.V.P. by Kenneth Cole\\&quot;.  I responded \\&quot;Thanks, I know what to get my boyfriend for Christmas!\\&quot; Not only is he in serious need of a frangrance makeover, but this is a definite gift for me too.  It&#x27;s been quite a while since I&#x27;ve had that kind of reaction to a man&#x27;s cologne :)</li>
            <li> Like several other reviewers I had previously owned a bottle given to me by a girlfriend years ago.  One squirt ftom that one and i was set for the day and night. The new bottle seems weaker and lasts a much shotter time.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> I am a woman...a woman who bought this for her man. I bought it because it was the sexiest thing I had ever smelled...a little sawdust mixed with a musky yet refreshing scent...Its like watching your man chop wood with his shirt off boasting a totally ripped mid section. If you smell sexy you are sexy! I love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and was liked by the person who received it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I appreciate it comming  before the date it said it woukd come. But I&#x27;m disappointed it showed this above picture. I received the cologne without the box it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Db oakland park, Florida</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend.  It was discontinued in the states and I was lucky enough to find it from a seller in Germany thru Amazon.  He was surprised that I was even able to find it.  At $55 it wasn&#x27;t cheap, but you don&#x27;t need alot.  I hope I can still find it once he runs out of this bottle....its such a GREAT MAN SMELL :)</li>
            <li> I received this as expected!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> RSVP is a great product. Perfect scent for winter/autumn. Earthy, spicy, woody...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it lasted longer (3-4 hour peak time).</li>
            <li> My husband like this. He was happy I found some</li>
            <li> I have women tell my husband all the time that he smells great!  (and I have to agree)</li>
            <li> This smells so good on my husband, he is often late for work.</li>
            <li> Ok, long story short, we evicted a roommate and after he was gone i found an unopened bottle of this in a closet. I popped off the top and gave her a spray. HOLY **** this smells good. I consider it sex in a bottle. wear this out to happy hour and walk by some people and you will get attention. its sad that they stopped making it. im not sure what kenneth cole was thinking. also if you like this, Dolce and Gabana The One smells similar.</li>
            <li> Update (05/2015): Thankfully this fragrance has resurfaced. I ordered some at fragrancenet.com It is the real deal.  Another fine fragrance which has left the market. Along with Gucci Nobile, this was one of my everyday go-to scents. Wish it was still around.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances I have found for a man!</li>
            <li> This cologne made an excellent gift especially when I didn&#x27;t know what would be the ultimate gift, totally nailed it!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST cologne ever!!  I don&#x27;t like many of the Men&#x27;s Cologne choices available, but this is awesome.  It&#x27;s too bad I cannot ever find it locally.  Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
