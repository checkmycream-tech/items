            <li>Original Eau De Cologne Cool Stick 20ml 0.7fl Oz&lt;br /&gt;Marianne</li>
            <li>I ordered two cool sticks.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so mildly scented that I have a feeling that folks will just assume I didn&#x27;t wash all the soap off in this mornings shower.</li>
            <li>Evaporates if left in car  otherwise nice smelling stuff  </li>
            <li>The product arrived on time, and was not dried out, as other customers have experienced.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a visible residue if you use it more than a couple times on the same area.</li>
            <li>I like them for hot summer days</li>
            <li>it smells STRONGLY like a bar of Irish Spring soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the size of a large cheek/lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Sooooo after reading many reviews, I expected this fragrance to be some earth shattering amazing hidden gem.</li>
            <li>The smell goes away really fast.</li>
            <li>I would really like to know what I bought?</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>Would not have ordered it if I new</li>
            <li>After a minute or two, it does mellow and and smell slightly more like an actual fragrance (I assume because the alcohol component has dried).</li>
            <li>Smell too strong - not like original 4711 - stick itself was old partial dried out and clearly had been used the stick was half way up the tube ...</li>
            <li>Pretty expensive for a very tiny cool stick.</li>

            <li> Apurse size! Would not have ordered it if I new this is it&#x27;s size!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it falls out of the holder all the time;otherwise, I&#x27;d say it is great........I want it for travel and hope that I can use it without losing it.</li>
            <li> Has a surprising cool effect. The scent is not lasting. Doesn&#x27;t smell like the fragrance. It leaves a visible residue if you use it more than a couple times on the same area.</li>

            <li> I have been using the eau de cologne for years. Now I can have the stick too.</li>
            <li> It was way overpiced at about $16. I was shocked because it is so small. It&#x27;s like the size of a large cheek/lip gloss. The smell goes away really fast.Don&#x27;t waist your money. I am a real fan of 4711 and I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
