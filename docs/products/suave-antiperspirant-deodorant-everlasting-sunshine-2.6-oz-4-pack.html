            <li>Great price for good deodorant.</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome not so overwhelming that it drowns out your perfume and yet covers any odor you might have throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Suave products are excellent alternatives to higher priced products and are usually very good performers.  </li>
            <li>She loved the scent of this deodorant</li>
            <li>The price was a good deal too.</li>
            <li>Suave products are always a good value.</li>
            <li>It is a good buy value wise and the product performs as it should.</li>
            <li>I found this deoderant very effective under most conditions.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price/value relationship on this effective deodorant</li>
            <li>I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>it was great to get up with clean smelling arm pitts</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant that I have used ever, it doesnt roll up under my arms, it smells great, and lasts the longest out of all the ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I love suave deodorant</li>
            <li>I feel confident when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, I stay dry</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll not find another product with that much active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes cheap is the best.  </li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelming when you put it on but fades quickly to the sweaty pit funk once you begin moving.  </li>
            <li>I bought this pack of deodorant for my daughter who lives for light, but nice-smelling bath and body items.  </li>
            <li>Suave probably discontinued it because I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>find the fragrance sweet and overwhelming, but it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>this is an economical price and was perfectly good, new, fresh product.  </li>
            <li>It is great if several members of your family use the same kind or dorm mates sharing.</li>
            <li>Too sweet and fruity - like cookies or candy or something.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light and smooth and washes off clean - I really like it.</li>
            <li>If you like Pink Bubblegum (and many people do), though, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>so she won&#x27;t run out too quickly.</li>
            <li>and I like the mild scent.</li>
            <li>Scent is pretty strong when you first put it on but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>This product has worked well for keeping me smelling fresh</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and smell great not to sweet or musky</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and does last through an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whatever they put in this, is a exact smell that they put into sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again if the price stays the same or gets cheaper. :)</li>
            <li>The bar held up in a hot car during a day of travel and shopping to our overnight destination.</li>
            <li>This deodorant came packaged exactly as promised and arrived exactly when predicted.</li>
            <li>At $2 a piece, this is a better deal than I could find at any of my local stores.</li>
            <li>Previously I used the Sweet Pea, but when I bought this, I wasn&#x27;t able to find it.  </li>
            <li>Two dollars a pop for the large size?  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li>I find the Suave works as well as the big name brands and has unique fragrances.</li>
            <li>It does work fine as a daily antiperspirant/deodorant, BUT the fragrance is just too strong and too sweet-smelling; it reminds me of Pink Bubblegum and it takes about 15 minutes to dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well enough - but this scent would be better for teenage girls.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Highly recommend you try it....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>no complaint there.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the value where I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>This deodorant keeps me smelling fresh and my underarms dry.  </li>
            <li>I think of clear air when I smell this</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old.</li>
            <li>Bought this instead of my usual Dove deodorant because it was cheap...</li>
            <li>The only time there&#x27;s a problem is if I don&#x27;t wash the old deoderant off thoroughly enough before applying new.</li>

            <li> My only concern is that they could become dry if they are around too long...</li>
            <li> This deodorant, for me, was a disappointment and I won&#x27;t be buying more.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this because of the fast delivery and good price, but I was really disappointed as it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> but the pits have to stay dry.  </li>

            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered a 4 pack - I&#x27;m giving the other 3 away.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great, smells good, and great price.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not the same. This don&#x27;t even last a night of sleeping. I was really disappointed. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Ugh!  Purchased Suave Everlasting Sunshine on sale.  Now, I know why.  As one reviewer stated, &amp;#34;Sticky/wet.&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t mind my workout sweat but the pits have to stay dry.  The smell is overwhelming when you put it on but fades quickly to the sweaty pit funk once you begin moving.  Truly disappointed (sad face).</li>
            <li> Great price for good deodorant. Scent is pretty strong when you first put it on but goes away quickly. Keeps me relatively dry, definitely keeps odor away.</li>
            <li> I find the Suave works as well as the big name brands and has unique fragrances. Not the over powering fragrances of some anti-antiperspirants. Can&#x27;t beat the value where I live in Florida. My only concern is that they could become dry if they are around too long...only time can tell about that. It is great if several members of your family use the same kind or dorm mates sharing.</li>
            <li> I love suave deodorant it&#x27;s actually all that I will wear.  I bought this an everlasting sunshine scent,  and it smells like I&#x27;m going to the beach.  whatever they put in this, is a exact smell that they put into sunscreens.  I will never wear this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of deodorant for my daughter who lives for light, but nice-smelling bath and body items.  She loved the scent of this deodorant and so did I.  It works well, just like Suave deodorants always have for her, so no complaint there.  Now that she&#x27;s moving away to attend school, I&#x27;m ever so grateful for multi-packs like this so she won&#x27;t run out too quickly.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say. It smells very pleasant, works (for me) well over 24 hours, and the price is right. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> The brand I use and a great buy....how could I not buy it ?&lt;br /&gt; Saves me a trip to the store also.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I feel confident when I use this product. Great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Same stuff the grocery store or the drug store, but sold in a convenient 4 pack.  I like to keep multiple deodorants around, one the bathroom, one in the travel bag, one in the gym bag, and buying in bulk at an affordable price allows me to do that.</li>
            <li> When I saw the deal on this product I could not pass it up!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have definitely not been disappointed in my decision.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend you try it.... You will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts all day. The price was a good deal too. Will buy again if the price stays the same or gets cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price/value relationship on this effective deodorant</li>
            <li> Suave products are always a good value. The deodorant/antiperspirant works as well as more expensive brands and I like the mild scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected &amp;#34;Everlasting Sunshine&amp;#34; to smell like, but it wasn&#x27;t this.  Too sweet and fruity - like cookies or candy or something.  Works well enough - but this scent would be better for teenage girls.</li>
            <li> My wife smells great and it lasts quite a while. The bar held up in a hot car during a day of travel and shopping to our overnight destination. 10/10 would suggest.</li>
            <li> Suave products are excellent alternatives to higher priced products and are usually very good performers.  This deodorant, for me, was a disappointment and I won&#x27;t be buying more.  It does work fine as a daily antiperspirant/deodorant, BUT the fragrance is just too strong and too sweet-smelling; it reminds me of Pink Bubblegum and it takes about 15 minutes to dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad, but not great.  I just need a kinder, gentler fragrance.  If you like Pink Bubblegum (and many people do), though, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.  It is a good buy value wise and the product performs as it should.</li>
            <li> I found this deoderant very effective under most conditions.  The only time there&#x27;s a problem is if I don&#x27;t wash the old deoderant off thoroughly enough before applying new.</li>
            <li> i take 2 showers a day i take 1 at night then 1 in the morning because i sweat at night and i put some on last night and it was great to get up with clean smelling arm pitts</li>
            <li> this is an economical price and was perfectly good, new, fresh product.  I hate running out of deodorant or not having back up when it crumbles.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and smell great not to sweet or musky I think of clear air when I smell this and it keeps me from wettness I that others I tried didn&#x27;t do so well.</li>
            <li> compare to other brand your money goes a long way on this. And it&#x27;s also works which is the best part.</li>
            <li> This deodorant came packaged exactly as promised and arrived exactly when predicted. The smell is awesome not so overwhelming that it drowns out your perfume and yet covers any odor you might have throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant that I have used ever, it doesnt roll up under my arms, it smells great, and lasts the longest out of all the ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Will continue to buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me smelling fresh and my underarms dry.  It goes on light and smooth and washes off clean - I really like it.</li>
            <li> This smells horrible. Purchased this because of the fast delivery and good price, but I was really disappointed as it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  It has a great smell and does last through an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does everything I need it to.</li>
            <li> Bought this instead of my usual Dove deodorant because it was cheap... Never again! 3 days later went back and bought dove because this deodorant felt sticky/wet and stained my work shirt!!</li>
            <li> At $2 a piece, this is a better deal than I could find at any of my local stores. Works well and the scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old. I have been using deodorant since I was 12. This one is my favorite by far. The scent is wonderful, I stay dry and I actually get compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;. Which I do not wear, they smell that Everlasting Sunshine scent. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO TAL CUAL COMO ESTA DESCRITO, SIN NING&amp;Uacute;N TIPO DE PROBLEMA EN EL EMBALAJE Y FUE ENVIADO EN EL TIEMPO RECOMENDADO POR EL VENDEDOR</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for keeping me smelling fresh but it hasn&#x27;t worked at all for keeping my underarms dry.  I&#x27;ve pitted out my shirts everyday that I&#x27;ve worn it, which is unusual for me. Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered a 4 pack - I&#x27;m giving the other 3 away.</li>
            <li> Two dollars a pop for the large size?  Oh, yeah!  Great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the fragrance sweet and overwhelming, but it fades quickly.  Previously I used the Sweet Pea, but when I bought this, I wasn&#x27;t able to find it.  Suave probably discontinued it because I liked it so much.  The fragrance was minimal.  But this does not interfere with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains 20% aluminum chlorohydrate.  That is the ingredient that absorbs moisture.  Go ahead and look at every label on the drugstore shelves.  You&#x27;ll not find another product with that much active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes cheap is the best.  Two pits up!</li>
