            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>This Eucalyptus Spearmint scent is really refreshing and invigorates you.</li>

            <li>It serves multiple purposes with being relaxing as well as doing a great job cleaning and leaving a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh clean scent it leaves.</li>
            <li>this product washes off clean and smells good all day without being harshly strong like Irish Spring and without smelling like cologne....</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling silky smooth getting ready to order more products</li>
            <li>Great Product leaves you clean and your skin smooth and silky, leaves no soap residue, and has a lasting fragrant but not too strong, i would give it five stars except the price on Amazon is ridicules you can find it half that price in many stores.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and definitely leaves skin feeling moisturized without feeling oily</li>
            <li>I use Dr Teals everyday and love the wash... so much better than soap.</li>
            <li>Great price compared to other similar product</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li>and there it was; a few dollars more in price, but worth it.</li>
            <li>and I feel like other body washes wash my skin better.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft, silky and smelling like spring</li>
            <li>This body wash is very gentle to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I buy this product for a much more reasonable price at a drugstore, the amazon price is disappointing.</li>

            <li> Found this in Walgren&#x27;s and went back to pick it up again and they weren&#x27;t carrying the body wash any longer. I came home got on Amazon and there it was; a few dollars more in price, but worth it. I love the fresh clean scent it leaves.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts for a lil while and I love them. But sometimes there&#x27;s just no time to take a bath and you want the same effect so this Body Wash is a great substitute! This Eucalyptus Spearmint scent is really refreshing and invigorates you. It lathers up well and also has Epsom Salt ingredients as well so it&#x27;s almost like taking a bath. The only thing is, I wish they didn&#x27;t use SLS.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin looking and feeling healthy, soft and smelling great!</li>
