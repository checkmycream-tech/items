            <li>so I can&#x27;t say that it represents the greatest value.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s wonderful without being floral, spicy or overpowering.</li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s Fade Defy Conditioner for Colored Hair is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>What I do know is that this product leaves my hair looking gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Pantene makes a good line of hair care products and this conditioner that targets hair that has been colored is an excellent addition.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt great, and the ends were not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does, indeed, provide great help with color fading</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of conditioning, this product works great.</li>
            <li>This Fade Defy is especially important in the summer if you do not wear a hat.  </li>
            <li>It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, and I think if you had severely damaged hair this might be a good conditioner for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that can stand on</li>
            <li>Another good choice that has worked out well in our household.</li>
            <li>Pantene is one of the brands I have good results with and</li>
            <li>Fabulous!!</li>
            <li>It rinses with ease, has a gender-neutral smell, and the results are outstanding!</li>
            <li>It smells great and easy to work into the hair.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>The review is honest and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>And, as for extending the life or a coloring ... I honestly cannot say.</li>
            <li>On that note, a lot of people have experienced the conditioner not rinsing out cleanly and leaving their hair feeling coated.  </li>
            <li>My color hasn&#x27;t faded a bit, which is a true bonus beyond find a good, reliable conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so by day 2, it is more greasy if I use it on my roots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether or not this makes hair color more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34;?  </li>
            <li>So I love that this conditioner keeps that color locked in.</li>
            <li>However, I found that this Pro-V  conditioner is better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay as conditioners go, but I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li>If you buy this conditioner, you should also make sure to buy shampoo for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for color preservation, it does a great job, but it&#x27;s only as good as the dye you use to begin with.</li>
            <li>I really love Pantene and I love their premium line, the Expert Collection.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>It sounds more of a marketing gimmick to me.</li>
            <li>This product mostly misses the mark, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(More on that below.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Moving on to the fragrance: it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly a floral-y type of aroma, with a hint of something that almost smells of licorice, at times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I rinsed it out, though, my hair did feel softer and a bit more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The detangling process was yet another thing that was just okay.  </li>
            <li>frizz/fuzziness on the top layer/canopy of my hair, and</li>
            <li>Okay, not at all.  </li>
            <li>The shine is truly outstanding.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is OK</li>
            <li>Vibrant Color Conditioner felt great going on.</li>
            <li>I found that this did a good job with smoothing flyaway hair on the top of my head and easing comb-out, but it didn&#x27;t manage the frizzy parts of the lower part of my hair very well..</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents but found this scent to be very nice.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with my soft, silky and manageable hair it renders.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply</li>
            <li>It still didn&#x27;t feel all that great, but it was better than what I feared it would feel like prior to the conditioner being rinsed out.</li>
            <li>The Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection is a step up from their &#x27;normal&#x27; (and also quite good) line.  </li>
            <li>This is the first of the Pantene products that I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li>I have good body and volume and mainly look for a conditioner to add shine and smooth without flattening my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight longish hair that is very easy to get my fingers through with most conditioners.</li>
            <li>so I could give an accurate description of any resulting smoothness, shine, etc.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to purchase products in recyclable containers so figuring out whether I can recycle the tube this comes in will be an important factor in whether I would purchase this after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>Another Pantene item selected for my wife, who reports a grand success with this Pro-V product.</li>
            <li>so it is really important to use hair products that help me maintain my color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a regular hair conditioner, it is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application: I&#x27;ve already touched a bit on this, but I did want to make it clear why I felt that I had to use a good amount of this product at a time.  </li>
            <li>The smell was nothing special and not that pleasant, but it did have a better odor than the chemicals used for the actual coloring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pantene products before and the majority of them work fine; nothing special.</li>
            <li>Full Disclosure: This product was received for free as a part of the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this conditioner, because I&#x27;ve used some products in the Pantene Expert Collection before and found them to be pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li>but I did not feel it rinsed out cleanly.</li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly</li>
            <li>So, for this to be more effective, one would probably need to buy the whole package of the 3 different products: shampoo, conditioner and gloss, to see if that made it work better.</li>
            <li>They say &amp;#34;Noticeably more intense color from Day 1*&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight, colored (hide the gray) and fairly healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this conditioner lives up to the claim of giving more intense color, it is not a color depositing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for me!!</li>
            <li>- the coating magnifies the color to make it appear more vibrant (a lot like putting water on a colored object</li>
            <li>This is not a color depositing conditioner so maybe the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; part is that your hair is more shiny than normal &amp; it helps prevent color fading compared to not using a conditioner for color treated hair?  </li>
            <li>However, upon applying it to my hair and then rinsing as normal, then airdrying, the conditioner did not leave an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful because dying my hair isn&#x27;t something I choose to do, at this point it&#x27;s necessary to hide my grey hairs.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m told it has helped with frizzy ends, as well, which was a pleasant surprise, since I don&#x27;t that was an expected result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll edit my post if needed a couple months down the road, but so far I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and felt very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly smelly and most of all my hair is silky soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>When I first got this conditioner, I was very put off by the strong scent, which is raspberry-ish/fruity.</li>
            <li>for those of you who favor the \\&quot;Crayola\\&quot; kinds of hair color -- the blues, purples, lavenders, etc. -- the woman who did my hair last time told me those colors fade out a lot more quickly than colors like I have.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good creme rinse as far as creme rinses go, and it left my hair soft, shiny and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not.</li>
            <li>I love Pantene, especially when it comes to conditioners.</li>
            <li>, I think the shampoo you use is more critical than the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I found this to be an adequate conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t perform as well as some others for my particular hair type</li>
            <li>This one is a first.</li>
            <li>first thing I realized was that the manufacturer recommends you use the shampoo and the conditioner before you color so that you can have &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; color from day one.</li>
            <li>The most prevailing thing that I noticed was that my hair was pretty voluminous, yet it didn&#x27;t smooth down any of the coarseness/</li>
            <li>do have color-treated hair, which has been lightened from black to brown, and scrutinized it afterwards to see if the claim of &amp;#34;noticeable more intense color from Day 1&amp;#34; was accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, naturally curly/wavy, but easily goes flat.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely not a product for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and just a little amount on the ends of my hair really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>This creme rinse was very creamy and had a terrific light scent.  </li>
            <li>But what I really don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t do very well detangling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the expert conditions work very well, although it seems the conditioner itself is a bit thicker (and for some reason they color it) .  </li>
            <li>really like the way this conditioner makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>It seems  more \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; in the shower and is easier to comb out while it is wet.  </li>
            <li>I also need to be concerned with ease of comb-out since I have so much hair.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t happy with how it left the texture or overall look of my hair (especially the loss of body).</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting from them.</li>
            <li>It claims to give intense color from day 1.</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>My hair responds really well to this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also, because of the thickness, it doesn&#x27;t smoothly go through the entire hair.  </li>
            <li>Just some on the ends and avoiding the roots works really well for me.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite pleasant and reasonably subtle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is a relatively thick and creamy conditioner, you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it to get good results.</li>
            <li>My fine color treated hair looked far from its first freshness the next day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, though, so those sensitive to fragrances likely won&#x27;t have a problem with it, especially since it dissipates greatly once the hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>this Pro-V Expert Collection Fade Defy Vibrant Color Conditioner</li>
            <li>Using it now following Clairol Nice and Easy coloring, its done a remarkable nob of helping to preserve a dark, dark blue black.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine and this conditioner just weighed it down so much</li>
            <li>As far as improvement in the length of time my color stayed on, there really was no change.</li>
            <li>This is a heavier than normal conditioner</li>
            <li>I am not going to be able to use it long enough to see if it will help my color from fading.  </li>
            <li>This is a heavy product - meant to be used more on the ends than on the roots or whole-hair.  </li>
            <li>Since I have long, mildly wavy hair, I use a generous amount.</li>
            <li>But this one didn&#x27;t really live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li>I used Tresemmes Dry Defy line to help restore some of that moisture and was amazed at how quickly it improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything special or noteworthy for my hair, and as for its claims, well, there&#x27;s not much (if any) truth in that advertising, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>Now, those with shorter and/or finer hair probably won&#x27;t have that issue, especially since I can see how using more than just a little of this conditioner at a time would really weigh hair in those categories</li>
            <li>and my hair takes the red pretty well.</li>
            <li>In order to prep it for dying, I recently bleached my hair for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a rich, thick conditioner, my hair is left smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I get my hair done pretty frequently, so there usually isn&#x27;t enough time for it to fade.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it I made sure I really, really rinsed, but still had the same weighed down feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too heavy for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I used to have blonde-ish highlights and lowlights but have gone a little darker to caramel and light brown.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair soft &amp; manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes my wife&#x27;s hair soft and seems help revive the tint.</li>
            <li>My hair, while soft, felt coated not conditioned.</li>
            <li>And after my hair dries it feels really soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>But it left my hair feel coated no matter how much I rinsed.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not something that I experienced, so that might be something that&#x27;s due to one&#x27;s specific hair type and texture, hard vs soft water, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light scent similar to other Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my ends still felt pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>Every time that I used this, I found that after I slathered on an initial bit - something around the size of, say, a half dollar in my palm - it would pretty much disappear.  </li>
            <li>Since I shampoo everyday, I know the color can fade fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair extra soft and smooth, but a little bit more weighed down than usual.  </li>
            <li>Pantene is generally a brand that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good....we will update later.</li>
            <li>and I noticed no discernible difference in this conditioner as far as keeping in the red.  </li>
            <li>I decided to add some highlights to brighten the overall look without changing my natural color.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, and this conditioner weighs it down too much.  </li>
            <li>This is a thick, heavy conditioner that doesn&#x27;t wash out well, leaving my fine hair feeling weighed-down and almost greasy even on the first day.</li>
            <li>As is common with these products, the resultant color is fairly uniform and can be dull with continuous treatments from over-processing the hair.</li>
            <li>The fairly thick white cream has a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>I could already tell the color had faded a little on the first washing</li>
            <li>It settled down to something faintly fruity and pleasant.</li>
            <li>You get a little bit less product (8.4oz vs 12oz usually) and it costs a small bit more, but you get a better product.  </li>
            <li>so I do not use it on my roots or it tends to weigh down my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it being too weighty and it has really calmed down my frizz, even with Spring showers.  </li>
            <li>It also largely retained the waves in my hair and added just a little to the shine.</li>
            <li>But my hair sure was a dull mess.</li>
            <li>one second, the strands (from mid-shaft down) would feel pretty well coated; then next, it would feel dry and tangly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I found that this did a good job with smoothing flyaway hair on the top of my head and easing comb-out, but it didn&#x27;t manage the frizzy parts of the lower part of my hair very well..</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents but found this scent to be very nice.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with my soft, silky and manageable hair it renders.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply</li>
            <li> It still didn&#x27;t feel all that great, but it was better than what I feared it would feel like prior to the conditioner being rinsed out.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection is a step up from their &#x27;normal&#x27; (and also quite good) line.  </li>
            <li> This is the first of the Pantene products that I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li> I have good body and volume and mainly look for a conditioner to add shine and smooth without flattening my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight longish hair that is very easy to get my fingers through with most conditioners.</li>
            <li> so I could give an accurate description of any resulting smoothness, shine, etc.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to purchase products in recyclable containers so figuring out whether I can recycle the tube this comes in will be an important factor in whether I would purchase this after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> Another Pantene item selected for my wife, who reports a grand success with this Pro-V product.</li>
            <li> so it is really important to use hair products that help me maintain my color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a regular hair conditioner, it is great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: I&#x27;ve already touched a bit on this, but I did want to make it clear why I felt that I had to use a good amount of this product at a time.  </li>
            <li> The smell was nothing special and not that pleasant, but it did have a better odor than the chemicals used for the actual coloring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene products before and the majority of them work fine; nothing special.</li>
            <li> Full Disclosure: This product was received for free as a part of the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner, because I&#x27;ve used some products in the Pantene Expert Collection before and found them to be pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li> but I did not feel it rinsed out cleanly.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly</li>
            <li> So, for this to be more effective, one would probably need to buy the whole package of the 3 different products: shampoo, conditioner and gloss, to see if that made it work better.</li>
            <li> They say &amp;#34;Noticeably more intense color from Day 1*&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight, colored (hide the gray) and fairly healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this conditioner lives up to the claim of giving more intense color, it is not a color depositing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Good enough for me!!</li>
            <li> - the coating magnifies the color to make it appear more vibrant (a lot like putting water on a colored object</li>
            <li> This is not a color depositing conditioner so maybe the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; part is that your hair is more shiny than normal &amp; it helps prevent color fading compared to not using a conditioner for color treated hair?  </li>
            <li> However, upon applying it to my hair and then rinsing as normal, then airdrying, the conditioner did not leave an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful because dying my hair isn&#x27;t something I choose to do, at this point it&#x27;s necessary to hide my grey hairs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m told it has helped with frizzy ends, as well, which was a pleasant surprise, since I don&#x27;t that was an expected result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll edit my post if needed a couple months down the road, but so far I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li> It smells fabulous and felt very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly smelly and most of all my hair is silky soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> When I first got this conditioner, I was very put off by the strong scent, which is raspberry-ish/fruity.</li>
            <li> for those of you who favor the \\&quot;Crayola\\&quot; kinds of hair color -- the blues, purples, lavenders, etc. -- the woman who did my hair last time told me those colors fade out a lot more quickly than colors like I have.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good creme rinse as far as creme rinses go, and it left my hair soft, shiny and lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not.</li>
            <li> I love Pantene, especially when it comes to conditioners.</li>
            <li> , I think the shampoo you use is more critical than the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I found this to be an adequate conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t perform as well as some others for my particular hair type</li>
            <li> This one is a first.</li>
            <li> first thing I realized was that the manufacturer recommends you use the shampoo and the conditioner before you color so that you can have &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; color from day one.</li>
            <li> The most prevailing thing that I noticed was that my hair was pretty voluminous, yet it didn&#x27;t smooth down any of the coarseness/</li>
            <li> do have color-treated hair, which has been lightened from black to brown, and scrutinized it afterwards to see if the claim of &amp;#34;noticeable more intense color from Day 1&amp;#34; was accurate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, naturally curly/wavy, but easily goes flat.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not a product for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and just a little amount on the ends of my hair really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This creme rinse was very creamy and had a terrific light scent.  </li>
            <li> But what I really don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t do very well detangling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the expert conditions work very well, although it seems the conditioner itself is a bit thicker (and for some reason they color it) .  </li>
            <li> really like the way this conditioner makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> It seems  more \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; in the shower and is easier to comb out while it is wet.  </li>
            <li> I also need to be concerned with ease of comb-out since I have so much hair.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t happy with how it left the texture or overall look of my hair (especially the loss of body).</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting from them.</li>
            <li> It claims to give intense color from day 1.</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> My hair responds really well to this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also, because of the thickness, it doesn&#x27;t smoothly go through the entire hair.  </li>
            <li> Just some on the ends and avoiding the roots works really well for me.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite pleasant and reasonably subtle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is a relatively thick and creamy conditioner, you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it to get good results.</li>
            <li> My fine color treated hair looked far from its first freshness the next day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, though, so those sensitive to fragrances likely won&#x27;t have a problem with it, especially since it dissipates greatly once the hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> this Pro-V Expert Collection Fade Defy Vibrant Color Conditioner</li>
            <li> Using it now following Clairol Nice and Easy coloring, its done a remarkable nob of helping to preserve a dark, dark blue black.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine and this conditioner just weighed it down so much</li>
            <li> As far as improvement in the length of time my color stayed on, there really was no change.</li>
            <li> This is a heavier than normal conditioner</li>
            <li> I am not going to be able to use it long enough to see if it will help my color from fading.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavy product - meant to be used more on the ends than on the roots or whole-hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I have long, mildly wavy hair, I use a generous amount.</li>
            <li> But this one didn&#x27;t really live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> I used Tresemmes Dry Defy line to help restore some of that moisture and was amazed at how quickly it improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything special or noteworthy for my hair, and as for its claims, well, there&#x27;s not much (if any) truth in that advertising, in my experience.  </li>
            <li> Now, those with shorter and/or finer hair probably won&#x27;t have that issue, especially since I can see how using more than just a little of this conditioner at a time would really weigh hair in those categories</li>
            <li> and my hair takes the red pretty well.</li>
            <li> In order to prep it for dying, I recently bleached my hair for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a rich, thick conditioner, my hair is left smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I get my hair done pretty frequently, so there usually isn&#x27;t enough time for it to fade.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it I made sure I really, really rinsed, but still had the same weighed down feeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too heavy for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have blonde-ish highlights and lowlights but have gone a little darker to caramel and light brown.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair soft &amp; manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes my wife&#x27;s hair soft and seems help revive the tint.</li>
            <li> My hair, while soft, felt coated not conditioned.</li>
            <li> And after my hair dries it feels really soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> But it left my hair feel coated no matter how much I rinsed.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not something that I experienced, so that might be something that&#x27;s due to one&#x27;s specific hair type and texture, hard vs soft water, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light scent similar to other Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my ends still felt pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> Every time that I used this, I found that after I slathered on an initial bit - something around the size of, say, a half dollar in my palm - it would pretty much disappear.  </li>
            <li> Since I shampoo everyday, I know the color can fade fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair extra soft and smooth, but a little bit more weighed down than usual.  </li>
            <li> Pantene is generally a brand that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good....we will update later.</li>
            <li> and I noticed no discernible difference in this conditioner as far as keeping in the red.  </li>
            <li> I decided to add some highlights to brighten the overall look without changing my natural color.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and this conditioner weighs it down too much.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick, heavy conditioner that doesn&#x27;t wash out well, leaving my fine hair feeling weighed-down and almost greasy even on the first day.</li>
            <li> As is common with these products, the resultant color is fairly uniform and can be dull with continuous treatments from over-processing the hair.</li>
            <li> The fairly thick white cream has a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> I could already tell the color had faded a little on the first washing</li>
            <li> It settled down to something faintly fruity and pleasant.</li>
            <li> You get a little bit less product (8.4oz vs 12oz usually) and it costs a small bit more, but you get a better product.  </li>
            <li> so I do not use it on my roots or it tends to weigh down my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it being too weighty and it has really calmed down my frizz, even with Spring showers.  </li>
            <li> It also largely retained the waves in my hair and added just a little to the shine.</li>
            <li> But my hair sure was a dull mess.</li>
            <li> one second, the strands (from mid-shaft down) would feel pretty well coated; then next, it would feel dry and tangly.  </li>
            <li> It did take away some of the body and didn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as soft as other conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I want the color to last as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> Once dried, my hair did feel pretty soft to the touch, and there may have been a slight increase in the shine factor, but not much.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair flat and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, this tube doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick and lightly scented creme, a little flowery to me.</li>
            <li> When I use a rinse-out conditioner, I don&#x27;t want to have to rinse my hair 4 or 5 times, only to realize when it begins to dry that it</li>
            <li> - again, it was really dry and totally without even an iota of slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> time that I used it, I fully dried my hair and straightened out the natural curls/</li>
            <li> I have really long, very thick, coarse, wurly hair, so it takes a decent amount of product - even though it is fairly thick in consistency - to really coat the strands.  </li>
            <li> That almost never happens with other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, especially Pantene.</li>
            <li> so my issues are mainly with dull hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice one single, solitary difference in how my hair color looked prior to and after use, as compared to any other conditioner that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Dry Defy in that line because I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> ; capability will be somewhat limited.  </li>
            <li> I hoped for shiny, soft hair with some shine and a color that took me past 6</li>
            <li> My hair looked dirty and tangled easily because of the coating on it.</li>
            <li> This is a salon quality conditioner that can currently be purchased on Amazon for less than $8.00.</li>
            <li> Now, it could be that my hair just sucked up the product and moisture therein, but even after I applied more, my hair felt pretty terrible</li>
            <li> I use a shower comb and there are few snarls left after I towel dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to review a conditioner in a short amount of time as the actual test will be how well it helps the color stay over time.  </li>
            <li> and I really do not like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have seen blonde hair that faded and turned green from sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that it softened as well as the conditioner I use that is supplied by L&#x27;Oreal, in fact, though they recommend combing through the hair with the product on, it really never saturated the ends as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> I still needed to reapply an overall color, as usual, at the 6 week mark.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s just okay, and not something whose results justify its price point, but if you&#x27;re a Pantene fan and want to give this a try out of curiosity, all I can say is it probably won&#x27;t give you the worst hair experience of your life, but it&#x27;s really far from being a holy grail type of product.</li>
            <li> and I have a little damage (frizzy and flyaway hair), but not much.</li>
            <li> (The fragrance doesn&#x27;t disappear entirely, but it loses intensity the drier the hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, this performed for me like any average conditioner would.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the John Freida line for hair color shampoos and conditioners as it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all</li>
            <li> Because it is so thick and coats, liberal use tends to weigh down my hair and makes it look very flat, even somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> Pantene has really stepped up their game for hair color protecting products as of late.</li>
            <li> and my hair wasn&#x27;t a snarly, tangled mess, but the conditioner didn&#x27;t get rid of all of the tangles</li>
            <li> but I saw no real benefit to using this instead of my usual hair care products.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, thick, and wavy.</li>
            <li> She said they can fade in as little as a week depending on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add blow drying to the mix, and oftentimes, my hair is dry and needs serious conditioning.</li>
            <li> We will update this review in a few weeks as well.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is a heavy cream, and it takes awhile to wash out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding a condition that calms my frizz without being greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Usually, one would use Pantene&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fade Defy&amp;#34; shampoo followed by their &amp;#34;Fade Defy&amp;#34; creme rinse.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not my favorite conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene hair products in the past but they&#x27;re not my go to for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am usually fond of Pantene products, but this one?</li>
            <li> I did not notice my toner fading any slower than usual.</li>
            <li> This is not a dye so the color just faded for me at its usual pace.</li>
            <li> So while I generally like Pantene products, this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> While the color fade protections seems decent (red is the worst!)</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not really sure what they mean by that.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, it&#x27;s hard to believe since it doesn&#x27;t contain any dye or pigment to &#x27;refresh&#x27; the color.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this conditioner is that it comes in a tube that does not appear to be recyclable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, in terms of value, it&#x27;s not great:</li>
            <li> As for &amp;#34;fade-defy&amp;#34; - questionable.</li>
            <li> It is expensive to have my hair done at a salon</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> its just plain out nasty.....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a heavier than normal conditioner so I do not use it on my roots or it tends to weigh down my hair too much.  I wash my hair every other day so by day 2, it is more greasy if I use it on my roots.  This makes my hair soft &amp; manageable.  It has a light scent similar to other Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not this makes hair color more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34;?  Well, I&#x27;m not really sure what they mean by that.  This is not a color depositing conditioner so maybe the &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; part is that your hair is more shiny than normal &amp; it helps prevent color fading compared to not using a conditioner for color treated hair?  Marketing mumbo jumbo but it is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> Full Disclosure: This product was received for free as a part of the Amazon Vine program.  The review is honest and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review comes by way of my bride in her mid 40&#x27;s....ummmm 20&#x27;s...  Her hair is quite frizzy and has been getting ever so frizzier with each color application and eventual styling.  Coloring hair takes time and when it starts to fade away its just plain out nasty.....remember she is dictating this.  It is hard to review a conditioner in a short amount of time as the actual test will be how well it helps the color stay over time.  We will update this review in a few weeks as well.  For now I am finding that using this conditioner makes my hair feel silkier and smoother and makes for easier straightening....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good....we will update later.</li>
            <li> When I first got this conditioner, I was very put off by the strong scent, which is raspberry-ish/fruity. However, upon applying it to my hair and then rinsing as normal, then airdrying, the conditioner did not leave an overwhelming smell. It settled down to something faintly fruity and pleasant. My hair looked and felt great, and the ends were not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I do have color-treated hair, which has been lightened from black to brown, and scrutinized it afterwards to see if the claim of &amp;#34;noticeable more intense color from Day 1&amp;#34; was accurate. Unfortunately, not. My color appeared the same as before.</li>
            <li> It makes my wife&#x27;s hair soft and seems help revive the tint. Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Pantene has really stepped up their game for hair color protecting products as of late. This is wonderful because dying my hair isn&#x27;t something I choose to do, at this point it&#x27;s necessary to hide my grey hairs. So I love that this conditioner keeps that color locked in. It isn&#x27;t overly smelly and most of all my hair is silky soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> This conditioner promises to help colored hair resist fading. The fairly thick white cream has a light floral scent. It is easy to apply but I did not feel it rinsed out cleanly. My hair, while soft, felt coated not conditioned. Additionally, I did not notice any increased vibrancy of color or shine even though I used the shampoo from the same line. My fine color treated hair looked far from its first freshness the next day. So while I generally like Pantene products, this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a heavy cream, and it takes awhile to wash out of your hair.  The scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I have very fine, thin hair, and this conditioner weighs it down too much.  I am not going to be able to use it long enough to see if it will help my color from fading.  It&#x27;s just too heavy for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Pantene makes a good line of hair care products and this conditioner that targets hair that has been colored is an excellent addition.  This potion will help prevent fading of hair between appointments with the hairdresser and even repair strands that have been damaged.  The scent is quite pleasant and reasonably subtle.  This is a salon quality conditioner that can currently be purchased on Amazon for less than $8.00.</li>
            <li> I was only given the &amp;#34;Fade Defy&amp;#34; creme rinse to use and review so my assessment of it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fade Defying&amp;#34; capability will be somewhat limited.  Usually, one would use Pantene&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fade Defy&amp;#34; shampoo followed by their &amp;#34;Fade Defy&amp;#34; creme rinse.  I have colored hair and after using this product I could not notice if my color had remained the same or faded just a tad bit.  I&#x27;m going to assume that it basically remained the same though I do know that color will fade from hair after shampooing.  This creme rinse was very creamy and had a terrific light scent.  I am very sensitive to scents but found this scent to be very nice.  I think it&#x27;s a good creme rinse as far as creme rinses go, and it left my hair soft, shiny and lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I love Pantene, especially when it comes to conditioners. But this one didn&#x27;t really live up to expectations.  I dye my hair auburn every six weeks and my hair takes the red pretty well. I&#x27;ve been using color protecting conditioner forever and I noticed no discernible difference in this conditioner as far as keeping in the red.  But what I really don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t do very well detangling. I have fine, straight longish hair that is very easy to get my fingers through with most conditioners. However, this one still leaves it tangly. That almost never happens with other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, especially Pantene. I have an inexpensive Herbal Essences color protect conditioner that leaves my hair detangled and softer than this more expensive Pantene bottle.</li>
            <li> Definitely not my favorite conditioner ever. This is a thick, heavy conditioner that doesn&#x27;t wash out well, leaving my fine hair feeling weighed-down and almost greasy even on the first day. As for &amp;#34;fade-defy&amp;#34; - questionable. I can&#x27;t say I got any additional time or color out of it.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection is a step up from their &#x27;normal&#x27; (and also quite good) line.  You get a little bit less product (8.4oz vs 12oz usually) and it costs a small bit more, but you get a better product.  I&#x27;ve found the expert conditions work very well, although it seems the conditioner itself is a bit thicker (and for some reason they color it) .  It does leave my hair feeling like you put something in it, but that also means it stops the dryness, and seems like it protects it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene lost a star here for how they are promoting their product.  They say &amp;#34;Noticeably more intense color from Day 1*&amp;#34;.  Now whenever there is a big claim and an asterisks my marketing alert radar goes off.  It&#x27;s a good product that can stand on it&#x27;s own, wish they wouldn&#x27;t try to add gimmicks.</li>
            <li> I like to try a variety of hair products. My hair is straight, colored (hide the gray) and fairly healthy. I&#x27;ve used Pantene products before and the majority of them work fine; nothing special. However, I found that this Pro-V  conditioner is better. It has a nice scent and just a little amount on the ends of my hair really makes a difference. It added moisture, shine and body. Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene hair products in the past but they&#x27;re not my go to for shampoo and conditioner. This conditioner was nothing to write home about. I don&#x27;t see any difference in the tone and color of my hair so I can&#x27;t say if the fade defying part works. It&#x27;s okay as conditioners go, but I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> I have two-color foils in my hair to help camouflage the gray hairs creeping in.  I used to have blonde-ish highlights and lowlights but have gone a little darker to caramel and light brown.  It is expensive to have my hair done at a salon so I want the color to last as long as possible.  To help keep the color, I use shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you who favor the \\&quot;Crayola\\&quot; kinds of hair color -- the blues, purples, lavenders, etc. -- the woman who did my hair last time told me those colors fade out a lot more quickly than colors like I have.  She said they can fade in as little as a week depending on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this conditioner makes my hair feel.  It seems  more \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; in the shower and is easier to comb out while it is wet.  I use a shower comb and there are few snarls left after I towel dry my hair.  And after my hair dries it feels really soft.  I didn&#x27;t get this until a couple weeks after my last hair appointment and I could already tell the color had faded a little on the first washing so I can&#x27;t tell whether using this would have slowed the initial fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the shampoo you use is more critical than the conditioner.  I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo that goes with this conditioner so that is a big factor.  If you buy this conditioner, you should also make sure to buy shampoo for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this conditioner is that it comes in a tube that does not appear to be recyclable.  I prefer to purchase products in recyclable containers so figuring out whether I can recycle the tube this comes in will be an important factor in whether I would purchase this after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, thick, and wavy. I&#x27;m 50 so my issues are mainly with dull hair and I have a little damage (frizzy and flyaway hair), but not much. I have good body and volume and mainly look for a conditioner to add shine and smooth without flattening my hair. I also need to be concerned with ease of comb-out since I have so much hair. I found that this did a good job with smoothing flyaway hair on the top of my head and easing comb-out, but it didn&#x27;t manage the frizzy parts of the lower part of my hair very well.. It also largely retained the waves in my hair and added just a little to the shine. It did take away some of the body and didn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as soft as other conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a relatively thick and creamy conditioner, you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it to get good results. However, there isn&#x27;t a lot in a tube for the price so I can&#x27;t say that it represents the greatest value. All in all, I found this to be an adequate conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t perform as well as some others for my particular hair type and I wasn&#x27;t happy with how it left the texture or overall look of my hair (especially the loss of body).</li>
            <li> Another Pantene item selected for my wife, who reports a grand success with this Pro-V product. It does, indeed, provide great help with color fading and I&#x27;m told it has helped with frizzy ends, as well, which was a pleasant surprise, since I don&#x27;t that was an expected result. Another good choice that has worked out well in our household.</li>
            <li> I am usually fond of Pantene products, but this one? It really wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting from them. While the color fade protections seems decent (red is the worst!), it just doesn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly and I really do not like the way it makes my hair feel. When I use a rinse-out conditioner, I don&#x27;t want to have to rinse my hair 4 or 5 times, only to realize when it begins to dry that it *still* hasn&#x27;t come out all the way. And if I want stiff/dry hair, then I&#x27;ll grab the nearest 80&#x27;s hair gel and party with that - not with my conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Pantene. Back to the drawing board with this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this conditioner lives up to the claim of giving more intense color, it is not a color depositing conditioner.  It did leave my hair extra soft and smooth, but a little bit more weighed down than usual.  The next time I used it I made sure I really, really rinsed, but still had the same weighed down feeling.  I prefer the John Freida line for hair color shampoos and conditioners as it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all and their line is specific for the color of your hair as well.</li>
            <li> In order to prep it for dying, I recently bleached my hair for the first time ever. This resulted in my hair losing every trace of moisture in it. I used Tresemmes Dry Defy line to help restore some of that moisture and was amazed at how quickly it improved the condition of my hair. When I discovered the Fade Defy line, I jumped on it because I knew I needed to both restore moisture and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of conditioning, this product works great. Over several uses, I can feel the difference in my hair. As for color preservation, it does a great job, but it&#x27;s only as good as the dye you use to begin with. When I colored my hair with Ion Brilliance, the color washed out within a couple of washes. Using it now following Clairol Nice and Easy coloring, its done a remarkable nob of helping to preserve a dark, dark blue black.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this conditioner at all. This is the first of the Pantene products that I haven&#x27;t liked. It feels like you have a coating in your hair after rinsing that you just can&#x27;t get out. It leaves my hair flat and unmanageable. The fragrance is pleasant, and I think if you had severely damaged hair this might be a good conditioner for you.  I&#x27;ve never used a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft afterwards. This one is a first. My hair is extremely fine and this conditioner just weighed it down so much I had to take another shower and rewash my hair to get it out. This is definitely not a product for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really love Pantene and I love their premium line, the Expert Collection. I have been using the Dry Defy in that line because I have really dry hair and like it a lot so I wanted to try the Fade Defy. I have color treated hair and the last time I colored my hair I used temporary color instead of permanent so it is really important to use hair products that help me maintain my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fade Defy shampoo and conditioner are formulated to preserve color, fight fade, prevent damage and provide shine. It also smells amazing! I love the scent. Itâ€™s wonderful without being floral, spicy or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pantene is one of the brands I have good results with and this Pro-V Expert Collection Fade Defy Vibrant Color Conditioner is no exception. It comes in a tube form. It&#x27;s a thick and lightly scented creme, a little flowery to me. It smells great and easy to work into the hair. I like the way it makes my hair soft and silky. It claims to give intense color from day 1. I don&#x27;t have my hair color treated so I can&#x27;t attest to the claim. At any rate, it&#x27;s hard to believe since it doesn&#x27;t contain any dye or pigment to &#x27;refresh&#x27; the color. It sounds more of a marketing gimmick to me. As a regular hair conditioner, it is great and I&#x27;m happy with my soft, silky and manageable hair it renders.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner, because I&#x27;ve used some products in the Pantene Expert Collection before and found them to be pretty good quality.  This product mostly misses the mark, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, in terms of value, it&#x27;s not great: I have really long, very thick, coarse, wurly hair, so it takes a decent amount of product - even though it is fairly thick in consistency - to really coat the strands.  (More on that below.)  With that in mind, this tube doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  Considering the price point at which it&#x27;s sold, there isn&#x27;t nearly enough bang for the buck, so to speak.  Now, those with shorter and/or finer hair probably won&#x27;t have that issue, especially since I can see how using more than just a little of this conditioner at a time would really weigh hair in those categories down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the fragrance: it&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s mostly a floral-y type of aroma, with a hint of something that almost smells of licorice, at times.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, though, so those sensitive to fragrances likely won&#x27;t have a problem with it, especially since it dissipates greatly once the hair is dry.  (The fragrance doesn&#x27;t disappear entirely, but it loses intensity the drier the hair gets.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I&#x27;ve already touched a bit on this, but I did want to make it clear why I felt that I had to use a good amount of this product at a time.  Every time that I used this, I found that after I slathered on an initial bit - something around the size of, say, a half dollar in my palm - it would pretty much disappear.  It was the oddest thing: one second, the strands (from mid-shaft down) would feel pretty well coated; then next, it would feel dry and tangly.  Now, it could be that my hair just sucked up the product and moisture therein, but even after I applied more, my hair felt pretty terrible - again, it was really dry and totally without even an iota of slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed it out, though, my hair did feel softer and a bit more hydrated.  It still didn&#x27;t feel all that great, but it was better than what I feared it would feel like prior to the conditioner being rinsed out. On that note, a lot of people have experienced the conditioner not rinsing out cleanly and leaving their hair feeling coated.  That&#x27;s not something that I experienced, so that might be something that&#x27;s due to one&#x27;s specific hair type and texture, hard vs soft water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detangling process was yet another thing that was just okay.  I used a wide-toothed comb prior to blow drying and my hair wasn&#x27;t a snarly, tangled mess, but the conditioner didn&#x27;t get rid of all of the tangles either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time that I used it, I fully dried my hair and straightened out the natural curls/wurls so I could give an accurate description of any resulting smoothness, shine, etc.  Once dried, my hair did feel pretty soft to the touch, and there may have been a slight increase in the shine factor, but not much.  The most prevailing thing that I noticed was that my hair was pretty voluminous, yet it didn&#x27;t smooth down any of the coarseness/frizz/fuzziness on the top layer/canopy of my hair, and my ends still felt pretty dry.  So in terms of the claim that it repairs &amp;#34;rough, damaged strands,&amp;#34; that&#x27;s not what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in terms of intensifying the color?  Not so much.  Okay, not at all.  I didn&#x27;t notice one single, solitary difference in how my hair color looked prior to and after use, as compared to any other conditioner that I&#x27;ve used.  For me, this doesn&#x27;t impact color fade or anything of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this performed for me like any average conditioner would.  It didn&#x27;t do anything special or noteworthy for my hair, and as for its claims, well, there&#x27;s not much (if any) truth in that advertising, in my experience.  So it&#x27;s just okay, and not something whose results justify its price point, but if you&#x27;re a Pantene fan and want to give this a try out of curiosity, all I can say is it probably won&#x27;t give you the worst hair experience of your life, but it&#x27;s really far from being a holy grail type of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far.  I have difficult hair.  It&#x27;s fine, naturally curly/wavy, but easily goes flat.  It&#x27;s also graying.  I decided to add some highlights to brighten the overall look without changing my natural color.  I have trouble finding a condition that calms my frizz without being greasy and heavy.  This product has done that.  I don&#x27;t use a lot, but I leave it on while I finished my shower and rinse at the end.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it being too weighty and it has really calmed down my frizz, even with Spring showers.  My color hasn&#x27;t faded a bit, which is a true bonus beyond find a good, reliable conditioner.  I&#x27;ll edit my post if needed a couple months down the road, but so far I&#x27;m very happy.  I also use Pantene shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair responds really well to this conditioner. Since I have long, mildly wavy hair, I use a generous amount. It rinses with ease, has a gender-neutral smell, and the results are outstanding! Even though it is a rich, thick conditioner, my hair is left smooth and bouncy. The shine is truly outstanding. And, as for extending the life or a coloring ... I honestly cannot say. I get my hair done pretty frequently, so there usually isn&#x27;t enough time for it to fade. What I do know is that this product leaves my hair looking gorgeous! Good enough for me!!</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s Fade Defy Conditioner for Colored Hair is a very good product.  I colored my hair 5 weeks ago and, using the Fade Defy conditioner, my color has not faded at all.  This Fade Defy is especially important in the summer if you do not wear a hat.  I have seen blonde hair that faded and turned green from sun exposure.  This will not happen with the Pantene conditioner.  Overall I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pantene is generally a brand that has worked for me. But this one was a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vibrant Color Conditioner felt great going on. It smells fabulous and felt very moisturizing. But it left my hair feel coated no matter how much I rinsed. My hair looked dirty and tangled easily because of the coating on it. I wanted to asses how well this prevented color fade. I had a toning rinse put on my hair that I wanted to preserve. I did not notice my toner fading any slower than usual. But my hair sure was a dull mess.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy product - meant to be used more on the ends than on the roots or whole-hair.  Because it is so thick and coats, liberal use tends to weigh down my hair and makes it look very flat, even somewhat greasy. Also, because of the thickness, it doesn&#x27;t smoothly go through the entire hair.  Just some on the ends and avoiding the roots works really well for me. It does coat - the coating magnifies the color to make it appear more vibrant (a lot like putting water on a colored object makes it look brighter).</li>
            <li> I color my hair at home using L&#x27;Oreal brand products at 6-week intervals. As is common with these products, the resultant color is fairly uniform and can be dull with continuous treatments from over-processing the hair. Add blow drying to the mix, and oftentimes, my hair is dry and needs serious conditioning. Since I shampoo everyday, I know the color can fade fairly quickly. I was hoping this fade defy conditioning product would help with some of those issues. I hoped for shiny, soft hair with some shine and a color that took me past 6 weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I realized was that the manufacturer recommends you use the shampoo and the conditioner before you color so that you can have &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; color from day one. I didn&#x27;t have the shampoo, but I started using the conditioner. The smell was nothing special and not that pleasant, but it did have a better odor than the chemicals used for the actual coloring. I didn&#x27;t notice that it softened as well as the conditioner I use that is supplied by L&#x27;Oreal, in fact, though they recommend combing through the hair with the product on, it really never saturated the ends as well as I&#x27;d hoped. As far as improvement in the length of time my color stayed on, there really was no change. This is not a dye so the color just faded for me at its usual pace. I also see where they recommend an additional product, the gloss, to increase shine but I did not purchase that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is OK but I saw no real benefit to using this instead of my usual hair care products. I still needed to reapply an overall color, as usual, at the 6 week mark. So, for this to be more effective, one would probably need to buy the whole package of the 3 different products: shampoo, conditioner and gloss, to see if that made it work better.</li>
