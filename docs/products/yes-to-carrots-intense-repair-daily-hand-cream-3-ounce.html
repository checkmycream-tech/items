    <ol>
            <li>I am so impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>One of the best lotions I have ever used</li>
            <li>Excellent,  excellent oroduct.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still searching for the perfect hand cream that will get me through 12-hour hospital shifts...</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Works great on feet too.</li>
            <li>Great size for travel or your purse.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I feel like this has great moisture that doesn&#x27;t need to keep being reapplied to work well.</li>
            <li>He loved it and it seems to be working great on his hands.</li>
            <li>It has a light, delightful carrot scent.</li>
            <li>Very glad Amazon has posted a 2 pictures of this product so i can read the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream!</li>
            <li>Love the Yes to Carrots products!</li>
            <li>Easy to keep on your desk or in your purse!</li>
            <li>Bees makes a Beeswax Almond Milk hand cream that has more natural ingredients, and smells so delicious, but is leaves hands feeling greasy, and fingerprints on everything touched after using it.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Yes to Carrots products before and really enjoyed them</li>
            <li>For the price, I would rather buy another lotion that smells better and works just as well.</li>
            <li>LOVE this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d love this more from the reviews... I do love many of the YESto products though</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m able to hover my mouse over the picture showing me all the ingredients :)  </li>
            <li>Gave as gift too many family and freiends.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is just lovely.  </li>
            <li>This hand cream was not an &amp;#34;intense repair&amp;#34; as described -- it is more the consistency of a body lotion than hand cream.</li>
            <li>the latter of which is worthwhile just because of its delicious pumpkin-spice smell!).</li>
            <li>All of these work better than this Yes to Carrots hand</li>
            <li>, I realize that I have tried many, many hand creams, but hopefully comments about all of my purchases allow you to better select one for your needs)</li>
            <li>This is very rich and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>It smells nice - fresh, and not too strong.</li>
            <li>However, the scent of the lotion, while not objectionable, is not as pleasant as I would normally like from a hand lotion - it somewhat reminds me of chemicals.   </li>
            <li>Dries very quickly and don&#x27;t leave your hands sticky or feeling grease.</li>
            <li>This hand cream goes on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Great hand cream especially for winter.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone wanting gentle effective hand cream without obtrusive scent.</li>
            <li>Great hydrating lotion, very gentle natural scent.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and size as it&#x27;s purse friendly.</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry hands with even dryer cuticles and this cream works great....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not as great as other yes to carrots body lotions, 4 stars</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients, lack of chemicals and was very very happy with some of their other products.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I like that this lotion is paraben-free and has many natural ingredients</li>
            <li>At first you might think it&#x27;s greasy but it dissipates really quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>Never expected such great results.  </li>
            <li>It really does repair!</li>
            <li>I totally planning on purchasing more.</li>
            <li>, I used Intensive Rescue Hand Repair Cream (fragrance free) by Vaseline, it&#x27;s half price, and works much better for my hands.</li>
            <li>It applies nicely, never greasy and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but positive reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of the  JR Watkins Hand Creams and Hand Repair Balms by Upper Canada and find these to have superior moisturizing, with much nicer scents than this Yes to Carrots hand</li>
            <li>The smell is light enough to not bore you.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the Yes to Carrots hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>This was not bad, but I did not find it as good, and it is considerably more expensive given that you get half as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For comparison, Gardener&#x27;s Hand Creams are thicker and work better than most of the other natural hand creams, such as Burt&#x27;s Bees Ultimate Care Hand Cream, Collective Well-Being Hand Cream, and Desert Essence Organics Pumpkin Hand Repair Cream (</li>
            <li>I like this better than most hand creams, but not as well as their other products, and given that it is roughly half the size of the hand &amp; elbow cream and costs almost the same amount</li>
            <li>I also like that it is free of parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>The fact that it feels very natural, 5 stars&lt;</li>
            <li>I was also disappointed by the scent, since I was expecting the delightful scent of the Yes to Carrots body butter, but this is very lightly scented and not nearly as nice of a smell.</li>
            <li>I have given it several times as a gift and get positive feedback.</li>
            <li>If the winter esp causes your skin to get dry and chapped, this is a good one for thick coverage.</li>
            <li>It keeps my nails and hands soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I prefer the thicker, intense lotion (especially during winter), and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>though as there are no harsh chemicals in this lotion.</li>
            <li>After I use it, my hands feel soft and smooth, rather than dry and cracked, for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d keep this in my car as a &amp;#34;back-up&amp;#34;, but natural products seem to go sour quickly in temperature extremes (understandable I guess).</li>
            <li>This is a good size as well - smaller than the big body lotions, but not too small (bigger than travel size).</li>
            <li>This lotion is a very helpful moisturizer in dry climates....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, I have small hands and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover them.</li>
            <li>I found the yes to carrots intense hand cream to be less moisturizing, less easily absorbed than their hand and elbow cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying it to my hand, i feel it works fine, but not surprisingly great or moisturizing to my hands, 3 stars</li>

            <li> I work outside with water all day long and this is the only hand lotion that repairs my hands and doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling gross.</li>
            <li> Small amount for such a high price.</li>
            <li> I use hand lotion after washing my hands fairly religiously to avoid dry cracking skin around my cuticles and fingers tips.  </li>
            <li> I hope the other products I like remain the same.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensative skin and perfumes give me migraines.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed that, when I tried this product, it was similar to the consistency of a body lotion...not very thick and dense like the \\&quot;intense</li>
            <li> and know they are among the few natural anti-bacterials (chammomile being the other that I know of).  </li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of this product and see little benefit as it pertains to moisture.  </li>
            <li> I get tubes of this every few months especially in the winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other</li>
            <li> I would say it works about as well as any other high-quality hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have used other hand creams</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d recommend the other [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It looks from their packaging and reviews of other products like they are chaging their formulas.  </li>
            <li> , so I thought I&#x27;d try the hand cream since I&#x27;ve been having dry skin lately.</li>
            <li> (and there are a few I&#x27;ve tried that I wish I had passed on).  </li>
            <li> I have horrible cracked hands and it is so nice to put on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lotion fanatic, so I have a lot to compare this to.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love the quality of this lotion.  Only downside is the price!</li>
            <li> I get tubes of this every few months especially in the winter! This hand cream goes on smooth and absorbs well. At first you might think it&#x27;s greasy but it dissipates really quickly into your skin. It keeps my nails and hands soft and supple. I do a lot of housework as well as am on the computer often so I keep this on hand. I even got my husband hooked on it as well. It really does repair!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product.  I read a review and tried it.  Never expected such great results.  Works great on feet too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other Yes to Carrots products before and really enjoyed them, so I thought I&#x27;d try the hand cream since I&#x27;ve been having dry skin lately. I would say it works about as well as any other high-quality hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned. After I use it, my hands feel soft and smooth, rather than dry and cracked, for a long time. Additionally, I like that this lotion is paraben-free and has many natural ingredients However, the scent of the lotion, while not objectionable, is not as pleasant as I would normally like from a hand lotion - it somewhat reminds me of chemicals.   So, while I do like this lotion, I probably won&#x27;t race to buy it again unless it is deeply discounted. For the price, I would rather buy another lotion that smells better and works just as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hand cream.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating lotion, very gentle natural scent.</li>
            <li> A hand cream that actually works! Have not seen in the store for a while and always looking for it.  Great size for travel or your purse.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d love this more from the reviews... I do love many of the YESto products though (and there are a few I&#x27;ve tried that I wish I had passed on).  I&#x27;d keep this in my car as a &amp;#34;back-up&amp;#34;, but natural products seem to go sour quickly in temperature extremes (understandable I guess).</li>
            <li> I use at work. Dries very quickly and don&#x27;t leave your hands sticky or feeling grease. The smell is light enough to not bore you.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands pretty frequently and when it gets cold outside it really tears them up.  I have used other hand creams and I just don&#x27;t like the feel of them after I use them. They feel greasy or gummy or something.  On a whim I purchased this product.  I AM AMAZED.  My hands are softer and my cuticles are not trying to pry themselves from my nail beds.  It is not a greasy feeling cream. I would recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, I have small hands and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover them. I totally planning on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> If the winter esp causes your skin to get dry and chapped, this is a good one for thick coverage. No smell. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions I have ever used</li>
            <li> I found the yes to carrots intense hand cream to be less moisturizing, less easily absorbed than their hand and elbow cream.  I suppose which you prefer will depend on your skin.  I like this better than most hand creams, but not as well as their other products, and given that it is roughly half the size of the hand &amp; elbow cream and costs almost the same amount, I&#x27;d recommend the other [[ASIN:B003PF9XCI Yes To Carrots Softening Hand and Elbow Cream, 6.76-Ounce]] over this one.  I bought this because it listed comfrey, borage among the ingredients (though I do not see them now!) and know they are among the few natural anti-bacterials (chammomile being the other that I know of).  It looks from their packaging and reviews of other products like they are chaging their formulas.  I hope the other products I like remain the same.  I like the natural ingredients, lack of chemicals and was very very happy with some of their other products.  This was not bad, but I did not find it as good, and it is considerably more expensive given that you get half as much.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of this product and see little benefit as it pertains to moisture.  I also do not like the smell or virtually lack of.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream especially for winter.  I have VERY dry hands with even dryer cuticles and this cream works great....highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very glad Amazon has posted a 2 pictures of this product so i can read the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back side i&#x27;m able to hover my mouse over the picture showing me all the ingredients :)  TY AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Excellent,  excellent oroduct.  Gave as gift too many family and freiends.</li>
            <li> Left a film on my hands so I gave to to my mother, she likes it...go figure</li>
            <li> This hand cream is just lovely.  I have horrible cracked hands and it is so nice to put on.  Not greasy at all.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband who cannot use anything with paraben... He loved it and it seems to be working great on his hands.</li>
            <li> This hand cream was not an &amp;#34;intense repair&amp;#34; as described -- it is more the consistency of a body lotion than hand cream. I was also disappointed by the scent, since I was expecting the delightful scent of the Yes to Carrots body butter, but this is very lightly scented and not nearly as nice of a smell. I will use this up but not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, Gardener&#x27;s Hand Creams are thicker and work better than most of the other natural hand creams, such as Burt&#x27;s Bees Ultimate Care Hand Cream, Collective Well-Being Hand Cream, and Desert Essence Organics Pumpkin Hand Repair Cream (the latter of which is worthwhile just because of its delicious pumpkin-spice smell!). All of these work better than this Yes to Carrots hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a Beeswax Almond Milk hand cream that has more natural ingredients, and smells so delicious, but is leaves hands feeling greasy, and fingerprints on everything touched after using it. I&#x27;ve tried several of the  JR Watkins Hand Creams and Hand Repair Balms by Upper Canada and find these to have superior moisturizing, with much nicer scents than this Yes to Carrots hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;(yes, I realize that I have tried many, many hand creams, but hopefully comments about all of my purchases allow you to better select one for your needs)</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream! I&#x27;m a lotion fanatic, so I have a lot to compare this to. I prefer the thicker, intense lotion (especially during winter), and this fits the bill. This is very rich and absorbs well. It smells nice - fresh, and not too strong. I like the natural ingredients. This is a good size as well - smaller than the big body lotions, but not too small (bigger than travel size). Easy to keep on your desk or in your purse!</li>
            <li> Small amount for such a high price. Great product though as there are no harsh chemicals in this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream ever. I have been using it exclusively for a couple of years. I have given it several times as a gift and get positive feedback. It has a light, delightful carrot scent. It absorbs fully so you don&#x27;t have to watch what you touch. I have dry, sensative skin and perfumes give me migraines. I have nothing but positive reactions to this product. I also use the carrot night face cream.</li>
            <li> The fact that it feels very natural, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not as great as other yes to carrots body lotions, 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it to my hand, i feel it works fine, but not surprisingly great or moisturizing to my hands, 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i will keep use the product, but it won&#x27;t make me want to buy again, I used Intensive Rescue Hand Repair Cream (fragrance free) by Vaseline, it&#x27;s half price, and works much better for my hands.</li>
            <li> I feel like this has great moisture that doesn&#x27;t need to keep being reapplied to work well. I like the smell and size as it&#x27;s purse friendly.</li>
            <li> I use hand lotion after washing my hands fairly religiously to avoid dry cracking skin around my cuticles and fingers tips.  I really like the Yes to Carrots hand lotion.  It applies nicely, never greasy and has a nice light scent. I also like that it is free of parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed that, when I tried this product, it was similar to the consistency of a body lotion...not very thick and dense like the \\&quot;intense repair\\&quot; name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still searching for the perfect hand cream that will get me through 12-hour hospital shifts...</li>
            <li> Love the Yes to Carrots products! Would recommend this to anyone wanting gentle effective hand cream without obtrusive scent. Great!</li>
            <li> This lotion is a very helpful moisturizer in dry climates.... we take this with us when we are visiting Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I work outside with water all day long and this is the only hand lotion that repairs my hands and doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling gross.</li>
