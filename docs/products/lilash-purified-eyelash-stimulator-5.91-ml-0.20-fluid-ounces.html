            <li>I am giving this product a great review though.</li>
            <li>I had been using LiLash and had great results.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>LiLash is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I am more than happy with the results!</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the great reviews, biting my hand, I paid the $100 for 1 tube (before I used Rapid Lash with good results).</li>
            <li>I used to use the pre-2008 formulation of Revitalash, which I loved.</li>
            <li>now 6 weeks on i have a set of gorgeous lashes thicker and longer</li>
            <li>I loved this product.  </li>
            <li>There are so many beauty products out there that offer incredible results and they dissapoint every time.</li>
            <li>This is great, because I find makeup kind of</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all these good reviews.  </li>
            <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond thrilled and happy.  </li>
            <li>I look good with or without eyemake up.  </li>
            <li>a month ago it is not so good...</li>
            <li>I bought Lilash in February 2012, used it for 2 months and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>saying it was as good as the perscription kind but cheaper.</li>
            <li>I am running out and am planning to by more LiLash soon!  </li>
            <li>and this just enhances them even more!</li>
            <li>THE RESULTS ARE PHENOMENAL!</li>
            <li>I love the results!</li>
            <li>Still LOVE LiLash!  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought this product over a year ago, it worked great!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on my eyelashes !  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!!!</li>
            <li>Simply AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>but once my lashes started growing, the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, after using the product for 3 weeks, I started to see some amazing results--longer and fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased LiLash after a friend had amazing results.</li>
            <li>and she now has amazing eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It takes a litle, like a month for you to see this product is amazing, u don&#x27;t need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have had amazing results from LiLash Eyelash Stimulator.</li>
            <li>It works amazing, I always get complimented on my eyelashes and people</li>
            <li>Not as spectacular as my friend&#x27;s lashes  -</li>
            <li>Nothing that washing with warm water did not cure.</li>
            <li>MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S EYELASHES WERE SPECTACULAR</li>
            <li>I say now use this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li>when I don&#x27;t wear mascara, my eyes look like I have nice curled lashes.</li>
            <li>Product works great and such an awesome price.</li>
            <li>so i have to make my own...</li>
            <li>My friends joke that pretty soon I&#x27;ll be able to fly with these babies!</li>
            <li>and thankfully I was one of the lucky ones that experienced ZERO side affects.</li>
            <li>For more honest reviews, check out the Truth in Aging blog, Cosmetics Cop website (Paula discusses the \\&quot;eyelash war\\</li>
            <li>My lashes grew longer &amp; darker &amp; a bit thicker [as in more of them], and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t sound good to me.  </li>
            <li>Strongly reccomended!</li>
            <li>The good news is I did see significant changes.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were very dense,long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is to not do the \\&quot;some is good, more is better\\&quot; thing with this product.</li>
            <li>It needs to be more watery form when going on.</li>
            <li>I was able to stretch 1 tube for a year.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t grow more lashes, just affects the lashes you already have.</li>
            <li>However, keep in mind that just pulling on the eyelash makes the lid more irritated.</li>
            <li>The best advise I can give is be patient and apply it religiously every day and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician &amp; cosmetologist, I personally found this is the BEST product.  </li>
            <li>i wish that lilash made me grow some more lashes</li>
            <li>but she always did have better lashes than me -</li>
            <li>The product looked authentic and caused no irritation but as time passed I saw my lashes reverting to their pre-treated state:</li>
            <li>You get longer lashes and after using it for awhile, you can let more days pass before having to use it again.</li>
            <li>They are longer for sure but also thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day and apply it to the top and bottom lashes, reversing each application the direction that I apply it.</li>
            <li>There is thickening because there are more lashes.</li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li>Love this product  </li>
            <li>LiLash definitely is the best eyelash stimulator for me.  </li>
            <li>I love my lashes after lilash.</li>
            <li>They even get to the point of touching my eyebrows after about 5 months of use.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love LiLash and have been using it for about a year now.  </li>
            <li>Love LiLash.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much better my lashes look.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrow seemed hopeless after so many years of overplucking...</li>
            <li>now that my lashes are longer than ever before I use the product once a week to maintain it, so I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I will be waiting and buying there : )</li>
            <li>I thought for sure</li>
            <li>even my eye dr said this would be safe to use.</li>
            <li>I am not all impressed with this product, or maybe the person sent me a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; as I did order through a private dealer.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it has brought MORE attention to my almond shaped eyes and made them POP with the longer lashes.</li>
            <li>Hope my review is helpful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>JUST MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>He did some blood tests, sure it was something else.</li>
            <li>I feel much better.</li>
            <li>If an ingredient has more letters in it than the alphabet, DONT USE IT.</li>
            <li>The item really works great.  </li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my lashes since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, I got a terrific price from !</li>
            <li>Many of the ecommerce sellers are selling either expired or counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li>i love this product...</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>All I knew was that my eyelashes were getting shorter and more sparse.  </li>
            <li>I actually LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>have been using it for about a year now, and I love it, and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Latisse for the price alone.  </li>
            <li>The tube of LiLash has MUCH more in it...</li>
            <li>So I decided to try just one more time, and splurged on LiLash.  </li>
            <li>, I love to look at myself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>After 20-25 days of use according to the simple directions, I saw lashes, many lashes, I could not believe the lashes I had!!!  </li>
            <li>I have used Li-lash before and was so very happy with my long lashes.  </li>
            <li>By the 3-4 month mark, my lashes were 3x their original length!</li>
            <li>She was delighted to tell me and our assembled friends that they were real and went on to tell us all about Li Lash.   </li>
            <li>Turns out my potential is extremely good!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made it really easy to get 50% off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>-It&#x27;s easy to apply  Cons:  </li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to apply, which is just once</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use and provides noticeably longer lashes that are easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I still use the product with religion, and have beautiful lashes, but I hear if you stop, they fall out and leave you with stubs.</li>
            <li>I figure it&#x27;s worth a try, if it&#x27;s not as good, I&#x27;ll definitely fork out the $120 and feel good about it.    </li>
            <li>: I stopped using this when I got pregnant to be on the safe side, and about four months after I stopped my lashes</li>
            <li>After three months I have noticed a huge difference in length.  </li>
            <li>Lilash is offering a huge sale this Sat-Tues on their website for just $99 per tube.  </li>
            <li>I think you should experiment with a few choices to find the best fit for you.   </li>
            <li>WITHIN TWO WEEKS I COULD TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li>I would say I started to notice a huge improvement in the length within 3-4 weeks of using it every night as directed.  </li>
            <li>After the 4th or 5th week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and there is a HUGE difference in my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i just received my second tube of lilash in the mail and am happy as a clam.  </li>
            <li>Revitalash filled in the sparse areas; I had lashes growing where there were no lashes before.</li>
            <li>It took about a month to see fantastic results.</li>
            <li>there is a REASON why this is so cheap on this website.</li>
            <li>My lashes REALLY grew, and started curling up on their own, whereas before I have always had to use a curling iron.</li>
            <li>You must use it everyday for the best results.</li>
            <li>This is  such a great product.</li>
            <li>DONT BE SO CHEAP, and DONT BE SO VAIN,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice on two occasions a light brow line where I applied the product.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 months before I even saw any results, so patience is important.</li>
            <li>The real LiLash is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>Cosmetic Alchemy has confirmed they do not sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would really work, but lashes were notably longer and thicker after about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Good experience so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, and it is far superior to Revitalash.</li>
            <li>Yes, the price is hefty on the LiLash official website, BUT you are buying the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>They had very good results with their first tubes but their second ones (ordered from Amazon)</li>
            <li>My friend was so excited about the results on me</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are significantly longer</li>
            <li>For about the first 3 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product as all my friends were raving about it</li>
            <li>but it look pretty when you wear mascara on :)</li>
            <li>I was loving my new lashes when I noticed my eyes were drying out</li>
            <li>LiLash had the most positive reviews, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>But, the one positive \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; was that my heretofore crepey eyelids are more \\&quot;awake\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I bought it last year &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>Still cannot believe it, but it is true.</li>
            <li>-It seems to somehow go into a stage every once in awhile, where it looks like my eyelashes are getting shorter, and it stays like that for a good week even if I&#x27;ve been applying it daily.  </li>
            <li>they have offered a full refund.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but lasts a good while and totally delivers on results!  </li>
            <li>Not a bad problem to have.</li>
            <li>I just think there are other options to try out there that do not cause the side effects I experienced, so</li>
            <li>I thought they would respond quickly and do well</li>
            <li>and I love it so much that I want to go ahead and purchase a years worth.</li>
            <li>I for sure knew there was a difference because lashes that were almost nonexistent were now more than double in length.</li>
            <li>I however was not so lucky.</li>
            <li>My lashes have always been average at best and are now touching my eyebrows, they&#x27;re so long.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my lashes were becoming blunt and straight (like my mother&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>then you got a good one (as long as it hasn&#x27;t expired)</li>
            <li>Despite applying the product across the top lid once a day at bedtime, the bottom lashes grew too but are not quite as long as the top lashes.</li>
            <li>I could see it really was working!!  </li>
            <li>guarantee.\\&quot;    BE AWARE!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t any irritation any more, and I really was starting to see that my lashes were double their original length and looked GREAT.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again from the original company I purchased the product from the first time I ordered it.</li>
            <li>My lashes were quite short, not any more!</li>
            <li>is rockin&#x27; some HOT LASHES!  </li>
            <li>I checked with LiLash corporate and they informed me that NO LiLash sold on Amazon is authentic!</li>
            <li>Although i have experienced some itching and a little redness on my eyeshadow</li>
            <li>&amp; I constantly receive compliments about my amazingly loooooong eye lashes.</li>
            <li>so they still taper and look thinner near the top.</li>
            <li>completely worth it.    </li>
            <li>i think its worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money ..</li>
            <li>I noticed that I rarely see lashes fall out - even when removing makeup.</li>
            <li>is rare for me to wear any).  </li>
            <li>however, there are some side effects worth noting.  </li>
            <li>That is absolutely worth the price I think.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Although I have not heard of the product, i thought it was worth a try given it</li>
            <li>Still, it was fun while it lasted.</li>
            <li>The money is worth it though.</li>
            <li>I did hope for more thickness in the individual hairs, but I am not disappointed with the results at all.     </li>
            <li>had better reviews than other more well known brands.  </li>
            <li>but instead they are now noticeably longer than the right side</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t apply Lilash on the right side).</li>
            <li>There is no TM but instead has a registered symbol (\\&quot;r\\&quot; with a circle around it) on the bottom right side.</li>
            <li>right...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and have definitely noticed a HUGE difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m still using my first original tube though, which has lasted for almost 6 months so far (well worth the price if you ask me)!  </li>
            <li>All in all, Lilash a pretty good deterrent - depending on how afflicted you are - and grows your lashes beyond your normal lengths at the same time.</li>
            <li>so really thats not bad.  </li>
            <li>Now I do have nice long lashes and dare I say,</li>
            <li>The first week or so, however, my eyelids did itch after putting it on, so my waxer suggested that I put it on right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I did notice some very slight darkening of my eyelids where I apply the serum, but it hasn&#x27;t been too remarkable.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of latisse from my doctor and used it three times and noticed a huge improvement in the length only after 3 uses!</li>
            <li>:  Definite and really great growth to my eyelashes on my upper lids.  </li>
            <li>But I am getting better and better everyday.  </li>
            <li>It did take a full 12 weeks, with religious application each night, but MAN, my once poker straight, stubby lashes have blossomed into the most envious lashes of anyone I know.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and have had no bad reactions.  </li>
            <li>The original costs much more than LiLash, is harder to apply, and needs to be repurchased every month or so.     </li>
            <li>recently tried another brand - which was abt half the price and touted to be just as good or better in \\&quot;independent\\</li>
            <li>Own lashes not long, pale, kind of sparse.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed is that Lilash made the lashes feel \\&quot;different.\\</li>
            <li>the red swelling is alot better.     </li>
            <li>All my life I have been complimented on my pretty eyes.</li>
            <li>I guess it is an ok product if you have dense lashes that are just short.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes were short and light but after using LiLash for 3 weeks I started to notice that my eyelashes were getting longer!</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ll probably go back to Ardell and after my eyes feel better and my wallet recovers, I&#x27;ll try Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>Prior to using LiLash, my lashes were almost not even visible on the top unless I curled them and put on mascara.</li>
            <li>Those side effects went away after the first week and have not returned.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in LOVE with this product and have already purchased another tube because I&#x27;ve heard that latisse is going to sue LiLash because they use similar formulas</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks I was using it...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first time it worked well</li>
            <li>At first, I had some itching on my eyelids but no longer.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are now lush, darker, longer, and the bald spot is filled in.  </li>
            <li>The real package has no plastic or stickers and worth the $80.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does....  </li>
            <li>During the first 6 of months of use</li>
            <li>I am currently trying it and will write more in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I waited to write my review until I finished the whole tube - which took close to 8 months!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Some side effects: Your eyes will seem irritated at first... but it goes away.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m kind of joking, but not really).</li>
            <li>But when I saw this cheap price which was nearly 1/2 price from the one I purchased before, I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I really like that savings, and LILASH works!  </li>
            <li>Still, it was never uncomfortable,</li>
            <li>I will NOT buy this product through the most recent company I purchased it from.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I was complimented on my lashes and asked if I was wearing falsies.   </li>
            <li>waste your time or your money elsewhere, buy the LiLash now and get on YOUR way to long, sexy lashes today!!!</li>
            <li>First, my eyes got a red line on top and became very itchy.  </li>
            <li>and I am sure that I could back off using it even that much.  </li>
            <li>My 16 yr old daughter and my 4 yr old daughter tell me often \\&quot;I LOVE your lashes!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I am about to vacation in mexico, so I dyed my long lashes and am glad to not feel like I have to rely on waterproof mascara every day.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and what I really wanted to share was why it is best for people with sensitive eyes to only apply this product at night.</li>
            <li>Per my experience, I&#x27;d highly recommend, I feel so special to have such gorgeous eye lashes, what I&#x27;d always admired in other girls</li>
            <li>After 2 months using Lilash [which is SO easy], saw definite added length and darkness.  </li>
            <li>-I notice my eyes get irritated and red easily whilst taking it.  </li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product to anyone wanting to grow their eyelashes to their fullest potential.</li>
            <li>Lilash there is a large \\&quot;TM\\&quot; for trademark.</li>
            <li>As I reached a &#x27;certain age&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have experienced a slight darkening of the eyelid just above the eyelash line and a bit of irritation.  </li>
            <li>I think it is very important to apply the product carefully and not allow any of the product to get into your eye to avoid color change side effects.</li>
            <li>i thought my lashes were pretty long originally, but after using lilash, it&#x27;s evident that i was mistaken.  </li>
            <li>had used this product a few years back and had great results at that time.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but no one would really notice them unless he/she is an inch away from my face looking through a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone thought i had pink eye</li>
            <li>I have used Revitalash and did not have these reactions but also did not have much results.</li>
            <li>Item came really fast when i needed assistance with product</li>
            <li>It took a while to see real growth (2-3 mo)</li>
            <li>At times my left eye would lightly twitch.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really recommend, otherwise.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed by how well it works.</li>
            <li>i used it straight away within two weeks</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I want to finish the tube b/c it cost so much and to see if by chance something happens at the 3 month mark</li>
            <li>, my eyelids became very itchy sometimes...</li>
            <li>I really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>but thanks to this product...</li>
            <li>I really recommend using this if you want longer fuller eye lashes</li>
            <li>AMAZON SHIPS FAST.  </li>
            <li>Really works I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li>And it came really fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>The whole tube lasted me 5 months.</li>
            <li>After the 8 weeks I did not notice much improvement in length.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of change in thickness/number of lashes, but no complaints.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are now much longer.  </li>
            <li>The real thing is labled serum not stimulator also there are mispelled words on the packaging.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m really scared of that part</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>It took about 4 weeks to REALLY see a thickening in my lashes and now at 5 weeks they are beginning to look longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>i was really liking what i saw and</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly, even to those who are aging gracefully!  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes were absolutely 50% longer.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just the normal eyelash growth cycle</li>
            <li>but it was too much...</li>
            <li>I think it all depends on how fast your eyelashes grow.    </li>
            <li>This product absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I happened onto this product and after much internet research decided to order.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to really kick in.  </li>
            <li>There were evenings, getting ready for bed, when I would think \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, i didnt have any issues with ordering and recieving this item.</li>
            <li>The real LiLash is manufactured by Cosmetic Alchemy NOT Cosmetic \\&quot;Pros\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d see if you can get the real deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you want real results, stick with LiLash.</li>
            <li>, these are really mine!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 month and can really see the difference - it really works.</li>
            <li>The arches of my eyebrows are my darker, almost giving my face the effect of having on too much bronzer that I haven&#x27;t rubbed in.</li>
            <li>The skin discoloration has yet to go away, but I&#x27;m really hoping it does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really regretting it now.</li>
            <li>This is most likely because my eyes are annoyingly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>At first I was applying too much, thinking \\&quot;the more the better\\&quot;, but that only made my eye irritated and red.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are now revertting back to their original length.</li>
            <li>Then I wore mascara to work one day (which I don&#x27;t normally) and my eyelashes were rubbing on my glasses!</li>
            <li>I usually buy from my local beauty salon, but I saw it on Amazon for a great savings and figured I&#x27;d buy here.  </li>
            <li>As long as I didn&#x27;t itch it - I would be fine.</li>
            <li>They all came back clean.</li>
            <li>I was really busy over these two weeks, so I didn&#x27;t have very much time to stare at my lashes and critique them nightly</li>
            <li>When I arrived at the restaurant, I was greeted by a vibrant woman with a stylish, elfin crop and amazingly long eyelashes - which I naturally assumed were extensions .</li>
            <li>enough, she was right!  </li>
            <li>Which was a huge deal because when I say I never had long lashes before</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think a tube will last a full 6 months but 4-5 months,</li>
            <li>I have very fair complexion and blonde thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it anymore mainly because of the cost.</li>
            <li>A more immediate side effect happened after a few days of applying the product: it made my eyes very itchy.</li>
            <li>I started my first tube the first of February and can tell it&#x27;s getting low</li>
            <li>I know that everyone&#x27;s experience is different, mine has been tremendous.</li>
            <li>Luckily I bought it through a vendor that would take it back.</li>
            <li>Latisse costs more than LiLash and you only get a tiny bottle of it that lasts about 30 days.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get irritation unless i put on too much, and I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I guess, but really wanted super long lashes.</li>
            <li>I never had super short lashes or anything, normal length</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i ordered lilash i was sceptic and also the price tag was high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone having issues with their lashes.</li>
            <li>That went away, but my usually dry eyes have been much dryer and much more red.  </li>
            <li>so i would said a little side effect... but love the result...</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s this new tube, as I have also used one of my older tubes</li>
            <li>It is completely embarrassing because no matter how much I try to cover it, it looks like I have a mustache.  </li>
            <li>No negative side effects at all.</li>
            <li>Lilash works well, no real issues, some itchiness at first and intermittently,but the thicker longer lashes well worth the itch.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but thought it was worth a try as I have never had long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>recommend anyone with sensitve eyes to ONLY apply it at night, otherwise deal with itchy bloodshot eyes which is much more distracting than having long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was worth the irritation for the final results though.  </li>
            <li>WORTH the price if you want lovely, long, dark lashes.  </li>
            <li>not least, my lashes themselves grew longer but not fuller.  </li>
            <li>I use the maybelline colossal lash (in the yellow tube)</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t think anything is going to happen for me except more dry, red eyes!  </li>
            <li>(only seeing light) for a years due to a rare condition but</li>
            <li>I just bought another bottle to apply them to the right and provide maintenance doses for the left.</li>
            <li>For a minute there, I thought I was getting wrinkles but didn&#x27;t understand why it was only with my right eye.</li>
            <li>Also on the tube at the upper right corner of the word</li>
            <li>For some reason my left eyelashes are thicker and longer then my right eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Given the length of my lashes before, double was not extremely long, but there was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>, I have super long eye lashes to begin with</li>
            <li>And they grew in with a little upwards curl too, which was pretty cool because I did not even need to use an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>&quot; begun by Latisse when reviewing Jan Marini&#x27;s new version.</li>
            <li>I bought some new Lilash from their site and voila,</li>
            <li>so I only used it every other night for the first week and now it is fine.</li>
            <li>It did take a week or two of using it to kick in, but once it did my lashes were super long and manageable!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first two or three weeks, but now my lashes are amazingly long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped wearing mascara much of the time because now I don&#x27;t really need the extra definition to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do love the lashes and I don&#x27;t think I can go back to minimal</li>
            <li>were pretty much back to normal.</li>
            <li>I very rarely wear any sort of eye makeup due to allergies and I try not to rub my eyes because I know this can also cause lash</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have super straight, thick asian hair, with very fine, short, sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li>it was NATURAL!</li>
            <li>At first, my eyes became slightly red and puffy by the morning, but not sore - so I continued.</li>
            <li>Last year for the first time I purchased Lilash from an Amazon seller.</li>
            <li>my lashes were growing back stubs at first,</li>
            <li>and I definitely noticed my eyelashes seemed fuller within the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>And my eyelashes actually hit my sunglasses for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I used this at only 33% of the recommended use---</li>
            <li>In the first 2-3 weeks, my eyes were bloodshot red and irritated from the product.</li>
            <li>My friends and co-workers are all saying \\&quot;Wow!  </li>
            <li>For the first month I didn&#x27;t notice any lash growth, and I did notice that sometimes my eyelash line felt very mildly irritated, like a little bit red and puffy if I looked closely in just the area where the gel is applied.</li>
            <li>The new growth is clearly darker.  </li>
            <li>If you are an eyelash puller you may get used to the different feel of your lashes and pull anyway or at least pull the tips where your lashes feel more \\&quot;normal.\\&quot; For me, it hurt like heck trying to pull them but your pain tolerance may be higher than mine.</li>
            <li>; perhaps it is due to some slight swelling from the irritation, but I love the result!  </li>
            <li>SO I ORIGINALLY HAVE PRETTY THICK LASHES .</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product but stopped because I developed dark brown circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>before makeup (it goes on clear).  </li>
            <li>My forehead has a circle in the middle that is much darker than my natural skin.  </li>
            <li>On the sellers website it clearly states that no LiLash products sold on Amazon are authorized.</li>
            <li>If I purchase this item again, I will order it directly from the LiLash website.</li>
            <li>I was/am nervous about the authenticity of the product, I would buy directly from LiLash if I were to reorder.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell exactly how long it took</li>
            <li>so far, just length.  </li>
            <li>Sometime in my early 40&#x27;s those compliments trickled off, and one day while applying my makeup I noticed that my lashes had noticeably thinned and faded in color.</li>
            <li>I naturally have sparse eyelashes, and</li>
            <li>I am Asian and my lashes grow straight with no curl to them and my bottom lashes were straight and very short.</li>
            <li>- some minor itching at first (nothing like when I have an allergic itching in the eyes)</li>
            <li>This is easily fixed with a curler.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever see my lashes look lush again after menopause.</li>
            <li>45 yrs old.</li>
            <li>My 16yr old can&#x27;t wait until I let her use it</li>
            <li>within one month this product completely improved my eyebrows and has made them twice as thick...and they are still growing.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Lilash after using several eyelash stimulating products that delievered very little--if any--results.</li>
            <li>, my whole eyelid is red and itchy.</li>
            <li>This has multiplied my natural lash length by literally five times since a year ago.</li>
            <li>Has anyone stopped using LiLash completely and had any effects (ie eyelashes falling out)?</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it after about a week as my eyes became very itchy and red.</li>
            <li>The only problem is it made my eye lids much darker people think i have eye shadow on .</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old.  </li>
            <li>And the product did not burn nor irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have had no side effects so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for about 4 weeks, and so far, I can&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li>However, in all fairness, I think it is too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>directly worked wonders.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>Take it from a blue-eyed blonde who was paranoid about side effects - I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>---don&#x27;t go nuts applying it three times a day and expecting lush lashes to show up overnight with no side effects.     </li>
            <li>However - one con is that you need to continue to use the product or your lashes will eventually revert to their &#x27;old selves&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going straight back in tomorrows mail.  </li>
            <li>My lashes seem to fall out frequently when I am not using the product.</li>
            <li>Even my 25 year old daughter can&#x27;t believe, me of all people, has longer lashes than her.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde, with extremely light hair, so I know the difference between blonde lashes and white lashes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 2-3 months since I stopped using Lilash completely.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, it completely eliminated the results that I already had.</li>
            <li>The seller claims that it is real (which it is NOT) and would NOT give me my money back!!!!</li>
            <li>That was 8 or 9 months ago, and my lashes are still long, dark, lovely.  </li>
            <li>not the nice minor pain/rush you usually get when you succeed in snipping off or pulling out a lash.</li>
            <li>I bought this in Feb and wondered why it hadn&#x27;t worked like previous LiLash purchase (previous results were noticably amazing).</li>
            <li>&quot; They were thicker, harder to pull or break off, and had such a strange almost plastic-like feeling that I didn&#x27;t like touching them.</li>
            <li>I first bought Lilash from this site last year to help regrow my eyelashes for my left eye.</li>
            <li>I now use it only once a week, but definitely put it on 4-5 times a week for the first 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product at first, but I am glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>Latisse, the main brand, cost the same and it comes with disposable applicator to avoid contamination and irritation.</li>
            <li>and the only thing to change in March, was I started using Lilash on March 20th to be exact.  </li>
            <li>I had a similar experience to reviewer B. Choi on this site: I initially bought Lilash directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, with dramatically positive results.</li>
            <li>Okay, yes you may get a slight pink line where you are putting the product</li>
            <li>so i read about LiLash and decided to give it a try it took about 2 Months before i really noticed they got long</li>
            <li>i have really shot eyelash and always want my long..</li>
            <li>I was not negatively affected by the product, such as itching, burning, etc.  </li>
            <li>There are no side effects such as burning, itching, etc., although I am noticing that the skin right above the lashes is a bit darker -- not a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li>Eventually due to the pain and the odd, un-satisfying feeling of touching the lashes, I gave up.</li>
            <li>Used it for a year with amazing results, now it barely maintains only a slight improvement in the length, thickness and dark color of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have light green eyes and they stayed that way after an entire bottle of lilash.</li>
            <li>Just take it slow and easy</li>
            <li>One of the ingredients in Librow, the same one that&#x27;s used for treating glaucoma), causes hair to grow under your eyebrows, over your eyebrows, to the side of your eyebrows and even directly under your eyes!</li>
            <li>My results were not dramatic enough to substitute for mascara because my eyelashes weren&#x27;t/aren&#x27;t super thick, but I am no longer losing eye lashes at the rate they were falling out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lilash also caused me to produce more eyelashes above my natural eyelash line so its a little harder to put on eyeliner evenly because the extra stray eyelash hairs would get in the way.  </li>
            <li>If you stop using it, eventually, your old short lashes regrow.</li>
            <li>after 2 days of using Lilash that i purchased directly from Lilash my eyes became swollen and very red and also ichy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m two weeks in and my bottom lashes have almost doubled in length and my top lashes have at least doubled and are starting to actually curl.  </li>
            <li>far as the product itself goes, it DEFINITELY works!!  </li>
            <li>I still am surprised that this product works so well especially at my age.  </li>
            <li>After the 6th and 7th week I noticed a big difference in almost all of my lashes, and a natural curl began in the outer lashes.  </li>
            <li>As for the price, this tiny tube has lasted for for months so far.</li>
            <li>Now she is the one with the tiny lashes and her 53 year old mom</li>
            <li>My lashes are back to normal short length</li>
            <li>I am not sure I would have forked out the full price for it, but the $70 lured me in.     </li>
            <li>After about 5-7 weeks, my friends ( ALL OF MY FRIENDS) started asking me if I curl my lashes, and what kind of mascara I am using, and if I have fake lashes on.</li>
            <li>so maybe I got the wrong kind.</li>
            <li>I tried all sorts of mascaras, false eyelashes, anything to make them \\&quot;look\\&quot; like I had more than I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it just once or twice a week now and feel like I&#x27;ve hardly depleted the supply in the tube - it will last another three months easily.</li>
            <li>They appear less green and more brown.  </li>
            <li>My eyelash-pulling tendencies are limited to just that eye and only happens when I am very stressed.</li>
            <li>I noticed some slight discomfort the first two days, it felt like pressure on my eyes and also some crusting in the morning.</li>
            <li>At first was itchy and I only used every other day For two weeks.</li>
            <li>But i reccomand this if you really ewant long LONG lashes</li>
            <li>Then I discovered that the lashes got so long onthe left, they obscured my normal undereye creases.   </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been off the product long enough to see if my eyelids will return to their normal color or not.  </li>
            <li>I ordered another tube in 2011, and now I get a sensitive, puffy red eyelid on my left eye when I use it.</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde lashes so at first I didn&#x27;t notice , but once I put on the mascara it was \\&quot;POW\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have tried waxing - incase it really was hair and not my skin, and I&#x27;ve tried makeup, nothing works, it&#x27;s so dark.  </li>
            <li>mother natural skip me on the long eyelash...</li>
            <li>Lilash is one of the few over the counter lash growth formula that really works!  </li>
            <li>I only use it every other day, so the tube lasts for 6 months, making it not very expensive.</li>
            <li>So I typically am not the type of person to write a review, and I am a regular girl with have no incentive to write a good or bad review, either way.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered it again and this time in 3 weeks of use my long, lush lashes are back.</li>
            <li>Concealer covers it easily, but still without makeup it is not attractive.  </li>
            <li>I expected great things from Lilash since a colleague of mine has been using it and has crazy long lashes now.  </li>
            <li>or so I have had the lash line ( where you apply LiLash) be a little more pink and slightly itchy.</li>
            <li>I´m now left with shorter, very sparse lashes and with less volume than before.</li>
            <li>My lashes are medium to slightly long and look pretty decent with mascara on but are thin and not very dark.  </li>

            <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews, biting my hand, I paid the $100 for 1 tube (before I used Rapid Lash with good results).</li>
            <li> I used to use the pre-2008 formulation of Revitalash, which I loved.</li>
            <li> now 6 weeks on i have a set of gorgeous lashes thicker and longer</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> There are so many beauty products out there that offer incredible results and they dissapoint every time.</li>
            <li> This is great, because I find makeup kind of</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all these good reviews.  </li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond thrilled and happy.  </li>
            <li> I look good with or without eyemake up.  </li>
            <li> a month ago it is not so good...</li>
            <li> I bought Lilash in February 2012, used it for 2 months and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> saying it was as good as the perscription kind but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am running out and am planning to by more LiLash soon!  </li>
            <li> and this just enhances them even more!</li>
            <li> THE RESULTS ARE PHENOMENAL!</li>
            <li> I love the results!</li>
            <li> Still LOVE LiLash!  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product over a year ago, it worked great!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on my eyelashes !  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Simply AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> but once my lashes started growing, the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, after using the product for 3 weeks, I started to see some amazing results--longer and fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased LiLash after a friend had amazing results.</li>
            <li> and she now has amazing eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It takes a litle, like a month for you to see this product is amazing, u don&#x27;t need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have had amazing results from LiLash Eyelash Stimulator.</li>
            <li> It works amazing, I always get complimented on my eyelashes and people</li>
            <li> Not as spectacular as my friend&#x27;s lashes  -</li>
            <li> Nothing that washing with warm water did not cure.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S EYELASHES WERE SPECTACULAR</li>
            <li> I say now use this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li> when I don&#x27;t wear mascara, my eyes look like I have nice curled lashes.</li>
            <li> Product works great and such an awesome price.</li>
            <li> so i have to make my own...</li>
            <li> My friends joke that pretty soon I&#x27;ll be able to fly with these babies!</li>
            <li> and thankfully I was one of the lucky ones that experienced ZERO side affects.</li>
            <li> For more honest reviews, check out the Truth in Aging blog, Cosmetics Cop website (Paula discusses the \\&quot;eyelash war\\</li>
            <li> My lashes grew longer &amp; darker &amp; a bit thicker [as in more of them], and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t sound good to me.  </li>
            <li> Strongly reccomended!</li>
            <li> The good news is I did see significant changes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were very dense,long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is to not do the \\&quot;some is good, more is better\\&quot; thing with this product.</li>
            <li> It needs to be more watery form when going on.</li>
            <li> I was able to stretch 1 tube for a year.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t grow more lashes, just affects the lashes you already have.</li>
            <li> However, keep in mind that just pulling on the eyelash makes the lid more irritated.</li>
            <li> The best advise I can give is be patient and apply it religiously every day and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician &amp; cosmetologist, I personally found this is the BEST product.  </li>
            <li> i wish that lilash made me grow some more lashes</li>
            <li> but she always did have better lashes than me -</li>
            <li> The product looked authentic and caused no irritation but as time passed I saw my lashes reverting to their pre-treated state:</li>
            <li> You get longer lashes and after using it for awhile, you can let more days pass before having to use it again.</li>
            <li> They are longer for sure but also thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day and apply it to the top and bottom lashes, reversing each application the direction that I apply it.</li>
            <li> There is thickening because there are more lashes.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it, if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li> Love this product  </li>
            <li> LiLash definitely is the best eyelash stimulator for me.  </li>
            <li> I love my lashes after lilash.</li>
            <li> They even get to the point of touching my eyebrows after about 5 months of use.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love LiLash and have been using it for about a year now.  </li>
            <li> Love LiLash.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much better my lashes look.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrow seemed hopeless after so many years of overplucking...</li>
            <li> now that my lashes are longer than ever before I use the product once a week to maintain it, so I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I will be waiting and buying there : )</li>
            <li> I thought for sure</li>
            <li> even my eye dr said this would be safe to use.</li>
            <li> I am not all impressed with this product, or maybe the person sent me a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; as I did order through a private dealer.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it has brought MORE attention to my almond shaped eyes and made them POP with the longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Hope my review is helpful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> JUST MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> He did some blood tests, sure it was something else.</li>
            <li> I feel much better.</li>
            <li> If an ingredient has more letters in it than the alphabet, DONT USE IT.</li>
            <li> The item really works great.  </li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my lashes since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, I got a terrific price from !</li>
            <li> Many of the ecommerce sellers are selling either expired or counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li> i love this product...</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> All I knew was that my eyelashes were getting shorter and more sparse.  </li>
            <li> I actually LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> have been using it for about a year now, and I love it, and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Latisse for the price alone.  </li>
            <li> The tube of LiLash has MUCH more in it...</li>
            <li> So I decided to try just one more time, and splurged on LiLash.  </li>
            <li> , I love to look at myself in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> After 20-25 days of use according to the simple directions, I saw lashes, many lashes, I could not believe the lashes I had!!!  </li>
            <li> I have used Li-lash before and was so very happy with my long lashes.  </li>
            <li> By the 3-4 month mark, my lashes were 3x their original length!</li>
            <li> She was delighted to tell me and our assembled friends that they were real and went on to tell us all about Li Lash.   </li>
            <li> Turns out my potential is extremely good!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made it really easy to get 50% off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> -It&#x27;s easy to apply  Cons:  </li>
            <li> Easy application.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to apply, which is just once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use and provides noticeably longer lashes that are easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I still use the product with religion, and have beautiful lashes, but I hear if you stop, they fall out and leave you with stubs.</li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s worth a try, if it&#x27;s not as good, I&#x27;ll definitely fork out the $120 and feel good about it.    </li>
            <li> : I stopped using this when I got pregnant to be on the safe side, and about four months after I stopped my lashes</li>
            <li> After three months I have noticed a huge difference in length.  </li>
            <li> Lilash is offering a huge sale this Sat-Tues on their website for just $99 per tube.  </li>
            <li> I think you should experiment with a few choices to find the best fit for you.   </li>
            <li> WITHIN TWO WEEKS I COULD TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> I would say I started to notice a huge improvement in the length within 3-4 weeks of using it every night as directed.  </li>
            <li> After the 4th or 5th week I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and there is a HUGE difference in my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i just received my second tube of lilash in the mail and am happy as a clam.  </li>
            <li> Revitalash filled in the sparse areas; I had lashes growing where there were no lashes before.</li>
            <li> It took about a month to see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> there is a REASON why this is so cheap on this website.</li>
            <li> My lashes REALLY grew, and started curling up on their own, whereas before I have always had to use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> You must use it everyday for the best results.</li>
            <li> This is  such a great product.</li>
            <li> DONT BE SO CHEAP, and DONT BE SO VAIN,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice on two occasions a light brow line where I applied the product.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months before I even saw any results, so patience is important.</li>
            <li> The real LiLash is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> Cosmetic Alchemy has confirmed they do not sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would really work, but lashes were notably longer and thicker after about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Good experience so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, and it is far superior to Revitalash.</li>
            <li> Yes, the price is hefty on the LiLash official website, BUT you are buying the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> They had very good results with their first tubes but their second ones (ordered from Amazon)</li>
            <li> My friend was so excited about the results on me</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are significantly longer</li>
            <li> For about the first 3 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product as all my friends were raving about it</li>
            <li> but it look pretty when you wear mascara on :)</li>
            <li> I was loving my new lashes when I noticed my eyes were drying out</li>
            <li> LiLash had the most positive reviews, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> But, the one positive \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; was that my heretofore crepey eyelids are more \\&quot;awake\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought it last year &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li> Still cannot believe it, but it is true.</li>
            <li> -It seems to somehow go into a stage every once in awhile, where it looks like my eyelashes are getting shorter, and it stays like that for a good week even if I&#x27;ve been applying it daily.  </li>
            <li> they have offered a full refund.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but lasts a good while and totally delivers on results!  </li>
            <li> Not a bad problem to have.</li>
            <li> I just think there are other options to try out there that do not cause the side effects I experienced, so</li>
            <li> I thought they would respond quickly and do well</li>
            <li> and I love it so much that I want to go ahead and purchase a years worth.</li>
            <li> I for sure knew there was a difference because lashes that were almost nonexistent were now more than double in length.</li>
            <li> I however was not so lucky.</li>
            <li> My lashes have always been average at best and are now touching my eyebrows, they&#x27;re so long.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my lashes were becoming blunt and straight (like my mother&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> then you got a good one (as long as it hasn&#x27;t expired)</li>
            <li> Despite applying the product across the top lid once a day at bedtime, the bottom lashes grew too but are not quite as long as the top lashes.</li>
            <li> I could see it really was working!!  </li>
            <li> guarantee.\\&quot;    BE AWARE!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t any irritation any more, and I really was starting to see that my lashes were double their original length and looked GREAT.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again from the original company I purchased the product from the first time I ordered it.</li>
            <li> My lashes were quite short, not any more!</li>
            <li> is rockin&#x27; some HOT LASHES!  </li>
            <li> I checked with LiLash corporate and they informed me that NO LiLash sold on Amazon is authentic!</li>
            <li> Although i have experienced some itching and a little redness on my eyeshadow</li>
            <li> &amp; I constantly receive compliments about my amazingly loooooong eye lashes.</li>
            <li> so they still taper and look thinner near the top.</li>
            <li> completely worth it.    </li>
            <li> i think its worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money ..</li>
            <li> I noticed that I rarely see lashes fall out - even when removing makeup.</li>
            <li> is rare for me to wear any).  </li>
            <li> however, there are some side effects worth noting.  </li>
            <li> That is absolutely worth the price I think.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Although I have not heard of the product, i thought it was worth a try given it</li>
            <li> Still, it was fun while it lasted.</li>
            <li> The money is worth it though.</li>
            <li> I did hope for more thickness in the individual hairs, but I am not disappointed with the results at all.     </li>
            <li> had better reviews than other more well known brands.  </li>
            <li> but instead they are now noticeably longer than the right side</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t apply Lilash on the right side).</li>
            <li> There is no TM but instead has a registered symbol (\\&quot;r\\&quot; with a circle around it) on the bottom right side.</li>
            <li> right...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and have definitely noticed a HUGE difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m still using my first original tube though, which has lasted for almost 6 months so far (well worth the price if you ask me)!  </li>
            <li> All in all, Lilash a pretty good deterrent - depending on how afflicted you are - and grows your lashes beyond your normal lengths at the same time.</li>
            <li> so really thats not bad.  </li>
            <li> Now I do have nice long lashes and dare I say,</li>
            <li> The first week or so, however, my eyelids did itch after putting it on, so my waxer suggested that I put it on right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I did notice some very slight darkening of my eyelids where I apply the serum, but it hasn&#x27;t been too remarkable.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of latisse from my doctor and used it three times and noticed a huge improvement in the length only after 3 uses!</li>
            <li> :  Definite and really great growth to my eyelashes on my upper lids.  </li>
            <li> But I am getting better and better everyday.  </li>
            <li> It did take a full 12 weeks, with religious application each night, but MAN, my once poker straight, stubby lashes have blossomed into the most envious lashes of anyone I know.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and have had no bad reactions.  </li>
            <li> The original costs much more than LiLash, is harder to apply, and needs to be repurchased every month or so.     </li>
            <li> recently tried another brand - which was abt half the price and touted to be just as good or better in \\&quot;independent\\</li>
            <li> Own lashes not long, pale, kind of sparse.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is that Lilash made the lashes feel \\&quot;different.\\</li>
            <li> the red swelling is alot better.     </li>
            <li> All my life I have been complimented on my pretty eyes.</li>
            <li> I guess it is an ok product if you have dense lashes that are just short.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes were short and light but after using LiLash for 3 weeks I started to notice that my eyelashes were getting longer!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ll probably go back to Ardell and after my eyes feel better and my wallet recovers, I&#x27;ll try Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> Prior to using LiLash, my lashes were almost not even visible on the top unless I curled them and put on mascara.</li>
            <li> Those side effects went away after the first week and have not returned.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with this product and have already purchased another tube because I&#x27;ve heard that latisse is going to sue LiLash because they use similar formulas</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks I was using it...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first time it worked well</li>
            <li> At first, I had some itching on my eyelids but no longer.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are now lush, darker, longer, and the bald spot is filled in.  </li>
            <li> The real package has no plastic or stickers and worth the $80.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does....  </li>
            <li> During the first 6 of months of use</li>
            <li> I am currently trying it and will write more in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review until I finished the whole tube - which took close to 8 months!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Some side effects: Your eyes will seem irritated at first... but it goes away.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m kind of joking, but not really).</li>
            <li> But when I saw this cheap price which was nearly 1/2 price from the one I purchased before, I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I really like that savings, and LILASH works!  </li>
            <li> Still, it was never uncomfortable,</li>
            <li> I will NOT buy this product through the most recent company I purchased it from.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I was complimented on my lashes and asked if I was wearing falsies.   </li>
            <li> waste your time or your money elsewhere, buy the LiLash now and get on YOUR way to long, sexy lashes today!!!</li>
            <li> First, my eyes got a red line on top and became very itchy.  </li>
            <li> and I am sure that I could back off using it even that much.  </li>
            <li> My 16 yr old daughter and my 4 yr old daughter tell me often \\&quot;I LOVE your lashes!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I am about to vacation in mexico, so I dyed my long lashes and am glad to not feel like I have to rely on waterproof mascara every day.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and what I really wanted to share was why it is best for people with sensitive eyes to only apply this product at night.</li>
            <li> Per my experience, I&#x27;d highly recommend, I feel so special to have such gorgeous eye lashes, what I&#x27;d always admired in other girls</li>
            <li> After 2 months using Lilash [which is SO easy], saw definite added length and darkness.  </li>
            <li> -I notice my eyes get irritated and red easily whilst taking it.  </li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product to anyone wanting to grow their eyelashes to their fullest potential.</li>
            <li> Lilash there is a large \\&quot;TM\\&quot; for trademark.</li>
            <li> As I reached a &#x27;certain age&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have experienced a slight darkening of the eyelid just above the eyelash line and a bit of irritation.  </li>
            <li> I think it is very important to apply the product carefully and not allow any of the product to get into your eye to avoid color change side effects.</li>
            <li> i thought my lashes were pretty long originally, but after using lilash, it&#x27;s evident that i was mistaken.  </li>
            <li> had used this product a few years back and had great results at that time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but no one would really notice them unless he/she is an inch away from my face looking through a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone thought i had pink eye</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash and did not have these reactions but also did not have much results.</li>
            <li> Item came really fast when i needed assistance with product</li>
            <li> It took a while to see real growth (2-3 mo)</li>
            <li> At times my left eye would lightly twitch.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really recommend, otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed by how well it works.</li>
            <li> i used it straight away within two weeks</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I want to finish the tube b/c it cost so much and to see if by chance something happens at the 3 month mark</li>
            <li> , my eyelids became very itchy sometimes...</li>
            <li> I really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> but thanks to this product...</li>
            <li> I really recommend using this if you want longer fuller eye lashes</li>
            <li> AMAZON SHIPS FAST.  </li>
            <li> Really works I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li> And it came really fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> The whole tube lasted me 5 months.</li>
            <li> After the 8 weeks I did not notice much improvement in length.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of change in thickness/number of lashes, but no complaints.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are now much longer.  </li>
            <li> The real thing is labled serum not stimulator also there are mispelled words on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m really scared of that part</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> It took about 4 weeks to REALLY see a thickening in my lashes and now at 5 weeks they are beginning to look longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> i was really liking what i saw and</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly, even to those who are aging gracefully!  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes were absolutely 50% longer.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just the normal eyelash growth cycle</li>
            <li> but it was too much...</li>
            <li> I think it all depends on how fast your eyelashes grow.    </li>
            <li> This product absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I happened onto this product and after much internet research decided to order.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to really kick in.  </li>
            <li> There were evenings, getting ready for bed, when I would think \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, i didnt have any issues with ordering and recieving this item.</li>
            <li> The real LiLash is manufactured by Cosmetic Alchemy NOT Cosmetic \\&quot;Pros\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d see if you can get the real deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you want real results, stick with LiLash.</li>
            <li> , these are really mine!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 month and can really see the difference - it really works.</li>
            <li> The arches of my eyebrows are my darker, almost giving my face the effect of having on too much bronzer that I haven&#x27;t rubbed in.</li>
            <li> The skin discoloration has yet to go away, but I&#x27;m really hoping it does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really regretting it now.</li>
            <li> This is most likely because my eyes are annoyingly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> At first I was applying too much, thinking \\&quot;the more the better\\&quot;, but that only made my eye irritated and red.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are now revertting back to their original length.</li>
            <li> Then I wore mascara to work one day (which I don&#x27;t normally) and my eyelashes were rubbing on my glasses!</li>
            <li> I usually buy from my local beauty salon, but I saw it on Amazon for a great savings and figured I&#x27;d buy here.  </li>
            <li> As long as I didn&#x27;t itch it - I would be fine.</li>
            <li> They all came back clean.</li>
            <li> I was really busy over these two weeks, so I didn&#x27;t have very much time to stare at my lashes and critique them nightly</li>
            <li> When I arrived at the restaurant, I was greeted by a vibrant woman with a stylish, elfin crop and amazingly long eyelashes - which I naturally assumed were extensions .</li>
            <li> enough, she was right!  </li>
            <li> Which was a huge deal because when I say I never had long lashes before</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think a tube will last a full 6 months but 4-5 months,</li>
            <li> I have very fair complexion and blonde thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it anymore mainly because of the cost.</li>
            <li> A more immediate side effect happened after a few days of applying the product: it made my eyes very itchy.</li>
            <li> I started my first tube the first of February and can tell it&#x27;s getting low</li>
            <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s experience is different, mine has been tremendous.</li>
            <li> Luckily I bought it through a vendor that would take it back.</li>
            <li> Latisse costs more than LiLash and you only get a tiny bottle of it that lasts about 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get irritation unless i put on too much, and I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I guess, but really wanted super long lashes.</li>
            <li> I never had super short lashes or anything, normal length</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i ordered lilash i was sceptic and also the price tag was high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone having issues with their lashes.</li>
            <li> That went away, but my usually dry eyes have been much dryer and much more red.  </li>
            <li> so i would said a little side effect... but love the result...</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s this new tube, as I have also used one of my older tubes</li>
            <li> It is completely embarrassing because no matter how much I try to cover it, it looks like I have a mustache.  </li>
            <li> No negative side effects at all.</li>
            <li> Lilash works well, no real issues, some itchiness at first and intermittently,but the thicker longer lashes well worth the itch.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but thought it was worth a try as I have never had long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> recommend anyone with sensitve eyes to ONLY apply it at night, otherwise deal with itchy bloodshot eyes which is much more distracting than having long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was worth the irritation for the final results though.  </li>
            <li> WORTH the price if you want lovely, long, dark lashes.  </li>
            <li> not least, my lashes themselves grew longer but not fuller.  </li>
            <li> I use the maybelline colossal lash (in the yellow tube)</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t think anything is going to happen for me except more dry, red eyes!  </li>
            <li> (only seeing light) for a years due to a rare condition but</li>
            <li> I just bought another bottle to apply them to the right and provide maintenance doses for the left.</li>
            <li> For a minute there, I thought I was getting wrinkles but didn&#x27;t understand why it was only with my right eye.</li>
            <li> Also on the tube at the upper right corner of the word</li>
            <li> For some reason my left eyelashes are thicker and longer then my right eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Given the length of my lashes before, double was not extremely long, but there was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> , I have super long eye lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> And they grew in with a little upwards curl too, which was pretty cool because I did not even need to use an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> &quot; begun by Latisse when reviewing Jan Marini&#x27;s new version.</li>
            <li> I bought some new Lilash from their site and voila,</li>
            <li> so I only used it every other night for the first week and now it is fine.</li>
            <li> It did take a week or two of using it to kick in, but once it did my lashes were super long and manageable!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first two or three weeks, but now my lashes are amazingly long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped wearing mascara much of the time because now I don&#x27;t really need the extra definition to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do love the lashes and I don&#x27;t think I can go back to minimal</li>
            <li> were pretty much back to normal.</li>
            <li> I very rarely wear any sort of eye makeup due to allergies and I try not to rub my eyes because I know this can also cause lash</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have super straight, thick asian hair, with very fine, short, sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it was NATURAL!</li>
            <li> At first, my eyes became slightly red and puffy by the morning, but not sore - so I continued.</li>
            <li> Last year for the first time I purchased Lilash from an Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> my lashes were growing back stubs at first,</li>
            <li> and I definitely noticed my eyelashes seemed fuller within the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> And my eyelashes actually hit my sunglasses for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I used this at only 33% of the recommended use---</li>
            <li> In the first 2-3 weeks, my eyes were bloodshot red and irritated from the product.</li>
            <li> My friends and co-workers are all saying \\&quot;Wow!  </li>
            <li> For the first month I didn&#x27;t notice any lash growth, and I did notice that sometimes my eyelash line felt very mildly irritated, like a little bit red and puffy if I looked closely in just the area where the gel is applied.</li>
            <li> The new growth is clearly darker.  </li>
            <li> If you are an eyelash puller you may get used to the different feel of your lashes and pull anyway or at least pull the tips where your lashes feel more \\&quot;normal.\\&quot; For me, it hurt like heck trying to pull them but your pain tolerance may be higher than mine.</li>
            <li> ; perhaps it is due to some slight swelling from the irritation, but I love the result!  </li>
            <li> SO I ORIGINALLY HAVE PRETTY THICK LASHES .</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product but stopped because I developed dark brown circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> before makeup (it goes on clear).  </li>
            <li> My forehead has a circle in the middle that is much darker than my natural skin.  </li>
            <li> On the sellers website it clearly states that no LiLash products sold on Amazon are authorized.</li>
            <li> If I purchase this item again, I will order it directly from the LiLash website.</li>
            <li> I was/am nervous about the authenticity of the product, I would buy directly from LiLash if I were to reorder.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell exactly how long it took</li>
            <li> so far, just length.  </li>
            <li> Sometime in my early 40&#x27;s those compliments trickled off, and one day while applying my makeup I noticed that my lashes had noticeably thinned and faded in color.</li>
            <li> I naturally have sparse eyelashes, and</li>
            <li> I am Asian and my lashes grow straight with no curl to them and my bottom lashes were straight and very short.</li>
            <li> - some minor itching at first (nothing like when I have an allergic itching in the eyes)</li>
            <li> This is easily fixed with a curler.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever see my lashes look lush again after menopause.</li>
            <li> 45 yrs old.</li>
            <li> My 16yr old can&#x27;t wait until I let her use it</li>
            <li> within one month this product completely improved my eyebrows and has made them twice as thick...and they are still growing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Lilash after using several eyelash stimulating products that delievered very little--if any--results.</li>
            <li> , my whole eyelid is red and itchy.</li>
            <li> This has multiplied my natural lash length by literally five times since a year ago.</li>
            <li> Has anyone stopped using LiLash completely and had any effects (ie eyelashes falling out)?</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it after about a week as my eyes became very itchy and red.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it made my eye lids much darker people think i have eye shadow on .</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old.  </li>
            <li> And the product did not burn nor irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have had no side effects so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for about 4 weeks, and so far, I can&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li> However, in all fairness, I think it is too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> directly worked wonders.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> Take it from a blue-eyed blonde who was paranoid about side effects - I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> ---don&#x27;t go nuts applying it three times a day and expecting lush lashes to show up overnight with no side effects.     </li>
            <li> However - one con is that you need to continue to use the product or your lashes will eventually revert to their &#x27;old selves&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going straight back in tomorrows mail.  </li>
            <li> My lashes seem to fall out frequently when I am not using the product.</li>
            <li> Even my 25 year old daughter can&#x27;t believe, me of all people, has longer lashes than her.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde, with extremely light hair, so I know the difference between blonde lashes and white lashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2-3 months since I stopped using Lilash completely.  </li>
            <li> Because of that, it completely eliminated the results that I already had.</li>
            <li> The seller claims that it is real (which it is NOT) and would NOT give me my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> That was 8 or 9 months ago, and my lashes are still long, dark, lovely.  </li>
            <li> not the nice minor pain/rush you usually get when you succeed in snipping off or pulling out a lash.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Feb and wondered why it hadn&#x27;t worked like previous LiLash purchase (previous results were noticably amazing).</li>
            <li> &quot; They were thicker, harder to pull or break off, and had such a strange almost plastic-like feeling that I didn&#x27;t like touching them.</li>
            <li> I first bought Lilash from this site last year to help regrow my eyelashes for my left eye.</li>
            <li> I now use it only once a week, but definitely put it on 4-5 times a week for the first 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first, but I am glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Latisse, the main brand, cost the same and it comes with disposable applicator to avoid contamination and irritation.</li>
            <li> and the only thing to change in March, was I started using Lilash on March 20th to be exact.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar experience to reviewer B. Choi on this site: I initially bought Lilash directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, with dramatically positive results.</li>
            <li> Okay, yes you may get a slight pink line where you are putting the product</li>
            <li> so i read about LiLash and decided to give it a try it took about 2 Months before i really noticed they got long</li>
            <li> i have really shot eyelash and always want my long..</li>
            <li> I was not negatively affected by the product, such as itching, burning, etc.  </li>
            <li> There are no side effects such as burning, itching, etc., although I am noticing that the skin right above the lashes is a bit darker -- not a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> Eventually due to the pain and the odd, un-satisfying feeling of touching the lashes, I gave up.</li>
            <li> Used it for a year with amazing results, now it barely maintains only a slight improvement in the length, thickness and dark color of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have light green eyes and they stayed that way after an entire bottle of lilash.</li>
            <li> Just take it slow and easy</li>
            <li> One of the ingredients in Librow, the same one that&#x27;s used for treating glaucoma), causes hair to grow under your eyebrows, over your eyebrows, to the side of your eyebrows and even directly under your eyes!</li>
            <li> My results were not dramatic enough to substitute for mascara because my eyelashes weren&#x27;t/aren&#x27;t super thick, but I am no longer losing eye lashes at the rate they were falling out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lilash also caused me to produce more eyelashes above my natural eyelash line so its a little harder to put on eyeliner evenly because the extra stray eyelash hairs would get in the way.  </li>
            <li> If you stop using it, eventually, your old short lashes regrow.</li>
            <li> after 2 days of using Lilash that i purchased directly from Lilash my eyes became swollen and very red and also ichy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks in and my bottom lashes have almost doubled in length and my top lashes have at least doubled and are starting to actually curl.  </li>
            <li> far as the product itself goes, it DEFINITELY works!!  </li>
            <li> I still am surprised that this product works so well especially at my age.  </li>
            <li> After the 6th and 7th week I noticed a big difference in almost all of my lashes, and a natural curl began in the outer lashes.  </li>
            <li> As for the price, this tiny tube has lasted for for months so far.</li>
            <li> Now she is the one with the tiny lashes and her 53 year old mom</li>
            <li> My lashes are back to normal short length</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would have forked out the full price for it, but the $70 lured me in.     </li>
            <li> After about 5-7 weeks, my friends ( ALL OF MY FRIENDS) started asking me if I curl my lashes, and what kind of mascara I am using, and if I have fake lashes on.</li>
            <li> so maybe I got the wrong kind.</li>
            <li> I tried all sorts of mascaras, false eyelashes, anything to make them \\&quot;look\\&quot; like I had more than I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it just once or twice a week now and feel like I&#x27;ve hardly depleted the supply in the tube - it will last another three months easily.</li>
            <li> They appear less green and more brown.  </li>
            <li> My eyelash-pulling tendencies are limited to just that eye and only happens when I am very stressed.</li>
            <li> I noticed some slight discomfort the first two days, it felt like pressure on my eyes and also some crusting in the morning.</li>
            <li> At first was itchy and I only used every other day For two weeks.</li>
            <li> But i reccomand this if you really ewant long LONG lashes</li>
            <li> Then I discovered that the lashes got so long onthe left, they obscured my normal undereye creases.   </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been off the product long enough to see if my eyelids will return to their normal color or not.  </li>
            <li> I ordered another tube in 2011, and now I get a sensitive, puffy red eyelid on my left eye when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde lashes so at first I didn&#x27;t notice , but once I put on the mascara it was \\&quot;POW\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried waxing - incase it really was hair and not my skin, and I&#x27;ve tried makeup, nothing works, it&#x27;s so dark.  </li>
            <li> mother natural skip me on the long eyelash...</li>
            <li> Lilash is one of the few over the counter lash growth formula that really works!  </li>
            <li> I only use it every other day, so the tube lasts for 6 months, making it not very expensive.</li>
            <li> So I typically am not the type of person to write a review, and I am a regular girl with have no incentive to write a good or bad review, either way.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered it again and this time in 3 weeks of use my long, lush lashes are back.</li>
            <li> Concealer covers it easily, but still without makeup it is not attractive.  </li>
            <li> I expected great things from Lilash since a colleague of mine has been using it and has crazy long lashes now.  </li>
            <li> or so I have had the lash line ( where you apply LiLash) be a little more pink and slightly itchy.</li>
            <li> I´m now left with shorter, very sparse lashes and with less volume than before.</li>
            <li> My lashes are medium to slightly long and look pretty decent with mascara on but are thin and not very dark.  </li>
            <li> and one little nasty side effect I&#x27;ve noticed, on the outside corners of my eyes, I&#x27;ve noticed a nice new growth of fine hair on my upper cheek....</li>
            <li> (the tubes last a long time) on different weeks, without the same puffy results.</li>
            <li> I got constant compliments on how long they were, with my eyes open</li>
            <li> I was VERY sceptical, since products like this, with these type of claims, usually don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> She had lost  her long  blonde hair and eyelashes  .   </li>
            <li> In the beginning, I did experience some minor itching on the application sites but this discomfort diminshed after regular use.</li>
            <li> Never went back to the way they used to be thank god but not as long as they were when i was using the product .</li>
            <li> I too noticed a difference in 1.5 weeks of using the product and now my lashes are so long I use it only once a week.</li>
            <li> am not generally a \\&quot;senstive\\&quot; person to products.  </li>
            <li> i actually have long lashes!  </li>
            <li> It just seemed by month two all of the sudden my eyelashes were very long.  </li>
            <li> Using mascara (black or clear) never produced those types of effects.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and has different reactions to it, so you just have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Now, a year after using this no more redness and sensitivity, back to normal.   </li>
            <li> yes, it is true, that give me long lashes but it make it thin.</li>
            <li> It stings a little right when i put it on, but goes away withing few minutes .</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I saw a big increase in the length of my eyelashes after about a month&#x27;s use once daily.  </li>
            <li> The only way to cover the white was with extreme amounts of mascara.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that worries me is once I stop using it, I feel like I&#x27;ll really HATE my eyelashes when they&#x27;re back to normal because I&#x27;ll FEEL as if they got super super short, when they&#x27;ll probably just be the same length they were before I started using this, but in my mind, I&#x27;ll think they got worse.</li>
            <li> the first few days, my eyes were a little bit itchy and irritated, but that went away.  </li>
            <li> They are thicker, longer and look ridiculously long after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> I even trimmed my eyelashes because there were a couple that were extremely long.</li>
            <li> I pluck them when they get too long</li>
            <li> Be careful not to cause extra irritation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about that, be careful to apply to the lid only.), and Makeup Alley site.</li>
            <li> I had bought cheaper products that didn&#x27;t and expected this one to be the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LiLash for a year, and my eyelashes are FREAKISHLY long</li>
            <li> Now I literally have 8-10 moderately long lashes on either eye.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have stayed long.</li>
            <li> so I thought, maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s taking so long</li>
            <li> I tried Ardell briefly before trying Lilash and saw some improvement in a week but not much difference after that.  </li>
            <li> my eyelashes look so long and people have commented on how long my eyelashes are.  </li>
            <li> mY EYELASHES GREW TWICE AS LONG</li>
            <li> Makes lashes long again.</li>
            <li> Length is ridiculously, wonderfully long.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn´t recommend this product if you´re expecting/wanting long term effects.</li>
            <li> It works all and all, just takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased LiLash for my mom and my aunt because they couldn&#x27;t believe how long my lashes have gotten.</li>
            <li> They got so long</li>
            <li> I had long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> and my lashes aren&#x27;t as long as they were when i was using the product.</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on religiously everyday for a couple of weeks according to the instructions and nothing so far.  </li>
            <li> u have long eyelash..</li>
            <li> They are long, they are fuller.  </li>
            <li> They are still long.  </li>
            <li> I will keep reordering as long as it&#x27;s avalible.</li>
            <li> Better and less expensive in the long run than being on a prescription drug.  </li>
            <li> It is only now , over a month and a half later that I&#x27;m seeing the results.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Now after three months my lashes are really long and fuller too!  </li>
            <li> Since I noticed the brown line only occurred when I had other products on my eyes, I now avoid wearing anything on my lids where I am applying li lash.  </li>
            <li> After about a month or so, I found that I  only need to apply it every other morning or evening - either time works.  </li>
            <li> So now, to maintain my lashes, I use it every other day (in an attempt to make it last longer/save money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im using only once at night, because my eyes get little red.</li>
            <li> They are very long.  </li>
            <li> the long dark lashes and the compliments are back.</li>
            <li> My individual eyelashes were still thin, but they were just much longer.</li>
            <li> AND extreme dark skin above my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I use this every single night before bed.  </li>
            <li> A dark line shows where I put the Lilash, and then above it my lids are stained almost into my brow bone.  </li>
            <li> Looks like the posts about it being fake are 100% true.</li>
            <li> I really wanted thick lashes when I started this product, so I overlooked other warning&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> what do i have to loose</li>
            <li> Although the product was sealed, when I opened it part of the plastic piece inside the tube was loose.</li>
            <li> Negative side effects: You may notice after a few months that a tiny patch of facial hairs near your eyes have grown longer and darker.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product last year and after one month and a half my lashes where extremly longer than they were before.</li>
            <li> I recently had my lashes tinted black</li>
            <li> I have slight reddish discoloration of upper lid</li>
            <li> I miss the long lashes I had while using this so am looking for other alternatives.</li>
            <li> The writing on the tube looks a little different.</li>
            <li> Just a little extra \\&quot;eye crud\\&quot; in the am after I woke up.</li>
            <li> I am asian and I have little to no lashes at all...</li>
            <li> No new growth in other words.  </li>
            <li> I actually had to cut them down because my mascara was leaving marks all the way up by my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy, I love it, but too bad I&#x27;m into the whole \\&quot;natural beauty,\\</li>
            <li> I have pink lids anyway</li>
            <li> eyelashes had been falling out at an alarming speed.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 one for me and one for my mother after a few days we both had to quit using it because our eyes would barely open from the welling and rash.</li>
            <li> I would wake up to find several lashes on my pillow or a few on my check.</li>
            <li> This is a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> its not very noticiable yet, but it must be after I apply the serum at night</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems here.</li>
            <li> So one month in, not much is happening, but I keep at it.    </li>
            <li> However after learning that I was applying too much of it, I changed my application method and the irritation was decreased to an extent.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously w/ absolutely no visible results at all.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this product and noticed right away the packaging was wrong.</li>
            <li> The product was a little irritating at first</li>
            <li> Another problem, and by far my biggest concern, SERIOUS SKIN PIGMENTATION DAMAGE all over my face.  </li>
            <li> My short eyelashes became long and thick in a matter of 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, my long thick eye lashes started to grow in white!</li>
            <li> but those suckers wouldn&#x27;t come out without major pain -</li>
            <li> My stubby little eyelashes are twice as long as they used to be, and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> and then every other noght or so.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the same as the original either :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I have purchased several tubes of this product over the past couple of years, with no problem with the product.</li>
            <li> I have heard from so many people that buy lilash on amazon and were disappointed that it didnt work as well as the lilash from the lilash website.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I first bought it.   </li>
            <li> I step it up to every other night, 50% of recommended use.</li>
            <li> have greenish/blue eyes (bordering on \\&quot;hazel\\&quot;), and I have not noticed any eye color change, as some other users have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> did not experience any itching or burning or any of the other side effects people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!  </li>
            <li> It used to be the other way around.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even have to trim them because a few have become so long.  </li>
            <li> I measured the left lashes a few weeks ago and straightened out they are a little longer than .5 inch.</li>
            <li> So if you have thin lashes like I do, then you have thin super long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean you could barely tell I had any.  </li>
            <li> They are darker/thicker than the non-Lilashed side but not to the extent that I expected according to previous reviews here.</li>
            <li> She also states that the eye pigmentation problem occurs when the active ingredient is applied to the eye, not the lid.</li>
            <li> I wondered if perhaps a person develops a tolerance to the active ingredient in Lilash, causing it to stop working.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews and info I found regarding the active ingredient in this product.  </li>
            <li> It is a imitation I do believe.  </li>
            <li> So I called the company and was told what the other reviewer was told: that no one else is authorized to sell the product online and that Lilash bought elsewhere may be expired or even (in the case of auction sites) previously used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not losing anymore eyelashes other than the occasional lash that usually falls out, even when I rub my eyes!</li>
            <li> Now they doubled the price and its just NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> It was not worth it to me, to continue using it.</li>
            <li> so really dark eye lids</li>
            <li> They did not become as thick as I hoped, but I received multiple compliments on my eyelashes even when I was not wearing mascara (which again, was/</li>
            <li> I have had very little irritation (just a dry feeling when I wake up in the AM)and</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the break down:    </li>
            <li> I have dropped down to using it once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to review this, because I think it&#x27;s just my lashes, but one eye has curlier lashes than the other!</li>
            <li> but I like the dramatic look and decided to try this to see if it would help my natural lashes grow even longer.</li>
            <li> cause my eyes are black)    </li>
            <li> I chose LiLash because it seemed to have less side effects than Latisse and did not require an online prescription.</li>
            <li> Over time I have less irritation and itchiness, but the redness remains.</li>
            <li> The prescription product, Latise, said that when you stopped using it, your lashses would return to their previous state.  </li>
            <li> But by about 4 or 5 weeks into it....holy cow!  </li>
            <li> my husband didn&#x27;t notice any redness (I asked him,) it didn&#x27;t interfere with makeup at all, and it was gone in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> After three months of using the product way less than prescribed, I got great-looking lashes with fewer side effects.</li>
            <li> It does sometimes turn a little dark in the lid closest to the lash</li>
            <li> THEY WERE SO THICK AND LONG .</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are twice as long and thick.  </li>
            <li> My lashed were so long and thick</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look long without mascara, but especially with mascara, they LOOK ridiculously FAKE....</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I dropped it down to using it every few days instead of every night</li>
            <li> I did notice a couple times in the beginning my eyelids feeling a little irritated but</li>
            <li> It took a little longer on the eyebrows to grow in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth losing your vision to save $30!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look bad ( and I rarely wear make up )</li>
            <li> but it was a few months.</li>
            <li> It was so noticable that when I ran into a few friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while one night</li>
            <li> After a few weeks my lashes are dramatically thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 8 weeks everyday sometimes twice a day</li>
            <li> I never experienced irritation, just obvious results.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others since then</li>
            <li> I wasted tons and tons of money on it.  </li>
            <li> I have very short thin lashes</li>
            <li> and it has not effected the \\&quot;green tone\\</li>
            <li> Ive learned a few things,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with it, but so far, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> so I purchased 1 for 1/2 the price a few months ago.     </li>
            <li> I then following the directions, and applied ONE thin line along my lash line.  </li>
            <li> (so I&#x27;ve now wasted $250)</li>
            <li> I saw small changes (less lash loss) within a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hoping they will not remove it as some other over the counter formulas were forced to do.  </li>
            <li> Combining that with Lilash would make my eyes even itchier and slightly painful after those first episodes.   </li>
            <li> I use very little and also wipe the excess off before putting it on.  </li>
            <li> The product lasted me for about 8 months!and i stoped using it after that just because it felt dirty and old.</li>
            <li> If you think you have a counterfeit or were sold the wrong size, send it back to Amazon ASAP.</li>
            <li> I went on girls weekend and one friend asked if I was wearing fake eyelashes and another commented on seeing something different on me</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but after several weeks of use li&#x27;lash has made my lashes thicker, darker, and longer.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, I thought I noticed a difference but was not sure.  </li>
            <li> Talk about a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> and i did no experience any crazy side effecs at all, only a little redness on my eye lid</li>
            <li> THIS EYELASH SIMULATOR TOOK MY NATURAL LASHES AND MADE THEM LOOK FAKE!</li>
            <li> It took approximately 3 months to see dramatic changes with daily use.  </li>
            <li> I was/am really disappointed as I was expecting the results to last longer--considering the amount that I spent for this product.  </li>
            <li> I had used the less expensive, store bought products, (Loreal and Rapid Lash), with little to no results.  </li>
            <li> and then if I rub them too hard washing or drying my face.</li>
            <li> and it was dark out!!!</li>
            <li> so dry eyes can be very irritating).  </li>
            <li> IT TAKES AT LEAST ONE MONTH BUT- --</li>
            <li> I started using Lilash (bought from a medspa, not Amazon) in late August.  </li>
            <li> I will buy at least 4 times a year.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, I know this is a somewhat common complaint.)  </li>
            <li> I have never written a negative review in my life - but on principle I must do it now.</li>
            <li> If there were negative stars - I would have chosen them.</li>
            <li> My hair grows kinda slow</li>
            <li> I mean are you kidding me??  </li>
            <li> I probably got a fake knock-off like some other reviewers suspected.  </li>
            <li> Just because you bought it on Amazon doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short, I was very skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I could already tell a difference, by 6 weeks they were crazy long.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.     </li>
            <li> ,they grow so long they look fake !</li>
            <li> I have short, thin, sparse Asian eyelashes that are absolutely pathetic.</li>
            <li> My husband and I went over journals and pin pointed when i started complaining about being sick, April 3rd.  </li>
            <li> and she said she also hears of unhappy people due to this.  </li>
            <li> Despite the length, the base of the lashes are the only part that got really thick</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a pic with one thin coat of mascara:</li>
            <li> None of my eyelashes have broken.  </li>
            <li> She has not experienced any side effects or eye color changes either.</li>
            <li> it looks like i am wearing false eye lashes.</li>
            <li> My co-workers asked if I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> One day during a meeting a coworker asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve informed Amazon customer service this seller is profiting on false advertisement and a counterfeit product and</li>
            <li> I have people ask me everyday if I have lash extensions or fake lashes!</li>
            <li> I hope this will eventually be less painful.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation and I have sesitive eyes considering I was blind</li>
            <li> First I thought it was the flu than depression, then I just kept journaling, that i was sick, sick sick.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to resist rubbing them.</li>
            <li> it was so embarrassing and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> After 8 weeks I had people asking me if I had fake lashes or extensions.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say 2 of them immediately ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> i was wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> all Li Lash does is make the lashes I have longer, which looks really weird.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> so I think this is just exaggerated.</li>
            <li> My friends have noticed and asked if they were fake or did I have lash extensions and were amazed to learn that they were all mine.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I feel like everytime</li>
            <li> my friends thought i had fake eye lashes on.</li>
            <li> i was thinking about getting those fake eyelash</li>
            <li> .. was kinda scary to try it but thinking to myself</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> One even asked if I was wearing fake lashes when I wore eye liner.  </li>
            <li> Someone even thought I had false lashes placed!</li>
            <li> Who needs false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> and I have seen dramatic differences!</li>
            <li> what eye shadow i wear but i am afraid to use it because i dont want them darker ..  </li>
            <li> I must say that I was very very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> The color of the lids is like a darkish brown bronze it does not look bad</li>
            <li> and it seems not to bad.</li>
            <li> Hate to experiment on a product so expensive!</li>
            <li> I did have some lash growth, but I after I started using it, I began to get sick.</li>
            <li> By the morning of memorial day, I was so sick</li>
            <li> I was really doubtful that this product would deliver what it claims, but I was shocked to discover that after one month my lashes started to curl up...</li>
            <li> its FAKE!!</li>
            <li> So disappointed in Lilash!</li>
            <li> I tried another product because it was cheaper but was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Librow does work, but, it has a horrible side effect.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this product in March and did not notice any changes. I read the information and truth be told, had the itchy eyes, which was bearable, and waited patiently. It took about 3 months before my husband and I saw a difference. They are thicker, longer and look ridiculously long after applying mascara.I even trimmed my eyelashes because there were a couple that were extremely long. I will continue to use this product, once a day to maintain the length. My only hesitation with this product is the cost, but be patient if you do use this product!</li>
            <li> Did not like at all. It dries on your lashes over night in a crusty form. When you wake up in the morning you have to scrape it off your lashes, which made mine soar, and some of them fall out. It needs to be more watery form when going on.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd tube of LiLash. I bought it last year &amp; loved it. I was able to stretch 1 tube for a year. If you stop using it, eventually, your old short lashes regrow. So, I ordered it again and this time in 3 weeks of use my long, lush lashes are back. (and it&#x27;s a bargain on Amazon- best price I found)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LiLash for about 6 weeks now, and there is a big difference in my eyelashes.  They are noticeably longer.  I really like this product. The product did not irritate my eyes at all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Lilash before and the product works.  This one does not.  If I purchase this item again, I will order it directly from the LiLash website.</li>
            <li> Librow does work, but, it has a horrible side effect. One of the ingredients in Librow, the same one that&#x27;s used for treating glaucoma), causes hair to grow under your eyebrows, over your eyebrows, to the side of your eyebrows and even directly under your eyes! I have had to spend hundreds of dollars on electrolysis so user beware.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a eyelash stimulator after extensions left my lash line bald. LiLash had the most positive reviews, so I tried it. I did see my lashes filling in, but then again, they were going to grow anyway. No negative side effects at all. I was/am nervous about the authenticity of the product, I would buy directly from LiLash if I were to reorder.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would really work, but lashes were notably longer and thicker after about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Lilash did work for me and i did no experience any crazy side effecs at all, only a little redness on my eye lid but it went away after a while.I have tried this product last year and after one month and a half my lashes where extremly longer than they were before. I used it at nights only almost everynight for about a month and then every other noght or so.The product lasted me for about 8 months!and i stoped using it after that just because it felt dirty and old.I didn&#x27;t buy it anymore mainly because of the cost. But i reccomand this if you really ewant long LONG lashes</li>
            <li> I first bought Lilash from this site last year to help regrow my eyelashes for my left eye. My eyelash-pulling tendencies are limited to just that eye and only happens when I am very stressed. For that reason, the differences between both eyes are night and day noticeable. First thing I noticed is that Lilash made the lashes feel \\&quot;different.\\&quot; They were thicker, harder to pull or break off, and had such a strange almost plastic-like feeling that I didn&#x27;t like touching them. Believe me, despite those side effects, I was pulling and pulling but those suckers wouldn&#x27;t come out without major pain - not the nice minor pain/rush you usually get when you succeed in snipping off or pulling out a lash. Eventually due to the pain and the odd, un-satisfying feeling of touching the lashes, I gave up. Using mascara (black or clear) never produced those types of effects. After a while, the lashes began to grow. Can&#x27;t tell exactly how long it took but it was a few months. I only intended to use the product to even up my lashes but instead they are now noticeably longer than the right side (I didn&#x27;t apply Lilash on the right side). I just bought another bottle to apply them to the right and provide maintenance doses for the left. Not a bad problem to have. I measured the left lashes a few weeks ago and straightened out they are a little longer than .5 inch. Despite the length, the base of the lashes are the only part that got really thick so they still taper and look thinner near the top. They are darker/thicker than the non-Lilashed side but not to the extent that I expected according to previous reviews here. Also, it doesn&#x27;t grow more lashes, just affects the lashes you already have. Despite applying the product across the top lid once a day at bedtime, the bottom lashes grew too but are not quite as long as the top lashes. For a minute there, I thought I was getting wrinkles but didn&#x27;t understand why it was only with my right eye. Then I discovered that the lashes got so long onthe left, they obscured my normal undereye creases.   Negative side effects: You may notice after a few months that a tiny patch of facial hairs near your eyes have grown longer and darker. I pluck them when they get too long but no one would really notice them unless he/she is an inch away from my face looking through a magnifying glass. A more immediate side effect happened after a few days of applying the product: it made my eyes very itchy. It was difficult to resist rubbing them. Eventually the sensation went away but might come back every now and then if I rub them too hard washing or drying my face. Be careful not to cause extra irritation. If you are an eyelash puller you may get used to the different feel of your lashes and pull anyway or at least pull the tips where your lashes feel more \\&quot;normal.\\&quot; For me, it hurt like heck trying to pull them but your pain tolerance may be higher than mine. However, keep in mind that just pulling on the eyelash makes the lid more irritated. Combining that with Lilash would make my eyes even itchier and slightly painful after those first episodes.   All in all, Lilash a pretty good deterrent - depending on how afflicted you are - and grows your lashes beyond your normal lengths at the same time. Give it a try. Better and less expensive in the long run than being on a prescription drug.  ETA: The picture of Lilash associated with this selling IS NOT what the current Lilash looks like. When the company first sold the product, it was in a small mascara box and contained only .18 oz in each tube. Also on the tube at the upper right corner of the word Lilash there is a large \\&quot;TM\\&quot; for trademark. If you go to the Lilash site you will notice the box is bigger and it comes in a .2 oz tube. The writing on the tube looks a little different. There is no TM but instead has a registered symbol (\\&quot;r\\&quot; with a circle around it) on the bottom right side. If you think you have a counterfeit or were sold the wrong size, send it back to Amazon ASAP. You can also call Lilash to see if you have a counterfeit. For more honest reviews, check out the Truth in Aging blog, Cosmetics Cop website (Paula discusses the \\&quot;eyelash war\\&quot; begun by Latisse when reviewing Jan Marini&#x27;s new version. She also states that the eye pigmentation problem occurs when the active ingredient is applied to the eye, not the lid. If you&#x27;re worried about that, be careful to apply to the lid only.), and Makeup Alley site.</li>
            <li> I bought LiLash on a whim and didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work. I had bought cheaper products that didn&#x27;t and expected this one to be the same. I&#x27;ve been using LiLash for a year, and my eyelashes are FREAKISHLY long, it&#x27;s amazing! I don&#x27;t even wear mascara because the lashes would scrape up against my glasses! I am running out and am planning to by more LiLash soon!  Must BUY!</li>
            <li> Lilash works well, no real issues, some itchiness at first and intermittently,but the thicker longer lashes well worth the itch. Personally, I still use the product with religion, and have beautiful lashes, but I hear if you stop, they fall out and leave you with stubs.</li>
            <li> after 2 days of using Lilash that i purchased directly from Lilash my eyes became swollen and very red and also ichy. I&#x27;m sure everyone thought i had pink eye it was so embarrassing and uncomfortable i have not used again. I have used Revitalash and did not have these reactions but also did not have much results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning for my second tube.  I&#x27;ll make this short, I was very skeptical about this product.  Really didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but thought it was worth a try as I have never had long eyelashes.  After 3 weeks I could already tell a difference, by 6 weeks they were crazy long.  After 8 weeks I had people asking me if I had fake lashes or extensions.  Which was a huge deal because when I say I never had long lashes before I mean you could barely tell I had any.  It was so noticable that when I ran into a few friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while one night and they noticed immediately and it was dark out!!! Needless to say 2 of them immediately ordered this product.  I started my first tube the first of February and can tell it&#x27;s getting low so going to go ahead and reorder now.  It&#x27;s the last of May so I don&#x27;t think a tube will last a full 6 months but 4-5 months, so really thats not bad.  As for changing eye color I wouldn&#x27;t know as I have brown eyes.  I did notice a couple times in the beginning my eyelids feeling a little irritated but nothing I couldn&#x27;t tolerate.  I use this every single night before bed.  The best advise I can give is be patient and apply it religiously every day and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Simply AMAZING.  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician &amp; cosmetologist, I personally found this is the BEST product.  I sell it to a lot of clients and use it myself, I have super long eye lashes to begin with and this just enhances them even more! Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and has different reactions to it, so you just have to be careful.  I have super sensitive skin and have had no bad reactions.  I try to put it on once a day, some days twice and a majority of days I forget, yet I&#x27;m still amazed.  Strongly reccomended!</li>
            <li> Item came really fast when i needed assistance with product the customer service person was promt to help me. Good experience so far.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It really works!!!!! Although i have experienced some itching and a little redness on my eyeshadow but I would buy it again and again. My eyelashes are bigger, blacker and thicker.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works!  It took a while to see real growth (2-3 mo) but once my lashes started growing, the results were amazing.  I was loving my new lashes when I noticed my eyes were drying out (I wear contacts so dry eyes can be very irritating).  At times my left eye would lightly twitch.  I stopped using the product and the dryness and irritation stopped.  In the meantime, I noticed my eyelids were darker and in fact my husband commented on me wearing eye shadow one day when in fact I was not wearing any makeup at all! I haven&#x27;t been off the product long enough to see if my eyelids will return to their normal color or not.  All in all, the product works but not without costs, financial and physical.  I miss the long lashes I had while using this so am looking for other alternatives.</li>
            <li> completely worth it.    my lashes grew triple its size. my brother thought i was wearing mascara...my dad thoguht i was wearing fake lashes. nope. it was NATURAL! i look like i&#x27;ve been wearing make up. &lt;3     through all the troubles...i think its worth it. the red swelling is alot better.     here&#x27;s the break down:    pro:     longer lashes    longer lashes    longer lashes      cons:     red swelling    eye color change (doesnt matter to me cause my eyes are black)    itchy      warning:   DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR BOTTOM EYELID!</li>
            <li> i just received my second tube of lilash in the mail and am happy as a clam.  i&#x27;m still using my first original tube though, which has lasted for almost 6 months so far (well worth the price if you ask me)!  lilash truly works.  i thought my lashes were pretty long originally, but after using lilash, it&#x27;s evident that i was mistaken.  my lashes have gotten obviously longer and people comment on them asking if they&#x27;re extensions!  i wish that lilash made me grow some more lashes so they&#x27;re fuller though.  so far, just length.  i&#x27;ll cross my fingers!</li>
            <li> I bought Li Lash following a lunch with a friend who had finished her courses of  chemo and radio therapy, weeks earlier . She had lost  her long  blonde hair and eyelashes  .   When I arrived at the restaurant, I was greeted by a vibrant woman with a stylish, elfin crop and amazingly long eyelashes - which I naturally assumed were extensions . She was delighted to tell me and our assembled friends that they were real and went on to tell us all about Li Lash.   I placed my order that evening and have used it every night since . At first, my eyes became slightly red and puffy by the morning, but not sore - so I continued. It is only now , over a month and a half later that I&#x27;m seeing the results. Not as spectacular as my friend&#x27;s lashes  - but she always did have better lashes than me - but I am more than happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I had a similar experience to reviewer B. Choi on this site: I initially bought Lilash directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, with dramatically positive results. All my life I have been complimented on my pretty eyes. Sometime in my early 40&#x27;s those compliments trickled off, and one day while applying my makeup I noticed that my lashes had noticeably thinned and faded in color. It was if my eyes had lost their definition. Lilash produced results within 6-8 weeks, without irritation for me. I also found that once my lashes had achieved maximum length and thickness I could apply Lilash 3 times per week and still maintain my results.    Last year for the first time I purchased Lilash from an Amazon seller. The product looked authentic and caused no irritation but as time passed I saw my lashes reverting to their pre-treated state: thinner, finer, lighter in color. This happened over a period of about 2 months. I wondered if perhaps a person develops a tolerance to the active ingredient in Lilash, causing it to stop working. So I called the company and was told what the other reviewer was told: that no one else is authorized to sell the product online and that Lilash bought elsewhere may be expired or even (in the case of auction sites) previously used. And of course, there&#x27;s no money-back guarantee.    I bought some new Lilash from their site and voila, the long dark lashes and the compliments are back. Lilash definitely works, but consider the source when buying.</li>
            <li> I used to use the pre-2008 formulation of Revitalash, which I loved. My lashes were very dense,long and beautiful. In 2008, the formula was changed, and I found it didn&#x27;t work as before. So I tried Li Lash based on the reviews. It works, but not as I had hoped. I naturally have sparse eyelashes, and all Li Lash does is make the lashes I have longer, which looks really weird. Revitalash filled in the sparse areas; I had lashes growing where there were no lashes before. Now I literally have 8-10 moderately long lashes on either eye. It doesn&#x27;t even help to put on volumizing mascara. I guess it is an ok product if you have dense lashes that are just short. Can&#x27;t really recommend, otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was amazed with the results of this product! I tried Latisse for over a month with no noticeable change to my lashes. After reading some reviews, I decided to try Lilash. I was absolutely amazed by how well it works. After a few weeks my lashes are dramatically thicker and longer. Someone even thought I had false lashes placed! There was no irritation to my eyes. I did notice some very slight darkening of my eyelids where I apply the serum, but it hasn&#x27;t been too remarkable. I can&#x27;t comment on the iris changes as I have brown eyes. I am definitely buying this again!</li>
            <li> LiLash is terrific! I have had no problems with irritation or stinging at the time of application. And my lashes-HUGE improvement. I will use LiLash forever!!</li>
            <li> researched this product after a friend told me about it. i had just finished 6 months of chemotherapy and had lost my eyebrows and eyelashes i was  fed up with looking in the mirror every day to check out if my eyelashes were coming back. i ordered lilash i was sceptic and also the price tag was high. the product arrived in a week i used it straight away within two weeks my lashes were growing back stubs at first, now 6 weeks on i have a set of gorgeous lashes thicker and longer than i had before. ive had no side effects and no irritation.. well worth the money ..every girl or boy should have this item in their bag..i</li>
            <li> This product is great. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. You get longer lashes and after using it for awhile, you can let more days pass before having to use it again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  Ive never used anything like this but just thought I would give it a shot after seeing the Latisse commercials.  After three months I have noticed a huge difference in length.  I went on girls weekend and one friend asked if I was wearing fake eyelashes and another commented on seeing something different on me but didnt know what it was.  It was my eyelashes.  They havent thickened but they are definitely longer.  They now rub up against my sunglasses when I blink.  They are very long.  My friend was so excited about the results on me she bought the product herself the following Monday.  She hasnt noticed a difference in three weeks but I told her to be patient.  It just seemed by month two all of the sudden my eyelashes were very long.  I would definitely recommend this.  I havent had the irritation some people have had.  I may get an itch a couple times a day but that is all Ive had. And btw, I started using this the beginning of July 2010 using it every day, I still have some left.</li>
            <li> I have been using LiLash for about one month and I can really tell a difference in my eyelashes.  They are longer for sure but also thicker.  The product was a little irritating at first so I only used it every other night for the first week and now it is fine. Good Stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Lilash for years. My eyelashes have stayed long. Once they got to where I wanted them I just used it a couple times a week. Don&#x27;t ever want to go back to short lashes. No problems to report.</li>
            <li> LiLash is amazing! My estetician recommended LiLash. I must say that I was very very skeptical. There are so many beauty products out there that offer incredible results and they dissapoint every time. My eye lashes were short and light but after using LiLash for 3 weeks I started to notice that my eyelashes were getting longer! I told all my friends about LiLash.</li>
            <li> I expected great things from Lilash since a colleague of mine has been using it and has crazy long lashes now.  My lashes are medium to slightly long and look pretty decent with mascara on but are thin and not very dark.  Since my lashes aren&#x27;t very short to begin with I thought they would respond quickly and do well and they haven&#x27;t.  I had eye twitching in my left eye for about 2 weeks.  That went away, but my usually dry eyes have been much dryer and much more red.  It&#x27;s now 8, yes, EIGHT weeks and I have seen no change at all!  I mean are you kidding me??  My hair grows kinda slow so I thought, maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s taking so long but I just don&#x27;t think anything is going to happen for me except more dry, red eyes!  I want to finish the tube b/c it cost so much and to see if by chance something happens at the 3 month mark but I know it won&#x27;t so why suffer? I tried Ardell briefly before trying Lilash and saw some improvement in a week but not much difference after that.  So, I started in on Lilash with bigger hopes. Now, I&#x27;ll probably go back to Ardell and after my eyes feel better and my wallet recovers, I&#x27;ll try Rapidlash. I probably got a fake knock-off like some other reviewers suspected.  They had very good results with their first tubes but their second ones (ordered from Amazon) didn&#x27;t do anything and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the same as the original either :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, and it is far superior to Revitalash. I only use it every other day, so the tube lasts for 6 months, making it not very expensive. I don&#x27;t get irritation unless i put on too much, and I have very sensitive eyes. The most important thing is to not do the \\&quot;some is good, more is better\\&quot; thing with this product. It isn&#x27;t!    My stubby little eyelashes are twice as long as they used to be, and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but I did see improvement in my eyelash length when I started the product. I did not experience any discomfort at all. Just a little extra \\&quot;eye crud\\&quot; in the am after I woke up. Nothing that washing with warm water did not cure.</li>
            <li> I researched the differences between LiLash and Latisse before purchasing Latisse. I chose LiLash because it seemed to have less side effects than Latisse and did not require an online prescription. I am Asian and my lashes grow straight with no curl to them and my bottom lashes were straight and very short. I have been using it twice a day and apply it to the top and bottom lashes, reversing each application the direction that I apply it. I use very little and also wipe the excess off before putting it on.  Prior to using LiLash, my lashes were almost not even visible on the top unless I curled them and put on mascara. After four days of using Lilash, I could see some growth. I&#x27;m two weeks in and my bottom lashes have almost doubled in length and my top lashes have at least doubled and are starting to actually curl.  I noticed some slight discomfort the first two days, it felt like pressure on my eyes and also some crusting in the morning. Those side effects went away after the first week and have not returned. I am absolutely in LOVE with this product and have already purchased another tube because I&#x27;ve heard that latisse is going to sue LiLash because they use similar formulas and I love it so much that I want to go ahead and purchase a years worth. I know that everyone&#x27;s experience is different, mine has been tremendous.</li>
            <li> YOU WONT SEE RESULTS IN A WEEK OR TWO OR THREE. IT TAKES AT LEAST ONE MONTH BUT- -- THE RESULTS ARE PHENOMENAL! I AM 19 SO I ORIGINALLY HAVE PRETTY THICK LASHES . THIS EYELASH SIMULATOR TOOK MY NATURAL LASHES AND MADE THEM LOOK FAKE! THEY WERE SO THICK AND LONG . I DON&#x27;T EVEN NEED MASCARA!</li>
            <li> I started using Lilash (bought from a medspa, not Amazon) in late August.  I apply it regurlarly in the morning after I wash my face, before makeup (it goes on clear).  My lashes have always been average at best and are now touching my eyebrows, they&#x27;re so long.  I had to change my mascara so that when darkened, thickened, they would not be too obnoxious.  Side effects? - some minor itching at first (nothing like when I have an allergic itching in the eyes), maybe some darkening (sort of looks like plum color eyeliner), but nothing bothersome at all.  I have blue eyes and have not had any color changes.  Per my experience, I&#x27;d highly recommend, I feel so special to have such gorgeous eye lashes, what I&#x27;d always admired in other girls I&#x27;d seen!</li>
            <li> This product worked as described for me! I got my LiLash on Amazon in a window of time when it was listed for $70. I am not sure I would have forked out the full price for it, but the $70 lured me in.     I am 45 and I had few-to-average lashes to start. They looked ok/average with mascara.  I took pics 1 week into product use. Here are the results after 11 weeks: [...]  Here&#x27;s a pic with one thin coat of mascara: [...]     There is definitely lengthening. I noticed that I rarely see lashes fall out - even when removing makeup. There is thickening because there are more lashes. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because the hairs are thicker. I did hope for more thickness in the individual hairs, but I am not disappointed with the results at all.     Curl. I don&#x27;t know how to review this, because I think it&#x27;s just my lashes, but one eye has curlier lashes than the other! This is easily fixed with a curler. ;) The outer lashes on both eyes are curlier than the rest of my lashes.     Only con: I definitely have increased redness on my lids. I have pink lids anyway so I think this is just exaggerated. Over time I have less irritation and itchiness, but the redness remains. It&#x27;s an acceptable trade-off for me.    I am about to vacation in mexico, so I dyed my long lashes and am glad to not feel like I have to rely on waterproof mascara every day.    So now I am looking at buying the second bottle, and that $120 price tag is looming. Amazon has RapidLash on sale for $26 and it has great reviews too. I figure it&#x27;s worth a try, if it&#x27;s not as good, I&#x27;ll definitely fork out the $120 and feel good about it.    Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and what I really wanted to share was why it is best for people with sensitive eyes to only apply this product at night. I have very fair complexion and blonde thin eyelashes. I also have very sensitive eyes and this product caused them to be itchy and irritated and bloodshot throughout the day. But last week I switched to applying the product at night instead of in the morning and the problem has gone away!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend anyone with sensitve eyes to ONLY apply it at night, otherwise deal with itchy bloodshot eyes which is much more distracting than having long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Follow up ** I&#x27;ve been using the product for two months now and I have seen dramatic differences! I bartend and I have strangers comment on my eyelashes all the time.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 6 months.  It took approximately 3 months to see dramatic changes with daily use.  The good news is I did see significant changes.  I saw small changes (less lash loss) within a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes had been falling out at an alarming speed.  I have PCOS so I have issues with hair loss and I think the same mechanism that was/is causing my hair loss was causing my lash loss.  I very rarely wear any sort of eye makeup due to allergies and I try not to rub my eyes because I know this can also cause lash loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tube ran out (about 5-6 months with almost daily use), my eyelashes were darker and longer.  They did not become as thick as I hoped, but I received multiple compliments on my eyelashes even when I was not wearing mascara (which again, was/is rare for me to wear any).  My results were not dramatic enough to substitute for mascara because my eyelashes weren&#x27;t/aren&#x27;t super thick, but I am no longer losing eye lashes at the rate they were falling out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any iris pigment changes.  I did, however, have constant moderate irritation and reddening of the eyelids where I applied the product the entire time I used it.  This is most likely because my eyes are annoyingly sensitive.  It was worth the irritation for the final results though.  My eye lashes have yet to revert back their prior, falling out stage and I haven&#x27;t used LiLash for almost 2 months now.</li>
            <li> This product works, I have been using it for almost a year now.  It took about a month to see fantastic results. Now I only use the product about 4 times a week and I am sure that I could back off using it even that much.  Okay, yes you may get a slight pink line where you are putting the product but it gets covered with makeup and my eyelashes look so long and people have commented on how long my eyelashes are.  I will continue using this product and will continue to tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using lilash for about a month now...and I have longer and fuller lashes.  For the first two weeks I was using it...I had some irritation, my eyelids became very itchy sometimes...but this stopped after two weeks and then about 3 weeks i started seeing results.  i love this product.  I really see a difference.  I am asian and I have little to no lashes at all...but thanks to this product...i actually have long lashes!  when i put mascara it looks like i am wearing false eye lashes. I really recommend using this if you want longer fuller eye lashes</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.COM!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya&#x27;ll there is a REASON why this is so cheap on this website. You pay for what you get. Yes, the price is hefty on the LiLash official website, BUT you are buying the real deal!!! If you look on the bottom of the bottle from the Cosmetic Alchemy website(the official LiLash website)it says made by Cosmetic Alchemy. If you look on the bottom of the bottle from amazon.com, it says Cosmetic Pros. SO...its FAKE!!!!! DON&#x27;T BUY from this site!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So disappointed in Lilash! Used it for a year with amazing results, now it barely maintains only a slight improvement in the length, thickness and dark color of my lashes. Have reverted back to curling eyelashes and wearing a 2nd coat of mascara.  Rats.  Wondered if the product formulation changed or if my lashes built up a resistance to the product? Guess I&#x27;ll find another product... Hate to experiment on a product so expensive!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 2 yrs ago and I love it, if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey I&#x27;d try their LiBrow product too!!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 one for me and one for my mother after a few days we both had to quit using it because our eyes would barely open from the welling and rash.</li>
            <li> Love this product  have used it for years  amazon has great price for it. AMAZON SHIPS FAST.  mY EYELASHES GREW TWICE AS LONG</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but after several weeks of use li&#x27;lash has made my lashes thicker, darker, and longer. I have experienced no side effects, and will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been using Li-Lash for 3 weeks now &amp; it&#x27;s no joke!!  I will continue to purchase Li-Lash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holla,&lt;br /&gt;Lovely Lady</li>
            <li> I love the results! Makes lashes long again. I didn&#x27;t think I would ever see my lashes look lush again after menopause.</li>
            <li> I looooove Lilash! I&#x27;ve been a user for about 2 years &amp; I constantly receive compliments about my amazingly loooooong eye lashes. My friends joke that pretty soon I&#x27;ll be able to fly with these babies! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product to anyone wanting to grow their eyelashes to their fullest potential. Turns out my potential is extremely good! ;)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have tried LiLash.  The first time it worked well but after reading a review on another product I tried that after my tube of LiLash was gone.  Mistake!!  LiLash definitely is the best eyelash stimulator for me.  Really works I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product.  At first, I had some itching on my eyelids but no longer.  No swelling, no side effects.  Just started no results yet.  A friend of mine uses this product and her eyelashes are beautiful.  She is very blue eyes and has had no change in color.  I think it is very important to apply the product carefully and not allow any of the product to get into your eye to avoid color change side effects.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love my lashes after lilash. And it came really fast in the mail. It takes a while for the results to show about 1 month, but I am so happy now. I ran out of lilash a while ago but the results have lasted for months. I even used it to grow my eyebrows back. It took a little longer on the eyebrows to grow in about 2 months. The whole tube lasted me 5 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  It is cheaper here on Amazon then on their site also.  It lasts me up to a year and my lashes do grow.  They even get to the point of touching my eyebrows after about 5 months of use.  I only wear mascara for make up so I say my lashes should make a statement and this product does just that!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 8 weeks everyday sometimes twice a day and I definitely noticed my eyelashes seemed fuller within the first week of using it. After the 8 weeks I did not notice much improvement in length. I got a free sample of latisse from my doctor and used it three times and noticed a huge improvement in the length only after 3 uses!</li>
            <li> 45 yrs old. Got Lilash for myself for bday. Own lashes not long, pale, kind of sparse. After 2 months using Lilash [which is SO easy], saw definite added length and darkness.  Now 3 months of use:  Lashes, with one coat of mascara, reach my eyebrows! Love them. The new growth is clearly darker.  Length is ridiculously, wonderfully long.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much of change in thickness/number of lashes, but no complaints.  I get tons of compliments on my lashes now.  Never did before.  Have recommended to friends. Recommend Lilash to everyone reading this.  No eye irritation. No burning. No side effects.  Just quickly-grown longer lashes and darkening. Still have 2 months to go to reach maximum results.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what that is! LOVE Lilash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE March 28, 2012 -- 15 months later ** Still LOVE LiLash!  My lashes grew longer &amp; darker &amp; a bit thicker [as in more of them], and I am thrilled.  After about 6 months of initial use, I stopped using every day &amp; went to a \\&quot;Maintenance\\&quot; use -- just 2 or 3 times a week.  That was 8 or 9 months ago, and my lashes are still long, dark, lovely.  SOOOO not what I am used to!  My 16 yr old daughter and my 4 yr old daughter tell me often \\&quot;I LOVE your lashes!\\&quot;  My 16yr old can&#x27;t wait until I let her use it [waiting until she is 17 or 18].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial bottle of LiLash lasted over a year.  I just purchased my 2nd bottle.  WORTH the price if you want lovely, long, dark lashes.  I never experienced irritation, just obvious results. :-D YAY!</li>
            <li> I havent noticed anything yet. I have been using it since the day I bought it and I havent noticed any&lt;br /&gt;growth in my lashes yet.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but now I am not.  I tried another product because it was cheaper but was very disappointed so I went back to LiLash. It really does work.  My lashes are now much longer.  My friends have noticed and asked if they were fake or did I have lash extensions and were amazed to learn that they were all mine.  I love this product because it does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Works great my lashes are thicker and fuller however, there are some side effects worth noting.  After using it, my eyelids get red and the skin begins to peel, making my eyelid sting when putting on liquid eyeliner.  Lilash also caused me to produce more eyelashes above my natural eyelash line so its a little harder to put on eyeliner evenly because the extra stray eyelash hairs would get in the way.  For some reason my left eyelashes are thicker and longer then my right eyelashes.  I have used Latisse prior and did not experience any of these problems I have with Lilash.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0039YQ7WY LiLash Purified Eyelash Stimulator (5.32ml), 0.18-Fluid Ounces]]  I bought this product from Amazon because there was a place on my left eye where the lashes were totally gone and it actually look bald in that area.  After researching all the products, I decided on LiLash.  The prescription product, Latise, said that when you stopped using it, your lashses would return to their previous state.  That didn&#x27;t sound good to me.  I saw no such claim about LiLash (although I&#x27;m still using it).  I&#x27;ve been using it every night as the instructions said for about 1 month.  My lashes are now lush, darker, longer, and the bald spot is filled in.  There are no side effects such as burning, itching, etc., although I am noticing that the skin right above the lashes is a bit darker -- not a big deal to me.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone having issues with their lashes.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product and noticed right away the packaging was wrong. I had bought this product in the past(not on-line) and saved the packaging. The real thing is labled serum not stimulator also there are mispelled words on the packaging. The package is also wraped in plastic with a sticker on it. The real package has no plastic or stickers and worth the $80.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I love LiLash and have been using it for about a year now.  I usually buy from my local beauty salon, but I saw it on Amazon for a great savings and figured I&#x27;d buy here.  First, the package I received looked a bit different than what I usually get at the salon.  Then, when I used it, my eyelids burned.  I contacted the manufacturer and found out that there are no authorized resellers on Amazon or on eBay!  It turns out that there are a ton of people selling counterfeit LiLash on the internet and the manufacturer now has a program where you can get 50% off of LiLash purchased through their website if you return your online purchase!!  Just go to lilash.com and click on the button at the bottom that says \\&quot;Fight Back Against Counterfeits\\&quot;.  They&#x27;ve made it really easy to get 50% off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and have definitely noticed a HUGE difference in my eyelashes.  Fuller and longer.  I now use it only once a week, but definitely put it on 4-5 times a week for the first 6 weeks.  One bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love LiLash.  I will never go without this item again.  I had a visible difference in my lashes in 1½ weeks.  I had no eye irritaion, redness, itch or burning sensation.  Had no problems at all with with product and it works!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several tubes of this product over the past couple of years, with no problem with the product. I ordered another tube in 2011, and now I get a sensitive, puffy red eyelid on my left eye when I use it. I know it&#x27;s this new tube, as I have also used one of my older tubes (the tubes last a long time) on different weeks, without the same puffy results. I have read others with the same review, and I concur! Too bad. And for over $100.00 which I can&#x27;t get a refund for since Amazon only refunds within 30 days of purchase, I am stuck with the loss. Boooooo!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about three months ago.  I used it twice a day, and after about three weeks I noticed a difference.  I could tell my lashes were a bit longer.  Now after three months my lashes are really long and fuller too!  I can&#x27;t tell you how much better my lashes look.  I am about to order my second vial.  I don&#x27;t want to be without Lilash now.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works and it arrived in a timely manner. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow seemed hopeless after so many years of overplucking...within one month this product completely improved my eyebrows and has made them twice as thick...and they are still growing. I was skeptical about this product at first, but I am glad I gave it a shot. Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Lilash after using several eyelash stimulating products that delievered very little--if any--results. In the beginning, I did experience some minor itching on the application sites but this discomfort diminshed after regular use. I must admit, after using the product for 3 weeks, I started to see some amazing results--longer and fuller lashes. However, about  after 1 month, I started to experience this massive shedding of my lashes on both eyes.  I would wake up to find several lashes on my pillow or a few on my check. I was/am really disappointed as I was expecting the results to last longer--considering the amount that I spent for this product.  I´m now left with shorter, very sparse lashes and with less volume than before. Overall, I think that all these eyelash growth/enhancing/stimulating serums are not formulated to deliever long-term results.  I wouldn´t recommend this product if you´re expecting/wanting long term effects. I definitely am not going to buy this product again!!!</li>
            <li> This eyelash stimulator works like a dream. Just follow the directions and you will have fuller, longer, curlier eyelashes. You should start noticing changes after about 6 weeks and then at l2 weeks you will be amazed. I never put mascara on. I actually had to trim my lashes because they touch my sunglasses!!!</li>
            <li> I used Lilash when it was only $60 last year and it did work.I got some puffy eye but it went away after a couple days of not using. Now they doubled the price and its just NOT worth it. Latisse, the main brand, cost the same and it comes with disposable applicator to avoid contamination and irritation. Whats the point of risking your eye with something not FDA approved that will irritate you if you aren&#x27;t saving money?</li>
            <li> After using Revitalash for about 2 years I felt as if my lashes were getting use to the product already. I read great reviews of LiLash and how it doesn&#x27;t sting like others. Unfortunately, I feel like everytime I wake up in the morning, my whole eyelid is red and itchy. I was only using it 3 times a week, but had to stop an entire week. I hope this will eventually be less painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lilash for three months.  I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first two or three weeks, but now my lashes are amazingly long.  I&#x27;ve stopped wearing mascara much of the time because now I don&#x27;t really need the extra definition to my eyes.  This is great, because I find makeup kind of a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few days, my eyes were a little bit itchy and irritated, but that went away.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin or eye color changes, but my eyes are brown anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big five stars for this product.</li>
            <li> I was really doubtful that this product would deliver what it claims, but I was shocked to discover that after one month my lashes started to curl up...Me with \\&quot;curled up\\&quot; lashes?!!Really? Still cannot believe it, but it is true. Easy to apply and personally I experienced no discomfort or skin color changes.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> This Lilash is the best product on the market for stimulating eyelash growth and thickness.  It is amazing and I have see results like never before.  This product works.  My eyelashes are twice as long and thick.  Who needs false eyelashes!  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does....  longer lashes.... now that my lashes are longer than ever before I use the product once a week to maintain it, so I am pleased. I know there are cheaper products out there, but as I already KNOW that this one works I don&#x27;t bother to change and experiment with cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.   I have tried a few others since then and they do work...This is a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> This has multiplied my natural lash length by literally five times since a year ago. It is truly amazing. I want to try the LiBrow next.</li>
            <li> I have heard from so many people that buy lilash on amazon and were disappointed that it didnt work as well as the lilash from the lilash website.  I talked with Gail at Lilash and she said she also hears of unhappy people due to this.  No one is authorized to sell lilash on amazon or ebay.  Lilash is offering a huge sale this Sat-Tues on their website for just $99 per tube.  I will be waiting and buying there : )</li>
            <li> So I typically am not the type of person to write a review, and I am a regular girl with have no incentive to write a good or bad review, either way. I am giving this product a great review though. I never had super short lashes or anything, normal length I guess, but really wanted super long lashes. This product works. After about 5-7 weeks, my friends ( ALL OF MY FRIENDS) started asking me if I curl my lashes, and what kind of mascara I am using, and if I have fake lashes on. My lashes REALLY grew, and started curling up on their own, whereas before I have always had to use a curling iron. I haven&#x27;t used a curling iron in over a year. 2 tubes of LiLash lasted me a year. My lashes now look like doll&#x27;s lashes. I have blue eyes, so I was concerned about color change - no color change at all.   My boyfriend constantly comments on them. Girls are jealous. Seriously.     Cons: only one. During the first 6 of months of use or so I have had the lash line ( where you apply LiLash) be a little more pink and slightly itchy. As long as I didn&#x27;t itch it - I would be fine. When I itched my eye, it would swell up a bit. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because of the increased blood flow to the area to stimulate growth, and the chemicals in the product. That&#x27;s all. Now, a year after using this no more redness and sensitivity, back to normal.   Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now.  It wasn&#x27;t &#x27;til like the 3rd or 4th, maybe even 5th month where I started noticing anything.  I thought for sure I wasted tons and tons of money on it.  So, here&#x27;s the pros and cons.  Pros:  -It works  -It made my eyelashes longer  -It&#x27;s easy to apply  Cons:  -It seems to somehow go into a stage every once in awhile, where it looks like my eyelashes are getting shorter, and it stays like that for a good week even if I&#x27;ve been applying it daily.  -I notice my eyes get irritated and red easily whilst taking it.  It works all and all, just takes a long time.  Sometimes it has it&#x27;s moments.  The only thing that worries me is once I stop using it, I feel like I&#x27;ll really HATE my eyelashes when they&#x27;re back to normal because I&#x27;ll FEEL as if they got super super short, when they&#x27;ll probably just be the same length they were before I started using this, but in my mind, I&#x27;ll think they got worse. Ya know?  So, I&#x27;m really scared of that part haha.  I just wish they would come out with something that&#x27;s permanent, and that you only need to do once every year or couple of years.  My eyelashes look long without mascara, but especially with mascara, they LOOK ridiculously FAKE....it&#x27;s crazy, I love it, but too bad I&#x27;m into the whole \\&quot;natural beauty,\\&quot; thing so I don&#x27;t wear mascara often.</li>
            <li> Easy application.  No Irritation in my case.  Definitely made lashes longer - just be patient.  Have been using this product for a year now.</li>
            <li> I did not received LiLash.  I received a product called Eyelash - MD  Lashipix.  I have used LiLash before and it works well for me.  The Lashipix did not work at all.  I feel that I have been duped and and have lost $139.00+ because of this site.  I would like to be refunded and I will send the product back if I had an address.  Patty Chandler</li>
            <li> I purchased LiLash after a friend had amazing results. I LOVE IT!!! I have people ask me everyday if I have lash extensions or fake lashes! It took about 3-4 weeks to start seeing results, but by the 6th week.....look out! I&#x27;ve purchased LiLash for my mom and my aunt because they couldn&#x27;t believe how long my lashes have gotten. I recently had my lashes tinted black so I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara!!! BUY THIS NOW....YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I saw a big increase in the length of my eyelashes after about a month&#x27;s use once daily.  I have brown eyes, so was not concerned about the potential for color change.  I have experienced a slight darkening of the eyelid just above the eyelash line and a bit of irritation.  But, the one positive \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; was that my heretofore crepey eyelids are more \\&quot;awake\\&quot; (ie, not so crepey); perhaps it is due to some slight swelling from the irritation, but I love the result!  Hopefully it won&#x27;t go away over time!!</li>
            <li> LiLash has definitely made a noticeable change in my eyelashes. My eyelashes are significantly longer and I receive compliments all of the time. The product has not worked to make them thicker, only longer. You must use it everyday for the best results. I also tried Revitalash and saw no results. I think you should experiment with a few choices to find the best fit for you.   Has anyone stopped using LiLash completely and had any effects (ie eyelashes falling out)?</li>
            <li> I purchased LiLash from a local salon last year because the eyelash extensions just weren&#x27;t working for me (always coming off).  So I decided to make this splurge as one last effort to help my eyelashes in any way.  I have very short thin lashes (you can&#x27;t see anything when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara) and I used LiLash faithfully.  For about the first 3 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was seeing a difference.  But by about 4 or 5 weeks into it....holy cow!  I could see it really was working!!  They got so long I felt like I had extensions on.  And my eyelashes actually hit my sunglasses for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself goes, it DEFINITELY works!!  I have never purchased it from Amazon though so I&#x27;m going to now to see if it works the same.  I&#x27;ll add to my review after trying it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a week now and I have already noticed a diff. I had long lashes to begin with but I like the dramatic look and decided to try this to see if it would help my natural lashes grow even longer. I have not experienced any irritation and I have sesitive eyes considering I was blind (only seeing light) for a years due to a rare condition but even my eye dr said this would be safe to use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product as all my friends were raving about it saying it was as good as the perscription kind but cheaper. So I ordered and have been using it for 5 1/2 weeks and do not see any growth. My eyelashes do look darker but that is all. I noticed my product said \\&quot;stimulator\\&quot; and my friends product said \\&quot;serum\\&quot; so maybe I got the wrong kind. I am not all impressed with this product, or maybe the person sent me a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; as I did order through a private dealer.</li>
            <li> I know this product works as my sister uses it and she now has amazing eyelashes. I had to stop using it after about a week as my eyes became very itchy and red. It was not worth it to me, to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is  such a great product. I have hazel eyes and it has not effected the \\&quot;green tone\\&quot; that I have. As a matter of fact, it has brought MORE attention to my almond shaped eyes and made them POP with the longer lashes. I have had very little irritation (just a dry feeling when I wake up in the AM)and nothing else. It took about 4 weeks to REALLY see a thickening in my lashes and now at 5 weeks they are beginning to look longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;Do not think about it. Just get this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I had really short stubby lashes all my life ..so i read about LiLash and decided to give it a try it took about 2 Months before i really noticed they got long i was really liking what i saw and when i wore mascara my friends thought i had fake eye lashes on. i used 2 tubes already  and stopped using it about 7 months ago . The only problem is it made my eye lids much darker people think i have eye shadow on . The color of the lids is like a darkish brown bronze it does not look bad and i get asked all th time what eye shadow i wear but i am afraid to use it because i dont want them darker ..  i am a caramel complextion  so really dark eye lids I DONT THINK SO ..so im updating 7 months later and my lashes aren&#x27;t as long as they were when i was using the product. Never went back to the way they used to be thank god but not as long as they were when i was using the product . Hope my review is helpful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT LILASH FOR MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S WEDDING TWO YRS AGO. AS DID SHE.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS I COULD TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE. ONE TUBE LASTS FOREVER!  WHEN MY SUPPLY RAN OUT, I JUST FORGOT ABOUT IT. BUT, NOW MY LASHES ARE SHORT AND STUBBY AGAIN, SO BACK TO LILASH I GO. I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT AGAIN! MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S EYELASHES WERE SPECTACULAR (MUCH YOUNGER YOU KNOW) BUT I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS, AND NO PRESCIPTION NEEDED JUST MAKES IT BETTER.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all these good reviews.  I received this product as a gift for Christmas and have used it faithfully since.  It has been two months and I do not see any results at all.  I was not negatively affected by the product, such as itching, burning, etc.  All I saw was \\&quot;nothing.\\&quot;  No results at all!  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old.  I could count the number of lashes I had.  I had been thinking about purchasing such a product for some time, but I was worried about spending my money on a product that may not work.  I was also worried about the risks involved in using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to wrap my arms around the notion of \\&quot;aging gracefully.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not yet.  I am going to kick and scream all the way.  So, I purchased this product.  After 20-25 days of use according to the simple directions, I saw lashes, many lashes, I could not believe the lashes I had!!!  And they are growing as if I use an eyelash curler, which I do not.  And the product did not burn nor irritate my sensitive eyes.  It was so easy to apply, which is just once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond thrilled and happy.  I look good with or without eyemake up.  I am so pleased.  According to the instructions, once you have the density of lashes you want, you just have to apply the product 3 or 4x a week, rather than once daily.  I still am surprised that this product works so well especially at my age.  My husband noticed too, and that is saying something.  I recommend this product highly, even to those who are aging gracefully!  Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  The downside is that once you stop using the product, your lashes will diminish accordingly.  The product lasts for six months, so I intend repurchase this product to keep the results I have.  One risk is also that if you have blue eyes, they may turn to brown.  I have had blue eyes for 65 years.  I won&#x27;t mind a change.</li>
            <li> I was at my salon and was not in the market for any type of eyelash products.  They had a display on the counter and when I was checking out I inquired about it.  The receptionist said the owner of the salon tried this product on one eye to see if it works.  I was told there was a noticeable difference within three weeks of only using it one time a day.  I have been going to this salon for about eight years now and the owner of this salon would never sell a product she did not believe in.  I am currently trying it and will write more in a couple weeks. I have had no side effects so far.  [[ASIN:B0039YQ7WY LiLash Purified Eyelash Stimulator (5.91 ml), 0.20-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review until I finished the whole tube - which took close to 8 months!  That is absolutely worth the price I think.  But I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Definite and really great growth to my eyelashes on my upper lids.  I would say I started to notice a huge improvement in the length within 3-4 weeks of using it every night as directed.  My eyelashes were absolutely 50% longer.  I got constant compliments on how long they were, with my eyes open they would touch my eyebrows.  After a few months of use, I dropped it down to using it every few days instead of every night just so they didn&#x27;t get out of control long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The skin on my upper eyelids darkened noticeably, even my boyfriend commented.  A dark line shows where I put the Lilash, and then above it my lids are stained almost into my brow bone.  Concealer covers it easily, but still without makeup it is not attractive.  I can&#x27;t be sure, but my hazel eye color seems to have darkened as well sadly.  They appear less green and more brown.  I hope that fades as I stop using it !!!  Last but not least, my lashes themselves grew longer but not fuller.  No new growth in other words.  It just makes what you have grow longer faster.  So if you have thin lashes like I do, then you have thin super long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product does exactly what it says.  I just think there are other options to try out there that do not cause the side effects I experienced, so I&#x27;m going to try those.</li>
            <li> I bought and used Lilash for about 2 months. I did have some lash growth, but I after I started using it, I began to get sick. First I thought it was the flu than depression, then I just kept journaling, that i was sick, sick sick.  By the morning of memorial day, I was so sick I couldnt get out of bed.  I hurt every where. My husband and I went over journals and pin pointed when i started complaining about being sick, April 3rd.  and the only thing to change in March, was I started using Lilash on March 20th to be exact.  I went to the dr. He did some blood tests, sure it was something else. They all came back clean. Its been 12 days since I used Lilash.  I feel much better. Ive got that poison out of my system. Im still not 100%. But I am getting better and better everyday.  Ive learned a few things, Like always check the ingredients on a product, if you cannot find them DONT USE IT.  If an ingredient has more letters in it than the alphabet, DONT USE IT. If and item has not been approved by the FDA, DO NOT PUT IT ON YOU OR IN YOU. DONT BE SO CHEAP, and DONT BE SO VAIN,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say now use this product at your own risk. I have not found where anyone has had side effects as side s mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keri Wold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I&#x27;m so impressed with the results of this serum. I too noticed a difference in 1.5 weeks of using the product and now my lashes are so long I use it only once a week. I have dark blonde lashes so at first I didn&#x27;t notice , but once I put on the mascara it was \\&quot;POW\\&quot;.  I use the maybelline colossal lash (in the yellow tube) and I have lashes for days. I don&#x27;t know how I will do with out it. My girflriend pays big money to get lash extensions and upkeep. Some side effects: Your eyes will seem irritated at first... but it goes away. It does sometimes turn a little dark in the lid closest to the lash but it also goes away.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product but stopped because I developed dark brown circles under my eyes.  I have heard that others also experience this.  Luckily I bought it through a vendor that would take it back.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product over a year ago, it worked great!  The second time I got it a month ago it is not so good...they must have changed the ingredients...I am switching to another product...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in mid-November after an acquaintance raved about it.  Well..I have used it now for a month and do not see one bit of difference in the length or fullness of my lashes.  I should have saved my money and gone for the FDA approved Latisse.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product, however I will continue to use it until it is gone.  If I start to see any changes I will post again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews, biting my hand, I paid the $100 for 1 tube (before I used Rapid Lash with good results). It took 2 months before I noticed anything at all, I was kicking myself thinking I should have stayed with Rapid Lash but then BAM!! they took off. Now I do have nice long lashes and dare I say, when I don&#x27;t wear mascara, my eyes look like I have nice curled lashes. I&#x27;m now a total lash whore, I use 2 different mascaras to make them look longer! I do love the lashes and I don&#x27;t think I can go back to minimal lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take away 1 star for price and length of time it took to actually see results. and one little nasty side effect I&#x27;ve noticed, on the outside corners of my eyes, I&#x27;ve noticed a nice new growth of fine hair on my upper cheek.... its not very noticiable yet, but it must be after I apply the serum at night, some of it must run to the outside corners of my eyes.. don&#x27;t know if this is happening to anyone else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for about 4 weeks, and so far, I can&#x27;t see any difference.  I&#x27;ll stick with it, but so far, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> The item really works great.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  I would recommend it to others and will purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems here. Product works great and such an awesome price. I have been using for 4 weeks now and can already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second bottle of LiLash, I can not wait to get it!  I have received so many compliments on my lashes since I started using it.  I will buy at least 4 times a year.  I have had no side effects.  I have light green eyes and they stayed that way after an entire bottle of lilash.</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on religiously everyday for a couple of weeks according to the instructions and nothing so far.  However, in all fairness, I think it is too early to tell.  I&#x27;ll use it all up and hope for the best. I used Latisse for over a month with no results.</li>
            <li> Lilash is one of the few over the counter lash growth formula that really works!  I read all reviews and info I found regarding the active ingredient in this product.  I am hoping they will not remove it as some other over the counter formulas were forced to do.  Best of all, I got a terrific price from !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LiLash for about 8 months now and the 1st (2) tubes I purchased from Lilash directly worked wonders. My short eyelashes became long and thick in a matter of 6 weeks. I saw that Amazon was selling them so I purchased 1 for 1/2 the price a few months ago.     My eyelashes are now revertting back to their original length. At first I thought it was just the normal eyelash growth cycle but it&#x27;s been about 2 months and my eyelashes are not enhanced anymore.     LiLash works...but I would be cautious about purchasing from this site.    Note: I contacted Lilash reps b/c I wanted to know why the product stopped working and they said, \\&quot;We do not sell on Amazon or eBay and nor do any of our authorized resellers.  Many of the ecommerce sellers are selling either expired or counterfeit product.  When you purchase from us you get a 90-day money back guarantee.\\&quot;    BE AWARE!</li>
            <li> Yes, I said it ... It really works! I was skeptical about this product when I first bought it.   After reading all the reviews, I thought it was worth a try. Although I have not heard of the product, i thought it was worth a try given it had better reviews than other more well known brands.  After about 2 weeks, I thought I noticed a difference but was not sure.  I had taken photos of my lashes before I started, then again at 2 weeks.  The photo were inconclusive.  I was optimistic, and continued to try the product.  After the 4th or 5th week I noticed a huge difference. I was really busy over these two weeks, so I didn&#x27;t have very much time to stare at my lashes and critique them nightly (I&#x27;m kind of joking, but not really). I for sure knew there was a difference because lashes that were almost nonexistent were now more than double in length. Given the length of my lashes before, double was not extremely long, but there was a huge difference.  After the 6th and 7th week I noticed a big difference in almost all of my lashes, and a natural curl began in the outer lashes.  Since this time, I have not worn Li lash every night. I will continue to use the product, and do want to wear it on a nightly basis if possible.  I did notice on two occasions a light brow line where I applied the product. On both occasions I did have lotion and eye cream on my lids. Since I noticed the brown line only occurred when I had other products on my eyes, I now avoid wearing anything on my lids where I am applying li lash.  I have super straight, thick asian hair, with very fine, short, sparse eyelashes. This product worked for me, so hopefully this review has helped you in some way.</li>
            <li> i love this product... mother natural skip me on the long eyelash...so i have to make my own... i have really shot eyelash and always want my long.. i was thinking about getting those fake eyelash but it was too much... i did some digging and found this product.. was kinda scary to try it but thinking to myself what do i have to loose right... so i bought the product and put it on... after 2 weeks my eyelash grow longer.. i didn&#x27;t notice it but one of my sister in law told me.. wow u have long eyelash.. i was like whatever.. so i look at my eyelash and it did grew longer than before... i love it... one thing i notice is that this product does make my eye red like i didn&#x27;t have enough sleep.. so i would said a little side effect... but love the result... i wounder if i stop using will my eyelash fall out..I&#x27;ll update u guys to see what happen...</li>
            <li> I have used Li-lash before and was so very happy with my long lashes.  But when I saw this cheap price which was nearly 1/2 price from the one I purchased before, I ordered it.  It is a imitation I do believe.  Same bottle and everything, but it is like I am not even using it.  My lashes are back to normal short length and yes I have been using it for a couple of months.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like the Li-Lash that I ordered before.  So now I don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of brands on the market that promote lengthening,darkening eye lashes, and making them fuller.  The original costs much more than LiLash, is harder to apply, and needs to be repurchased every month or so.     Lilash lasts for months before I need to buy another.  I really like that savings, and LILASH works!  After about a month or so, I found that I  only need to apply it every other morning or evening - either time works.  Even applying once a week keeps the length. I think it all depends on how fast your eyelashes grow.    I also like the fact that I&#x27;m not allergic to it.      I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented on my eyelashes !  They never did before - not for years and years!!!    I will keep on using it!</li>
            <li> LiLash works - I love this product.  It makes your your lashes longer and stronger.   My only problem: the $20 off repeat purchase coupon did not come off my last order.</li>
            <li> Take it from a blue-eyed blonde who was paranoid about side effects - I really like it and recommend it. Just take it slow and easy---don&#x27;t go nuts applying it three times a day and expecting lush lashes to show up overnight with no side effects.     At first, I used this at only 33% of the recommended use---I applied it once every three nights, instead of every night. For the first month I didn&#x27;t notice any lash growth, and I did notice that sometimes my eyelash line felt very mildly irritated, like a little bit red and puffy if I looked closely in just the area where the gel is applied. Still, it was never uncomfortable, my husband didn&#x27;t notice any redness (I asked him,) it didn&#x27;t interfere with makeup at all, and it was gone in less than 24 hours. So one month in, not much is happening, but I keep at it.    I step it up to every other night, 50% of recommended use. I didn&#x27;t any irritation any more, and I really was starting to see that my lashes were double their original length and looked GREAT. I wish I had before-and-after pictures!    After three months of using the product way less than prescribed, I got great-looking lashes with fewer side effects. I&#x27;m using it just once or twice a week now and feel like I&#x27;ve hardly depleted the supply in the tube - it will last another three months easily. I didn&#x27;t notice any pigmentation changes at all.      Update: I stopped using this when I got pregnant to be on the safe side, and about four months after I stopped my lashes were pretty much back to normal. Still, it was fun while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical when I ordered this.  All I knew was that my eyelashes were getting shorter and more sparse.  My best friend visited me and had asked me what happened to my eyelashes.  They were non-existant.  I tried all sorts of mascaras, false eyelashes, anything to make them \\&quot;look\\&quot; like I had more than I did.  I saw the Latisse advertised on commercials.  I knew my doctor wouldn&#x27;t go for writing me a prescription for it.  I researched and searched for anything and everything.  This product kept popping up.  So, I finally decided to get it.  It has been the best decision I have made.  I have been using this since March.  I used it every morning for about 6 weeks.  My co-workers asked if I was wearing false eyelashes.  Nope.  They are mine.  They are long, they are fuller.  I have dropped down to using it once or twice a week.  None of my eyelashes have broken.  They are still long.  I&#x27;m not losing anymore eyelashes other than the occasional lash that usually falls out, even when I rub my eyes!</li>
            <li> I actually LOVE this product. However, I purchased it from a different company this time through Amazon. Although the product was sealed, when I opened it part of the plastic piece inside the tube was loose. This concerns me, because I get the feeling it was tampered with. I will NOT buy this product through the most recent company I purchased it from. I will buy it again from the original company I purchased the product from the first time I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It takes a litle, like a month for you to see this product is amazing, u don&#x27;t need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> The woman who does my waxing recommended this product to me.  I was VERY sceptical, since products like this, with these type of claims, usually don&#x27;t work.  Plus, I&#x27;m not the type to shell out $140 on a beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with it, and was going to return it, since I wasn&#x27;t noticing any results.  She kept telling me to hang with it, and keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, she was right!  About six weeks after I began using the product religiously, my eyelashes were a lot longer, darker and thicker!  I do notice that if I stop using the product for any substantial length of time, my lashes revert somewhat.  So now, to maintain my lashes, I use it every other day (in an attempt to make it last longer/save money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not generally a \\&quot;senstive\\&quot; person to products.  The first week or so, however, my eyelids did itch after putting it on, so my waxer suggested that I put it on right before bed.  That did help.  Now, I can use it in the morning, and have no itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have greenish/blue eyes (bordering on \\&quot;hazel\\&quot;), and I have not noticed any eye color change, as some other users have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it, and would recommend it to anyone.  A co-worker has started using it, and she is impressed with her results as well.  She has not experienced any side effects or eye color changes either.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works. I have short, thin, sparse Asian eyelashes that are absolutely pathetic. I used this product for 2 months before I even saw any results, so patience is important. By the 3-4 month mark, my lashes were 3x their original length! Amazing. And they grew in with a little upwards curl too, which was pretty cool because I did not even need to use an eyelash curler. This product won&#x27;t make your eyelashes any thicker though, however. My individual eyelashes were still thin, but they were just much longer. You still need to use a mascara that adds volume to make them look thicker. But even so, this product has worked miracles. For the first time in my life, I was complimented on my lashes and asked if I was wearing falsies.   My only cons about this product are the price and the occasional eye irritation. In the first 2-3 weeks, my eyes were bloodshot red and irritated from the product. However after learning that I was applying too much of it, I changed my application method and the irritation was decreased to an extent. However, my eyes still do get irritated from time to time from using this product so I skip a day or two when that happens. As for the price, this tiny tube has lasted for for months so far. You&#x27;ll only be paying for it once or twice a year. The money is worth it though. Do yourself a favor and buy it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any changes after almost a month of usage. In addition have had eyelashes falling out, that never happened before. Don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  As I reached a &#x27;certain age&#x27; I noticed my lashes were becoming blunt and straight (like my mother&#x27;s). I happened onto this product and after much internet research decided to order.  It took about a month to really kick in.  I thought I noticed that my lashes were beginning to curl again - but I thought maybe I was imagining it.  Then I wore mascara to work one day (which I don&#x27;t normally) and my eyelashes were rubbing on my glasses! There were evenings, getting ready for bed, when I would think \\&quot;oh I have to take my mascara off\\&quot; - then I would realize I wasn&#x27;t wearing any.  One day during a meeting a coworker asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any itching or burning or any of the other side effects people have mentioned. Also my lashes did not fall out when I stopped using it.  However - one con is that you need to continue to use the product or your lashes will eventually revert to their &#x27;old selves&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried another brand - which was abt half the price and touted to be just as good or better in \\&quot;independent\\&quot; reviews. I used it religiously w/ absolutely no visible results at all.  Talk about a waste of money!  This is one case where you definately get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i bought this product, works well, it takes about a month for me to see results, im using only once at night, because my eyes get little red. It stings a little right when i put it on, but goes away withing few minutes . I would recommended it to others, it does what it suppose to do, makes your eyelashes grow . Fast shipping, i didnt have any issues with ordering and recieving this item. Good service.!</li>
            <li> At first was itchy and I only used every other day For two weeks. then i started using every day now and it seems not to bad. I notice changes on my eyelashes. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit  product. The real LiLash is manufactured by Cosmetic Alchemy NOT Cosmetic \\&quot;Pros\\&quot;. Remember this is going on your eyes!!!!!  BE CAREFUL!  It&#x27;s not worth losing your vision to save $30! The real LiLash is absolutely amazing and thankfully I was one of the lucky ones that experienced ZERO side affects. I thought I&#x27;d see if you can get the real deal on Amazon. Looks like the posts about it being fake are 100% true. I haven&#x27;t even taken the plastic off the bottle!!! It&#x27;s going straight back in tomorrows mail.  I&#x27;ve informed Amazon customer service this seller is profiting on false advertisement and a counterfeit product and they have offered a full refund. Just because you bought it on Amazon doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t return it. Their customer service rep was very kind, helpful and understanding of my dilemma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T ACCEPT COUNTERFEIT. RETURN THE PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY AND REPORT THE SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to get one that has Cosmetic Alchemy at the bottom of the tube then you got a good one (as long as it hasn&#x27;t expired) I however was not so lucky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and there is a HUGE difference in my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I had used this product a few years back and had great results at that time. I tried something cheaper the next time and there was no comparison.  LiLash definitely outperformed the cheaper substitute. If you want real results, stick with LiLash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years, and I like it because not only are my lashes longer, they are stronger. My lashes seem to fall out frequently when I am not using the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! A bit pricey but lasts a good while and totally delivers on results!  My lashes were quite short, not any more!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product on the market. I have had amazing results from LiLash Eyelash Stimulator. Thank you LiLash.</li>
            <li> LiLash is great! It did take a week or two of using it to kick in, but once it did my lashes were super long and manageable! I have also used Latisse and switched to LiLash because my dermatologist switched.  I like it better than Latisse for the price alone.  Latisse costs more than LiLash and you only get a tiny bottle of it that lasts about 30 days.  The tube of LiLash has MUCH more in it...I have been using the same bottle for 4 months now.  Its easy to use and provides noticeably longer lashes that are easy to manage.  Definitely try it!</li>
            <li> I have used lilash from Burton&#x27;s salon and now from amazon. I had no problems with the serum from the salon but redness on my eye lids and eyes from amazon.</li>
            <li> yes, it is true, that give me long lashes but it make it thin. but it look pretty when you wear mascara on :)</li>
            <li> I bought this in Feb and wondered why it hadn&#x27;t worked like previous LiLash purchase (previous results were noticably amazing). When I did research I found that what I bought is NOT LiLash by Cosmetic Alchemy but something by cosmetic pros (written in tiny letters on bottom of tube)- only the tube is labeled LiLash. This explains the diluted results. I&#x27;ve contacted Amazon, but to no avail. Cosmetic Alchemy has confirmed they do not sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had used the less expensive, store bought products, (Loreal and Rapid Lash), with little to no results.  So I decided to try just one more time, and splurged on LiLash.  I am so glad I did!!!  At first I was applying too much, thinking \\&quot;the more the better\\&quot;, but that only made my eye irritated and red.  I then following the directions, and applied ONE thin line along my lash line.  It did take a full 12 weeks, with religious application each night, but MAN, my once poker straight, stubby lashes have blossomed into the most envious lashes of anyone I know.  Even my 25 year old daughter can&#x27;t believe, me of all people, has longer lashes than her.  It used to be the other way around.  Now she is the one with the tiny lashes and her 53 year old mom is rockin&#x27; some HOT LASHES!  My friends and co-workers are all saying \\&quot;Wow!  Your lashes are sooo long\\&quot;.  One even asked if I was wearing fake lashes when I wore eye liner.  I said, \\&quot;No, these are really mine!\\&quot;  I suspect this is how someone feels after getting a boob job, I love to look at myself in the mirror.  I&#x27;ve even have to trim them because a few have become so long.  Also, they have curled and I don&#x27;t have to use an eyelash curler anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money elsewhere, buy the LiLash now and get on YOUR way to long, sexy lashes today!!!</li>
            <li> I was given info. on this product by a co-worker so I decided to try it out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 month and can really see the difference - it really works. No adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add my review so no one else has the same problem.  I bought Lilash in February 2012, used it for 2 months and absolutely loved it.  My lashed were so long and thick I actually had to cut them down because my mascara was leaving marks all the way up by my eyebrows! After 2 months though I began to have a lot of problems.  First, my eyes got a red line on top and became very itchy.  (Yes, I know this is a somewhat common complaint.)  Also, my long thick eye lashes started to grow in white! I am a natural blonde, with extremely light hair, so I know the difference between blonde lashes and white lashes.  The only way to cover the white was with extreme amounts of mascara.  Another problem, and by far my biggest concern, SERIOUS SKIN PIGMENTATION DAMAGE all over my face.  My forehead has a circle in the middle that is much darker than my natural skin.  The arches of my eyebrows are my darker, almost giving my face the effect of having on too much bronzer that I haven&#x27;t rubbed in. AND extreme dark skin above my upper lip.  It is completely embarrassing because no matter how much I try to cover it, it looks like I have a mustache.  I have tried waxing - incase it really was hair and not my skin, and I&#x27;ve tried makeup, nothing works, it&#x27;s so dark.  It&#x27;s visible even in pictures.  It&#x27;s been about 2-3 months since I stopped using Lilash completely.  The white eyelashes are gone, as well as the red lines. The skin discoloration has yet to go away, but I&#x27;m really hoping it does.  I really wanted thick lashes when I started this product, so I overlooked other warning&#x27;s, I&#x27;m really regretting it now.</li>
            <li> I had been buying that on and off for last 2 years.It works amazing, I always get complimented on my eyelashes and people can&#x27;t belive I have no extensions,they grow so long they look fake ! I have slight reddish discoloration of upper lid but it doesn&#x27;t look bad ( and I rarely wear make up ) I will keep reordering as long as it&#x27;s avalible.It is a miracle product :D</li>
            <li> I have never written a negative review in my life - but on principle I must do it now. I had been using LiLash and had great results. HOWEVER - I purchased the product from this seller and it did not work. Because of that, it completely eliminated the results that I already had. (so I&#x27;ve now wasted $250) I checked with LiLash corporate and they informed me that NO LiLash sold on Amazon is authentic! The seller claims that it is real (which it is NOT) and would NOT give me my money back!!!! On the sellers website it clearly states that no LiLash products sold on Amazon are authorized. Beware of buying from this seller and please don&#x27;t support unethical business practices! If there were negative stars - I would have chosen them.</li>
