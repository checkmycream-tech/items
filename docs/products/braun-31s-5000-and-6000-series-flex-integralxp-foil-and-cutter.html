            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>The foil and cutter may be an original replacement for the Braun shaver sold in the Korea market but not in the USA..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good price and  as always Braun products work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item damaged in shipment; the cracked plastic will not accept Super Glue.  </li>

            <li>The performance of the shaver really improved after installing these replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy.</li>
            <li>I should have done that first!  </li>
            <li>Should have ordered Braun the first time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>First, everything came as promised and they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>May have to go with a higher cost provider if JB Weld is not compatible with the plastic.  </li>
            <li>The blades do wear after many years but are simple to replace&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These fit my old German made Braun shaver and certainly are a better option than buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I waited so long to replace my foil and cutters that I couldn&#x27;t use my razor, and couldn&#x27;t find the 5000 series in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I can finally get a smooth shave from my razor again.</li>
            <li>so I spent $30 more and got an $80 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They arrived ahead of schedule and the price was very competitive.</li>
            <li>I have a ten year old Braun 5775, this replacement brought it back to good use.</li>
            <li>equipment does not seem to give the same close shaving results as the original equipment, it appears as if the items is not made for the shaver I have.</li>
            <li>Correct product information was provided only after original purchase and had to pay another $40.00.  </li>
            <li>The one side of the head doesn&#x27;t click in properly like my original.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a new razor !</li>
            <li>Made my razor like brand new!</li>
            <li>Replacing the foil and cutter is like having a new shaver!</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to use and older model razor.</li>
            <li>Braun shavers are high quality.</li>
            <li>A feel was very good when cutting a whisker.</li>
            <li>Hope it will last a long time now, but anyway I&amp;#34;l be coming for more when needed</li>
            <li>Hubby says it&#x27;s like having a new shaver w the new foil screen and cutter.</li>
            <li>Like NEW.  </li>
            <li>its like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new one solved the probllem.</li>
            <li>The old one developed a whole in the foil which made caught on skin and beard.  </li>
            <li>The new cutters and foil made my shaver feel like new; I forgot how quickly I can shave if I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times.  </li>
            <li>Works like new in my 10 year old razor.</li>
            <li>New replacement blade assembly doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much sharper than the ten year old unit it replaced, although it does shave a bit faster.  </li>
            <li>Although the foil and cutter fits the US Braun it in no way produces the shave that my 1 year old foil and cutter still</li>
            <li>had an old electric shaver with worn cutters and the foil covering those cutters.  </li>
            <li>The foil I had had gotten mangled somewhere along the line and the cutters had gotten old.  </li>
            <li>I decided to order a couple of spares in advance and my old one wore through unexpectedly a couple weeks after they arrived.  </li>
            <li>This foil and cutter recovered my old Braun eletric shaver.</li>
            <li>Brought it back to like new !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a VERY old razor and this part brought it back to life.  </li>
            <li>simply because I thought my Braun razor was too old even though the series numbers appeared to match.  </li>
            <li>Bouught the Braun brand name 3 weeks after buying a cheaper version (shaveraid) that never fit quite right and then broke.  </li>
            <li>This little tune up for the shaver really did the trick.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this refill for a long time.</li>
            <li> The new foil and cutter replaced one that was approximately 1 year old.  </li>

            <li> as expected</li>

            <li> Expensive unit and this made it like new again.  </li>
            <li> These things always seem a little expensive, but they do last twelve plus months.</li>
            <li> Received the order very quickly as usual.</li>
            <li> , I did a stupid thing and went on Amazon, out of curiosity to see if they had the replacement parts for my old razor.  </li>
            <li> These parts last a long time but when they fail, shaving is painful!  </li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Vague</li>
            <li> unclear labeling resulted in purchasing the wrong replacement parts.  </li>

            <li> Good quality, screen a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> Works well. Husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price and  as always Braun products work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BHanson</li>
            <li> I waited so long to replace my foil and cutters that I couldn&#x27;t use my razor, and couldn&#x27;t find the 5000 series in stores any more. Finally found it online and it arrived from Korea within a week! I can finally get a smooth shave from my razor again.</li>
            <li> I almost nicked myself. It was a close shave!</li>
            <li> Way over priced . These pieces should cost under $ 20 , maybe under $10 . Not 30 something . Rip off</li>
            <li> it is OK, but does not shave as you expect from a new blade</li>
            <li> works ok ... as expected</li>
            <li> Actual picture was what I needed and product received was completely different ... not good and quite misleading ... not going to waste my time on the return as it will cost more of my time and money</li>
            <li> Fis the razor, replaces the foil I had that became damaged, nice to have a clean comfortable shave again. OK</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, like new again.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to install. These things always seem a little expensive, but they do last twelve plus months.</li>
            <li> Bouught the Braun brand name 3 weeks after buying a cheaper version (shaveraid) that never fit quite right and then broke.  Should have ordered Braun the first time.  Hubby says it&#x27;s like having a new shaver w the new foil screen and cutter.</li>

            <li> This set restored my razor and gave me a great shave. I will replace this every 18 months as recommended.</li>
            <li> Very thrilled that I could find them.  Stores no longer carry this style and I refuse to go back to my newer shaver that I don&#x27;t like as well.  The cutters are performing like a jewel.  Service was quicker than promised.  I&#x27;d give it six or more stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Up to usual German standards.</li>
            <li> Fair price for something that absolutely made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> To be blunt and to the point,&lt;br /&gt;1. The time between order and delivery is unacceptable (ordered Nov. 15, 2013, received Dec.10th).&lt;br /&gt;2. The foil and cutter may be an original replacement for the Braun shaver sold in the Korea market but not in the USA..&lt;br /&gt;3. Although the foil and cutter fits the US Braun it in no way produces the shave that my 1 year old foil and cutter still produces.&lt;br /&gt;Had I known the foil and cutter was not a replacement for a USA model I would never have ordered it from your company.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely perfect, I would recommend that attachment to anyone, thank You for carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;If You get greedy , you wind up with nothing . OOO</li>
            <li> Excellent product. As good as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Thought the shaver should be thrown out but it is good as new again.  My Husband is pleased and we saved money, what&#x27;s not to like about that?</li>
            <li> I have a ten year old Braun 5775, this replacement brought it back to good use. The replacement fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Feels like a new razor !</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to use and older model razor.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected</li>
            <li> Like NEW.  Expensive unit and this made it like new again.  If this wears out I&#x27;ll order another one and keep it going.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> First, everything came as promised and they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an old electric shaver with worn cutters and the foil covering those cutters.  I had a $50 gift certificate to wally world so I spent $30 more and got an $80 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I did a stupid thing and went on Amazon, out of curiosity to see if they had the replacement parts for my old razor.  I should have done that first!  I could have saved the gift certificate for something else.  Anyway, I purchased the replacements parts and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> He loves his electric razor and is happy that I found a place to get replacement parts quickly.</li>
            <li> Made my razor like brand new! Thank you</li>
            <li> buying this product an putting it on my razor made it just like a brand new one very pleased with this cutter head</li>
            <li> The new cutters and foil made my shaver feel like new; I forgot how quickly I can shave if I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times.  Very easy to replace the cutter block, and a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a VERY old razor and this part brought it back to life.  Thank you Braun</li>
            <li> A feel was very good when cutting a whisker.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I needed.  Item damaged in shipment; the cracked plastic will not accept Super Glue.  Maybe JB Weld will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper used the least amount of protective bubble wrap possible to ship the item.  Expect to incur a return shipping cost.  May have to go with a higher cost provider if JB Weld is not compatible with the plastic.  Will update if JB Weld helps with the cracked plastic.</li>
            <li> Braun shavers are high quality. The blades do wear after many years but are simple to replace&lt;br /&gt;and its like having a new shaver. You can&#x27;t beat German engineering.</li>
            <li> This is not the cutter that is pictured. This cutter is the one with flat horizontal blades, not the vertical pointed ones that are hard to find.</li>
            <li> This little tune up for the shaver really did the trick.  The foil I had had gotten mangled somewhere along the line and the cutters had gotten old.  The performance of the shaver really improved after installing these replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy.</li>
            <li> equipment does not seem to give the same close shaving results as the original equipment, it appears as if the items is not made for the shaver I have.</li>
            <li> It is excellent quality.  It works so well I ordered another one for future use.  Won&#x27;t need one again for quite a while.</li>
            <li> The new foil and cutter replaced one that was approximately 1 year old.  The old one developed a whole in the foil which made caught on skin and beard.  The new one solved the probllem.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve been searching for this refill for a long time. It works great.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Braun.  Replacing the foil and cutter is like having a new shaver!</li>
            <li> These parts last a long time but when they fail, shaving is painful!  I decided to order a couple of spares in advance and my old one wore through unexpectedly a couple weeks after they arrived.  They arrived ahead of schedule and the price was very competitive.</li>
            <li> Fits and works great, fast delivery and no shipping fees.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> great item quick shipping</li>
            <li> To be honest I really didn&#x27;t expect this foil and cutter to work simply because I thought my Braun razor was too old even though the series numbers appeared to match.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely pleased when the items both fit perfectly and performed flawlessly!!  THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> Deceptive Sales Scheme.  Vague unclear labeling resulted in purchasing the wrong replacement parts.  I was denied return because package had been opened.  Correct product information was provided only after original purchase and had to pay another $40.00.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> These fit my old German made Braun shaver and certainly are a better option than buying a new shaver.  They give me what I expect in a shave and a shaver.</li>
            <li> Arrived when they said it would.  Works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 5000 series for almost 20 years.  This is the 2nd time I have replaced the blade and foil.  These replacements work like a charm.</li>
            <li> Works like new in my 10 year old razor.</li>
            <li> Received the order very quickly as usual. Everything is fine.</li>
            <li> This foil and cutter recovered my old Braun eletric shaver. Hope it will last a long time now, but anyway I&amp;#34;l be coming for more when needed</li>
            <li> Price,shipping &amp; packaging good.  However, even though it was in the unopened manufactures&#x27; package,it didn&#x27;t seem to quite&lt;br /&gt;fit.  The one side of the head doesn&#x27;t click in properly like my original.  Sometimes this affects you when your shaving or putting&lt;br /&gt;the shaver in the charger because the head pops off.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for a shaver that just won&#x27;t quit. Brought it back to like new !</li>
