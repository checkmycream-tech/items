            <li>Great shampoo, smells great, kinda makes my head tingle, love it.</li>
            <li>The product itself is a good product.  </li>
            <li>The citrus mint is good too.</li>
            <li>and I loved how it felt (the tingle and all)</li>
            <li>and how good my hair felt the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>If you remove the cap from the bottle, it smells very good and has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>My son was very happy when he received the shampoo; it is one of his favorite to keep healthy look.</li>
            <li>I find it better than Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, the feel, and get tons of compliments on my hair after using this shampoo!</li>
            <li>It smells good, clean the hair, removes pomade and makes your scalp feel great.  </li>
            <li>Smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>I remember over a decade ago buying this shampoo and loving the tingling sensation it would bring as you massaged your scalp.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and the fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I believe the authentic AC Tea Tree Shampoo is good</li>
            <li>Good value and quick shipment by Amazon</li>
            <li>Best American Crew Product I could find on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is packaged in a bag that was able to catch most of the leakage.  </li>
            <li>The smell is outstanding and there is a tingle on your scalp when you use</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>They sent hair coloring conditioner and told me it cost more</li>
            <li>Had to buy this online because they don&#x27;t sell at stores any more.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love the price and the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>American Crew Shampoo is an awesome brand.</li>
            <li>But, Amazon had a better deal on the Tea Tree formula</li>
            <li>the shampoo bottle top was not tapped shut thus allowing some of the shampoo to leak out inside he package.</li>
            <li>they ship it with better packaging.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>The tea tree smells nice and clean too.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily shampoo for healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It removes daily buildup of product, keeps my hair healthy and smelling good, and is a good price in this large bulk size.</li>
            <li>I use it with their tingling conditioner and a little bit of Kevin Murphy Night Rider product and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The protective bag had a huge rip.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately nothing else was in the box.  </li>
            <li>It suds nicely and you can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>Crew Tea Tree is great middle ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job at cleaning your hair and not leaving it greasy and smelly, but as far as scent goes, its almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Works well to clean hair and stimulate the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Also is a great choice if you have problems with a dry scalp.</li>
            <li>If you buy it, it&#x27;ll clean your hair, too.</li>
            <li>We tried American Crew Tea Tree and loved it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so hard to find on the shelves... great for oily hair :)</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase and has helped my dry scalp completely.</li>
            <li>I had some dandruff before using this shampoo and it fixed that very quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, remember not to use too much shampoo!</li>
            <li>No issues, just glad to have my shampoo and conditioner set back!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>The regular American Crew for Oily and/or for Dry hair is OK, but the Tea Tree stuff cleans very well and smells great.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s hair gets dry and my hair is very fine...  </li>
            <li>Crew Tea Tree has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</li>
            <li>for having this shampoo shipped, not sure it&#x27;s a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Not as much &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; as you would get in a salon Tea Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After washing bottle I found that it was not broken.  </li>
            <li>As soon as this bottle finishes, I am going to purchase the real deal, the Paul Mitchell line.</li>
            <li>He loves this for oily hair issues but Ulta has stopped carrying this product &#x3D; really wish they would rethink this issue and offer it.  </li>
            <li>This is a reasonable replacement.</li>
            <li>shampoo cleans your hair very well.</li>
            <li>It truly could be used alone without the conditioner as ti leaves the hair clean and soft (not dried out at all).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular American Crew shampoo for years and dabbled with the Citrus Mint Refreshing Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as top notch as really expensive shampoo, but seems to take care of my hair nicely and the smell is a big deal.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews before purchasing the product and I found that this was the only authentic conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was constantly breaking out on my head during the hot months and this shampoo has helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think I like it better than their standard shampoo and would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>And the local Salon where my husband originally discovered American Crew Tea Tree wouldn&#x27;t keep it in stock anymore - ordering from them</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten it in my eyes yet (and hopefully never will), but I feel like it won&#x27;t be nearly as excruciating as the Citrus Mint if that ever happens.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box, some of the shampoo was leaking out so that was irritating but other than that - happy.</li>
            <li>First bottle came with a couple of other items.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo, for the price, I think I&#x27;ll definitely be looking at other options next time.</li>
            <li>I use it daily will no harsh effects.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use it daily will no harsh effects.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much leaked, but did lose some product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received the package, the lid on the shampoo was loose and slightly open.  </li>
            <li> Does just what I was looking for; getting rid of dry scalp and taking care of of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I tried to go back to Womens commercial products, but they made my hair limp, heavy, or dry...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would want to order this for deliver because it didn&#x27;t appear to be handled carefully or doesn&#x27;t hold up well to shipping.  </li>
            <li> , everything went as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> It either leaked through the loose lid or slightly opened lid.  </li>
            <li> Tiny slits in bag allowed small amount of product to leak into box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the way they make this product back from when I used to buy it from the salon, but it just didn&#x27;t thrill me like before.</li>
            <li> My son uses this shampoo because other shampoo leaves his hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> He has a tendancy to get an irritated scalp with other shampoos and he loves this one.</li>
            <li> It keep dandruff down too by revitalizing the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to warrant a return but not a good thing to find when opening a package with shampoo and other items in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a full blown metro, but I sure the hell ain&#x27;t use crap like Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you that slight burning sensation on your scalp that the Citrus Mint shampoo can.</li>
            <li> Whom ever packaged this shipment for Amazon did at least put the bottle partially in a plastic baggy so the other items in my order weren&#x27;t cover in tea tree balancing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fine, but annoying.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are adding something or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All packed together tightly in a small box.  </li>
            <li> this time the bottle was shipped by itself in a small box.  </li>
            <li> A small amount of shampoo leaked covering the bottle and some into the box.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it fell short.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have the same effect, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Usually as a man you have two options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you however have serious dandruff issues this is not for you as my room mate found out.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I received.  </li>
            <li> nothing wrong with option two, but that&#x27;s my style.</li>
            <li> Crap shampoo.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best American Crew Product I could find on amazon. I read other reviews before purchasing the product and I found that this was the only authentic conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a good product.  Works well to clean hair and stimulate the scalp.  Not as much &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; as you would get in a salon Tea Tree shampoo.  Not sure if they are adding something or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for having this shampoo shipped, not sure it&#x27;s a good idea.  Or maybe I&#x27;ve been unlucky.  First bottle came with a couple of other items.  All packed together tightly in a small box.  During shipment or packaging the bottle was cracked and leaked shampoo.  It is packaged in a bag that was able to catch most of the leakage.  Tiny slits in bag allowed small amount of product to leak into box.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was great about getting a replacement bottle shipped out.  this time the bottle was shipped by itself in a small box.  It appears the bottle was handled roughly prior to or during the packaging.  When I received the package, the lid on the shampoo was loose and slightly open.  The protective bag had a huge rip.  Fortunately nothing else was in the box.  A small amount of shampoo leaked covering the bottle and some into the box.  After washing bottle I found that it was not broken.  It either leaked through the loose lid or slightly opened lid.  Not sure how much leaked, but did lose some product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I don&#x27;t know if I would want to order this for deliver because it didn&#x27;t appear to be handled carefully or doesn&#x27;t hold up well to shipping.  I hope others fulfilled by Amazon are not having these issues, but I did twice.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does just what I was looking for; getting rid of dry scalp and taking care of of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is excellent. The smell is outstanding and there is a tingle on your scalp when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle was bigger than I thought.  The shampoo is thicker than the store bought.  Smells really nice.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> After experiencing the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo at my barbershop, I decided to give this one a try thinking that it would be similar to the PM. Needless to say, it fell short. If you remove the cap from the bottle, it smells very good and has a strong scent. However, when you actually use it in the shower, there is almost no smell whatsoever. It does a good job at cleaning your hair and not leaving it greasy and smelly, but as far as scent goes, its almost non-existent. As soon as this bottle finishes, I am going to purchase the real deal, the Paul Mitchell line.</li>
            <li> I remember over a decade ago buying this shampoo and loving the tingling sensation it would bring as you massaged your scalp. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have the same effect, unfortunately. While it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo, for the price, I think I&#x27;ll definitely be looking at other options next time. I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the way they make this product back from when I used to buy it from the salon, but it just didn&#x27;t thrill me like before. Also, remember not to use too much shampoo! You only need about a quarter size amount.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was constantly breaking out on my head during the hot months and this shampoo has helped a lot.  Its a litte pricey, however its lasted about 6 months now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells good, clean the hair, removes pomade and makes your scalp feel great.  It truly could be used alone without the conditioner as ti leaves the hair clean and soft (not dried out at all).  It keep dandruff down too by revitalizing the scalp.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> They sent hair coloring conditioner and told me it cost more and I should keep it instead.It took almost a month to resolve the problem.</li>
            <li> Had to buy this online because they don&#x27;t sell at stores any more. This product has been discontinued on American Crew&#x27;s Site and in stores. Everything showed up on time and was well packed. No issues, just glad to have my shampoo and conditioner set back!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever. its great for the scalp and it has tea tree oil in it. I had some dandruff before using this shampoo and it fixed that very quickly. Now this is the only shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo. Bottle leaked everywhere when it was shipped.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Only one that gets rid of flakes and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I find it better than Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li> This has an amount 3X what I can buy locally but at only twice the price. Great purchase and has helped my dry scalp completely.</li>
            <li> I have hair that tends to be a bit oily and this product keeps it under control for the day.  I use it daily will no harsh effects.  VERY good price from this seller, I will purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo.  The regular American Crew for Oily and/or for Dry hair is OK, but the Tea Tree stuff cleans very well and smells great.  I use it with their tingling conditioner and a little bit of Kevin Murphy Night Rider product and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo of quality and at a great price.</li>
            <li> He loves this for oily hair issues but Ulta has stopped carrying this product &#x3D; really wish they would rethink this issue and offer it.  The citrus mint is good too.</li>
            <li> Simple purchase and delivery, everything went as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> The tea trea Crew shampoo works well. It removes daily buildup of product, keeps my hair healthy and smelling good, and is a good price in this large bulk size. I used to use \\&quot;degunkify\\&quot; shampoo by herbal essences, but they seem to have discontinued that. This is a reasonable replacement. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, smells great, kinda makes my head tingle, love it. Also is a great choice if you have problems with a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My son uses this shampoo because other shampoo leaves his hair greasy.  Love the price and the size of the bottle.  When I opened the box, some of the shampoo was leaking out so that was irritating but other than that - happy.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for my husband and he loves it. He has a tendancy to get an irritated scalp with other shampoos and he loves this one. The tea tree smells nice and clean too.</li>
            <li> American Crew Shampoo is an awesome brand.I have been using American Crew for year&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo cleans your hair very well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, the feel, and get tons of compliments on my hair after using this shampoo! Feels great in the shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular American Crew shampoo for years and dabbled with the Citrus Mint Refreshing Shampoo. But, Amazon had a better deal on the Tea Tree formula so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It lathers nicely and the fragrance is not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t give you that slight burning sensation on your scalp that the Citrus Mint shampoo can. I haven&#x27;t gotten it in my eyes yet (and hopefully never will), but I feel like it won&#x27;t be nearly as excruciating as the Citrus Mint if that ever happens. Overall, I think I like it better than their standard shampoo and would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> My son was very happy when he received the shampoo; it is one of his favorite to keep healthy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizing conditioner compliment to this shampoo, and this balances it out perfectly. My hair is colored and this combination leaves it standing up to the blowdrier day after day.</li>
            <li> I had my hair washed at the barber shop with this product and I loved how it felt (the tingle and all) and how good my hair felt the rest of the day.  So, I figured I would order it on Amazon (always trying to save a buck).  What I received in my order did not have any of the same qualities of the shampoo at the barber. Also, I haven&#x27;t had dandruff in years (been using Selsun Blue) and now it&#x27;s back a couple of weeks after switching to this product.  I believe the authentic AC Tea Tree Shampoo is good, unfortunately I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I received.  Lesson learned....</li>
            <li> This is a great daily shampoo for healthy hair. If you have some dandruff issues this is a great shampoo for you. If you however have serious dandruff issues this is not for you as my room mate found out. This shampoo is great if you have thick hair. It suds nicely and you can really feel it working. Great product and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good value and quick shipment by Amazon but.....when I received this shipment which contained multiple items the shampoo bottle top was not tapped shut thus allowing some of the shampoo to leak out inside he package. Not enough to warrant a return but not a good thing to find when opening a package with shampoo and other items in it. Whom ever packaged this shipment for Amazon did at least put the bottle partially in a plastic baggy so the other items in my order weren&#x27;t cover in tea tree balancing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Some time ago my husband and I was looking for a Tea Tree product that didn&#x27;t strip our hair. My husband&#x27;s hair gets dry and my hair is very fine...  We tried American Crew Tea Tree and loved it. Yes, I use it too.  I tried to go back to Womens commercial products, but they made my hair limp, heavy, or dry... I would end up back at Amazon ordering America Crew Tea Tree.  I buy from Amazon because Wal-mart has some Crew products, but not this one. And the local Salon where my husband originally discovered American Crew Tea Tree wouldn&#x27;t keep it in stock anymore - ordering from them took a couple weeks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a full blown metro, but I sure the hell ain&#x27;t use crap like Head and Shoulders. Crew Tea Tree has been a favorite of mine for a long time. It&#x27;s not as top notch as really expensive shampoo, but seems to take care of my hair nicely and the smell is a big deal. Usually as a man you have two options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Crap shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;2. Incredibly flowery smelling shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, nothing wrong with option two, but that&#x27;s my style. Crew Tea Tree is great middle ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing with this is the bottle came dented on the bottom. Fine, but annoying. Falls over in the shower. Hopefully the next go around they ship it with better packaging.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so hard to find on the shelves... great for oily hair :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo.  It cleaned my hair.  If you buy it, it&#x27;ll clean your hair, too.</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
