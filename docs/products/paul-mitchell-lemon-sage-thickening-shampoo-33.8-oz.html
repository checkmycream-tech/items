            <li> I have thin hair...I have been using the Lemon Sage Thickening Spray for nearly a year and it has truly made my hair look thicker.  I thought....I&#x27;ll try the shampoo too.  It really is a wonderful product.  I can feel the difference when I am rinsing my hair.  These products do make a great difference and are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo 3 years ago. Absolutely love it.   I&#x27;ve used a hundred different expensive salon shampoos over the years. My scalp is very sensitive and my hair is super fine. I wash my hair every day and occationaly twice.   This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair super shiny with lasting body. I do use the companion conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo.  Ever since I had chemo, my hair began to thin out on top.  This shampoo works really well to hide the thinness by volumning it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent price for this shampoo compared to beauty salons</li>
            <li> We really like this shampoo and are happy we can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this shampoo at the places where I used to get it all the time.  I decided to check on Amazon and thank goodness you had it and even in a larger quantity bottle.  Please continue to carry this item and I will continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I feel this product does what it claims.  My hair is very fine and thin.  This product does add body and thickness.  It takes about a week before anything is seen, but it works.  I&#x27;ve tried other products-- they are just different smells of soap, but no action.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for at least ten years.  It is wonderful for fine, limp, and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, delivery and service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Salons where I get this shampoo are always out and I was glad to find it online!  It has lasted a long time...at first I thought it would be too much money for the product, but it has lasted me forever.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Been using it for 7 years now.  Washes clean, leaves a nice tingle and a great aroma.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has really made my hair thicker and fuller looking.  My hair is starting to thin in the front, temple and sides, I started to use this shampoo in hopes of making the hair fuller, and it really has helped, I can actually style my hair and not see the scalp as bad as before....will keep using.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the recomendation of a friend who said it did a great job of adding body to your hair.  It does do that but not as much as I had hoped but it&#x27;s great shampoo and I am sure that I will order it again.

            <li> great price for the big one...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various Paul Mitchell products for years.  This one did NOT disappoint.  It smells beautiful, works up a good lather, rinses clean and seems to give my hair even more volume than nature has already given it.  I have thick curly hair so there&#x27;s really no volume problem.  But a girl can&#x27;t have too much hair to work with.  I recommend this for anyone looking for even a little extra UMPH!</li>

            <li> Gentle, clean scent.  Rinses well... you only need a little, so it lasts quite a long time.  Recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.  Also - men can use this too...</li>
            <li> I started using it about 2 years ago after a friend recommended and I love this shampoo so far.  It does give a decent fullness to my hair and it smells great and my hair and scalp just feel very clean.  I also use the conditioner that goes with it.  I highly recommend for people who have super fine hair.</li>
