            <li>Great after the shower as well.</li>
            <li>This is great for the summer and gives you a pick me a feeling as well.</li>
            <li>Great stuff...</li>
            <li>and if the wife is happy...</li>
            <li>This is a great body spray.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, not over bearing.</li>
            <li>Besides that it smells and works good.</li>
            <li>This smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>The spray helps me feel nice and smell good all day.</li>
            <li>Refreshing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be picking up more soon!</li>
            <li>very  good bottle size use it for quick touch ups throughout the day</li>
            <li>It keeps it smelling nice.</li>
            <li>but these sprays smell really nice.  </li>
            <li>Wife bought me some this because she liked the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>bottle has a nice look.</li>
            <li>The fresh smell of the spray is great when putting it on.</li>
            <li>so I have not put it to the test, but it does work great for desk jockey&#x27;s with hot offices.</li>
            <li>we both love the smell but it burns his under arms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great product, we&#x27;d absolutely buy these again.  </li>
            <li>This is a great body spray that works really well.  </li>
            <li>In theory deodorant sprays are better than sticks because sticks leave films on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this spray is a lot more damaging than a pit stain -- this spray contains hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which are environmentally damaging.</li>
            <li>HFCs are 3,830 times more potent than CO2 with a lifetime of 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says that this body spray has a very clean fragrance, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>This lasts the whole day, has a nice scent and feels nice when sprayed on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and has a very nice smell that gives you some extra protection to help you smell better.  </li>
            <li>do like the hole in the spray bottle because it makes it easy to put the bottle on a gym bag, etc.</li>
            <li>I liked the Fresh Force, it has a mild but distinct smell which works nicely as a body spray</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t, I think it&#x27;s worth a try. :)</li>
            <li>and it kept me smelling nice the whole day.</li>
            <li>This works great before going out about town and such.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive nose this may not be a good option for you.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Speed Stick Gear Body Spray, Fresh Force&amp;#34; provided decent protect though-out the day and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to keep smelling fresh after a long day, which is more than I can say for some of our hiking buddies.  </li>
            <li>We might have to make Speed Stick our new favorite brand!</li>
            <li>Clean Peak - elements of citrus and evergreen but somewhat medicinal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, Speed Stick&#x27;s Fresh Force Gear body spray is, for lack of a better pun, a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>I think, for the price, you get good value as well, and since there is a scent matched antiperspirant (also inexpensive), you don&#x27;t need to worry about different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on and keeps me cool</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, nice and fresh but still masculine.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>Fresh Force - elements of lemon &amp; lime but somewhat medicinal</li>
            <li>This is a nice accompaniment to the antiperspirant and Deoderant of the same name.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and manly and does not smell like perfume.</li>
            <li>Finally this felt nice on my body.  </li>
            <li>He loves the ease of the spray and the bottle design is really fun.</li>
            <li>and I want to go home smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>However, during traveling, camping, hiking, or long hours spent outdoors, it&#x27;s good to have an effective deodorant to prevent offending fellow travelers and companions.  </li>
            <li>This last all day long I would happily recommend this to anybody that likes to smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a spray, it goes on clean and the nozzle sprays very evenly.</li>
            <li>The Fresh Force body spray is exactly that.</li>
            <li>He has tried several other brands of body spray, mostly because of the different scents, but he said that he likes this one the best.</li>
            <li>I used it before I went out walking in a park on a hot day</li>
            <li>Hubby and I love all Speed Stick products and this one is just the same.</li>
            <li>and they couldn&#x27;t be any more different.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Unlike the traditional body spray containers where the spraying side is elevated and easy to spot, with these ones, the spray and the button are on the same level, so you have to check to make sure you are pointing in the right direction.</li>
            <li>However, it really does have a fresh aroma that doesn&#x27;t make you stand out in a crowd, but strong enough to make notice at a close distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ingredients seems harmless: mostly alcohols (may cause dry skin) and fragrances.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too flowery or bold that it will overpower those standing near you.</li>
            <li>I immediately recommended this Speed Stick Deodorant to them, especially the guys, who tend to emit strong body odors after sweating.  </li>
            <li>Those with strong body odor should not expect this to completely cover their natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Clean Peek body spray deodorant smell was barely noticeable, and this defeats the purpose of a deodorant.</li>
            <li>There are visual cues, for example, the spray side has a black circle around it, but many people are not fully awake in the mornings :)</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent body spray.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s overwhelming to everybody else in the house, even two floor distant.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s at the age where he&#x27;s become a stinky boy that now needs deodorant and stuff like this, and he really likes these sprays.  </li>
            <li>, it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really work out</li>
            <li>very strong not unpleasant smell to cover you if you are having a smelly day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  although cool looking, the can in kind of strange, and several time I sprayed it the wrong way ....&lt;</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I liked the Clean Peek as a solid white anti-perspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li>The spray feels wet at first but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried both the Fresh Force (green color on container) and the Clean Peek (orange color on container)</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the product itself, it leaves a cleanish smell that is not like a musky male smell or like that of fresh linens; instead, it&#x27;s somewhere in between those two and it dissipated rather quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>We tried this Speed Stick Gear Fresh Force Deodorant Body Spray during a day long hike; sprayed it on in the morning and it lasted until early evening.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, so a little works fine.</li>
            <li>this stuff is pretty strong,it will sure keep you from any odors after a long day at hard work</li>
            <li>but I actually won&#x27;t be using this anymore even though it works, because I really dislike the scent of it.</li>
            <li>only thing that I really don&#x27;t like about this product is the aerosol delivery package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend spraying these over the entire body because the scent is strong and long-lasting and could offend those with sensitive noses and would suggest only a short spray under the arms and perhaps a bit on the feet, if necessary.</li>
            <li>strange or too powerful (like Axe, those are totally overkill!)</li>
            <li>These body deodorant sprays from Speed Stick Gear are unusual in that they are not traditional underarm deodorants but are intended to be used on the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There, the more subtle smell was a plus, since there are different uses for antiperspirants and body-spray</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what advanced performance is supposed to mean</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have a very masculine but somewhat medicinal odor that is different than the scent of the equivalent solid anti-perspirant deodorants that I tested.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Just spray a little on your body before heading out and it works really well.  </li>

            <li> I am not an everyday body spray user, because some I have used in the past have been too strong or competed with the smell of the body lotion I use.</li>
            <li> Buying things for my son and my husband, they typically like Old Spice or Dove products.  </li>
            <li> Scent lasts long as well.</li>
            <li> It is dry, and does not make me feel sticky at all.</li>
            <li> He just puts a little on after taking a shower, and I can still smell a hint of it on him the next morning even.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We gave this to my teen son to use and he has used it everyday, so he must like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are going to be active</li>
            <li> I would get a roll on anti-perspirant but for non active things this is the thing for you.  </li>
            <li> Same principle in the locker room where nobody knows what anybody else has sprayed, just that the scent hangs thickly.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used this type of a container before, it may take a little bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Just a few spritzes of the body spray will leave you reeling in a chlorofluorocarbon mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cool looking bottle to appeal to men who are afraid their ‘body spray’ might be confused in the bathroom with women’s perfume</li>
            <li> The scent itself isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how little or how much you spray on the end result</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying very little on, or my wife thinking I took a bath in it.</li>
            <li> It is a tough balance to find different flagrance products to use without smelling like an old man or bottle of bad potpourri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My family and I usually don&#x27;t use any deodorant because we shower at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to describe</li>

            <li> The Fresh Force body spray is exactly that. Fresh. It does not have an overpowering smell like Axe, which I like. I don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying very little on, or my wife thinking I took a bath in it. It is dry, and does not make me feel sticky at all. It also works great in my gym bag! It keeps it smelling nice. You don&#x27;t need a lot, so a little works fine. Keep in mind that this is not an antiperspirant. If you want an antiperspirant, get the matching speedstick: http://www.amazon.com/Speed-Stick-Deodorant-Fresh-Force/dp/B00I0UG4PM/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1HWVCCJ2ZD3ARTX5RPZV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body spray, it goes on well, but the spray, for me, was initially counterintuitive and I found myself spraying my hand because I held it backwards. This only happened a couple of times, and then I finally learned my lesson. I think, for the price, you get good value as well, and since there is a scent matched antiperspirant (also inexpensive), you don&#x27;t need to worry about different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use body sprays, you will probably like it. If you haven&#x27;t, I think it&#x27;s worth a try. :)</li>
            <li> very  good bottle size use it for quick touch ups throughout the day</li>
            <li> I bought some for my husband we both love the smell but it burns his under arms. He has never had this problem before using this. Besides that it smells and works good.</li>
            <li> The fresh smell of the spray is great when putting it on. But it&#x27;s overwhelming to everybody else in the house, even two floor distant. Same principle in the locker room where nobody knows what anybody else has sprayed, just that the scent hangs thickly.</li>
            <li> These body deodorant sprays from Speed Stick Gear are unusual in that they are not traditional underarm deodorants but are intended to be used on the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a very masculine but somewhat medicinal odor that is different than the scent of the equivalent solid anti-perspirant deodorants that I tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend spraying these over the entire body because the scent is strong and long-lasting and could offend those with sensitive noses and would suggest only a short spray under the arms and perhaps a bit on the feet, if necessary. Those with strong body odor should not expect this to completely cover their natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: This body spray is not intended as a substitute for soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★ Clean Peak - elements of citrus and evergreen but somewhat medicinal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★ Fresh Force - elements of lemon &amp; lime but somewhat medicinal</li>
            <li> I got this body spray for my son, because he uses a lot of the Speed Stick brand products. He says that this body spray has a very clean fragrance, and it lasts most of the day. He has tried several other brands of body spray, mostly because of the different scents, but he said that he likes this one the best.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me was I wearing a anew cologne. This smells very good. I like that they came out with a body spray just for men. This is a great add on to the deodorant without it overpowering. Scent lasts long as well. Great after the shower as well. This is great for the summer and gives you a pick me a feeling as well.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent body spray.  Buying things for my son and my husband, they typically like Old Spice or Dove products.  I was worried it&#x27;d smell strange or too powerful (like Axe, those are totally overkill!) but these sprays smell really nice.  My son&#x27;s at the age where he&#x27;s become a stinky boy that now needs deodorant and stuff like this, and he really likes these sprays.  He just puts a little on after taking a shower, and I can still smell a hint of it on him the next morning even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product, we&#x27;d absolutely buy these again.  We might have to make Speed Stick our new favorite brand!</li>
            <li> As someone who has never been a big fan of mens body sprays because of their overpowering scents, this one didn&#x27;t change that opinion.  The scent itself isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how little or how much you spray on the end result is that for the next 30 minutes you will smell nothing else but this which is a no-go for me and my guy.</li>
            <li> Wife bought me some this because she liked the way it smells.  However, it seems that the local stores are no longer carrying it.  So I got on Amazon and ordered a case.  Great stuff...and if the wife is happy...everyone is happy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice accompaniment to the antiperspirant and Deoderant of the same name. Smells great! I would recommend it.  The spray helps me feel nice and smell good all day. Refreshing!</li>
            <li> I look for three things in a body spray; does it work, do I like the smell and does it bother my skin. This lasts the whole day, has a nice scent and feels nice when sprayed on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well. I used it before I went out walking in a park on a hot day and it kept me smelling nice the whole day. The scent is fresh and manly and does not smell like perfume. Finally this felt nice on my body.  The spray feels wet at first but dries quickly. It did not bother my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a nice look. The spray mechanism works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great body spray. I use this body spray every morning before I go to work and also when I go out to eat. This last all day long I would happily recommend this to anybody that likes to smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My family and I usually don&#x27;t use any deodorant because we shower at least twice a day.  However, during traveling, camping, hiking, or long hours spent outdoors, it&#x27;s good to have an effective deodorant to prevent offending fellow travelers and companions.  We tried this Speed Stick Gear Fresh Force Deodorant Body Spray during a day long hike; sprayed it on in the morning and it lasted until early evening.  The scent is fresh and not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s great to keep smelling fresh after a long day, which is more than I can say for some of our hiking buddies.  I immediately recommended this Speed Stick Deodorant to them, especially the guys, who tend to emit strong body odors after sweating.  Ingredients seems harmless: mostly alcohols (may cause dry skin) and fragrances.  Only drawback is the hydrofluorocarbon propellant for the spray which some folks may object to.</li>
            <li> Hubby and I love all Speed Stick products and this one is just the same. He loves the ease of the spray and the bottle design is really fun. I&#x27;ll be picking up more soon!</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try this out. The reason I took it is because I do sweat a bit when out hiking or walking trails with the wife. So I thought I would try this out. I can confirm it works well. It goes on and keeps me cool, it seems to work very well. What I don&#x27;t like about this is the over bearing scent of this spray. It is somewhat medical as one person said. Its hard to describe but I actually won&#x27;t be using this anymore even though it works, because I really dislike the scent of it. If you have a sensitive nose this may not be a good option for you.</li>
            <li> I am not an everyday body spray user, because some I have used in the past have been too strong or competed with the smell of the body lotion I use. It is a tough balance to find different flagrance products to use without smelling like an old man or bottle of bad potpourri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Speed Stick&#x27;s Fresh Force Gear body spray is, for lack of a better pun, a breath of fresh air. The fragrance is not too flowery or bold that it will overpower those standing near you. However, it really does have a fresh aroma that doesn&#x27;t make you stand out in a crowd, but strong enough to make notice at a close distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I really don&#x27;t like about this product is the aerosol delivery package. Just a few spritzes of the body spray will leave you reeling in a chlorofluorocarbon mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a body spray that I could really use everyday after my morning shower and not feel subconscious of overpowering the room.</li>
            <li> I am not a spray DEODORANT (NEVER ANTIPERSPIRANT because it affects my system)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  very strong not unpleasant smell to cover you if you are having a smelly day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  although cool looking, the can in kind of strange, and several time I sprayed it the wrong way ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy again</li>
            <li> This is a great body spray that works really well.  Just spray a little on your body before heading out and it works really well.  It is very easy to use and has a very nice smell that gives you some extra protection to help you smell better.  This works great before going out about town and such.  If you are going to be active I would get a roll on anti-perspirant but for non active things this is the thing for you.  It has been awhile since I have used a body spray but have found myself liking this spray and using it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I tried both the Fresh Force (green color on container) and the Clean Peek (orange color on container) and they couldn&#x27;t be any more different. I liked the Fresh Force, it has a mild but distinct smell which works nicely as a body spray deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Clean Peek body spray deodorant smell was barely noticeable, and this defeats the purpose of a deodorant. On the other hand, I liked the Clean Peek as a solid white anti-perspirant/deodorant. There, the more subtle smell was a plus, since there are different uses for antiperspirants and body-spray deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used this type of a container before, it may take a little bit of getting used to. Unlike the traditional body spray containers where the spraying side is elevated and easy to spot, with these ones, the spray and the button are on the same level, so you have to check to make sure you are pointing in the right direction. There are visual cues, for example, the spray side has a black circle around it, but many people are not fully awake in the mornings :)</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Speed Stick Gear Body Spray, Fresh Force&amp;#34; provided decent protect though-out the day and has a pleasant scent. We gave this to my teen son to use and he has used it everyday, so he must like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> In theory deodorant sprays are better than sticks because sticks leave films on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this spray is a lot more damaging than a pit stain -- this spray contains hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which are environmentally damaging. HFCs  production is rising by 15% per year. HFCs are 3,830 times more potent than CO2 with a lifetime of 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the product itself, it leaves a cleanish smell that is not like a musky male smell or like that of fresh linens; instead, it&#x27;s somewhere in between those two and it dissipated rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the hole in the spray bottle because it makes it easy to put the bottle on a gym bag, etc. But one should not purchase a deodorant based on the fact that the packaging is convenient.</li>
            <li> wow! this stuff is pretty strong,it will sure keep you from any odors after a long day at hard work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what advanced performance is supposed to mean but this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This smells soooo good. Not overpowering, nice and fresh but still masculine. Not perfumey at all. Cool looking bottle to appeal to men who are afraid their ‘body spray’ might be confused in the bathroom with women’s perfume ;) How comforting!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my office for when the summer months take a toll on me and I want to go home smelling fresh. I like that it is a spray, it goes on clean and the nozzle sprays very evenly. I tend to apply it a maybe twice a day, but that is because I am paranoid about giving off a stench. The smell is pleasant, not over bearing. I don&#x27;t really work out so I have not put it to the test, but it does work great for desk jockey&#x27;s with hot offices.</li>
