            <li>I ordered the \\&quot;Haute As Hello\\&quot;, and let me tell you its a gorgeous spring/summer color, as I received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>The color is great, but it took 3 coats to get full.  </li>
            <li>It looks very cheap.</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t go on very smooth.</li>

            <li>But whe using this.color,it showed.as more orange than coral.if u are looking for a.sorbet orange,then this is your color.</li>
            <li>Also it does not give you a nice smooth cover.</li>
            <li>The color is more salmon than it looked on screen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s matte, like a satin finish with no hint of sparkle, shine or gloss without a top coat.</li>
            <li>many Essie colors</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I love Essie.</li>
            <li>I love love love this polish, I bought two just in case.</li>
            <li>Definitely more orange than coral (pinkish-orange)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is okay though</li>
            <li>When you apply 2 shades, the color is perfect (only doing 1 coat</li>
            <li>I gave them one star because I received my order the first time !!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color, but I need three coats next time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;ONE COAT is all is takes, but if that isn&#x27;t enough for you, it won&#x27;t take more than two which is all you need for a good manicure.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this color.</li>
            <li>I love this pretty color.</li>
            <li>First, I love Essie polishes.</li>
            <li>so it takes about 4 coats to show the true color</li>
            <li>fresh manicures every 3 days just doesn&#x27;t fit my schedule.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this color</li>
            <li>and I love essie normally.</li>
            <li>Very pretty spring color...</li>
            <li>I also noticed that without a top coat, it&#x27;s more pink and with a top coat, it&#x27;s very orange.</li>
            <li>I love this color its really cute for summer and lasts a long time I bought two cause</li>
            <li>, it looks good on dark skin n light skin color</li>
            <li>Would be perfect if it was a little more pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright and pink.</li>
            <li>It is a fun color</li>
            <li>I had to use a top coat to get the color to pop and look like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>Essie is.a.great polish,the color looks more coral in their standard essie picture.</li>
            <li>At first I am not quite share to buy which colour, they looks similar.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>it fades SUPER easily from the sun -- the color fades pretty quickly to a lighter pink -- still looks pretty but isn&#x27;t the intended color.</li>
            <li>This fading happens both from sun, AND the color turns a strange orange/develops a yellowish tinge when nailtiques is applied on top of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not get a single streak, it is not lumpy, just be sure you put it on fast and don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li>Dries Fast.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Sender was very on time and all went very well.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a pink color since that is what it looks like online.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed if it goes on slightly bumpy or streaky, after applying 2 coats of polish (then top coat), it dries smoothly &amp; the 2nd coat of polish evens out the streaks.</li>
            <li>Not a good color if you have fair skin.</li>
            <li>still love the color, but wish i had tried to get the same color made by a different brand.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>but it is very much worth the extra work.</li>
            <li>In fact the past 12 nail polishes I have bought are Essie because for the most part they apply and wear very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a medium orange, not too dark, not too light.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s impossible to find the perfect shade online, but my local stores are never well</li>
            <li>Taking it out of the package, it had swirls of deep orange \\&quot;pigment\\&quot; sitting at the top of the bottle, which was really odd for an Essie polish.</li>
            <li>is definitely my least favorite color.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; to it at all -- it&#x27;s completely matte, so you have to put an overcoat of gloss on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cross between coral and peach, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Just beware this nail polish is not pink but ORANGE!</li>
            <li>It was very streaky and after a couple days it looked like some spots were orange and some pink.</li>

            <li> Just beware this nail polish is not pink but ORANGE!</li>
            <li> It was very streaky and after a couple days it looked like some spots were orange and some pink.</li>
            <li> The color is ehh, but I knew that after using 3 coats to get maximum opacity it probably wasn&#x27;t going to last long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I needed 3 coats because the polish streaked, so I would recommend that you let each coat dry completely before you apply another.</li>
            <li> It is streaky and chalky and chips in less that 24 hours (and I apply top coat and baby my nails-I usually get at least 3 days no chips from other colors).</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this color for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I wanted a pink</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uneven and sheer).</li>
            <li> The polishes typically last 1-2 weeks without chipping (assuming you use base &amp; top coats, which I do).</li>
            <li> So, from the picture this nail polish look pink!</li>
            <li> One coat is extremely translucent.</li>
            <li> and there was some other paint color on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure I want to give this as a present..</li>
            <li> It has a dull finish as if it had been diluted with nail polish remover to make the product go further.</li>
            <li> It looked like watered down nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find anything that even slightly resembles it from another brand.</li>
            <li> Not at all typical of an Essie polish.</li>
            <li> It looks a little juvenile, like taffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This can be a little streaky and dries a little dull.  </li>
            <li> and it is already chipping pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, won&#x27;t buy nail polish online again.</li>
            <li> You may need a few coats and it isn&#x27;t the fastest drying nail polish but the color is to die for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin and requires a few coats to achieve the look I desire.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the polish is very thin</li>
            <li> I have bought Essie before, but this stuff has no shine and it is like they put finger nail polish in it because maybe it was thick and out of date.</li>
            <li> I would return it if I could, but unfortunately I already paid for shipping and it is not worth returning.</li>
            <li> The consistency was very thick and would not glide on the nail.  </li>
            <li> I will still wear it, I&#x27;m just found it a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The formula is very thin compared to all of my other Essie polishes, so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it applies and wears HORRIBLY.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate the color but orange</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this polish.</li>
            <li> What horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> This is the worst nail polish ever.</li>
            <li> This is the worst finger nail polish I have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this color its really cute for summer and lasts a long time I bought two cause its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> So, from the picture this nail polish look pink! I wan&#x27;t expecting to get an orange peach colored nail polish in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate the color but orange is definitely my least favorite color. Just beware this nail polish is not pink but ORANGE!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. I have yet to find anything that even slightly resembles it from another brand. The only complaint that I have is the polish is very thin so it takes about 4 coats to show the true color but it is very much worth the extra work. Have been wearing it for about 2 weeks now and it has not chipped.</li>
            <li> I bought this color after googling some images of it, it is prefect for summer, or for nail design. It is a fun color and I also placed a matte coat over it n it looks awesome, it looks good on dark skin n light skin color</li>
            <li> Essie is.a.great polish,the color looks more coral in their standard essie picture. But whe using this.color,it showed.as more orange than coral.if u are looking for a.sorbet orange,then this is your color.</li>
            <li> Not a good color if you have fair skin. It looks very cheap. Also it does not give you a nice smooth cover. I would return it if I could, but unfortunately I already paid for shipping and it is not worth returning.</li>
            <li> The color is more salmon than it looked on screen. Would be perfect if it was a little more pink. Of course it&#x27;s impossible to find the perfect shade online, but my local stores are never well stocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s matte, like a satin finish with no hint of sparkle, shine or gloss without a top coat. It looks a little juvenile, like taffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many Essie colors, it&#x27;s opaque in one coat. Dries Fast. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE COAT is all is takes, but if that isn&#x27;t enough for you, it won&#x27;t take more than two which is all you need for a good manicure. I did not get a single streak, it is not lumpy, just be sure you put it on fast and don&#x27;t hesitate. Like I said, it dries fast.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same color as Tart Deco but I still love it. And it is a good thing because I just ran out of tart deco! It is a great coral color and I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Sender was very on time and all went very well.  Quite satisfied.[[ASIN:B003NYI9OY Essie Summer 2010 Collection Nail Colors, Haute As Hello #722]]</li>
            <li> I loved this color in the salon and had to buy it. Although I think the color is great, i wish i had known the following:&lt;br /&gt;1.) there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; to it at all -- it&#x27;s completely matte, so you have to put an overcoat of gloss on&lt;br /&gt;2.) it fades SUPER easily from the sun -- the color fades pretty quickly to a lighter pink -- still looks pretty but isn&#x27;t the intended color. This fading happens both from sun, AND the color turns a strange orange/develops a yellowish tinge when nailtiques is applied on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love the color, but wish i had tried to get the same color made by a different brand.</li>
            <li> I gave them one star because I received my order the first time !!! I purchased Essie Haute as Hello from this business. The quality of the product is disappointing. It has a dull finish as if it had been diluted with nail polish remover to make the product go further. The owner contacted me and promised to replace it, She Never Shipped me a replacement ! What horrible customer service. I will never give her business and I hope you don&#x27;t because the product is not like what you can buy in a local store. Next time I will just go to CVS for Essie !</li>
            <li> I love Essie. In fact the past 12 nail polishes I have bought are Essie because for the most part they apply and wear very well. I was excited about this color. It is a great summer coral. Unfortunately it applies and wears HORRIBLY. It is streaky and chalky and chips in less that 24 hours (and I apply top coat and baby my nails-I usually get at least 3 days no chips from other colors).</li>
            <li> I ordered the \\&quot;Haute As Hello\\&quot;, and let me tell you its a gorgeous spring/summer color, as I received many compliments on it. My only complaint is that I needed 3 coats because the polish streaked, so I would recommend that you let each coat dry completely before you apply another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color, but I need three coats next time.  I&#x27;m happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color! It&#x27;s a cross between coral and peach, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;And Essie is a good brand.</li>
            <li> This is the worst nail polish ever. The color is not even close to what it should be.  It actually looked like two different colors in the bottle even after shaking it.  The consistency was very thick and would not glide on the nail.  In the garbage it went.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this color for a very long time! I was so happy to see it was online. Perfect color!</li>
            <li> I bought this item here on amazon and I did not see it in the stores before I bought it.  The nail polish has a somewhat orange tint to it that it doesn&#x27;t show on the picture online.  I thought it would be more of a pink color since that is what it looks like online.  I will still wear it, I&#x27;m just found it a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was not the quality that I expect from Essie. It looked like watered down nail polish. Not satisfied, won&#x27;t buy nail polish online again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! It pops</li>
            <li> Beautiful! A pinkish coral color. I love love love this polish, I bought two just in case. You may need a few coats and it isn&#x27;t the fastest drying nail polish but the color is to die for!</li>
            <li> This is a great spring peach.  The color is great, but it took 3 coats to get full.  This can be a little streaky and dries a little dull.  I had to use a top coat to get the color to pop and look like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and have already used it. Taking it out of the package, it had swirls of deep orange \\&quot;pigment\\&quot; sitting at the top of the bottle, which was really odd for an Essie polish. Application? One coat is extremely translucent. It took 3 coats to give me maximum opacity. Not at all typical of an Essie polish. The formula is very thin compared to all of my other Essie polishes, so I was disappointed. The color? Definitely more orange than coral (pinkish-orange) .. it&#x27;s a medium orange, not too dark, not too light. UPDATE 5/28! I am very disappointed in this polish. 2 days in and it is already chipping pretty badly. The color is ehh, but I knew that after using 3 coats to get maximum opacity it probably wasn&#x27;t going to last long. I don&#x27;t know that I will use this color again, fresh manicures every 3 days just doesn&#x27;t fit my schedule. I also noticed that without a top coat, it&#x27;s more pink and with a top coat, it&#x27;s very orange. I have never had an Essie polish like that before and I do not like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and pink. I love it. I get a lot of compliments all the times with this nail polish</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this color but it just didn&#x27;t go on very smooth. It was very streaky and after a couple days it looked like some spots were orange and some pink. Maybe I got a bad bottle but I was not impressed and I love essie normally.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color... You&#x27;ll only need two coats of polish... Very pretty spring color... The brush coats your nail evenly... Can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a great, soft-coral perfect for spring time manis!! Received oodles of compliments on it and think it works well with all skin colors.</li>
            <li> I love this pretty color. It&#x27;s a little thin and requires a few coats to achieve the look I desire.</li>
            <li> What i got in the mail was not what i was expection. I wanted a pink but instead it came as an orange. It is okay though</li>
            <li> First, I love Essie polishes. The polishes typically last 1-2 weeks without chipping (assuming you use base &amp; top coats, which I do). When you apply 2 shades, the color is perfect (only doing 1 coat it&#x27;s uneven and sheer). This is a great coral color that is a bit more orange in person than in this picture. I am very pleased with the shade &amp; the polish. Don&#x27;t be alarmed if it goes on slightly bumpy or streaky, after applying 2 coats of polish (then top coat), it dries smoothly &amp; the 2nd coat of polish evens out the streaks.</li>
            <li> This is the worst finger nail polish I have ever purchased. I have bought Essie before, but this stuff has no shine and it is like they put finger nail polish in it because maybe it was thick and out of date. I will never buy from this company again. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> At first I am not quite share to buy which colour, they looks similar.&lt;br /&gt;But this #722 is flash, bright, like spring flower.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this product was that it bothered me when I opened the packaging and there was some other paint color on the bottle. And it won&#x27;t come off. Not sure I want to give this as a present..</li>
