            <li>I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li>Its wonderful but a bit too big for my makeup bag</li>
            <li>Check the Sigma site for their list of authorized amazon sellers to make sure you get an authentic one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>this brush is great, no shedding, its super fat and distributes the powder so well, and also it doesn&#x27;t hold too much powder.</li>
            <li>As usual, sigma exceeds all my expectations, i absolutely love all your brushes, they are the best quality brushes i have ever used, including the MAC brushes i have used.....love it!!!</li>
            <li>For the price and quality, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I just love sigma brushes i cant have  too much.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft &amp; easy to care for!</li>
            <li>I own over 25 Sigma brushes and this is one of my daily favorites!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very SOFT and very well constructed!!!</li>
            <li>It is so big and super soft, inspiring me to order several more Sigma brushes, which are in the mail as we speak!</li>
            <li>I love how big this brush is!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is wonderfully soft and full.</li>
            <li>With a couple taps, the powder goes on sheer and evenly, but is easily buildable.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush, it&#x27;s soft and blends out my powder extremely well!</li>
            <li>It did the job, but I would&#x27;ve preferred a softer and more airy application for my loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks sigma.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cake, but it just brushes gently over the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was using a real techniques brush before this, and it was scratchy and felt almost like it had split ends.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have any problems with Sigma brushes shedding.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy and dense but very soft.  </li>
            <li>Using this as a powder brush after the Flat Kabuki Sigma F80 gives the exact look I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>Dense and large enough to pick up and softly buff a sunkissed glow on my face but soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and the shedding is very very minimal.</li>
            <li>I really love this brush, it&#x27;s big &amp; fluffy.</li>
            <li>The constant hairs on my face had me going  back to the reviews here to see if I was alone, and although only a few report the same frustration, one reviewer noted it was much better after having washed it.</li>
            <li>I tried to fluff and gently shake the brush in a way that would remove any loose hairs in case that happened when it was new, but no luck.</li>
            <li>a bit of fallout after first few washes</li>

            <li> It is very large and fluffy and it doesn&#x27;t shed!!</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because sometimes it does leave tiny black hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> so its probably because its such a big fluffy brush</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> and hopefully the loose hairs out, I gave it a thorough wash,</li>
            <li> left black hairs on my face, and in my sink.</li>
            <li> Have other sigma brushes I purchased from sigmas website.</li>
            <li> It use it as a body brush and it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Though you&#x27;ll never get a real heavy coverage with this, obviously.</li>
            <li> problem with this brush boils down to two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles bled black when I washed it.</li>
            <li> When my fluffy MAC brush started to lose a hair every once in a while, I thought I&#x27;d take the opportunity to try out</li>
            <li> Use this everyday for applying setting powder&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> let it air dry properly, and was as disappointed as I was before - still black hairs every time I used</li>
            <li> This is a really fluffy yet dense powder brush!</li>
            <li> , I actually uttered the words &amp;#34;I HATE this brush&amp;#34; (hence the 1 star with that hate to love association).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush was denser than I was hoping for (or at least used to with my MAC brush).</li>
            <li> Really expensive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible fallout of the bristles!  </li>
            <li> Terrible brush.</li>

            <li> This brush is so perfect. It is so big and super soft, inspiring me to order several more Sigma brushes, which are in the mail as we speak! Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I love how big this brush is! Perfect for putting on translucent powder. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because sometimes it does leave tiny black hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year. Horrible fallout of the bristles!  Every application I end up with bristles on my face. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As usual, sigma exceeds all my expectations, i absolutely love all your brushes, they are the best quality brushes i have ever used, including the MAC brushes i have used.....love it!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible brush. Have other sigma brushes I purchased from sigmas website. I think this was a knockoff. Doesn&#x27;t feel like the same quality. The bristles bled black when I washed it.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush, it&#x27;s big &amp; fluffy. I use it to apply my face powder.</li>
            <li> I just love sigma brushes i cant have  too much. This brush applies powder like a dream. The bristles are super soft and the shedding is very very minimal. The shipping was fast. Thanks sigma.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these brushes. This powder brush is the perfect size, it holds the product well and stands up to washing.</li>
            <li> I use this for setting my foundation with a setting powder and it works great!  This brush is HUGE! You can cover a lot of area in a short amount of time.  The bristles are very soft and luxurious. After the initial wash, I have not noticed ANY shedding!  Lovely brush!</li>
            <li> I own over 25 Sigma brushes and this is one of my daily favorites! I use this brush daily to sweep away concealing setting powder. This brush is huge!! It&#x27;s very SOFT and very well constructed!!! I have not had any problems with shedding or issues with bristles falling out. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush! I would recommend this brush to anyone and would buy it again if needed!!!</li>
            <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> When my fluffy MAC brush started to lose a hair every once in a while, I thought I&#x27;d take the opportunity to try out one of the Sigma brushes a YouTube makeup gal had over the top recommendations for. But sadly, this brush felt like such an effort to try to love - by my wits end, I actually uttered the words &amp;#34;I HATE this brush&amp;#34; (hence the 1 star with that hate to love association).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this brush boils down to two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Every. single. brush stroke. left black hairs on my face, and in my sink. I tried to fluff and gently shake the brush in a way that would remove any loose hairs in case that happened when it was new, but no luck. The constant hairs on my face had me going  back to the reviews here to see if I was alone, and although only a few report the same frustration, one reviewer noted it was much better after having washed it. After a week of use to let it get it out of its system, fluffing it and hopefully the loose hairs out, I gave it a thorough wash, let it air dry properly, and was as disappointed as I was before - still black hairs every time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The brush was denser than I was hoping for (or at least used to with my MAC brush). It did the job, but I would&#x27;ve preferred a softer and more airy application for my loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I returned this item which seemed to be defective.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday for applying setting powder&lt;br /&gt;Has a bit of fallout after first few washes but I have mac big brushes that do the same thing so its probably because its such a big fluffy brush</li>
            <li> Using this as a powder brush after the Flat Kabuki Sigma F80 gives the exact look I have been looking for.  It doesn&#x27;t cake, but it just brushes gently over the skin.  It is extremely soft and fluffy.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I loved this brush, it&#x27;s soft and blends out my powder extremely well! For the price and quality, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful.  It use it as a body brush and it works extremely well.  The bristles are sturdy and dense but very soft.  Amazing combination.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma!!! The material and quality is just great..</li>
            <li> Really expensive...I was expecting something better. The quality of this brush is almost the same as the ecotools kabuki one I have</li>
            <li> this brush is great, no shedding, its super fat and distributes the powder so well, and also it doesn&#x27;t hold too much powder.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful but a bit too big for my makeup bag but over all its a very good brush to use.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft &amp; easy to care for! So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Sigma brushes! I was using a real techniques brush before this, and it was scratchy and felt almost like it had split ends. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderfully soft and full. Applies powder evenly and beautifully. Feels great against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding, but I also haven&#x27;t washed it yet. I normally don&#x27;t have any problems with Sigma brushes shedding.</li>
            <li> As described. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my go to bronzer brush. Dense and large enough to pick up and softly buff a sunkissed glow on my face but soft on my skin. I really, really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a pressed setting powder. With a couple taps, the powder goes on sheer and evenly, but is easily buildable. Though you&#x27;ll never get a real heavy coverage with this, obviously. Check the Sigma site for their list of authorized amazon sellers to make sure you get an authentic one.</li>
            <li> This is a really fluffy yet dense powder brush! I absolutely love it. I probably will even purchase the larger one as well.</li>
            <li> I had seen this brush used many times on yt videos, and I see why great brush, shipped quickly I would order another too!</li>
