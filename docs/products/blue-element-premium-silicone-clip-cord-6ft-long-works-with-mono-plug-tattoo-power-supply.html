            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Shipped and arrived in 3 days. You can feel the quality in this cord. The only difference in the cord I received is that though the cord is still blue, the grip is red and black. But it works and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>

            <li> Awesome cord! I like the look and feel of it. Works great and its an awesome color blue. Just what the picture shows</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> The clip cord don&#x27;t even work. Not returning it cause I don&#x27;t have the time to go buy a box, pack it, pay for the shipment to be sent back and wait for another one to come that won&#x27;t work either...</li>
            <li> Hooks are too long. They fall over and ground to the machine when turned to the side.</li>
            <li> Present so no complaints yet</li>
