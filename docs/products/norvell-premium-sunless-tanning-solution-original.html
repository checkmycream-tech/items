            <li>The BEST tanning spray I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>great stuff!</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t but still covered great.</li>
            <li>Norvell is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, worked well&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>It was a good buy.</li>
            <li>The title didn&#x27;t specify what color it was but came in original bronzing which is perfect.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this solution!</li>
            <li>Great product, smooth transaction, A++ seller, thank you</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful golden brown tan color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>Everyone seems to love the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be able to use this product myself at home.</li>
            <li>I had owned a spa and salon and have tried many spray tan lotions for airbrush tanning, and quickly made Norvell my exclusive brand.  </li>
            <li>This is great for very light skinned clients who don&#x27;t want heavy color.</li>
            <li>For full results, set time is 8 hours to overnight.  </li>
            <li>The color was nice, definitely not a dark tan.</li>
            <li>They have re-formulated so it no longer has that funky &#x27;smell&#x27; that sometimes accompanies spray tans the next  day on your skin, huge plus!!  </li>
            <li>I love all Norvell products but this is by far my favorite color its very natural looking</li>
            <li>I prefer the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; blend for me and most other people, it will compliment the most variety of skin tones, taking the guesswork out of what level color to use and no need to add additives.</li>
            <li>Was a great color when it was first applied but when it dried overnight it turned pretty orange.</li>
            <li>It is a predictable, natural and beautiful color and results.  </li>
            <li>Was also very streaky as it wore off.......</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for someone with light skin who doesn&#x27;t mind that the tan is going to fade almost entirely within 4 days.</li>
            <li>You can get usually a full week plus last ability of your tan before needing to exfoliate and do over.  </li>
            <li>It did not make me look like Snooki from the Jersey Shore &amp; for the older generation</li>
            <li>I was sprayed on Thursday night and by Monday the tan had faded almost completely.</li>
            <li>even natural looking tan</li>

            <li> so I was afraid of the dark color.</li>

            <li> Not streaky, doesn&#x27;t have a harsh odor, self adjusting, natural color.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love this solution! I use it on a wide variety of my clients. Everyone seems to love the color. No streaks no orange tint.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! The title didn&#x27;t specify what color it was but came in original bronzing which is perfect.</li>
            <li> It did not make me look like Snooki from the Jersey Shore &amp; for the older generation I did not, I repeat did not in any way resemble an Oompa-Loompa.  It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Was a great color when it was first applied but when it dried overnight it turned pretty orange. Was also very streaky as it wore off.......</li>
            <li> Solution was expired and dented. Not worth the money at all. Very unhappy with this purchase. I won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a spray tan machine and have been experimenting with different tanning solutions. Based on reviews, I ordered this brand. I was sprayed on Thursday night and by Monday the tan had faded almost completely. I have plenty of experience caring for a spray tan so that wasn&#x27;t the problem. The color was nice, definitely not a dark tan. I have very light skin so I was afraid of the dark color. This wasn&#x27;t dark at all. I would recommend this for someone with light skin who doesn&#x27;t mind that the tan is going to fade almost entirely within 4 days.</li>
            <li> The BEST tanning spray I&#x27;ve used! It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes and doesn&#x27;t leave me blotchy after a couple of days like all the others!</li>
            <li> This is great for very light skinned clients who don&#x27;t want heavy color. It builds nicely, not orangey on very white skin.</li>
            <li> I love all Norvell products but this is by far my favorite color its very natural looking and I am faired skin.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  Doesn&#x27;t look orange. Applies well with airbrush gun.</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth transaction, A++ seller, thank you</li>
            <li> I had owned a spa and salon and have tried many spray tan lotions for airbrush tanning, and quickly made Norvell my exclusive brand.  It is a predictable, natural and beautiful color and results.  I prefer the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; blend for me and most other people, it will compliment the most variety of skin tones, taking the guesswork out of what level color to use and no need to add additives. For full results, set time is 8 hours to overnight.  They have re-formulated so it no longer has that funky &#x27;smell&#x27; that sometimes accompanies spray tans the next  day on your skin, huge plus!!  It is a wonderful product.  You can get usually a full week plus last ability of your tan before needing to exfoliate and do over.  You do not need to go heavy when spraying or overlap too much, doing so will only build up the cosmetic bronzers, not the self-tanner, resulting in blotching spots. ..great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great smell. I&#x27;ve tried a number of sunless sprays. Others have gone on darker and felt sticky. This didn&#x27;t but still covered great. I do wish it was a tad darker.</li>
            <li> Norvell is a great product.  This color is so-so to me.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, but I did open it and rub a little on my skin. The color is a beautiful golden brown tan color, not orange at all. The reason I purchased this brand was because my salon uses it, so instead of paying $30 per tanning session I&#x27;d be able to use this product myself at home.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked well&lt;br /&gt;Nice even natural looking tan</li>
