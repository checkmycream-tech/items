            <li>She was so happy to find out that I had not only gotten her Cherry Softlips, but that I had gotten her so many!!</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be 6 tubes (3 packs) or 12 tubes (6 packs) ...</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm, and I keep them stashed everywhere.  </li>
            <li>And such a great price!</li>
            <li>love the cherry flavor with a hint of mint -- refreshing without overpowering.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it around town anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It felt like the balm just laid on top of my lips</li>
            <li>I have used softlips lip balm for years and just love it .</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t find them in the store any more.</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>Love this product and love the cheap bulk pack.</li>
            <li>It works great and makes lips incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It also smells good, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Puts a nice shine without feeling too greasy and has the added sunscreen to help in the hot summer days.  </li>
            <li>They feel the best on my lips, not too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>Along with another reviewer, I also didn&#x27;t exactly know how many tubes I would be receiving.</li>
            <li>I like Carmex best; soft lips is a close second.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Soft Lips lip balm keeps my lips soft and has a great taste.  </li>
            <li>The shipping is also reasonably quick.</li>
            <li>The cherry scent is heaven and it has a mild effervescent feel to it.</li>
            <li>and they keep her lips feeling good all day long!</li>
            <li>I love Soft Lips!  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy feeling or waxy, go on very smooth and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>but there aren&#x27;t as many options when purchasing from Amazon but came here mostly because the local drugstores are very inconsistent with their stock as well.</li>
            <li>These have SPF 20 sunscreen and menthol which gives it just a bit of a kick when you first put it on, but it isn&#x27;t too strong and seems to really help keep lips</li>
            <li>but I have had trouble finding it in stores at times and was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and in bulk to boot!</li>
            <li>I love the big bulk quantity you can buy!</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make this better on Amazon is if you could mix and match flavors.</li>
            <li>I will try pomegranate next. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although Amazon offered several flavors of SoftLips cherry is my favorite</li>
            <li>I decided to get this in bulk for my first year in college so that I&#x27;ll never run out/if I lose any, I&#x27;ll have backup.</li>
            <li>This product seems to have been discontinued, so I was very excited to see that I could purchase a large quantity for a low price.</li>
            <li>I got it really fast after I ordered it, and at a very comparable price!</li>
            <li>It seems like they used to sell this two pack at more stores, now I can only find it with one of the good lip balms like this and another one that is shimery and not nearly as good of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now I have a good supply which might be really important as we are already having extreme winter conditions in the first half of December here in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found this online and saw that I could get her 12 tubes for less than they would cost individually in the store, making it</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it does not last well on my super dry lips, I love the flavor and the high SPF which makes it a perfect summertime lip balm.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this product online.</li>
            <li>-- it really takes a toll on my lips.</li>
            <li>This is a better deal than you will find in the stores, and the product is as expected.  </li>
            <li>But when I put it on my chapped lips it didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>and now I know I can always get it from Amazon at a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Even when I lived up north this was the only one that could quickly heal my lips.</li>
            <li>After placing the order, I got my package two quick days later and found 12 tubes!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love how long 12 last for.  </li>
            <li>I could not be happier with the price and the ease of getting only what I wanted delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>I can go from lightly cracked lips, to back to normal in a day or two with regular applications.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal because when I go to Walmart to buy these, they are always out or they only have the kind that have one regular and one frosted (and I hate the frosted/lip tint ones).</li>
            <li>SoftLips is my favorite lip balm but sometimes it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>Also great in the winter to protect from chapping in the cold.  </li>
            <li>like this lip balm because it works so well, is pleasant tasting, and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty aftertaste as so many of the flavored lip balms do.</li>
            <li>If this was full price I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li>I have used many other lip balms, this is by far the best!!!Have used this for at least five years, will continue to use it in the future.</li>

            <li> My girlfriend only uses this brand and flavor of Softlips lip balm. However, we can never find this flavor anywhere. I was so happy when I found this online and saw that I could get her 12 tubes for less than they would cost individually in the store, making it so she has one for every month of the year!!! She was so happy to find out that I had not only gotten her Cherry Softlips, but that I had gotten her so many!! Thanks for selling this product online.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have been able to find. Not sticky, gummy, and tastes great. Since in stores you can only buy one lip balm with one tinted lip gloss now - this is the way to go if you want only the lip balm. I could not be happier with the price and the ease of getting only what I wanted delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> As a life long user of lip balms, I&#x27;ve settled on Softlips. They feel the best on my lips, not too heavy or sticky. The six pack seemed a little excessive at first but I just scatter them all over the place and now I always have one handy. Not a huge fan of cherry flavor but there aren&#x27;t as many options when purchasing from Amazon but came here mostly because the local drugstores are very inconsistent with their stock as well.</li>
            <li> I love the big bulk quantity you can buy! It&#x27;s impossible to get them at Walmart or Target, they only have the fancy ones in stock or whatever. Love this product and love the cheap bulk pack.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over department stores for this product but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  I can&#x27;t go without this.  I love this product and I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> 6 x 2 &#x3D; 12 tubes Awesome!!     When I ordered this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be 6 tubes (3 packs) or 12 tubes (6 packs) ... because of the way they post the quantity - Pack of 6     This is a great deal because when I go to Walmart to buy these, they are always out or they only have the kind that have one regular and one frosted (and I hate the frosted/lip tint ones). Or Shopko, when you can find them, one pack is $4. Ouch.     The only thing that could make this better on Amazon is if you could mix and match flavors. I learned, on here, that there are more flavors than vanilla and cherry! I will try pomegranate next. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, and I keep them stashed everywhere.  I was pleased to be able to buy them in bulk, at a great price.</li>
            <li> Best flavor of all the soft lips! Only place I can get it is on Amazon! And such a great price!</li>
            <li> Soft Lips lip balm keeps my lips soft and has a great taste.  Puts a nice shine without feeling too greasy and has the added sunscreen to help in the hot summer days.  Also great in the winter to protect from chapping in the cold.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without Softlips!</li>
            <li> Softlips is great. I&#x27;m torn between Softlips and Burt&#x27;s Bees, but you can&#x27;t argue with a deal like this. I used them as part of a goody bag for a small get together of girl friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, there are 6 packages x 2 chapsticks each &#x3D; 12 chapsticks total</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I can use where it&#x27;s not too thick or waxy feeling. It&#x27;s also the only one which actually prevents dry chapped lips. I use it all the tube and keep one stashed throughout the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Softlips for years to prevent the usual winter chapped lips situation. Dry heat indoors, cold wind outdoors -- it really takes a toll on my lips. The trick is to stay ahead of it, and start moisturizing BEFORE the dry cracklies appear. For me, that means applying Softlips several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cherry flavor with a hint of mint -- refreshing without overpowering. I&#x27;ve tried other flavors, but this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying &amp;#34;in bulk&amp;#34; means that I won&#x27;t run out before spring. Great deal here on Amazon. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but the person loves this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item several times over the past few years.  I love how long 12 last for.  This is a better deal than you will find in the stores, and the product is as expected.  If you like Softlips lip balm, this is a good buy for sure. The shipping is also reasonably quick.</li>
            <li> 12 softlips for less than $20??? Awesome deal. I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but this is the ONLY lip balm that will work for me. They go for $3/ea at the local drugstores here in CO. Can&#x27;t thank you enuff for this awesome deal on a truly awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have used many other lip balms, this is by far the best!!!Have used this for at least five years, will continue to use it in the future.</li>

            <li> I buy this product in bulk I love it so much.  It can be hard to find at my local drugstores so I stock up on Amazon.  It isnt sticky at all, and there is no color tint.  It also smells good, but not too much.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I&#x27;d recommend this to all of my friends.  Love it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not last well on my super dry lips, I love the flavor and the high SPF which makes it a perfect summertime lip balm.</li>
            <li> This item was on sale at the grocery store for $1.29 so I figured that I would try it out. I thought it smelled amazing! But when I put it on my chapped lips it didn&#x27;t really do much.My lips were still chapped. It felt like the balm just laid on top of my lips and it didn&#x27;t moisturize them or anything. When I put my lips together I could feel my chapped lips.If this was full price I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It seems like they used to sell this two pack at more stores, now I can only find it with one of the good lip balms like this and another one that is shimery and not nearly as good of a moisturizer. I can go from lightly cracked lips, to back to normal in a day or two with regular applications. Even when I lived up north this was the only one that could quickly heal my lips. Too bad it is such a feminine looking product. It works so well though. Just don&#x27;t leave it in your car, it will melt and leave a greasy puddle.</li>
            <li> SoftLips is my favorite lip balm but sometimes it is hard to find in the stores. Now I have a good supply which might be really important as we are already having extreme winter conditions in the first half of December here in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this lip balm because it works so well, is pleasant tasting, and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty aftertaste as so many of the flavored lip balms do. These have SPF 20 sunscreen and menthol which gives it just a bit of a kick when you first put it on, but it isn&#x27;t too strong and seems to really help keep lips protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Amazon offered several flavors of SoftLips cherry is my favorite and now I know I can always get it from Amazon at a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Along with another reviewer, I also didn&#x27;t exactly know how many tubes I would be receiving. After placing the order, I got my package two quick days later and found 12 tubes! So excited! I decided to get this in bulk for my first year in college so that I&#x27;ll never run out/if I lose any, I&#x27;ll have backup. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used softlips lip balm for years and just love it . It is not heavy feeling or waxy, go on very smooth and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lip balm! It is not greasy, but it does add shine. The cherry scent is heaven and it has a mild effervescent feel to it. I wear it over my 24hr lip color, because it adds moisture and shine. I have been using it for years but I have had trouble finding it in stores at times and was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and in bulk to boot! Now I have 12 tubes of it to go through.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these things. We can&#x27;t find them in the store any more. So when I found this deal, I had to buy for her! She loves the feel of these and they keep her lips feeling good all day long!</li>
