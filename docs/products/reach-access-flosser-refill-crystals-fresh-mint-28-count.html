            <li>I love the Reach flossers, so I bought them online.</li>
            <li>I got the mint-flavored ones and am more than satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>and I found I could get more food out between my teeth than using the string floss alone.  </li>
            <li>They have a mint taste which is okay</li>
            <li>I just wish there were more refills in the packs.</li>
            <li>i love these flossers, have been using them for about 5 years, i think they may have been discontinued so i shall stock pile them and the handles.</li>
            <li>Now when I think about flossing I&#x27;ll have one more reason to do it...</li>
            <li>If I would have known I think I should looked around town more.</li>
            <li>And the fresh minty flavor makes it a treat, Good job.</li>
            <li>These things are so much better than floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad not to have to deal with that anymore.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Not me, but I&#x27;m now doing it using the Reach &amp;#34;toothbrush size&amp;#34; flossing device given to me by my dentist, and I love the mint taste on these floss refills.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Very Useful!  </li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m glad to be able to find it, I hope J &amp; J won&#x27;t discountinue such a great product soon.</li>
            <li>The flosser are easy to snap on the flosser when I use it.  </li>
            <li>love this product and it is easy to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>easy to use in the reach power flosser.</li>
            <li>You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible.</li>
            <li>They worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Received product really quick!</li>
            <li>cartridge should be used once and then thrown away, but even using one a day these remain a fairly cheap option, given the added convenience they offer.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so used to Prime 2-day shipping which wasn&#x27;t available for this.  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I used to dread flossing, but these make it super easy and</li>
            <li>Great product and wish more people would use it because maybe the price would come down.</li>
            <li>would hihhly reccomrnd this to every one who want to keep clean teeth</li>
            <li>Just snap on a floss head and clean those teeth.</li>
            <li>The peppermint flavor was different from the originals they replaced, and it was a pleasant effect.</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest way to get flossing accomplished, and the mint flavored floss is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li>These have really helped me floss better.</li>
            <li>convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The mint is a little strong, but the disposable flossers are great.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and speeds up the whole flossing process.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so if you think you are getting a good price, carefully examine the shipping cost, purchased 12 of these</li>
            <li>love this flosser, works better than any other I have ever used.</li>
            <li>, she was right</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a very large mouth</li>
            <li>The replacement Reach floss items arrived quite quickly and were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>reach flossers are alwayus right there,whenever you&#x27;d like to use it which is a huge plus as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is very tasty!</li>
            <li>He has been using an Access Flosser for more than 5 years and loves it, especially the mint refills!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there is not a whole lot to say about the refill cartridges themselves, I cannot help but assert that the Reach Access Daily Flosser is by far the best flossing product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>I found much better deals on Amazon than in local stores!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It works exactly how it should.</li>
            <li>My husband loves these much better than regular floss.</li>
            <li>I was having real difficulties and had tried several products but this proved to be the one I was able to use and it works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just so easy to floss after every meal - I actually look forward too it.</li>
            <li>I go through therese flossers almost daily as I find it easy to just pick up the flosser(withouty</li>
            <li>Handle gives much better control than loose floss.</li>
            <li>They hold up to my tight spaces well and they have a nice minty</li>
            <li>I have teeth that are very close together</li>
            <li>I had problems trying to get the bridge flossed using my hands, but these make the job much easier</li>
            <li>After using it for a while, I&#x27;m really hooked.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than just the string floss.</li>
            <li>I buy this product very often because the battery operated flosser I had before went broke and doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these anywhere other than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Companies have tried making special floss and special gadgets to help make the chore a little easier, but none of them really do the job well- until</li>
            <li>2 days might not be realistic but over a week and a day after the shipping window is unacceptable to me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch from Dentek floss I could easily find at my local Walgreens, but it would slip out and would be left dangling from my tooth.  </li>
            <li>The price through Amazon was reasonable and now I&#x27;m back to flossing every day.</li>
            <li>AMAZON has such a variety and the prices are very competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>beware of this seller, complete rip off on shipping by AmericanWholesale - Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li>So much easier than regular floss.</li>
            <li>Then Johnson &amp; Johnson developed the Reach flosser and</li>
            <li>My dentist originally introduced Reach Access Flosser to me as an alternative to getting my wisdom tooth removed  since using ordinary flosser just couldn&#x27;t reach that far.</li>
            <li>but they get the hard to reach spots and are easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>My only improvement suggest is to make the refils a little stronger so they would not break so easy and could last one use.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I floss all the time now, it is less time consuming than the old finger and floss technique and not only am I happier using this little gem, my dentist is as thrilled as I am.</li>
            <li>Using them I&#x27;ve gone from having my dentiist tell me how bad my gums are to her telling me they look great.  </li>
            <li>Now it is so easy it is just ridiculous to think of not flossing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO a “cart full” of stuff at your usual and then re-do it on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>
            <li>Use to buy this at walgreens, and they got hard to get, I was happily surprised that the price and accessibility were right</li>
            <li>Not only is it much easier to floss than the ordinary flosser, it can reach far enough to ensure complete dental hygiene that I now only need two preventive cleaning a year just to keep it in check.  </li>

            <li> Not only is it much easier to floss than the ordinary flosser, it can reach far enough to ensure complete dental hygiene that I now only need two preventive cleaning a year just to keep it in check.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected and works for my needs, it was packaged well and would recommend to any needing the same product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I cannot do without them. They are included in my daily routine.  Twice a day or more before brushing my teeth I use these in my motorized Reach flosser.  My only improvement suggest is to make the refils a little stronger so they would not break so easy and could last one use.  Sometimes I have to use two or more for a one time use.</li>
            <li> By far the best flossing product I&#x27;ve ever used.This is actually my second order so it works great! Better than putting your finger in your month.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is very tasty!</li>
            <li> Love these flossers. My daughter turned me onto them when she worked for J and J and I have been hooked ever since. My dentist is always impressed when I go in for a cleaning. I hate flossing and these are so easy to use that I don&#x27;t hesitate. They are a bit pricey and the instructions say to throw them away after one using but they last a week if you rinse them off after you use it each time.</li>
            <li> these flossheads are great they nake flossing your teeth as easy as brushing!</li>
            <li> Very Useful!  Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I floss all the time and these are great!  They hold up to my tight spaces well and they have a nice minty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only small complaint is the 2 flavor pads on each fall out all the time.</li>
            <li> The replacement Reach floss items arrived quite quickly and were reasonably priced. The peppermint flavor was different from the originals they replaced, and it was a pleasant effect.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from a rare neurological disorder called Transverse Myelitis. It has left him with limited function of his hands making the use of regular dental floss next to impossible and not very effective. He has been using an Access Flosser for more than 5 years and loves it, especially the mint refills!</li>
            <li> These have really helped me floss better. The mint is an added bonus. I&#x27;ll use these forever!</li>
            <li> I used this type of flosser and for some reason I stopped.  Probably because the refills seemed so expensive.  The price through Amazon was reasonable and now I&#x27;m back to flossing every day.</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart &amp; Walgreens have been sold out of these for several weeks.  I love the Reach flossers, so I bought them online.</li>
            <li> It is benefIcial to use</li>
            <li> These little floss packs hhave singlehandedly helped my gums.  Using them I&#x27;ve gone from having my dentiist tell me how bad my gums are to her telling me they look great.  Not to mention how much less painful dr visits are now!</li>
            <li> This is the only floss that I will use.  All the regular flosses cut into my fingers because I have to work hard to get it between some tight spaces.  This flossing system works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t break when faced with the tight spots.  Great product and wish more people would use it because maybe the price would come down. Only downside is that it&#x27;s pricey.  The price advertised here is best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I have teeth that are very close together so the only way I can floss is by using the Reach Dental Flosser along with these snap-on refills. I got the mint-flavored ones and am more than satisfied with them. The hardest part was GETTING them as they are, unfortunately, often out of stock.</li>
            <li> The flavoured cartridges are preferable to the unflavoured, but I suppose that is a matter of personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is not a whole lot to say about the refill cartridges themselves, I cannot help but assert that the Reach Access Daily Flosser is by far the best flossing product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, flossing is annoying.  Companies have tried making special floss and special gadgets to help make the chore a little easier, but none of them really do the job well- until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach Flosser puts the individual floss cartridge on a toothbrush-style stick (which you can get in motorised or non-motorised formats)  The cartridge stays put and allows you to floss every tooth in your mouth in about as long as it takes you to brush, if not faster!  No fussing with sticking your fingers into your mouth, or fighting to get some gadget to hold the floss properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each cartridge should be used once and then thrown away, but even using one a day these remain a fairly cheap option, given the added convenience they offer.  In other words, you can spend a couple bucks on a \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; floss roll and rarely use it because it is annoying, or you can spend a few cents a day on these and have a cleaner, healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> I love these replacement flossers!  I found much better deals on Amazon than in local stores!! Received product really quick!</li>
            <li> I had problems trying to get the bridge flossed using my hands, but these make the job much easier and I found I could get more food out between my teeth than using the string floss alone.  They have a mint taste which is okay but hardly noticed because the floss does not remain in my mouth a long time.  I plan on buying them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Nice flavor. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The Reach flosser is awesome. I just wish there were more refills in the packs. I floss twice a day so have to buy often. But this product works great.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest way to get flossing accomplished, and the mint flavored floss is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li> AMAZON has such a variety and the prices are very competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO a “cart full” of stuff at your usual and then re-do it on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try isn’t it?</li>
            <li> great flossing product in the mint flavor. beware of this seller, complete rip off on shipping by AmericanWholesale - Amazon Marketplace. so if you think you are getting a good price, carefully examine the shipping cost, purchased 12 of these and they charged me $21.00 for dropping them into a 75c envelope and mailing it. so i could have just pulled them off the rack at walgreens. i love these flossers, have been using them for about 5 years, i think they may have been discontinued so i shall stock pile them and the handles.</li>
            <li> These are sort of expensive but they get the hard to reach spots and are easy to travel with. I use one daily and my dentist hasn&#x27;t complained yet!</li>
            <li> Good thing I got these flavored. Now when I think about flossing I&#x27;ll have one more reason to do it...I probably wont...but I&#x27;ll think about it</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time flossing due to my mouth being narrow. Regular floss just isn&#x27;t an option. These things work great and are exactly what I needed. I haven&#x27;t been able to find these anywhere other than Amazon. Will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Refreshing taste of mint while you floss! Along with brushing your teeth it feels like you just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> So much easier than regular floss.</li>
            <li> I purchased the flosser refill pack because I have a battery operated flosser.  The flosser are easy to snap on the flosser when I use it.  Once I&#x27;m done I use a tissue to pop off the flosser and throw it away.  The Flavored flossers aren&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Fits and works great.</li>
            <li> I used to dread flossing, but these make it super easy and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The mint is a little strong, but the disposable flossers are great.</li>
            <li> Good product but watch out the shipping and handling will get you. If I would have known I think I should looked around town more.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended these.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!!  Enough said!</li>
            <li> product is as advertised</li>
            <li> Been using these for several years instead of regular floss.</li>
            <li> Over a week to get something that could have been put in an envelope with a couple of stamps doesn&#x27;t make sense.  I have gotten so used to Prime 2-day shipping which wasn&#x27;t available for this.  2 days might not be realistic but over a week and a day after the shipping window is unacceptable to me.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely cynical money making scheme. Compare this product with the Flossaid Floss Holder which doesn&#x27;t require purchasing overpriced refills. You end up spending a huge amount more with this than you do with alternative floss holders, which is wonderful for this company, which is trying (and succeeding) to suck as much money from you as possible. Don&#x27;t be fooled like a consumer zombie--by some saner floss holders that don&#x27;t require buying overpriced refills.</li>
            <li> My dentist originally introduced Reach Access Flosser to me as an alternative to getting my wisdom tooth removed  since using ordinary flosser just couldn&#x27;t reach that far. After using it for a while, I&#x27;m really hooked. Not only is it much easier to floss than the ordinary flosser, it can reach far enough to ensure complete dental hygiene that I now only need two preventive cleaning a year just to keep it in check.  Unfortunately, the replacement flosser snap on seem to have disappeared from local drug store or grocery store and Amazon seems to be the only place I can find the replacement snap-ons. So while I&#x27;m glad to be able to find it, I hope J &amp; J won&#x27;t discountinue such a great product soon.</li>
            <li> Used with the Reach handle it makes flossing a snap. And the fresh minty flavor makes it a treat, Good job.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was having real difficulties and had tried several products but this proved to be the one I was able to use and it works.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch from Dentek floss I could easily find at my local Walgreens, but it would slip out and would be left dangling from my tooth.  Reach does not do this, and so from now on I will continue to use Reach!</li>
            <li> Rapid delivery time, good quality</li>
            <li> Item arrived ahead of schedule.  All is well at our household now and hopefully I will continue to use these items on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> ordered these  and i think they are a good product and work&lt;br /&gt; with ease ..i will be ordering them again</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Again I don&#x27;t use them but my wife does. in order to save any money we had to buy several packs.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t floss if I don&#x27;t have these. So much easier to use than just the string floss. That stuffs too frustrating and I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised; no issues.</li>
            <li> exactly as they were listed and fit J&amp;J flosser perfect</li>
            <li> love this product and it is easy to clean your teeth. would hihhly reccomrnd this to every one who want to keep clean teeth</li>
            <li> These things are so much better than floss. I used to try to use floss and get it stuck in between my teeth. I&#x27;m so glad not to have to deal with that anymore.</li>
            <li> I buy this product very often because the battery operated flosser I had before went broke and doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  Any questions?</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.  These are getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> They worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I love these things. Makes flossing easy!</li>
            <li> I have always hated flossing myteeth. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s just...awkward, trying to get your fingers and a pieve of string in your mouth between your teeth. Then Johnson &amp; Johnson developed the Reach flosser and WHOA...what a difference this little invention made. Not only do I floss all the time now, it is less time consuming than the old finger and floss technique and not only am I happier using this little gem, my dentist is as thrilled as I am. I now keep a Reach flosser and refills in my desk at work...it&#x27;s just so easy to floss after every meal - I actually look forward too it. And the flavor is great and leaves a light, clean and minty taste in your mouth. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just snap on a floss head and clean those teeth. Handle gives much better control than loose floss. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flosser head, what can I say? It works exactly how it should. Buy it and floss your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a few years with good results, because they are so easy to use.  The only drawback is their relatively high price for such a simple device!</li>
            <li> Use to buy this at walgreens, and they got hard to get, I was happily surprised that the price and accessibility were right on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this flosser, works better than any other I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Would like to see a lower price on this excellent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected and works for my needs, it was packaged well and would recommend to any needing the same product.</li>
            <li> Who likes to floss?  Not me, but I&#x27;m now doing it using the Reach &amp;#34;toothbrush size&amp;#34; flossing device given to me by my dentist, and I love the mint taste on these floss refills.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say. It is a simple replacement product and it works.</li>
            <li> Happy to find these. Not in our stores. Good shipper.</li>
            <li> Wrestling with floss is a nightmare, especially with numb, painful hands (and long nails!).  These are wonderful.  My package was short one head, but that happened at the factory, not with the seller.  No biggie.  I&#x27;m still thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> Great product. great price. Can&#x27;t find anywhere in stores</li>
            <li> easy to use in the reach power flosser. I bought both and use them daily. Great job in getting them to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> I love my Reach flosser and was so sad to find out they stopped making them!! My dental hygienist had suggested I look on Amazon.com for them. Yippee...I did, she was right and I bought three packs of them!</li>
            <li> I use these allot and they work great. Go through about one a week. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and the dentist says I have zero pockets or at least very few thanks to my daily flossing. Could do without the mint flavor, but it is gone after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I go through therese flossers almost daily as I find it easy to just pick up the flosser(withouty having to get regular floss which is hard for me to use,especially on my back molars)&lt;br /&gt;The reach flossers are alwayus right there,whenever you&#x27;d like to use it which is a huge plus as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is so easy to use and speeds up the whole flossing process.  I don&#x27;t have a very large mouth so getting my fingers in there to floss was such a chore.  Now it is so easy it is just ridiculous to think of not flossing.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these much better than regular floss. Great price too! These can be rather hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry this item has been discontinued. It helps me want to floss. I hope they reconsider bringing it back.</li>
