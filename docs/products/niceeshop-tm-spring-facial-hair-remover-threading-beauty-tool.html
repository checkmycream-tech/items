            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>2)Roll fingertips away from you, like your telling someone to go away, lol,  </li>
            <li>but i am happy with it.</li>
            <li>but all in all it was i am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but I looked them up on line and it was great</li>
            <li>For two dollars this works great.</li>
            <li>Works great once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>

            <li>For a buck it&#x27;s a great deal.  </li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>My friend showed me this product and said how great it was so</li>
            <li>I will buy more for gifts!!</li>
            <li>Bellabe is very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>I do think it is a very effective way for................ripping the hair from your flesh.</li>
            <li>This tool is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool!</li>
            <li>It does an OKAY job... not an excellent one!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t successfully remove ANY hair.</li>
            <li>Really liked it!</li>
            <li>Youtube is your friend :P</li>
            <li>How come these aren&#x27;t popular!?</li>
            <li>Rotating one hand worked best for me for most of parts, but it might be about my curve.</li>
            <li>So inexpensive, yet so effective!</li>
            <li>For the price, it is a nice hair removal tool to have in my arsenal!</li>
            <li>I was successfully using it within 5 minutes of opening it and am impressed by how smooth my face feels after 5 days.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the best with the fine hairs,</li>
            <li>It takes some practice and playing with it get good at it</li>
            <li>But if you place some ice around the area you plan on getting rid of the hair, then you are good to go.</li>
            <li>Good for on the go when you don&#x27;t have time to stop in for a lip wax or do an at home wax.</li>
            <li>Also good for peach fuzz without having to wax.</li>
            <li>It good for removing face hair.  </li>
            <li>I am still trying to figure out how to use it correctly, but it seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Does not catch the hair good</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Good Price but not for me.</li>
            <li>I use it, but maybe sterilizing it with rubbing alcohol before and after every use is a good idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li>so i guess i have to practice to get good at it.</li>
            <li>It was really good</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Quality wise too.</li>

            <li>those who can&#x27;t use waxing or shaving because of sensitivity, this is really a good tool.</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>Good for this price.</li>
            <li>Good product could have received sooner works well also could have had instructions with</li>
            <li>They work as good as rem spring.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>But it is awesome and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Works  good</li>
            <li>but once you do, it is a good way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>but it works good</li>
            <li>The product is good but the time it takes to get every hair I could have just swiped a razor across.</li>
            <li>And u have to go over areas repeatedly to get everything over all it good</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>

            <li>I am going to buy more as gifts!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>:) who ever invented this is the coolest person ever!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>great price, easy to use.</li>
            <li>great product, but the spring breaks easily</li>
            <li>Works like threading, great for removing the fine baby hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have fine fuzzy hair on my chin and lip, and it works great on it.</li>
            <li>Came in perfect condition and is a fairly large product ( It is longer than my hand).</li>
            <li>But on the bright side, it works better than everything I have ever used, you will get used to the pain after a while.</li>
            <li>This hair removal tool is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>this honestly world amazing</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so cheap and affordable and a great alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT is amazing.</li>
            <li>takes off all my chin hair and mustache works great good product worth the price you pay</li>
            <li>Threading tools are wonderful and work very well.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything from this product.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipper kindly included a bracelet and a card.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product every women should own.</li>
            <li>You have to learn to maneuver it effectively.</li>
            <li>I recommend having a pair of tweezers handy for any stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of learning how to manipulate it effectively, and like tweezing and waxing, there is some discomfort involved.</li>
            <li>but for good results in under 5 minutes.. I will gladly endure it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove every hair, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>can not in good faith give it a rating of &#x27;i love it&#x27;</li>
            <li>It took me an hour to really learn the best way to use this tool, even after watching a youtube video.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all over you tube tryin to figure out how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>In time you might get use to the feeling, kind of the way plucking your eye brows gets easier, but I have not used it that often.</li>
            <li>The coils of the spring are thicker and did not do as good of a job gripping hairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective in some areas but did not deliver the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>It works really well, it&#x27;s a shame that doesn&#x27;t come with an instruction, but when you learn how to use it, works perfectly, doesn&#x27;t heart at all..</li>
            <li>You can watch videos to learn, but you&#x27;ll develop your own technique.  </li>
            <li>It was surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>the pain kind of reminds me of tweezing or the threading method but its worthit</li>
            <li>kind of.  </li>
            <li>this is nice.  </li>
            <li>It came really fast and it works great!!</li>
            <li>But once i figure how to use it i liked it..</li>
            <li>This is a nice product to remove lots of hair at once.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get the hang of how to use it, and honestly sometimes I feel like I can get it to work, and sometimes I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It does work, but even picture directions would be nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this handy tool</li>
            <li>and you need kind a play around to find out how to use it efficiently.</li>
            <li>nice price.</li>
            <li>I also own the myspringit from myspringit.com</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t take off ALL the hair.</li>
            <li>this is a nice adjustment.</li>
            <li>Which is good because I was very excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it is a easy product to use, they do include pictures.</li>
            <li>quick lol</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy-</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I use it while watching TV.</li>
            <li>But the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get use to it and not feel pain!</li>
            <li>I tried tweezers, but it made me cry and those fine hairs are a lot in number wise</li>
            <li>I have used this product with great success.  </li>
            <li>So far so great!</li>
            <li>By far, I guess Bellabe is the best that I have used</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about two years now, so far it&#x27;s the best thing I have found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly WAY better than tweezers.</li>
            <li>and it is so much better and effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m proud that I took this chance because it was worth it.</li>
            <li>so I gave it to my mom who has awesome skin and her face is as smooth as a babies bottom overall a great product.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly think that the one I ordered here on amazon for $14 dollars cheaper is the much better product.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is this does a great job I honestly use it at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase not only because it works, but the price was awesome..</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and for me, painless too!</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>i say its good but not that good for some certain spot on ur face.</li>
            <li>as good as the original R.E.M spring.</li>
            <li>Very good for removing upper lips and chin hairs, but not so good for removing forehead hairs.</li>
            <li>and  had great success and love this product and the price under $1&#x27;00</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>worked great for the first 2 minutes..</li>
            <li>this is a great hair romover!takes off the hairs fast !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not for precise use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around for this after a friend said to get one and was very happy to get such a good deal.</li>
            <li>You bend it so the springs have space in them, then unbend/ roll and it just pulls out all your fine hairs!</li>
            <li>The item is very cheaply made and the spring looks like an industrial spring.</li>
            <li>Very cheap product.</li>
            <li>This is a life saver also very cheap</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very much handy.</li>
            <li>product is super affordable and works just as good as the pricier competitors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s portable and works well and very cheap :)</li>
            <li>They were very polite and I am very satisfied with is product!</li>
            <li>And the size was oddly HUGE!</li>
            <li>This product is an excellent idea, I just wish it worked better on the short stubble that is courser.</li>
            <li>I may get it to work better after a while,</li>
            <li>No instructions came with it at all, and if I hadn&#x27;t read many reviews, I would not have figured it out.  </li>
            <li>If I were you, I&#x27;d stick to something that will for sure pull from the root/pore whatever.</li>
            <li>i would buy more</li>
            <li>The best part is this was only a couple bucks!</li>
            <li>This product, for removing facial hair, worked great!</li>
            <li>Getting two more of these.</li>
            <li>for the most part works well...</li>
            <li>What more to say?</li>
            <li>Amazingly simple concept, perfect for peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>like I mentioned, it&#x27;s way better than waxing</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I think if I watch some instructional videos I will like it even more.</li>
            <li>Works as well as the  more pricey hair removers</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Best facial tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Im kinda weirded out by this ordered because it was interesting.</li>
            <li>Most of all, I do not have to use my tweezers, which I can&#x27;t seem to find because I&#x27;m forever misplacing ;P.  </li>
            <li>:) You&#x27;ll drop a couple of tears in the process.</li>
            <li>This pulls your hair out for sure</li>
            <li>It pulls many hairs at once.</li>
            <li>I also love the affordable price.</li>
            <li>I bought 5 more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Removes facial hair wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>i was expecting for it to work better, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>It works okay</li>
            <li>its the most inexpensive thing ive ever purchases and kept.</li>
            <li>so I had to take a break every so many times.</li>
            <li>Many reviews indicated this hair removal system caused pain but not for me.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more for gifts to my family and girlfriends.</li>
            <li>It hurts like the dickens, especially at first.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s getting better by every use .I</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine that they would be any better.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>ordered 2 just to be safe</li>
            <li>I noticed it doesn&#x27;t work on most of the hair</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Threading tool worked okay.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m sure that these threading tools are all made in China.  </li>
            <li>the thicker the hair the more it hurts.</li>
            <li>I find that it works better on coarser hair, by the way.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and plan on getting it again if it brakes. :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It hurts more than it takes out hairs.</li>
            <li>it cheap an nice.</li>
            <li>I have ZERO complaints what so ever!! :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this threading tool.  </li>
            <li>I bought 5 to start with and ordered 10 more.  </li>
            <li>I gave them to friends who love them.  </li>
            <li>I love that it pulls hairs out from the root.</li>
            <li>Even a tweezer is better than this.</li>
            <li>unless you really love pain, you wouldn&#x27;t want to experience using this, trust me.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely not the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Better than using chemicals.</li>
            <li>But maybe it was just more wishful thinking.</li>
            <li>Love the product and it pulls out all the hairs</li>
            <li>I love love this item.</li>
            <li>If you keep going over the hair, though, you would probably be able to remove it all.)  </li>
            <li>just love everything about it....</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>not in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>i WISH IT WORKED BETTER</li>
            <li>But I love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Threading cleans your face so much better.</li>
            <li>These work better than the battery-powered type, but the handles fall off almost immediately.</li>
            <li>It works but it hurts more than waxing...</li>
            <li>It hurts a lot more than just getting it threaded.</li>
            <li>but hey its really cheap and works!</li>
            <li>I love this and for a doller?</li>
            <li>If you can tolerate the pain:-)...</li>
            <li>if you have a low pain tolerance like me, it might not be the best thing to use.</li>
            <li>The REM spring is a better tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li>this is an okay product....</li>
            <li>Quality seems okay though</li>
            <li>I just ordered five more for gifts to family and friends.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more for myself.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing or threading.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and i was trying to find a better solution.</li>
            <li>I think shaving makes hair more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Because shaving made it more noticeable and my skin irritated a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have orderd more for my aunt</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for me, however, so I can&#x27;t rate it better.</li>
            <li>I love the Spring hair remover.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works okay, did pull out most of the hair, but will need to get use to the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay........</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>most places, you will need to bend/curve the device for use, though the degree in which you bend the device depends upon the location it&#x27;s being used the the type of hair to be removed.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, with more stubborn hairs, the device will need to be placed at an angle before use, depending upon the hair&#x27;s growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have both kinds and have been using the rem for more than an year.</li>
            <li>shipping was okay.</li>
            <li>However, it will get most if you repeat the threading technique about five or six times per area.</li>
            <li>I WILL LOOK TODAY FOR A COUPLE MORE CD&#x27;S</li>
            <li>THIS THING WORKS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li>OK..</li>
            <li>I was even able to get those hairs that have a tendency to get in grown.  </li>
            <li>After this review I am ordering 5 more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was very happy and buy a second one for my sister.</li>
            <li>Not terribly.</li>
            <li>I like this way better than tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li>This thing works and i love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still a fan :)</li>
            <li>this is so cheap and effective.  </li>
            <li>Springs have more gap, that&#x27;s why its not pulling any hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>What bothered me the most was that it&#x27;s like 25 dollars for 8 ozs.</li>
            <li>This is so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap and has amazing results.</li>
            <li>Better to invest on some wax.</li>
            <li>but i never pulled hair from my top lip</li>
            <li>Not that great and doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li>one more tip</li>
            <li>I have waxed before and that hurts so much more.  </li>
            <li>Okay, maybe it is me, but this thing is awkard and coming with no directions, I had to look up on the internet how to use the dang thing.</li>
            <li>glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use wax any more...</li>
            <li>Takes practice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Although the way the condition of the item itself seem as if someone opened it at the edge of the top corner.</li>
            <li>SO YOU WONT BE ABLE TO READ THE DESCRIPTION</li>
            <li>but after sometime i found that my hairs getting more thicker and thicker.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I suggest you save your money or buy a better one.</li>
            <li>Threading with a thread does a better job.</li>
            <li>I love this tool and will order more to gift my sisters:-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The best thing I used to remove hair from my upper lip.</li>
            <li>My face is SO smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but</li>
            <li>It will hurt but it does get better.  </li>
            <li>part is very easy and front of chin is also easy.  </li>
            <li>It gets all the hair out and it easy very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is very useful and handy if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>When you get the hang of it its quick and you get use to it real easy.  </li>
            <li>So simple yet it works very nicely!</li>
            <li>Eh, doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as the original brand.</li>
            <li>Easy, cheap, effective.</li>
            <li>This device is very flexible and easy to control it works great</li>
            <li>A pretty good tool, all in all.</li>
            <li>It worked really good the first time on the lips to remove hair but haven&#x27;t mastered the sides of the face with it.  </li>
            <li>Give your face a good go around the first time and then its just maintenance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but it just hurts so much!</li>
            <li>a great fun and useful gift.</li>
            <li>It hurts more and sometimes grabs your skin when removing the hair and sometimes it leaves a rash where the hair was removed from and also it easily gets rusted and not durable at all.</li>
            <li>I now can do this quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>The cheap ones work just as well as the more costly ones:-)...</li>
            <li>Very cheap and very worth it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work , tweezers are more accurate and faster</li>
            <li>My sister introduced me to this product and so far I am happy.</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is makeup/oil free... to get the all unintended hair off your face...</li>
            <li>love the free shipping, no damage to the package at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its brilliant and women should stop getting threaded and waxed for facial hair besides eyebrows and get one of these babies.</li>
            <li>The package came early, and the product was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best $1 i ever spent.</li>
            <li>This cheap tool is good for getting cheek hair, but doesn&#x27;t do a good job on upper lips and chins.</li>
            <li>This product quickly pulls the hair out and leaves the area nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, fast shipping, always available, easy to use, good size packaging, good brand name.</li>
            <li>While a teenaged boy would be pleased and excited about entering this state, I am not.</li>
            <li>It cool!  </li>
            <li>I love this item, unique concept.  </li>
            <li>It hurts at first but given the results I am sure I will get used to it!</li>
            <li>It works easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it was easy.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>These seem to break easily.</li>
            <li>you bend it, and the stuff falls out easily</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to clean it and take care of the areas that you pluck :)</li>
            <li>but what can I say beauty is pain for the price it can&#x27;t be beat and is easily portable and stops you from looking like SHEMAN...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also breaks easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use one or two very quick wax strips than sit there and pull my hair 10 at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes the hair and its really easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is exceptionally easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to use once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product does not come with instructions but it&#x27;s easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>I had to look up videos on how to use it correctly but after that it was easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>this was so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;cleared</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think that the product is easy for carry and i can have that any time with me.</li>
            <li>As I said, it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>treading is really easy with it.</li>
            <li>you gotta be strong when ou use this because it will hurt.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect about this item, all I knew is that I was kind of scared to try it.</li>
            <li>Cheap but really doing a good job removing fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for the low price and on top of that, free shipping.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it will hurt as first (JUST THINK THREADING)</li>
            <li>a nice cheap tool, better than plucking your whole face, and wasting a lot of money to wax.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I liked it.</li>
            <li>Totally user error, but it works that great to grab those hairs and remove them quickly and easily!</li>
            <li>When I compared the 2 springs, Bellabe is bright and shiny and new.</li>
            <li>that is fine and longer.  </li>
            <li>they were fine</li>
            <li>its easy to use, cheap, and removes hair.</li>
            <li>did not get the product for this, but you should note that you should not get this if you are expecting to to fine plucking of eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me with fine hair, forget it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working just as fine.</li>
            <li>but this one is fine till now.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;slight curve works fine often</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I tweeze my brows and am fine with that.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working just as fine.</li>
            <li>but this one is fine till now.</li>
            <li>if you have just fine baby hair, go for it.  </li>
            <li>The product works fine.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>i love this and its so quick</li>
            <li>it was super easy--I just bent it and blew on it--voila!  </li>
            <li>Going quickly did seem to help a bit, and if nothing else got more hair out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works well and is a great alternative to the other, more costly brand, and a good way to determine if you will like it without spending as much money.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, for more reasons than one!</li>
            <li>It may work ok for baby fine hair but the spring is too large for more stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>This little thing might be cheap, but it has worked great for me!</li>
            <li>Send instructions so I can do an accurate review of the product.</li>
            <li>My Mom liked it so much she ordered 10 of them for her co-workers.</li>
            <li>Its dirt cheap</li>
            <li>my skin was smooth, no blotchiness, but i did break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and works as designed.</li>
            <li>But overall the product work great.</li>
            <li>Even if shipping was FREE...</li>
            <li>Bellabe also comes in a reusuable tube that I can store my hair remover and is very convenient and handy.</li>
            <li>This was REALLY CHEAP.</li>
            <li>It works really well to remove hair, I tryed it on my face and it kind of hurts</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great beuty device and it arrived before the estimated time.</li>
            <li>Could have been my error but hurt more than it was worth to try to figure it out.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a cheap buy</li>
            <li>I found this tool, for a fraction of the price, with free shipping.</li>
            <li>With it being so cheap I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>But if youre looking to smooth your face</li>
            <li>This is so cheap, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy this.</li>
            <li>Also it is easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>it leaves my lip silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Yeah it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I got it through a promotion and was a great deal, so I am sharing my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>In this case it is: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!&amp;#34;  92 cents and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I just saw price because it was cheap</li>
            <li>More than worth the money.</li>
            <li>But it was really cheap, guess you get what you pay for in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it gets all of the unwanted peach fuzz without having to wax the whole face.  </li>
            <li>But for a cheap option I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li>But considering how cheap it is</li>
            <li>i honestly can&#x27;t take much pain.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a cheap alternative to remove those peach fuzz from your face, no complaining there ^^</li>
            <li>it was cheap and i just wanted to try it and see how it was.</li>
            <li>Once you do it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>That would make it more worth the pain.  </li>
            <li>;, because for this price and with a free shipping you might want to try, as it just might work for you.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hair free for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>but oh well, it was cheap</li>
            <li>I figured why not since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I have another product very similar, which works great.  </li>
            <li>The plastic endings are cheaply made but what can you expect?</li>
            <li>This thing gets the hair by the roots and your face is smooth.</li>
            <li>When finished, I can&#x27;t get over how smooth my face looks.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap</li>
            <li>A lot of people say that, cheap stuff from china is junk.</li>
            <li>I ordered one off eBay for about a dollar and free shipping, so even if it hadn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li>I am light skin</li>
            <li>cause it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It it wasn&#x27;t so cheap</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin felling smooth.</li>
            <li>I like it, cheap quality</li>
            <li>it was cheap, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does hurt a great deal above and just below the lip--actually brings tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li>... fabulous?</li>
            <li>it is so cheap</li>
            <li>I guess it requires more finesse than I have because I wasn&#x27;t really able to work it very well.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for something better but will use this very inexpensive tool until I find something better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better alternative for me hair disolving creams because most hair removal creams irritate my skin, and also, I dont have time for waxing very often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still impressed with the number of hairs this has been removing and how smooth I&#x27;ve been looking, though I may still need to tweeze a few of the courser hairs.  </li>
            <li>but more importantly everyone has had a lot of fun with them....</li>
            <li>It is good for peach fuzz, but I don&#x27;t think that it does as well on  hair that is a bit more coarse.  </li>
            <li>This came in very handy for when I don&#x27;t have time to go to the salon and get my upper lip waxed.</li>
            <li>it removes hair easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to using this tool, it is so easy and quick</li>
            <li>your hairs are out like that so easy and quick</li>
            <li>I dont even use it , if you think that it will take your hair off quick and easy dont buy this .</li>
            <li>Also once you get the swing of it, the process is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>found it super easy to use.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and much faster than plucking.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this product so I highly recommend this for anyone who is trying to get rid of their girl stash</li>
            <li>all in all though, the product came super fast and the price is amazing for what it does.</li>
            <li>It took 2-3 weeks to receive but it was definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Great for long travel, and if anticipate grooming needs.</li>
            <li>But with this price I am sure that you can afford to replace it once in a while ;)</li>
            <li>but once you have the hang of it, it&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>so I did some research online and found out the original one costs a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this instead of the original REM spring.</li>
            <li>Just wish it would pull more than two or three hairs at a time (was interested</li>
            <li>Worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this.</li>
            <li>Okay i first decided to buy thins thing</li>
            <li>Okay when i first opened the box i was like what the hell is this??</li>
            <li>I originally had the R.E.M. Spring</li>
            <li>ONCE it came in the mail I was excited to get rid of the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>You have to pull on it a bit to clean it and it just popped off.</li>
            <li>I clean it everytime</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m able to do it on my own and regularly without leaving my house or paying money for.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but it&#x27;s absolutely NOT pain free.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a brown bubble folder but it works well and is super cheap.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I do this while I watch TV and eventually my face is super smooth.  </li>
            <li>To clean, just pull the ends apart and blow.  </li>
            <li>I also clean it with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Love the price; would have liked it if the instructions were in English though</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason it doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars is because I feel like it doesn&#x27;t pull cleanly from the root sometimes (rips from the surface,</li>
            <li>A bit bulkier than the other product of kind, but it is still effective.  </li>
            <li>but as a product I didn&#x27;t find nothing too special.</li>
            <li>oh lord it most certainly did.</li>
            <li>Excellent for getting those stubborn hard to reach hairs in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Better if hair is kind long.</li>
            <li>but for now, it only pulls hair good</li>
            <li>The product is good, but my personal problem is</li>
            <li>Feel free to laugh at my expense, I deserve it.</li>
            <li>I did not have good results with this type facial hair remover.</li>
            <li>really though the pain goes away the more often you use it.</li>
            <li>so it is more intense.</li>
            <li>Another reason I did not give it full stars is that it can cause acne on your face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>Works really good on upper lips.</li>
            <li>but there not they really do work I will buy more as needed</li>
            <li>am so full of pain and regret.</li>
            <li>Good for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>Better than the wax job and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I gave these out as christmas gifts last year and everyone really loved them.  </li>
            <li>I love i so much that I bought 8 of them.</li>
            <li>Delivery was good, but instructions in Chinese so bomber.</li>
            <li>Eventually ordered the real thing and am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>this saves me so much money and time. :)</li>
            <li>I laughed when I saw it because it was so big.</li>
            <li>Love this so much much</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product</li>
            <li>This tool is advertised as being NOT painful.  </li>
            <li>Overall its good product not a necessity in life but for the price why not?</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sufficient to remove my hair on face :)</li>
            <li>Learning to make it function properly but think it is a good tool.</li>
            <li>its really good for upper lips.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34;, but not nearly as bad as waxing or tweezing.  </li>
            <li>not bad anyway</li>
            <li>Anw, the result is not bad.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product, just a bit tricky to figure out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this right now.</li>
            <li>This item didn&#x27;t pinch too much and was able to grab the hairs and remove them quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so quick and easy to remove hair and it saves you soon much time!</li>
            <li>but it does a nice job on those fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li>Hurts like the dickens, but works great &amp; is extremely inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m following the instructions that I downloaded on YouTube, but perhaps I&#x27;m not doing something right or the light facial hair that I have, isn&#x27;t the type that this works best on.</li>
            <li>Happy to be free of messy waxing or chemical bleaching.  </li>
            <li>Seriously this is one of the greatest things ever invented.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product it hurt, but it did remove all the fine hairs that I have been struggling to remove for years.</li>
            <li>I guess I could super glue it.  </li>
            <li>both ends quickly.  </li>
            <li>Both springs are trash worthy from the start.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with any directions but a quick look online shows you how to use it.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am lucky in one aspect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the more I use it the more facial hair will be removed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick considering that it came from overseas.</li>
            <li>IF im lucky.</li>
            <li>Such a simple concept, and so inexpensive, but it works great!</li>
            <li>Will most likely order more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll go quick.</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Packed adequately for contents.</li>
            <li>This is a quick way for me to remove unwanted hair without having to go to the salon and wait 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>but again...I quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li>That being said, this is great for someone who needs just a quick little clean up.</li>
            <li>By the way, the hairs it doesn&#x27;t get are easier to pluck because they are pulled out a bit more than they normally would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But hey it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>:) Oh if you use it often, try getting a new one in about 6 months.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and really effectiv.</li>
            <li>The product is okay but doesn&#x27;t do a good job at removing small hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to use and dont pull too much.</li>
            <li>I ordered it, came after 2 months and it has barely been used as I dont find them useful and effective.</li>
            <li>and its so easy and fast.</li>
            <li>and I had to plan around it, because the red marks were even more noticeable than the hairs were!</li>
            <li>Just pay the extra money for a better product!</li>
            <li>It grabs hairs pretty well, but you just have to take your time!</li>
            <li>Hurts like a bitch at first, but it does the job!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I get occasional thicker hairs that show up on my neck and chin, and this EASILY removes most of them.</li>
            <li>The first time it is used hurts a good deal, but after that, daily use is quite pain free and really convenient.  </li>
            <li>I think they are a great little gift.</li>
            <li>This little tool was so effective that I bought two more and gave one to my sister.  </li>
            <li>I bought this without very high expectations, I thought its cheap why not...</li>
            <li>Although visibly I don&#x27;t see as much hair, my face isn&#x27;t smooth.  </li>
            <li>There is a reason this thing is so cheap guys, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>tweezing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put soothing lotion on afterwards to calm the area.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it, but bought it either way because it was cheap and there was no shipping/tax fee included.</li>
            <li>It grabs all but the very tiniest hairs and leaves you smooth and mustache free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I think its worth the buy</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>My old epicare tool is lot better</li>
            <li>It does sting, but the pain is so worth it.</li>
            <li>This device works best on long or semi long hair not on short(stubble)</li>
            <li>Its not even worth spending a $</li>
            <li>Kind of like a hand held personal epilady.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>however, i have not had much success with them.</li>
            <li>but I rarely see it.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth the wait.</li>
            <li>paid only a few cents for it plus free shipping, so the price was excellent!</li>
            <li>this is far better</li>
            <li>Effectively removes hair if used properly.  </li>
            <li>This works better than I expected , it hurts but it does work , all my friends love using it</li>
            <li>I use this for the peach fuzz on my face to give my face a softer look and make my face makeup look more natural.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to try just for fun, but don&#x27;t have expectations like you&#x27;ll have a face threading session.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make it useful.</li>
            <li>Great for old lady peach fuzz as well as those occasional whiskers!  </li>
            <li>Can hurt as it pulls out the hair but is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I only paid $0.67 (free shipping).</li>
            <li>but it gets the job done and is worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth the money you save by not having to go get it done</li>
            <li>but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth it to save 90% of your money though.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless I think its a good investment if you&#x27;re looking for something fast and convenient although it&#x27;s not entirely painless.</li>
            <li>had friends try it without any success.  </li>
            <li>Kind of think tweezing a bunch of hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I should have know by the value that this was not what it is even worth.</li>
            <li>So worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>But it works so well that it&#x27;s worth the pain.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a useful hair removal tool, then I would recommend buying the R.E.M...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li>The pain, for me, was a bit much at first (especially right under my nose) but it gets easier and easier until you find yourself sitting in front of your computer screen rolling this over your upper lip for fun!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied but not overly excited about this product.</li>
            <li>I learn quick to just grab and pull fast!</li>
            <li>It was a pleasant surprise, and worth waiting the week and a half.</li>
            <li>This spring was reasonably priced, came exactly as described, and is a good alternative to chemicals for facial hair</li>
            <li>The product is good, I just don&#x27;t like that your eyebrows have to be so long before it will pull them properly, and dang does it hurt, but im more of a shaver than a tweezer.</li>
            <li>Other than that, good value</li>
            <li>Been bleaching my face since I was in high school, and it&#x27;s good to finally find a product that won&#x27;t burn my face (like waxing does) or drain my bank account.</li>
            <li>so I came right to Amazon and bought</li>
            <li>but I think I will go on youtube to find out if I am doing it right.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right..</li>
            <li>It will not remove hairs everywhere--the angle has to be right.  </li>
            <li>It works if you do it right</li>
            <li>you use it right</li>
            <li>right  now).  </li>
            <li>You do have to have it positioned just right for it to grab the hair</li>
            <li>i like it ,but sometimes it wont pluck right away, takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li>I recieved these in the mail right away.</li>
            <li>maybe i didn&#x27;t use it right, but it didn&#x27;t come with instructions anyway.</li>
            <li>It took time to get the maneuver right.</li>
            <li>You have to sort of play with it twisting the two sides until you find the right way.</li>
            <li>Takes some time to find the right way to use it, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>The technique is just to bend and straighten it right at the hairs.</li>
            <li>it might be just right for you.</li>
            <li>I started doing it right...</li>
            <li>The reviews I read before were right...</li>
            <li>This thing pretty much saved me from embarrassment and spending huge money.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure I am not that far off.</li>
            <li>I love this method of removing facial hair, it is very efficient and easy to</li>
            <li>it removes facial hair very easily.</li>
            <li>the Spring Facial hair remover I received was excellent and was NOT a let down.</li>
            <li>To be on the safe side I gave it a major cleaning and sterilization before I used it.</li>
            <li>however, once that five minutes of mind numbing pain is over and you master the task, this little device is great for facial hair :)</li>
            <li>I like it better than waxing because it didn&#x27;t leave my skin super red where I removed the hair.</li>
            <li>Felt it at first, but got adjusted to it and find it very handy when there are a few hairs that need to be pulled out.</li>
            <li>After learining the correct way, this tool is very good, and yes it does hurt, but I can get my upper lip done in about 2 mins or less, so not bad.</li>
            <li>My face has a very fine layer of blonde hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not too hairy and my facial hair is very fine except eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I would spend a little more money and make sure your are ordering from a USA company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little tool and it is so cheap!</li>
            <li>I will say, the side extensions are cheap, and the does not look shiny new, and silvery.</li>
            <li>It works great for my womanly facial hair.</li>
            <li>This is good for women who may be self conscious about facial hair.</li>
            <li>13 yrs old daughter loves and amazed with this.very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than anticipated, was larger than anticipated, was REALLY great quality.</li>
            <li>And let your male friends, relatives, and spouses try it - more fun could not be had.</li>
            <li>This product is really worth more than the low price it is offered at.</li>
            <li>but I was able to pop it right back on.</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>At this price it certainly wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li>It seems to do the best with the fine hairs, as occasionally I will still have to get the tweezers out for a tough hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always been a little wigged out by the downy fuzz that you can see in bright daylight (or in that damn magnifying mirror that I just had to have).</li>
            <li>I have tiny light facial hair on the side of my face by my ears and it worked like magic!</li>
            <li>This little tool works so good on my damn hairy face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nearly pain free (some very minor pain), no residue, and very quick.</li>
            <li>Not all replicas are good imitation of the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Came on time and works pretty good but does hurt a little if your not use to plucking.</li>
            <li>This nifty little tool, though it does hurt a bit, is far more effective than using a pair of tweezers to remove hair, is neat, cleans up well.</li>
            <li>Do your due diligence and read the reviews on the different brands, but I am super happy with my R.E.M.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>So value is very good and product is very similar to what the other sites offer but a heck of a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li>Removes most of the facial hair.</li>
            <li>Seems like it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>But I will buy this again over the higher priced items.</li>
            <li>At first it hurts.</li>
            <li>I think that the item could have been made with higher quality.</li>
            <li>You just have to know how to use it at first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it completely broke after a week of use, but its cheap enough for me to buy more</li>
            <li>It works better than tweezing or chemicals on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure if i would buy a more expensive one (the ones that cost around $16-25), it&#x27;d be better.</li>
            <li>It hurts a bit at first, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll want to do it all the time.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I love this niceEshop Spring Facial Hair Remover.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>At first it hurts, but you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know how to work it (didn&#x27;t come with instructions)</li>
            <li>I cant say if this hurts anymore than tweezing, to me it feels almost exactly like the threads they use at the Salon</li>
            <li>Just takes some getting used to at first.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to use this tool, but I figured it out on the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful I tried it because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back! :)</li>
            <li>This is my first one of these types of things..</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much better than practically chemically burning my skin off and still having upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>, I know better next time.  </li>
            <li>but they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty thorough job.</li>
            <li>There is pain but definitely gets better with every use.  </li>
            <li>With this price you can&#x27;t expect more but one you should keep in mind that you should know how to use it in proper way because it doesn&#x27;t have any manual and</li>
            <li>I contacted them when my first one did not come in the mail</li>
            <li>came off first time using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get exactly what you pay</li>
            <li>first time I went to use it</li>
            <li>Not only that this caused more unsightly ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Yeah it hurts at first</li>
            <li>Its exactly how you thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work and even broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Works really well , even for courser hair !</li>
            <li>glad this was only $2.</li>
            <li>It removes hair pretty well..</li>
            <li>I prefer it over hot wax.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says it will.</li>
            <li>This hurts WAY too much to use!</li>
            <li>It hurts at first</li>
            <li>At first, we looked at it with a puzzled eye.</li>
            <li>But, once she started using it and got over the initial discomfort of it, she has come to love it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>One end of this tool broke while I was removing from the box, before my first use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how it&#x27;s actually supposed to work.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to all who have facial hair problems! :)</li>
            <li>for the first time.</li>
            <li>The first couple rolls I had</li>
            <li>When it first came, I did not know how to use it</li>
            <li>Use ice on your face and then use this tool and it won&#x27;t hurt as much!</li>
            <li>Definitely works way better than tweezers.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s like when you first started tweezing your eyebrows and now that you&#x27;ve been doing it for years you don&#x27;t even bat an eye when</li>
            <li>If done consistently the hair starts to grow in softer, I&#x27;ve noticed with my chin hair.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It costs $25 or more to get your entire face threaded or waxed.</li>
            <li>I had a better one, but this still gets the job done, it just misses some of the smaller hairs</li>
            <li>so it takes more time to go over the same spots.</li>
            <li>It would work pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>It really does work though!</li>
            <li>First, my skin is way too sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does hurt when you first use the tool, but the pain lessens from your continuous usage of it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty dang hairy.</li>
            <li>, I got it on my first try.</li>
            <li>It hurt the first minute or so</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>Next time I will spend more for a better one that actually pulls out hairs.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that you got more than one of these when I made my purchase but received only the one.  </li>
            <li>A bit tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>As this cost around a $1 - including shipping - I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s been one of my better investments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I still give it 5 stars for being the first hair remover that doesnt cause me</li>
            <li>It sure beats pulling them all out individually.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just better overall).</li>
            <li>Yes the first time you try this</li>
            <li>but so did tweezing your eyebrows the first time.</li>
            <li>Wash your face first to get the oil out and the hairs up.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from facial hair for years and have never had a smooth result!</li>
            <li>Glad it was only $2.</li>
            <li>While the product does exactly what it says it will do.... pull your hairs out....</li>
            <li>The product is looks exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I prefer it over hot wax.</li>
            <li>First purchase from amazon</li>
            <li>It hurts just a bit the first couple of times but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>If you are asking yourself if there is a difference between a $16 spring and a $5 spring and why should you pay more for something so simple, then this is a review for you.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the company says it will do.</li>
            <li>works wonders and is pretty</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it works really well!</li>
            <li>I saw a similar product that was supposedly &amp;#34;recommended by Oprah&amp;#34; for about $12 more than this one.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it on the fine hairs in my upper lip and it grabs and plucks so easy, it&#x27;s not hard to use either.</li>
            <li>However I sometimes have trouble getting the more fine hairs</li>
            <li>It was larger than expected, but it worked great.</li>
            <li>I used it only on the Upper lip and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Once you get past how funny this tool looks - and your husband stops laughing when you tell him what it is used for - you will find that it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I loved a more expensive version of this I bought</li>
            <li>and you don;t want to run for your tweezers haha,,,  only grab this and is really fast !!!!</li>
            <li>so it may just be me, so I would definitely recommend others to clean, sanitize before and after using!</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m not disappointed... but just wish it was a little better..</li>
            <li>This little thing is not only cheap but it works so good.</li>
            <li>However, my upper lip has pretty strong hairs and it takes a while to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>At first, I was going to stop using it because it hurt so much.</li>
            <li>must as say it really pools the hair from the root pretty impress....</li>
            <li>It really hurts the first time too</li>
            <li>I also won&#x27;t suggest using it for long or grown hairs because it hurts more.</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty much painless</li>
            <li>But it isn&#x27;t easier or fast than tweezing, the area that actually pulls the hair is very minute, and it takes more effort and time than just using a tweezer or an epilator.</li>
            <li>Overall, just a great alternative to the other brands.</li>
            <li>gets rusty pretty fast.</li>
            <li>the pain was intense at first, I could used to it.</li>
            <li>At first the pain was intense, but after a while I became used to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for removing those small hairs on your face.</li>
            <li>You twist the product in an upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape, and kind of roll it up your face (or wherever) to pull the hair out at the root.</li>
            <li>either try to get a little hair at a time or use some kind of numbing cream the first couple times.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m super sensitive to waxing and always break out afterwards.</li>
            <li>Facial hair has never been so easy or painless to remove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Removes upper lip hair easily.</li>
            <li>try all different combinations of directions until you find something easy and work well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The ends do come off but are easily put back on.</li>
            <li>It clings to your small unwanted hair and your able to pluck away quickly.great item to have I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I was holding it so the handles were pointed straight away from my face, and wasn&#x27;t grabbing much hair..</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the R.E.M. and the spring is thicker and less flexible on these, which makes it a challenge to grab the hairs effectively.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend for people with facial hair.</li>
            <li>It works best if you bend it a little less than shown in the photo there</li>
            <li>Can smart if twist too slowly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>May have to repeat over certain areas.</li>
            <li>As it didn&#x27;t come with instructions,I had to watch a YouTube video just to make certain I was using it correctly.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this product is very nice and very convinient to have, especially when some hair removal on the go is needed.</li>
            <li>The spring is really simple looking and very cheap (less than $1.00 + free shipping!).</li>
            <li>this works great on medium sized hairs, not super short or long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not work on fine or short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Ends</li>
            <li>but if you keep at it regularly, all those fine fuzzies are gone.</li>
            <li>only removes fine ones.</li>
            <li>either way, it&#x27;s a pretty decent thing when you figure out how to work it.</li>
            <li>This little device is amazing.</li>
            <li>Hurts a little bit but amazing results.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nice little gadget.</li>
            <li>Effective- takes a little practice but each person can find their comfort zone and use</li>
            <li>I had to watch a few youtube videos to figure out how it works, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much for how cheap it was, but it was rusted in numerous places.</li>
            <li>Better off plucking with tweezers, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt all that much when you pluck the hairs out, and it doesn&#x27;t leave huge red spots all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li>But be careful, it hurts :)</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest tool like this I have seen on amazon and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do its job .</li>
            <li>It hurts just as much as tweezing/waxing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>tooo much work.</li>
            <li>This thing works so much better than I expected considering how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for removing cheek and chin fuzz.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s convenient (much faster than plucking,</li>
            <li>very convenient.</li>
            <li>but if you just do it really fast</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get rid of unwanted hair with ease.</li>
            <li>If I can get a user manual, it will be appreciated.</li>
            <li>works very well, (which means if you&#x27;re not use to it</li>
            <li>i dont really know how to use it</li>
            <li>Peach fuzz can be embarrassing especially when light hits u</li>
            <li>but i got over it really fast because i had to use it too often</li>
            <li>and it still really grabs the hair.</li>
            <li>so its not like I am out too much.</li>
            <li>It doesnt remove much hair at all</li>
            <li>But the pain lessens over time and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing or threading.</li>
            <li>Just know how to use it, know your tolerance for pain, and don&#x27;t expect it too fast.</li>
            <li>I will say sugaring is much easier for me..</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t working very well for me.</li>
            <li>I am still really iffy on this product.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t wish to pay too much for</li>
            <li>this product really pain on your face.</li>
            <li>However, I gave it to my mom because I&#x27;d much rather wax than use it.</li>
            <li>Really floppy spring doesn&#x27;t roll in handle at all...</li>
            <li>is much cleaner and faster than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>It took a whole month to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I got several since they were cheap.  </li>
            <li>very difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li>am ABSOLUTELY going to have to order more.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice it pulling out much hair.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>it is very slim and lightweight.</li>
            <li>The threading beauty tool does not work as well as the creams and it hurts more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Not to mention with the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really picks up all the hair.</li>
            <li>I stretche it a bit too much trying to shake hair out.</li>
            <li>it hurt so much</li>
            <li>but it hurts no worse than tweezing--and instead of plucking out one mustache hair, it kinda thins the whole area and gets 20 hairs with one go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hey thanks for the product it really works doens&#x27;t need any improvement at all.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t ever get this again because it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li>Does as advertised but yes, it hurts a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do it too fast make</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s only cheap because of the pain you have to endure</li>
            <li>, I am not one who can tolerate much pain..</li>
            <li>how fast it takes the hair away and</li>
            <li>The ends of the remover pop off and are not held/glued on very well.</li>
            <li>This thing pulls the hair out by the roots and it really hurts.</li>
            <li>razors seemed to break me out, and my hair grows so fast it didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li>really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It somewhat works but the hair comes out much quicker than the video said.  </li>
            <li>Really hurts and doesn&#x27;t remove that much hair that I can tell.</li>
            <li>but I find this much easier.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend it hurts to much</li>
            <li>My face feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t understand all these comments about having to &#x27;learn&#x27; how to use it.  </li>
            <li>May work for some folks I guess just didn&#x27;t work real well for me</li>
            <li>Really needs them.</li>
            <li>make it so much easier and faster to get rid of hair.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>to use as often as you want.&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair at the rooT,IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT MUCH ...</li>
            <li>the tool and lightly lay it on your skin just enough to grab hair</li>
            <li>Came fast too.</li>
            <li>but you get used to the pain after a while and its much easier than plucking out each hair with a tweezers.</li>
            <li>you do have to be careful not to get your hair (from the top of your head that is) tangled in the spring when you doing your jaw line.</li>
            <li>This item was so much cheaper</li>
            <li>so I have problems with facial hair primarily on my chin and underneath it.</li>
            <li>Much pricier tho.  </li>
            <li>I think mine arrived about a month after I ordered it, but this was very inexpensive</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Just experiment with how much of a bend you put on it and the angle you use to go across your face.</li>
            <li>I am back to using Olay facial hair removal duo for the upper lip, which works great</li>
            <li>It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as pulling out hairs one by one</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like waxing; it will hurt for longer hairs but if trimmed too much, the wax cannot grip.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t out much at all.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>It works really well!👍</li>
            <li>Really hurts, of course.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work like it should have</li>
            <li>yes it really hurts.  </li>
            <li>Can do your whole face except for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use creams or just for a fast hair removal.</li>
            <li>This product really works for removing unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>and since I was just trying it I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much.</li>
            <li>For what I paid, I wasent expenting much.</li>
            <li>The spring mechanism doesn&#x27;t appear to be working very well to remove hair.</li>
            <li>cheeks too if I really want to feel pain.</li>
            <li>So, I bought two of the these because they are so much cheaper ($1.95 vs. $13.75) to see if they compare.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected it might, but then again, I will keep trying to get better at using it. &#x27;</li>
            <li>After becoming pregnant and having my second child, my facial hair has gotta outta control!</li>
            <li>Works quickly and is so much better than using a pair a tweezers for excessive hair.  </li>
            <li>my rem spring is as new as the first day.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be just as good as the other tool I bought {different brand}  </li>
            <li>I loved that it come earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any red marks, it is quick and easy to use,  and some of the hairs on my chin have not grown back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and takes little time to use.</li>
            <li>It is more for broad areas than specific hairs.</li>
            <li>, I use it on my upper lip and it may hurt a bit but its worth it!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t help but worry about security concerns either by my phone number, or other information, like my credit card information is safe considering it is coming from a out-of-country</li>
            <li>The first time I used under my nose it was a little stingy maybe because there was more hair, but now I feel the pull</li>
            <li>Does a better job than most creams and waxes, and does not subject the user to the unpleasant smell of  most depilatories.</li>
            <li>It  definitely does work as it yanked the hairs out cleanly.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, it&#x27;s small but powerful.</li>
            <li>painful at first but wonderful!!</li>
            <li>, clean the spring atleast once a week with cotton and some facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Learning how to use it is very easy, after a few minutes you will have it figured out.</li>
            <li>I have been using them only a week and only one has been used so far, so far so good.</li>
            <li>However, now my face is as smooth and a baby&#x27;s bum, and I am pleased with the results of this simple little gizmo.</li>
            <li>First of all, the ends are two bulbous plastic pink knobs that are not nearly as small or easy to use as</li>
            <li>only problem that I can see that over time it&#x27;s gonna get full with hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda gross but really cool to look at.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll end up with a face full of itchy red bumps and stubble.  </li>
            <li>Buy the more expensive version with the smaller spring for good results.</li>
            <li>But because it is free shipping, be aware that your product will probably most likely arrive much later than the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed ex hairdresser and used to have my own professional waxing setup--but what a mess for home use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li>the more you use it the less it hurts though.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking that it will hurt less the more I use it.</li>
            <li>As you use it more it hurts less.</li>
            <li>Not much to it, but simple in this case means effective.</li>
            <li>You can hone in on a particular spot by bending it just so.</li>
            <li>I bought wax strips instead and used one, and while it was just as quick as this spring, it left my skin irritated</li>
            <li>I have been recommending this to everybody so far and with such a cheap price</li>
            <li>Got it quiet quick - for that is was shipped from China.</li>
            <li>BUT does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Just twist the end pieces gently  until the spring starts to roll UP your face (don&#x27;t push; it needs to roll slowly on its own).</li>
            <li>Obviously it&#x27;s not as painless as a hair remover cream, but you&#x27;ll never run out of quick hair removal as you might with a cream.</li>
            <li>On most of the face, including over the upper lip, simply rolling it upward will get rid of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work like the instructions say, nor is it easy to try and use, you should be able to use it on fine hair, however it will only pull out long THICK hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily there are a million YouTube videos about it, and after trying it awhile I finally got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Even though not all of my facial hair can be pulled out, but it works for most of my facial hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very painless and useful for the upper lip area.</li>
            <li>When I ordered the 8, they were not even the same color or metal, much cheaper and broke right away, one was even broke when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for hairy females.</li>
            <li>if you are pulling from a area with a lot of hair , you do need patience and a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so if you just want to try a spring hair remover or have a high tolerance for pain - go for it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people with peach fuzz</li>
            <li>highly recommend using a post-epilation lotion on the areas after you remove the hair, as it helps a lot with irritation and pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine blonde peach fuzz and this puts a major dent in the supply.</li>
            <li>It was difficult to use at first but after the 2nd/3rd use I was able to get the hang of it and removing facial hair is so easy now!  </li>
            <li>I used it, I experienced absolutely no redness (despite having highly sensitive skin) and all of the hair from my face that I wanted removed was gone in less than five minutes.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with this I am buying a second one to keep at my other home.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair in a single pass, which might be a good thing, because it feels just like you would expect from yanking out multiple hairs at the same time.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and small.</li>
            <li>I love this little tool for removing the hair around my lips.</li>
            <li>I love this little tool.  </li>
            <li>It is quicker than tweezing and gets the little hairs better.  </li>
            <li>Originally I thought it would pinch my skin, but it didn&#x27;t Of course, it wont take every single hair out</li>
            <li>Can be a bit painful to pull out hair, but who said beauty is easy!?!?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li>Works great, painful at first but really does work!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really think anything so simple could do such a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me...waste of my time and money but just threw it in the trash..wasn&#x27;t worth even bothering to ship it back!!</li>
            <li>no this is the only thing thats worked worth its price and should buy millions before they stop making them.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is purchasing this item was really worth it because I&#x27;m now in my 20s and all of a sudden these hairs started growing on my chin</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal when removing hair.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s normal as well, though, with the spring and all.</li>
            <li>but it takes more time and can get messy.</li>
            <li>and she only waxes rarely to get the stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>(I use a Braun epilator normally).  </li>
            <li>I now have a scar from the wax which was too strong,not my normal brand.</li>
            <li>A FEW MORE NOW.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a bit every time, but it is worth than spending $3 dollars on threading every 2nd week.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to figure out how to use this within a few minutes of trying.</li>
            <li>:) I can do it at home in just a few minutes every couple weeks</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s normal...</li>
            <li>It works, but I could not get in the habit of using it regularly, so mine pretty much sits in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Good with peach fuzz and minute, thin hairs.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s really not hard to figure out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that great with the really tough unruly hairs that just don&#x27;t belong there, but it&#x27;s excellent for large spaces and weird curves and all those tiny hairs you&#x27;d never get any other way besides waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li>Pulls facial hair right out without any problems or concenrs, dont need to focus on mirror, can just use it and watch tv</li>
            <li>But no it goes right back together.</li>
            <li>Also, if the regular way to use it isn&#x27;t grabbing hairs, try moving it around on your face other ways, that&#x27;s what I do and it pulls out hairs easily!</li>
            <li>it works easily also because you just twist it down</li>
            <li>I was not sure if I would be able to use this item properly or with success.  </li>
            <li>takes a couple tries to do it correctly but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It works best at removing the hair over my upper lip and it was really really painful the first time I did it.</li>
            <li>if your into new things, and can tolerate pain.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t see any new growth until 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger than I expected it to be, and so can remove more at once if you need it to.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s understandable but it would&#x27;ve been nice if the spring plucked out all of my facial hair and not just a few.</li>
            <li>it is cheap and the usage is painless and effortless for the upperlip,chin, and for overall facial hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, this means I&#x27;m using a shaver for my face but that cute pink thing simply doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>I feel SO much more confident now when I&#x27;m close to people, because I have nothing to be afraid about.</li>
            <li>but fortunately the price was low enough.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not exactly comfortable, but I find it easier to deal with than creams or depilatories that leave my sensitive skin with a chemical burn or rash.</li>
            <li>And, good grief, the price could not be better.</li>
            <li>Love this little tool!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t remove hair from a very sensitive place with it, but it work.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine from a lady in California through eBay, price was the same and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and does remove little facial peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Although at first this seemed to work with no adverse effects, after a day my skin began to get patchy and red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely touched it since purchasing because it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>There is a technique you should use, and yes it definitely hurts the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>There was barely any blotchiness at all, and then it went away really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does the exact same thing as a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>This is my second one because I lost the first one.</li>
            <li>This was a very silly Ideal that I took a chance trying.</li>
            <li>I know you wouldn&#x27;t wanna take that chance of feeling double the pain than the first time you tried.</li>
            <li>She uses it regularly and now has baby soft, smooth facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use this Facial Hair Remover Threading Beauty Tool a number of times, but have yet to get it to work consistently.  </li>
            <li>the spring facial hair remover threading beauty tool worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I do admit I didn&#x27;t know how to use it at first since the instructions weren&#x27;t in English, but Youtube helped me on that.</li>
            <li>It does exactly whatvit said it would and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I like the concept but even after a hot shower, this hurts to use on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
            <li>I first used it on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>And as far as cleaning, just stretch the string and the hairs fall out!</li>
            <li>It worked barely, but did a really crappy job at removing any substantial amount of hair.</li>
            <li>like most of the other users said this definitely hurts!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very small, flexible, quality seems to be good enough to do</li>
            <li>The only issue I might have is how to clean it properly, but other than that, worth the $ which isn&#x27;t even that much to begin with!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to get used to how this works, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be amazed with how easy it is.  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars only instead of four or five stars despite it being very cheap because it is hard to use at first.</li>
            <li>This item definitely  works , the price is cheap, will have to see how long it lasts...</li>
            <li>Works as expected and super affordable.</li>
            <li>It got all rusty from the first use even though it wasn&#x27;t near any water the only water that it touched was when I cleaned it</li>
            <li>it definitely works, it hurts like no other, but i&#x27;d much rather have all hair pulled with alot of pain fast..</li>
            <li>First, the spring is a larger diameter and doesn&#x27;t bend as easily, so it is much less effective and more difficult to use.</li>
            <li>you can rotate only right hand and let the left hand steady and close to the surface&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a shock the first time you use it on your upper lip (as I expected) but is real fast to get use to.</li>
            <li>You really have to spend a long time to make sure you go over all of the areas, and there may still be a few hairs you missed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get every single one (not sure if that is user error or just the product, or maybe nothing could get every hair) but it does the job and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that the pink handles come off really easy.</li>
            <li>- the REM tackles any hair except for your eyebrows easily - but not even that worked which led me to think this is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and needed something to help me remove upper lip facial hair!</li>
            <li>As a woman of a certain age, I have reached that point in life where the peach fuzz on my face rivals that of a teenage boy about to sprout a beard.</li>
            <li>(thankful that I&#x27;m smart enough to figure it out -</li>
            <li>Be careful when you first use it or you are in for a shock!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a little time, but it&#x27;s definitely doable, and I have not found anything better for this price with this ease and lack of irritation.</li>
            <li>This tool is shorter than what I had before, so it needs little more work while removing the facial hair.</li>
            <li>And you may need to go over and over the same area, pulling the hair out a little more each time.  </li>
            <li>This weird little thing is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li>This works especially well on fine hairs as well as those stubborn &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; hairs above the upper lip.  </li>
            <li>I had a hard time deciding whether to buy it or not, but i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Of your hair is soft it will probably work</li>
            <li>The delivery took a really long time, but I was willing to wait for it.</li>
            <li>It works so far and works well.</li>
            <li>Cheap item you will waste your time and money.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>WOULD NOT WASTE MY MONEY ON ANOTHER PRODUCT LIKE THIS</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me so much though to the point where I have to throw the tool away, so it&#x27;s not that big</li>
            <li>(If you are sensitive to pain it will probably hurt you a lot)...</li>
            <li>When I look back at the area after sooo much rolling and twisting there is still hair.</li>
            <li>But it does really remove your facial hairs.</li>
            <li>Arrived early, works great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>, she was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s ease of use and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It pulls hairs out completely including the root.</li>
            <li>I use creams for my lip but the hair grows back somewhat fast.</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t look natural to me.  </li>
            <li>(My face is too sensitive to use wax or</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin, and I break out after using this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt much, but I guess people have different pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>Removes all the hair and it doesnt grow back as fast as it would with a tweezer.</li>
            <li>but it really does minimize the amount of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but wow it did.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>it doesnt completely removes the hair but it does remove.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my skin was not irritated at all by it.</li>
            <li>Shipping took forever that I completely forgot about purchasing this</li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made and trust me, this product is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well, the directions come in Chinese so you should download an app that will translate.</li>
            <li>This beauty tool really work for me, it remove facial hair like it had advertised.</li>
            <li>These Spring Facial Hair Removers really work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using sparingly to get used to pain in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back if it breaks really soon</li>
            <li>And do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I use R.E.M. spring facial hair remover on regular basis which is more expensive and better quality.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t dare try it on my face nor dare gifting them.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t even touch the sensitive areas with this (like upperlip, cheekbone area...).</li>
            <li>Leaves some peach fuzz, but at least it&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li>First it took a significantly long time for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li>After a while of using, pain is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it took out more than a few hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li>but after a few different methods I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I need good hair removal products, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good to thin the entire area.  </li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s somewhat slow</li>
            <li>Regardless I purchased the same product for the same price and the other company was better.</li>
            <li>the two pink ends came right off.</li>
            <li>They are so easy and make unwanted hair a problem no more.  </li>
            <li>I believe this would be great for getting rid of the mustache area and other thin hairs.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a little, kind of like a sting, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li>I have found that it hurts less if you use it after washing your face or taking a shower, when your pores are really open and the hair can be removed easily.</li>
            <li>anymore i rather use this because it takes out every single hair even if its super short it will pull it out and doesnt burn me like waxing does</li>
            <li>It really takes out all these little unwanted hairs (especially in the mustache section) so quickly and its almost addicting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and if you have previously removed hair before, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other reviews on here make it seem.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you like the feeling of tiny hairs being plucked from your face one at a time by hot irons, by all means, enjoy.</li>
            <li>I usually wax and the hair grows back pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had to try lots of experiments to figure out how to really use.&lt;br /&gt;I find it&#x27;s different depending on the curve you&#x27;re applying on, however, the general idea I found was</li>
            <li>I am a dark-haired woman with parents of european decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short while, but already I&#x27;m pretty attached to it.</li>
            <li>Still overall a decent product</li>
            <li>Luckily it was less than a dollar.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t work well getting out fine hairs but the slightly thicker hairs it gets out</li>
            <li>Having about 30 small hairs all ripped out at the same time has a bit more of a sting...</li>
            <li>I saw the more expensive spring from another company and decided to give this one a try first since it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Its hard to get it right the first time I had to watch tutorials on youtube.</li>
            <li>Well, if you&#x27;ve read any of the other reviews, you know there may be a bit of pain involved -- but no pain, no gain, right?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>It works to some degree, because I can feel the hairs come out, but it&#x27;s not that easy and it only pulls few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li>This came straight from china and took about a month, but I saved nearly $25 compared to tweezerman and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed at how much hair comes out without the lasting pain of waxing.</li>
            <li>It took a long time to get here but to find out that this really works</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, one of the pink ends fell off.</li>
            <li>I normally get my upper lip threaded</li>
            <li>My lips is back to being normal again without those damned hairs.</li>
            <li>It hurts a bit at first as you have to get used to iy , but than you just too away with minimal to no pain.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I heard a few little yelps from the bathroom as my wife tried this out the first time.</li>
            <li>I have to say this thing is freaking amazing but its hurts so bad the first time you use it!</li>
            <li>and remove just thin hair very good but not provide for thick hair.</li>
            <li>When I received this in the mail, it had little rust spots on the main wire part, but it works perfectly hurts really bad.</li>
            <li>it.......is extremely painful if you are not used to such a thing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, most certainly, twist quickly.</li>
            <li>I saw these at the NW Women&#x27;s Show years ago and a local store they were more.&lt;br /&gt;Granted these are very inexpensively made, but they are a terrific tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I really like is that it does NOT leave a red mark or red face, unlike tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The upper lip area definitely needs extra attention with this tool; one tip is, with your mouth closed, push your tongue out to make the upper lip area protrude more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast to do and the pain only lasts 5 seconds and yo would only have to do this like once a month.</li>
            <li>Good for random chin hairs that spring out If you don&#x27;t using actual tweezers</li>
            <li>it on the upper lip and after a few attempts found it to be very useful.</li>
            <li>you are hoping to do your arms, legs, and major areas of the body, this probably won&#x27;t be what you want.  </li>
            <li>It is actually the size of a pencil, not a small q-tip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to clean it</li>
            <li>This is a powerful little tool.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful little tool.  </li>
            <li>I usually thread my upper lip and that was working fine, but when I heard about this tool I just had to try it</li>
            <li>The same item sells for various prices from less than a dollar to more than ten, but I believe they are all the same.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more painful in certain areas, but that&#x27;s really just because of your body.</li>
            <li>it works i&#x27;m so in love, the only downside is how do you properly get those hard angles done if your wrist won&#x27;t bend that way</li>
            <li>At least they were cheap</li>
            <li>I use it every Friday night to clear out my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Definitely something I am now self conscious about.</li>
            <li>I am always trying to get those light, thin hairs that you can only really see out in the sunny weather.</li>
            <li>and i would rather wax than bare the pain of it.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that it actually worked!</li>
            <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t want to have a completely hairless upper lip.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one for my adult daughter as well, and she also loves it but has the same issue with the plastic handles falling off.</li>
            <li>but I let someone else try it and apparently the pain was unbearable??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never waste money on getting my upper lip waxed again -</li>
            <li>It is much longer than I expected (about the length of my forearm).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I am male, 19 years old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Boy was I surprised when it turned our that this skinny metal spring actually works!</li>
            <li>It also hurts like hell when you do actually grab hairs from sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I must have had some allergic reaction to the material of the metal, or the fact that it came directly from China (with Chinese on the package) and I have no idea what might have touched it.</li>
            <li>So far, have only tried on my face.</li>
            <li>I just received these (apparently from China) and cannot figure out how to use it?  </li>
            <li>I have such low pain tolerance, and I&#x27;m able to slowly do the sides of my face.</li>
            <li>I have been tweezing random hairs on my face for nearly 20 years, so I&#x27;m pretty used to that feeling, and it&#x27;s not really painful to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aging and getting a little fuzz on my face, visible if the sun hits my cheek the right way.</li>
            <li>It does take a little practice to get it right, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the handles on my spring pop off easily, making it difficult to use effectively.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it daily for new growth, and occasionally use the tweezer for a stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>I do need to use tweezers for the odd stubborn hair, but in all this is simple and fun to use -</li>
            <li>Its quick depending on how heavy your facial hair is.</li>
            <li>got mine a few days ago and figured out how to use it right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;ll have to repeat the process to remove the hair, but i don&#x27;t mind using this, it makes hair removal quick and effortless.</li>
            <li>The hair removal spring gets most of my facial hair out, its a little painful in the first and second uses but after that it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, like when you first pluck your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The first one (like the pink one in the picture) works great, the others are crap.</li>
            <li>Hurts a little but worth it to get rid of facial hair without having to wax at home or spend a ton of $$ at a salon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job, but it didn&#x27;t pull not a single hair from me.</li>
            <li>It is a great &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; way of removing facial hair, but can be painful at times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at least ten times as effective as tweezing and hurts less.</li>
            <li>Consider your pain threshold before buying especially since the upper lip can be a sensitive area.</li>
            <li>At first I was surprised at how small the hairs it could pull out were.</li>
            <li>There are no other complaints that I have about this product, only that I would have found about this product one or two years ago.</li>
            <li>It works, its a little tricky at first and the pain is tolerable.</li>
            <li>This works to a certain motion, some ways I roll it it doesn&#x27;t work and other ways I roll it it works, and it HURTS!</li>
            <li>Its a bit painful and causes redness so make sure you dont use it right before you go out.</li>
            <li>it is a little painful but the more you do it, the more you get used to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for sideburns, but it&#x27;s tough to get short upper lip hairs.</li>
            <li>The spring will grab the small hairs on your face ten at a time an  pull them out quickly.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought an R.E.M. spring last year and keep telling my mom how much I love it for quickly (while still a bit painfully at times) removing chin and upper lip hairs....</li>
            <li>Now I really notice facial hair on other women...</li>
            <li>There was some &#x27;ouch&#x27; factor using it the first time, so I spread it out over a few days.  </li>
            <li>Yes it stings the first few times.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does hurt a little at first...but the smooth skin left behind is sooooo worth it.  </li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier and it takes less than five minutes to get rid of all your hair.</li>
            <li>less of a hassle than waxing) and really does pull out hairs!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was less than a buck, but I really didn&#x27;t know it would work.  </li>
            <li>Then pull it out straight or give it a slight twist with both wrists.  </li>
            <li>but after I kept using it and kept getting more obsessed with pulling out every hair around my lips, you barely notice the pain.</li>
            <li>It definitely hurts a bit the first few times.  </li>
            <li>For the first few times, I put some analgesic cream on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Easy to use (a bit painful at first, but you get used to it!)</li>
            <li>this product is super easy to use, you will spend less than a minute to get lip hairs (much less} I recently misplaced this product and in the drug store they have similar ones for MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li>I think it works, I am not sure if I am doing it right though because the instructions are not in English</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would really hurt but just like traditional plucking it hurts less as you keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wax breaks me out, tweezing takes forever and is almost impossible to do efficiently, hair removal creams break me out &amp; shaving is only good for a day.</li>
            <li>If you have facial hair on which you use other appliances, then this should work for the times when you can&#x27;t use the normal method.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally found that over the upper lip, only a slight bend is needed, whereas courser hairs might need a much stronger bend.</li>
            <li>Takes  a little practice but you can learn fast.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and does the job, but not without a little pain.  </li>
            <li>This little tool really does the trick.</li>
            <li>It hurts a little but very efficient</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little, especially near the lips.  </li>
            <li>It is a little red after I use it but goes away very soon.</li>
            <li>at first it&#x27;s a little strange because you are plucking the hairs all together.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t any more painful than plucking and it really does remove hair.</li>

            <li> This was a great product, great price but OUCH.</li>
            <li> Not so great on legs though.</li>
            <li> (Great y&#x27;all probably think I had a beard before this thing).</li>
            <li> Over all I like the product, which is a great alternative to chemical waxes and stinky hair removal products.</li>
            <li> never have i been so happy with a product like this.</li>
            <li> the price was great.</li>

            <li> Great for the price...</li>
            <li> But it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of a trick to figure out, but once you do it works great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great just as described.</li>
            <li> It fits great in my purse, although it would be great if it came with a slip case.</li>
            <li> it works great.</li>
            <li> 2)Roll fingertips away from you, like your telling someone to go away, lol,  </li>
            <li> but i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> but all in all it was i am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but I looked them up on line and it was great</li>
            <li> For two dollars this works great.</li>
            <li> Works great once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been happy with the microwave kits, and even sugaring seemed a pain.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> The price is great too.</li>
            <li> This item works really great.</li>
            <li> it works great.</li>
            <li> For a buck it&#x27;s a great deal.  </li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> My friend showed me this product and said how great it was so</li>
            <li> I will buy more for gifts!!</li>
            <li> Bellabe is very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li> I do think it is a very effective way for................ripping the hair from your flesh.</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool!</li>
            <li> It does an OKAY job... not an excellent one!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t successfully remove ANY hair.</li>
            <li> Really liked it!</li>
            <li> Youtube is your friend :P</li>
            <li> How come these aren&#x27;t popular!?</li>
            <li> Rotating one hand worked best for me for most of parts, but it might be about my curve.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive, yet so effective!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a nice hair removal tool to have in my arsenal!</li>
            <li> I was successfully using it within 5 minutes of opening it and am impressed by how smooth my face feels after 5 days.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the best with the fine hairs,</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and playing with it get good at it</li>
            <li> But if you place some ice around the area you plan on getting rid of the hair, then you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Good for on the go when you don&#x27;t have time to stop in for a lip wax or do an at home wax.</li>
            <li> Also good for peach fuzz without having to wax.</li>
            <li> It good for removing face hair.  </li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out how to use it correctly, but it seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> Does not catch the hair good</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Good Price but not for me.</li>
            <li> I use it, but maybe sterilizing it with rubbing alcohol before and after every use is a good idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li> so i guess i have to practice to get good at it.</li>
            <li> It was really good</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Quality wise too.</li>
            <li> I heard some good things about this</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product for under $1.</li>

            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy for the money, works well after you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Also , this tool just feels cheaper than the rem tool, but it&#x27;s good for travel.</li>
            <li> It worked good once I leared to use it.</li>
            <li> It works rlly good.</li>
            <li> In spite of that, it&#x27;s still a good product to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and awesome!</li>
            <li> Hair Remover Thresding Beauty tool, was on time,and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Workes good.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Before I try this, I heard lots of good words about this</li>
            <li> those who can&#x27;t use waxing or shaving because of sensitivity, this is really a good tool.</li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> Good for this price.</li>
            <li> Good product could have received sooner works well also could have had instructions with</li>
            <li> They work as good as rem spring.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> But it is awesome and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Works  good</li>
            <li> but once you do, it is a good way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> but it works good</li>
            <li> The product is good but the time it takes to get every hair I could have just swiped a razor across.</li>
            <li> And u have to go over areas repeatedly to get everything over all it good</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>

            <li> GREAT PRICE, QWIK DELIVERY, LOVE THE CD AND WILL BUY</li>
            <li> A nice reviewer gave good instructions on how to twirl the ends as you move the spring up toward the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it is so easy to use and awesome because now i dont have to wax or bleach.</li>
            <li> Not any more!</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m sure they do (HA-HA)!  </li>
            <li> This tool is pretty awesome because it works and you can use it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> every 1-2 months because there is no need to use it more than that!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure at some point I will get used to wanting to curse outloud with every roll of the spring!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> After some practice and getting used to the bit of pain, I&#x27;ve come to love this product!</li>

            <li> DEFINITELY BETTER THAN WAXING!</li>
            <li> I am going to buy more as gifts!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> :) who ever invented this is the coolest person ever!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> great price, easy to use.</li>
            <li> great product, but the spring breaks easily</li>
            <li> Works like threading, great for removing the fine baby hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have fine fuzzy hair on my chin and lip, and it works great on it.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and is a fairly large product ( It is longer than my hand).</li>
            <li> But on the bright side, it works better than everything I have ever used, you will get used to the pain after a while.</li>
            <li> This hair removal tool is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> this honestly world amazing</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so cheap and affordable and a great alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT is amazing.</li>
            <li> takes off all my chin hair and mustache works great good product worth the price you pay</li>
            <li> Threading tools are wonderful and work very well.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything from this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Also, the shipper kindly included a bracelet and a card.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a product every women should own.</li>
            <li> You have to learn to maneuver it effectively.</li>
            <li> I recommend having a pair of tweezers handy for any stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of learning how to manipulate it effectively, and like tweezing and waxing, there is some discomfort involved.</li>
            <li> but for good results in under 5 minutes.. I will gladly endure it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove every hair, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> can not in good faith give it a rating of &#x27;i love it&#x27;</li>
            <li> It took me an hour to really learn the best way to use this tool, even after watching a youtube video.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all over you tube tryin to figure out how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> In time you might get use to the feeling, kind of the way plucking your eye brows gets easier, but I have not used it that often.</li>
            <li> The coils of the spring are thicker and did not do as good of a job gripping hairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective in some areas but did not deliver the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works really well, it&#x27;s a shame that doesn&#x27;t come with an instruction, but when you learn how to use it, works perfectly, doesn&#x27;t heart at all..</li>
            <li> You can watch videos to learn, but you&#x27;ll develop your own technique.  </li>
            <li> It was surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> the pain kind of reminds me of tweezing or the threading method but its worthit</li>
            <li> kind of.  </li>
            <li> this is nice.  </li>
            <li> It came really fast and it works great!!</li>
            <li> But once i figure how to use it i liked it..</li>
            <li> This is a nice product to remove lots of hair at once.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get the hang of how to use it, and honestly sometimes I feel like I can get it to work, and sometimes I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It does work, but even picture directions would be nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this handy tool</li>
            <li> and you need kind a play around to find out how to use it efficiently.</li>
            <li> nice price.</li>
            <li> I also own the myspringit from myspringit.com</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t take off ALL the hair.</li>
            <li> this is a nice adjustment.</li>
            <li> Which is good because I was very excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it is a easy product to use, they do include pictures.</li>
            <li> quick lol</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy-</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I use it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> But the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get use to it and not feel pain!</li>
            <li> I tried tweezers, but it made me cry and those fine hairs are a lot in number wise</li>
            <li> I have used this product with great success.  </li>
            <li> So far so great!</li>
            <li> By far, I guess Bellabe is the best that I have used</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two years now, so far it&#x27;s the best thing I have found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly WAY better than tweezers.</li>
            <li> and it is so much better and effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m proud that I took this chance because it was worth it.</li>
            <li> so I gave it to my mom who has awesome skin and her face is as smooth as a babies bottom overall a great product.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly think that the one I ordered here on amazon for $14 dollars cheaper is the much better product.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is this does a great job I honestly use it at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase not only because it works, but the price was awesome..</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and for me, painless too!</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> i say its good but not that good for some certain spot on ur face.</li>
            <li> as good as the original R.E.M spring.</li>
            <li> Very good for removing upper lips and chin hairs, but not so good for removing forehead hairs.</li>
            <li> and  had great success and love this product and the price under $1&#x27;00</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> worked great for the first 2 minutes..</li>
            <li> this is a great hair romover!takes off the hairs fast !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not for precise use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around for this after a friend said to get one and was very happy to get such a good deal.</li>
            <li> You bend it so the springs have space in them, then unbend/ roll and it just pulls out all your fine hairs!</li>
            <li> The item is very cheaply made and the spring looks like an industrial spring.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver also very cheap</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very much handy.</li>
            <li> product is super affordable and works just as good as the pricier competitors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s portable and works well and very cheap :)</li>
            <li> They were very polite and I am very satisfied with is product!</li>
            <li> And the size was oddly HUGE!</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent idea, I just wish it worked better on the short stubble that is courser.</li>
            <li> I may get it to work better after a while,</li>
            <li> No instructions came with it at all, and if I hadn&#x27;t read many reviews, I would not have figured it out.  </li>
            <li> If I were you, I&#x27;d stick to something that will for sure pull from the root/pore whatever.</li>
            <li> i would buy more</li>
            <li> The best part is this was only a couple bucks!</li>
            <li> This product, for removing facial hair, worked great!</li>
            <li> Getting two more of these.</li>
            <li> for the most part works well...</li>
            <li> What more to say?</li>
            <li> Amazingly simple concept, perfect for peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> like I mentioned, it&#x27;s way better than waxing</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I think if I watch some instructional videos I will like it even more.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the  more pricey hair removers</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Best facial tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Im kinda weirded out by this ordered because it was interesting.</li>
            <li> Most of all, I do not have to use my tweezers, which I can&#x27;t seem to find because I&#x27;m forever misplacing ;P.  </li>
            <li> :) You&#x27;ll drop a couple of tears in the process.</li>
            <li> This pulls your hair out for sure</li>
            <li> It pulls many hairs at once.</li>
            <li> I also love the affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Removes facial hair wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> i was expecting for it to work better, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> It works okay</li>
            <li> its the most inexpensive thing ive ever purchases and kept.</li>
            <li> so I had to take a break every so many times.</li>
            <li> Many reviews indicated this hair removal system caused pain but not for me.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more for gifts to my family and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> It hurts like the dickens, especially at first.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s getting better by every use .I</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine that they would be any better.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> ordered 2 just to be safe</li>
            <li> I noticed it doesn&#x27;t work on most of the hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Threading tool worked okay.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m sure that these threading tools are all made in China.  </li>
            <li> the thicker the hair the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> I find that it works better on coarser hair, by the way.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on getting it again if it brakes. :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It hurts more than it takes out hairs.</li>
            <li> it cheap an nice.</li>
            <li> I have ZERO complaints what so ever!! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this threading tool.  </li>
            <li> I bought 5 to start with and ordered 10 more.  </li>
            <li> I gave them to friends who love them.  </li>
            <li> I love that it pulls hairs out from the root.</li>
            <li> Even a tweezer is better than this.</li>
            <li> unless you really love pain, you wouldn&#x27;t want to experience using this, trust me.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely not the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Better than using chemicals.</li>
            <li> But maybe it was just more wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> Love the product and it pulls out all the hairs</li>
            <li> I love love this item.</li>
            <li> If you keep going over the hair, though, you would probably be able to remove it all.)  </li>
            <li> just love everything about it....</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> not in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> i WISH IT WORKED BETTER</li>
            <li> But I love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Threading cleans your face so much better.</li>
            <li> These work better than the battery-powered type, but the handles fall off almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It works but it hurts more than waxing...</li>
            <li> It hurts a lot more than just getting it threaded.</li>
            <li> but hey its really cheap and works!</li>
            <li> I love this and for a doller?</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the pain:-)...</li>
            <li> if you have a low pain tolerance like me, it might not be the best thing to use.</li>
            <li> The REM spring is a better tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li> this is an okay product....</li>
            <li> Quality seems okay though</li>
            <li> I just ordered five more for gifts to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more for myself.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing or threading.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and i was trying to find a better solution.</li>
            <li> I think shaving makes hair more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Because shaving made it more noticeable and my skin irritated a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have orderd more for my aunt</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> This product is okay</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, however, so I can&#x27;t rate it better.</li>
            <li> I love the Spring hair remover.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It works okay, did pull out most of the hair, but will need to get use to the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay........</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> most places, you will need to bend/curve the device for use, though the degree in which you bend the device depends upon the location it&#x27;s being used the the type of hair to be removed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, with more stubborn hairs, the device will need to be placed at an angle before use, depending upon the hair&#x27;s growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have both kinds and have been using the rem for more than an year.</li>
            <li> shipping was okay.</li>
            <li> However, it will get most if you repeat the threading technique about five or six times per area.</li>
            <li> I WILL LOOK TODAY FOR A COUPLE MORE CD&#x27;S</li>
            <li> THIS THING WORKS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li> OK..</li>
            <li> I was even able to get those hairs that have a tendency to get in grown.  </li>
            <li> After this review I am ordering 5 more</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy and buy a second one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Not terribly.</li>
            <li> I like this way better than tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li> This thing works and i love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still a fan :)</li>
            <li> this is so cheap and effective.  </li>
            <li> Springs have more gap, that&#x27;s why its not pulling any hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> What bothered me the most was that it&#x27;s like 25 dollars for 8 ozs.</li>
            <li> This is so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap and has amazing results.</li>
            <li> Better to invest on some wax.</li>
            <li> but i never pulled hair from my top lip</li>
            <li> Not that great and doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> one more tip</li>
            <li> I have waxed before and that hurts so much more.  </li>
            <li> Okay, maybe it is me, but this thing is awkard and coming with no directions, I had to look up on the internet how to use the dang thing.</li>
            <li> glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use wax any more...</li>
            <li> Takes practice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Although the way the condition of the item itself seem as if someone opened it at the edge of the top corner.</li>
            <li> SO YOU WONT BE ABLE TO READ THE DESCRIPTION</li>
            <li> but after sometime i found that my hairs getting more thicker and thicker.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I suggest you save your money or buy a better one.</li>
            <li> Threading with a thread does a better job.</li>
            <li> I love this tool and will order more to gift my sisters:-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The best thing I used to remove hair from my upper lip.</li>
            <li> My face is SO smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but</li>
            <li> It will hurt but it does get better.  </li>
            <li> part is very easy and front of chin is also easy.  </li>
            <li> It gets all the hair out and it easy very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is very useful and handy if you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> When you get the hang of it its quick and you get use to it real easy.  </li>
            <li> So simple yet it works very nicely!</li>
            <li> Eh, doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as the original brand.</li>
            <li> Easy, cheap, effective.</li>
            <li> This device is very flexible and easy to control it works great</li>
            <li> A pretty good tool, all in all.</li>
            <li> It worked really good the first time on the lips to remove hair but haven&#x27;t mastered the sides of the face with it.  </li>
            <li> Give your face a good go around the first time and then its just maintenance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it just hurts so much!</li>
            <li> a great fun and useful gift.</li>
            <li> It hurts more and sometimes grabs your skin when removing the hair and sometimes it leaves a rash where the hair was removed from and also it easily gets rusted and not durable at all.</li>
            <li> I now can do this quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li> The cheap ones work just as well as the more costly ones:-)...</li>
            <li> Very cheap and very worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work , tweezers are more accurate and faster</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product and so far I am happy.</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is makeup/oil free... to get the all unintended hair off your face...</li>
            <li> love the free shipping, no damage to the package at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its brilliant and women should stop getting threaded and waxed for facial hair besides eyebrows and get one of these babies.</li>
            <li> The package came early, and the product was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best $1 i ever spent.</li>
            <li> This cheap tool is good for getting cheek hair, but doesn&#x27;t do a good job on upper lips and chins.</li>
            <li> This product quickly pulls the hair out and leaves the area nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, fast shipping, always available, easy to use, good size packaging, good brand name.</li>
            <li> While a teenaged boy would be pleased and excited about entering this state, I am not.</li>
            <li> It cool!  </li>
            <li> I love this item, unique concept.  </li>
            <li> It hurts at first but given the results I am sure I will get used to it!</li>
            <li> It works easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it was easy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> These seem to break easily.</li>
            <li> you bend it, and the stuff falls out easily</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to clean it and take care of the areas that you pluck :)</li>
            <li> but what can I say beauty is pain for the price it can&#x27;t be beat and is easily portable and stops you from looking like SHEMAN...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also breaks easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> and it was easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use one or two very quick wax strips than sit there and pull my hair 10 at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes the hair and its really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is exceptionally easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to use once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product does not come with instructions but it&#x27;s easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> I had to look up videos on how to use it correctly but after that it was easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> this was so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;cleared</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think that the product is easy for carry and i can have that any time with me.</li>
            <li> As I said, it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> treading is really easy with it.</li>
            <li> you gotta be strong when ou use this because it will hurt.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect about this item, all I knew is that I was kind of scared to try it.</li>
            <li> Cheap but really doing a good job removing fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy for the low price and on top of that, free shipping.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it will hurt as first (JUST THINK THREADING)</li>
            <li> a nice cheap tool, better than plucking your whole face, and wasting a lot of money to wax.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I liked it.</li>
            <li> Totally user error, but it works that great to grab those hairs and remove them quickly and easily!</li>
            <li> When I compared the 2 springs, Bellabe is bright and shiny and new.</li>
            <li> that is fine and longer.  </li>
            <li> they were fine</li>
            <li> its easy to use, cheap, and removes hair.</li>
            <li> did not get the product for this, but you should note that you should not get this if you are expecting to to fine plucking of eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me with fine hair, forget it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working just as fine.</li>
            <li> but this one is fine till now.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;slight curve works fine often</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I tweeze my brows and am fine with that.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working just as fine.</li>
            <li> but this one is fine till now.</li>
            <li> if you have just fine baby hair, go for it.  </li>
            <li> The product works fine.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> i love this and its so quick</li>
            <li> it was super easy--I just bent it and blew on it--voila!  </li>
            <li> Going quickly did seem to help a bit, and if nothing else got more hair out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works well and is a great alternative to the other, more costly brand, and a good way to determine if you will like it without spending as much money.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, for more reasons than one!</li>
            <li> It may work ok for baby fine hair but the spring is too large for more stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> This little thing might be cheap, but it has worked great for me!</li>
            <li> Send instructions so I can do an accurate review of the product.</li>
            <li> My Mom liked it so much she ordered 10 of them for her co-workers.</li>
            <li> Its dirt cheap</li>
            <li> my skin was smooth, no blotchiness, but i did break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and works as designed.</li>
            <li> But overall the product work great.</li>
            <li> Even if shipping was FREE...</li>
            <li> Bellabe also comes in a reusuable tube that I can store my hair remover and is very convenient and handy.</li>
            <li> This was REALLY CHEAP.</li>
            <li> It works really well to remove hair, I tryed it on my face and it kind of hurts</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great beuty device and it arrived before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> Could have been my error but hurt more than it was worth to try to figure it out.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a cheap buy</li>
            <li> I found this tool, for a fraction of the price, with free shipping.</li>
            <li> With it being so cheap I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> But if youre looking to smooth your face</li>
            <li> This is so cheap, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy this.</li>
            <li> Also it is easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> it leaves my lip silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Yeah it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I got it through a promotion and was a great deal, so I am sharing my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> In this case it is: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!&amp;#34;  92 cents and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I just saw price because it was cheap</li>
            <li> More than worth the money.</li>
            <li> But it was really cheap, guess you get what you pay for in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that it gets all of the unwanted peach fuzz without having to wax the whole face.  </li>
            <li> But for a cheap option I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li> But considering how cheap it is</li>
            <li> i honestly can&#x27;t take much pain.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a cheap alternative to remove those peach fuzz from your face, no complaining there ^^</li>
            <li> it was cheap and i just wanted to try it and see how it was.</li>
            <li> Once you do it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> That would make it more worth the pain.  </li>
            <li> ;, because for this price and with a free shipping you might want to try, as it just might work for you.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hair free for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> but oh well, it was cheap</li>
            <li> I figured why not since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have another product very similar, which works great.  </li>
            <li> The plastic endings are cheaply made but what can you expect?</li>
            <li> This thing gets the hair by the roots and your face is smooth.</li>
            <li> When finished, I can&#x27;t get over how smooth my face looks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap</li>
            <li> A lot of people say that, cheap stuff from china is junk.</li>
            <li> I ordered one off eBay for about a dollar and free shipping, so even if it hadn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li> I am light skin</li>
            <li> cause it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It it wasn&#x27;t so cheap</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin felling smooth.</li>
            <li> I like it, cheap quality</li>
            <li> it was cheap, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does hurt a great deal above and just below the lip--actually brings tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li> ... fabulous?</li>
            <li> it is so cheap</li>
            <li> I guess it requires more finesse than I have because I wasn&#x27;t really able to work it very well.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for something better but will use this very inexpensive tool until I find something better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better alternative for me hair disolving creams because most hair removal creams irritate my skin, and also, I dont have time for waxing very often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still impressed with the number of hairs this has been removing and how smooth I&#x27;ve been looking, though I may still need to tweeze a few of the courser hairs.  </li>
            <li> but more importantly everyone has had a lot of fun with them....</li>
            <li> It is good for peach fuzz, but I don&#x27;t think that it does as well on  hair that is a bit more coarse.  </li>
            <li> This came in very handy for when I don&#x27;t have time to go to the salon and get my upper lip waxed.</li>
            <li> it removes hair easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using this tool, it is so easy and quick</li>
            <li> your hairs are out like that so easy and quick</li>
            <li> I dont even use it , if you think that it will take your hair off quick and easy dont buy this .</li>
            <li> Also once you get the swing of it, the process is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> found it super easy to use.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and much faster than plucking.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this product so I highly recommend this for anyone who is trying to get rid of their girl stash</li>
            <li> all in all though, the product came super fast and the price is amazing for what it does.</li>
            <li> It took 2-3 weeks to receive but it was definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Great for long travel, and if anticipate grooming needs.</li>
            <li> But with this price I am sure that you can afford to replace it once in a while ;)</li>
            <li> but once you have the hang of it, it&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> so I did some research online and found out the original one costs a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this instead of the original REM spring.</li>
            <li> Just wish it would pull more than two or three hairs at a time (was interested</li>
            <li> Worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this.</li>
            <li> Okay i first decided to buy thins thing</li>
            <li> Okay when i first opened the box i was like what the hell is this??</li>
            <li> I originally had the R.E.M. Spring</li>
            <li> ONCE it came in the mail I was excited to get rid of the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> You have to pull on it a bit to clean it and it just popped off.</li>
            <li> I clean it everytime</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m able to do it on my own and regularly without leaving my house or paying money for.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but it&#x27;s absolutely NOT pain free.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a brown bubble folder but it works well and is super cheap.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I do this while I watch TV and eventually my face is super smooth.  </li>
            <li> To clean, just pull the ends apart and blow.  </li>
            <li> I also clean it with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Love the price; would have liked it if the instructions were in English though</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason it doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars is because I feel like it doesn&#x27;t pull cleanly from the root sometimes (rips from the surface,</li>
            <li> A bit bulkier than the other product of kind, but it is still effective.  </li>
            <li> but as a product I didn&#x27;t find nothing too special.</li>
            <li> oh lord it most certainly did.</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting those stubborn hard to reach hairs in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Better if hair is kind long.</li>
            <li> but for now, it only pulls hair good</li>
            <li> The product is good, but my personal problem is</li>
            <li> Feel free to laugh at my expense, I deserve it.</li>
            <li> I did not have good results with this type facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> really though the pain goes away the more often you use it.</li>
            <li> so it is more intense.</li>
            <li> Another reason I did not give it full stars is that it can cause acne on your face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> Works really good on upper lips.</li>
            <li> but there not they really do work I will buy more as needed</li>
            <li> am so full of pain and regret.</li>
            <li> Good for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> Better than the wax job and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I gave these out as christmas gifts last year and everyone really loved them.  </li>
            <li> I love i so much that I bought 8 of them.</li>
            <li> Delivery was good, but instructions in Chinese so bomber.</li>
            <li> Eventually ordered the real thing and am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> this saves me so much money and time. :)</li>
            <li> I laughed when I saw it because it was so big.</li>
            <li> Love this so much much</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product</li>
            <li> This tool is advertised as being NOT painful.  </li>
            <li> Overall its good product not a necessity in life but for the price why not?</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sufficient to remove my hair on face :)</li>
            <li> Learning to make it function properly but think it is a good tool.</li>
            <li> its really good for upper lips.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34;, but not nearly as bad as waxing or tweezing.  </li>
            <li> not bad anyway</li>
            <li> Anw, the result is not bad.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product, just a bit tricky to figure out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this right now.</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t pinch too much and was able to grab the hairs and remove them quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so quick and easy to remove hair and it saves you soon much time!</li>
            <li> but it does a nice job on those fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li> Hurts like the dickens, but works great &amp; is extremely inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m following the instructions that I downloaded on YouTube, but perhaps I&#x27;m not doing something right or the light facial hair that I have, isn&#x27;t the type that this works best on.</li>
            <li> Happy to be free of messy waxing or chemical bleaching.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this is one of the greatest things ever invented.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it hurt, but it did remove all the fine hairs that I have been struggling to remove for years.</li>
            <li> I guess I could super glue it.  </li>
            <li> both ends quickly.  </li>
            <li> Both springs are trash worthy from the start.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with any directions but a quick look online shows you how to use it.  </li>
            <li> I guess I am lucky in one aspect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the more I use it the more facial hair will be removed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick considering that it came from overseas.</li>
            <li> IF im lucky.</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, and so inexpensive, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Will most likely order more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll go quick.</li>
            <li> and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Packed adequately for contents.</li>
            <li> This is a quick way for me to remove unwanted hair without having to go to the salon and wait 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> but again...I quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, this is great for someone who needs just a quick little clean up.</li>
            <li> By the way, the hairs it doesn&#x27;t get are easier to pluck because they are pulled out a bit more than they normally would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But hey it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> :) Oh if you use it often, try getting a new one in about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and really effectiv.</li>
            <li> The product is okay but doesn&#x27;t do a good job at removing small hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are easy to use and dont pull too much.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, came after 2 months and it has barely been used as I dont find them useful and effective.</li>
            <li> and its so easy and fast.</li>
            <li> and I had to plan around it, because the red marks were even more noticeable than the hairs were!</li>
            <li> Just pay the extra money for a better product!</li>
            <li> It grabs hairs pretty well, but you just have to take your time!</li>
            <li> Hurts like a bitch at first, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I get occasional thicker hairs that show up on my neck and chin, and this EASILY removes most of them.</li>
            <li> The first time it is used hurts a good deal, but after that, daily use is quite pain free and really convenient.  </li>
            <li> I think they are a great little gift.</li>
            <li> This little tool was so effective that I bought two more and gave one to my sister.  </li>
            <li> I bought this without very high expectations, I thought its cheap why not...</li>
            <li> Although visibly I don&#x27;t see as much hair, my face isn&#x27;t smooth.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason this thing is so cheap guys, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> tweezing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put soothing lotion on afterwards to calm the area.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it, but bought it either way because it was cheap and there was no shipping/tax fee included.</li>
            <li> It grabs all but the very tiniest hairs and leaves you smooth and mustache free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think its worth the buy</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li> My old epicare tool is lot better</li>
            <li> It does sting, but the pain is so worth it.</li>
            <li> This device works best on long or semi long hair not on short(stubble)</li>
            <li> Its not even worth spending a $</li>
            <li> Kind of like a hand held personal epilady.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> however, i have not had much success with them.</li>
            <li> but I rarely see it.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll worth the wait.</li>
            <li> paid only a few cents for it plus free shipping, so the price was excellent!</li>
            <li> this is far better</li>
            <li> Effectively removes hair if used properly.  </li>
            <li> This works better than I expected , it hurts but it does work , all my friends love using it</li>
            <li> I use this for the peach fuzz on my face to give my face a softer look and make my face makeup look more natural.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to try just for fun, but don&#x27;t have expectations like you&#x27;ll have a face threading session.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make it useful.</li>
            <li> Great for old lady peach fuzz as well as those occasional whiskers!  </li>
            <li> Can hurt as it pulls out the hair but is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I only paid $0.67 (free shipping).</li>
            <li> but it gets the job done and is worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth the money you save by not having to go get it done</li>
            <li> but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth it to save 90% of your money though.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless I think its a good investment if you&#x27;re looking for something fast and convenient although it&#x27;s not entirely painless.</li>
            <li> had friends try it without any success.  </li>
            <li> Kind of think tweezing a bunch of hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I should have know by the value that this was not what it is even worth.</li>
            <li> So worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> But it works so well that it&#x27;s worth the pain.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a useful hair removal tool, then I would recommend buying the R.E.M...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li> The pain, for me, was a bit much at first (especially right under my nose) but it gets easier and easier until you find yourself sitting in front of your computer screen rolling this over your upper lip for fun!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied but not overly excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I learn quick to just grab and pull fast!</li>
            <li> It was a pleasant surprise, and worth waiting the week and a half.</li>
            <li> This spring was reasonably priced, came exactly as described, and is a good alternative to chemicals for facial hair</li>
            <li> The product is good, I just don&#x27;t like that your eyebrows have to be so long before it will pull them properly, and dang does it hurt, but im more of a shaver than a tweezer.</li>
            <li> Other than that, good value</li>
            <li> Been bleaching my face since I was in high school, and it&#x27;s good to finally find a product that won&#x27;t burn my face (like waxing does) or drain my bank account.</li>
            <li> so I came right to Amazon and bought</li>
            <li> but I think I will go on youtube to find out if I am doing it right.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right..</li>
            <li> It will not remove hairs everywhere--the angle has to be right.  </li>
            <li> It works if you do it right</li>
            <li> you use it right</li>
            <li> right  now).  </li>
            <li> You do have to have it positioned just right for it to grab the hair</li>
            <li> i like it ,but sometimes it wont pluck right away, takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> I recieved these in the mail right away.</li>
            <li> maybe i didn&#x27;t use it right, but it didn&#x27;t come with instructions anyway.</li>
            <li> It took time to get the maneuver right.</li>
            <li> You have to sort of play with it twisting the two sides until you find the right way.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to find the right way to use it, but once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> The technique is just to bend and straighten it right at the hairs.</li>
            <li> it might be just right for you.</li>
            <li> I started doing it right...</li>
            <li> The reviews I read before were right...</li>
            <li> This thing pretty much saved me from embarrassment and spending huge money.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty sure I am not that far off.</li>
            <li> I love this method of removing facial hair, it is very efficient and easy to</li>
            <li> it removes facial hair very easily.</li>
            <li> the Spring Facial hair remover I received was excellent and was NOT a let down.</li>
            <li> To be on the safe side I gave it a major cleaning and sterilization before I used it.</li>
            <li> however, once that five minutes of mind numbing pain is over and you master the task, this little device is great for facial hair :)</li>
            <li> I like it better than waxing because it didn&#x27;t leave my skin super red where I removed the hair.</li>
            <li> Felt it at first, but got adjusted to it and find it very handy when there are a few hairs that need to be pulled out.</li>
            <li> After learining the correct way, this tool is very good, and yes it does hurt, but I can get my upper lip done in about 2 mins or less, so not bad.</li>
            <li> My face has a very fine layer of blonde hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not too hairy and my facial hair is very fine except eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I would spend a little more money and make sure your are ordering from a USA company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little tool and it is so cheap!</li>
            <li> I will say, the side extensions are cheap, and the does not look shiny new, and silvery.</li>
            <li> It works great for my womanly facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is good for women who may be self conscious about facial hair.</li>
            <li> 13 yrs old daughter loves and amazed with this.very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than anticipated, was larger than anticipated, was REALLY great quality.</li>
            <li> And let your male friends, relatives, and spouses try it - more fun could not be had.</li>
            <li> This product is really worth more than the low price it is offered at.</li>
            <li> but I was able to pop it right back on.</li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> At this price it certainly wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the best with the fine hairs, as occasionally I will still have to get the tweezers out for a tough hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always been a little wigged out by the downy fuzz that you can see in bright daylight (or in that damn magnifying mirror that I just had to have).</li>
            <li> I have tiny light facial hair on the side of my face by my ears and it worked like magic!</li>
            <li> This little tool works so good on my damn hairy face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nearly pain free (some very minor pain), no residue, and very quick.</li>
            <li> Not all replicas are good imitation of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Came on time and works pretty good but does hurt a little if your not use to plucking.</li>
            <li> This nifty little tool, though it does hurt a bit, is far more effective than using a pair of tweezers to remove hair, is neat, cleans up well.</li>
            <li> Do your due diligence and read the reviews on the different brands, but I am super happy with my R.E.M.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> So value is very good and product is very similar to what the other sites offer but a heck of a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Removes most of the facial hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> But I will buy this again over the higher priced items.</li>
            <li> At first it hurts.</li>
            <li> I think that the item could have been made with higher quality.</li>
            <li> You just have to know how to use it at first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it completely broke after a week of use, but its cheap enough for me to buy more</li>
            <li> It works better than tweezing or chemicals on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure if i would buy a more expensive one (the ones that cost around $16-25), it&#x27;d be better.</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit at first, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll want to do it all the time.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love this niceEshop Spring Facial Hair Remover.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> At first it hurts, but you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how to work it (didn&#x27;t come with instructions)</li>
            <li> I cant say if this hurts anymore than tweezing, to me it feels almost exactly like the threads they use at the Salon</li>
            <li> Just takes some getting used to at first.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to use this tool, but I figured it out on the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful I tried it because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back! :)</li>
            <li> This is my first one of these types of things..</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so much better than practically chemically burning my skin off and still having upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> , I know better next time.  </li>
            <li> but they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty thorough job.</li>
            <li> There is pain but definitely gets better with every use.  </li>
            <li> With this price you can&#x27;t expect more but one you should keep in mind that you should know how to use it in proper way because it doesn&#x27;t have any manual and</li>
            <li> I contacted them when my first one did not come in the mail</li>
            <li> came off first time using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get exactly what you pay</li>
            <li> first time I went to use it</li>
            <li> Not only that this caused more unsightly ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Yeah it hurts at first</li>
            <li> Its exactly how you thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work and even broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Works really well , even for courser hair !</li>
            <li> glad this was only $2.</li>
            <li> It removes hair pretty well..</li>
            <li> I prefer it over hot wax.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says it will.</li>
            <li> This hurts WAY too much to use!</li>
            <li> It hurts at first</li>
            <li> At first, we looked at it with a puzzled eye.</li>
            <li> But, once she started using it and got over the initial discomfort of it, she has come to love it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> One end of this tool broke while I was removing from the box, before my first use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how it&#x27;s actually supposed to work.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to all who have facial hair problems! :)</li>
            <li> for the first time.</li>
            <li> The first couple rolls I had</li>
            <li> When it first came, I did not know how to use it</li>
            <li> Use ice on your face and then use this tool and it won&#x27;t hurt as much!</li>
            <li> Definitely works way better than tweezers.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like when you first started tweezing your eyebrows and now that you&#x27;ve been doing it for years you don&#x27;t even bat an eye when</li>
            <li> If done consistently the hair starts to grow in softer, I&#x27;ve noticed with my chin hair.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It costs $25 or more to get your entire face threaded or waxed.</li>
            <li> I had a better one, but this still gets the job done, it just misses some of the smaller hairs</li>
            <li> so it takes more time to go over the same spots.</li>
            <li> It would work pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> It really does work though!</li>
            <li> First, my skin is way too sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does hurt when you first use the tool, but the pain lessens from your continuous usage of it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty dang hairy.</li>
            <li> , I got it on my first try.</li>
            <li> It hurt the first minute or so</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> Next time I will spend more for a better one that actually pulls out hairs.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that you got more than one of these when I made my purchase but received only the one.  </li>
            <li> A bit tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> As this cost around a $1 - including shipping - I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s been one of my better investments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I still give it 5 stars for being the first hair remover that doesnt cause me</li>
            <li> It sure beats pulling them all out individually.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just better overall).</li>
            <li> Yes the first time you try this</li>
            <li> but so did tweezing your eyebrows the first time.</li>
            <li> Wash your face first to get the oil out and the hairs up.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from facial hair for years and have never had a smooth result!</li>
            <li> Glad it was only $2.</li>
            <li> While the product does exactly what it says it will do.... pull your hairs out....</li>
            <li> The product is looks exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I prefer it over hot wax.</li>
            <li> First purchase from amazon</li>
            <li> It hurts just a bit the first couple of times but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> If you are asking yourself if there is a difference between a $16 spring and a $5 spring and why should you pay more for something so simple, then this is a review for you.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the company says it will do.</li>
            <li> works wonders and is pretty</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it works really well!</li>
            <li> I saw a similar product that was supposedly &amp;#34;recommended by Oprah&amp;#34; for about $12 more than this one.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it on the fine hairs in my upper lip and it grabs and plucks so easy, it&#x27;s not hard to use either.</li>
            <li> However I sometimes have trouble getting the more fine hairs</li>
            <li> It was larger than expected, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> I used it only on the Upper lip and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Once you get past how funny this tool looks - and your husband stops laughing when you tell him what it is used for - you will find that it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I loved a more expensive version of this I bought</li>
            <li> and you don;t want to run for your tweezers haha,,,  only grab this and is really fast !!!!</li>
            <li> so it may just be me, so I would definitely recommend others to clean, sanitize before and after using!</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m not disappointed... but just wish it was a little better..</li>
            <li> This little thing is not only cheap but it works so good.</li>
            <li> However, my upper lip has pretty strong hairs and it takes a while to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> At first, I was going to stop using it because it hurt so much.</li>
            <li> must as say it really pools the hair from the root pretty impress....</li>
            <li> It really hurts the first time too</li>
            <li> I also won&#x27;t suggest using it for long or grown hairs because it hurts more.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty much painless</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t easier or fast than tweezing, the area that actually pulls the hair is very minute, and it takes more effort and time than just using a tweezer or an epilator.</li>
            <li> Overall, just a great alternative to the other brands.</li>
            <li> gets rusty pretty fast.</li>
            <li> the pain was intense at first, I could used to it.</li>
            <li> At first the pain was intense, but after a while I became used to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for removing those small hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> You twist the product in an upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape, and kind of roll it up your face (or wherever) to pull the hair out at the root.</li>
            <li> either try to get a little hair at a time or use some kind of numbing cream the first couple times.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m super sensitive to waxing and always break out afterwards.</li>
            <li> Facial hair has never been so easy or painless to remove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removes upper lip hair easily.</li>
            <li> try all different combinations of directions until you find something easy and work well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The ends do come off but are easily put back on.</li>
            <li> It clings to your small unwanted hair and your able to pluck away quickly.great item to have I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I was holding it so the handles were pointed straight away from my face, and wasn&#x27;t grabbing much hair..</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the R.E.M. and the spring is thicker and less flexible on these, which makes it a challenge to grab the hairs effectively.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend for people with facial hair.</li>
            <li> It works best if you bend it a little less than shown in the photo there</li>
            <li> Can smart if twist too slowly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> May have to repeat over certain areas.</li>
            <li> As it didn&#x27;t come with instructions,I had to watch a YouTube video just to make certain I was using it correctly.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this product is very nice and very convinient to have, especially when some hair removal on the go is needed.</li>
            <li> The spring is really simple looking and very cheap (less than $1.00 + free shipping!).</li>
            <li> this works great on medium sized hairs, not super short or long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not work on fine or short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Ends</li>
            <li> but if you keep at it regularly, all those fine fuzzies are gone.</li>
            <li> only removes fine ones.</li>
            <li> either way, it&#x27;s a pretty decent thing when you figure out how to work it.</li>
            <li> This little device is amazing.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little bit but amazing results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nice little gadget.</li>
            <li> Effective- takes a little practice but each person can find their comfort zone and use</li>
            <li> I had to watch a few youtube videos to figure out how it works, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much for how cheap it was, but it was rusted in numerous places.</li>
            <li> Better off plucking with tweezers, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt all that much when you pluck the hairs out, and it doesn&#x27;t leave huge red spots all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> But be careful, it hurts :)</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest tool like this I have seen on amazon and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do its job .</li>
            <li> It hurts just as much as tweezing/waxing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> tooo much work.</li>
            <li> This thing works so much better than I expected considering how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for removing cheek and chin fuzz.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s convenient (much faster than plucking,</li>
            <li> very convenient.</li>
            <li> but if you just do it really fast</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get rid of unwanted hair with ease.</li>
            <li> If I can get a user manual, it will be appreciated.</li>
            <li> works very well, (which means if you&#x27;re not use to it</li>
            <li> i dont really know how to use it</li>
            <li> Peach fuzz can be embarrassing especially when light hits u</li>
            <li> but i got over it really fast because i had to use it too often</li>
            <li> and it still really grabs the hair.</li>
            <li> so its not like I am out too much.</li>
            <li> It doesnt remove much hair at all</li>
            <li> But the pain lessens over time and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing or threading.</li>
            <li> Just know how to use it, know your tolerance for pain, and don&#x27;t expect it too fast.</li>
            <li> I will say sugaring is much easier for me..</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I am still really iffy on this product.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t wish to pay too much for</li>
            <li> this product really pain on your face.</li>
            <li> However, I gave it to my mom because I&#x27;d much rather wax than use it.</li>
            <li> Really floppy spring doesn&#x27;t roll in handle at all...</li>
            <li> is much cleaner and faster than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> It took a whole month to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I got several since they were cheap.  </li>
            <li> very difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li> am ABSOLUTELY going to have to order more.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice it pulling out much hair.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> it is very slim and lightweight.</li>
            <li> The threading beauty tool does not work as well as the creams and it hurts more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not to mention with the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really picks up all the hair.</li>
            <li> I stretche it a bit too much trying to shake hair out.</li>
            <li> it hurt so much</li>
            <li> but it hurts no worse than tweezing--and instead of plucking out one mustache hair, it kinda thins the whole area and gets 20 hairs with one go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey thanks for the product it really works doens&#x27;t need any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ever get this again because it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised but yes, it hurts a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it too fast make</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s only cheap because of the pain you have to endure</li>
            <li> , I am not one who can tolerate much pain..</li>
            <li> how fast it takes the hair away and</li>
            <li> The ends of the remover pop off and are not held/glued on very well.</li>
            <li> This thing pulls the hair out by the roots and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> razors seemed to break me out, and my hair grows so fast it didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li> really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It somewhat works but the hair comes out much quicker than the video said.  </li>
            <li> Really hurts and doesn&#x27;t remove that much hair that I can tell.</li>
            <li> but I find this much easier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it hurts to much</li>
            <li> My face feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t understand all these comments about having to &#x27;learn&#x27; how to use it.  </li>
            <li> May work for some folks I guess just didn&#x27;t work real well for me</li>
            <li> Really needs them.</li>
            <li> make it so much easier and faster to get rid of hair.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> to use as often as you want.&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair at the rooT,IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT MUCH ...</li>
            <li> the tool and lightly lay it on your skin just enough to grab hair</li>
            <li> Came fast too.</li>
            <li> but you get used to the pain after a while and its much easier than plucking out each hair with a tweezers.</li>
            <li> you do have to be careful not to get your hair (from the top of your head that is) tangled in the spring when you doing your jaw line.</li>
            <li> This item was so much cheaper</li>
            <li> so I have problems with facial hair primarily on my chin and underneath it.</li>
            <li> Much pricier tho.  </li>
            <li> I think mine arrived about a month after I ordered it, but this was very inexpensive</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Just experiment with how much of a bend you put on it and the angle you use to go across your face.</li>
            <li> I am back to using Olay facial hair removal duo for the upper lip, which works great</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as pulling out hairs one by one</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like waxing; it will hurt for longer hairs but if trimmed too much, the wax cannot grip.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t out much at all.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> It works really well!👍</li>
            <li> Really hurts, of course.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work like it should have</li>
            <li> yes it really hurts.  </li>
            <li> Can do your whole face except for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use creams or just for a fast hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product really works for removing unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> and since I was just trying it I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much.</li>
            <li> For what I paid, I wasent expenting much.</li>
            <li> The spring mechanism doesn&#x27;t appear to be working very well to remove hair.</li>
            <li> cheeks too if I really want to feel pain.</li>
            <li> So, I bought two of the these because they are so much cheaper ($1.95 vs. $13.75) to see if they compare.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected it might, but then again, I will keep trying to get better at using it. &#x27;</li>
            <li> After becoming pregnant and having my second child, my facial hair has gotta outta control!</li>
            <li> Works quickly and is so much better than using a pair a tweezers for excessive hair.  </li>
            <li> my rem spring is as new as the first day.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be just as good as the other tool I bought {different brand}  </li>
            <li> I loved that it come earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any red marks, it is quick and easy to use,  and some of the hairs on my chin have not grown back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and takes little time to use.</li>
            <li> It is more for broad areas than specific hairs.</li>
            <li> , I use it on my upper lip and it may hurt a bit but its worth it!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t help but worry about security concerns either by my phone number, or other information, like my credit card information is safe considering it is coming from a out-of-country</li>
            <li> The first time I used under my nose it was a little stingy maybe because there was more hair, but now I feel the pull</li>
            <li> Does a better job than most creams and waxes, and does not subject the user to the unpleasant smell of  most depilatories.</li>
            <li> It  definitely does work as it yanked the hairs out cleanly.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s small but powerful.</li>
            <li> painful at first but wonderful!!</li>
            <li> , clean the spring atleast once a week with cotton and some facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Learning how to use it is very easy, after a few minutes you will have it figured out.</li>
            <li> I have been using them only a week and only one has been used so far, so far so good.</li>
            <li> However, now my face is as smooth and a baby&#x27;s bum, and I am pleased with the results of this simple little gizmo.</li>
            <li> First of all, the ends are two bulbous plastic pink knobs that are not nearly as small or easy to use as</li>
            <li> only problem that I can see that over time it&#x27;s gonna get full with hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda gross but really cool to look at.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up with a face full of itchy red bumps and stubble.  </li>
            <li> Buy the more expensive version with the smaller spring for good results.</li>
            <li> But because it is free shipping, be aware that your product will probably most likely arrive much later than the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed ex hairdresser and used to have my own professional waxing setup--but what a mess for home use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li> the more you use it the less it hurts though.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking that it will hurt less the more I use it.</li>
            <li> As you use it more it hurts less.</li>
            <li> Not much to it, but simple in this case means effective.</li>
            <li> You can hone in on a particular spot by bending it just so.</li>
            <li> I bought wax strips instead and used one, and while it was just as quick as this spring, it left my skin irritated</li>
            <li> I have been recommending this to everybody so far and with such a cheap price</li>
            <li> Got it quiet quick - for that is was shipped from China.</li>
            <li> BUT does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Just twist the end pieces gently  until the spring starts to roll UP your face (don&#x27;t push; it needs to roll slowly on its own).</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not as painless as a hair remover cream, but you&#x27;ll never run out of quick hair removal as you might with a cream.</li>
            <li> On most of the face, including over the upper lip, simply rolling it upward will get rid of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the instructions say, nor is it easy to try and use, you should be able to use it on fine hair, however it will only pull out long THICK hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily there are a million YouTube videos about it, and after trying it awhile I finally got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Even though not all of my facial hair can be pulled out, but it works for most of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painless and useful for the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the 8, they were not even the same color or metal, much cheaper and broke right away, one was even broke when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for hairy females.</li>
            <li> if you are pulling from a area with a lot of hair , you do need patience and a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so if you just want to try a spring hair remover or have a high tolerance for pain - go for it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for people with peach fuzz</li>
            <li> highly recommend using a post-epilation lotion on the areas after you remove the hair, as it helps a lot with irritation and pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine blonde peach fuzz and this puts a major dent in the supply.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use at first but after the 2nd/3rd use I was able to get the hang of it and removing facial hair is so easy now!  </li>
            <li> I used it, I experienced absolutely no redness (despite having highly sensitive skin) and all of the hair from my face that I wanted removed was gone in less than five minutes.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with this I am buying a second one to keep at my other home.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair in a single pass, which might be a good thing, because it feels just like you would expect from yanking out multiple hairs at the same time.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and small.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool for removing the hair around my lips.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool.  </li>
            <li> It is quicker than tweezing and gets the little hairs better.  </li>
            <li> Originally I thought it would pinch my skin, but it didn&#x27;t Of course, it wont take every single hair out</li>
            <li> Can be a bit painful to pull out hair, but who said beauty is easy!?!?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Works great, painful at first but really does work!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think anything so simple could do such a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me...waste of my time and money but just threw it in the trash..wasn&#x27;t worth even bothering to ship it back!!</li>
            <li> no this is the only thing thats worked worth its price and should buy millions before they stop making them.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is purchasing this item was really worth it because I&#x27;m now in my 20s and all of a sudden these hairs started growing on my chin</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal when removing hair.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s normal as well, though, with the spring and all.</li>
            <li> but it takes more time and can get messy.</li>
            <li> and she only waxes rarely to get the stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> (I use a Braun epilator normally).  </li>
            <li> I now have a scar from the wax which was too strong,not my normal brand.</li>
            <li> A FEW MORE NOW.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a bit every time, but it is worth than spending $3 dollars on threading every 2nd week.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to figure out how to use this within a few minutes of trying.</li>
            <li> :) I can do it at home in just a few minutes every couple weeks</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s normal...</li>
            <li> It works, but I could not get in the habit of using it regularly, so mine pretty much sits in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Good with peach fuzz and minute, thin hairs.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s really not hard to figure out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great with the really tough unruly hairs that just don&#x27;t belong there, but it&#x27;s excellent for large spaces and weird curves and all those tiny hairs you&#x27;d never get any other way besides waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> Pulls facial hair right out without any problems or concenrs, dont need to focus on mirror, can just use it and watch tv</li>
            <li> But no it goes right back together.</li>
            <li> Also, if the regular way to use it isn&#x27;t grabbing hairs, try moving it around on your face other ways, that&#x27;s what I do and it pulls out hairs easily!</li>
            <li> it works easily also because you just twist it down</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would be able to use this item properly or with success.  </li>
            <li> takes a couple tries to do it correctly but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It works best at removing the hair over my upper lip and it was really really painful the first time I did it.</li>
            <li> if your into new things, and can tolerate pain.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t see any new growth until 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than I expected it to be, and so can remove more at once if you need it to.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s understandable but it would&#x27;ve been nice if the spring plucked out all of my facial hair and not just a few.</li>
            <li> it is cheap and the usage is painless and effortless for the upperlip,chin, and for overall facial hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, this means I&#x27;m using a shaver for my face but that cute pink thing simply doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I feel SO much more confident now when I&#x27;m close to people, because I have nothing to be afraid about.</li>
            <li> but fortunately the price was low enough.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not exactly comfortable, but I find it easier to deal with than creams or depilatories that leave my sensitive skin with a chemical burn or rash.</li>
            <li> And, good grief, the price could not be better.</li>
            <li> Love this little tool!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t remove hair from a very sensitive place with it, but it work.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from a lady in California through eBay, price was the same and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and does remove little facial peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Although at first this seemed to work with no adverse effects, after a day my skin began to get patchy and red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely touched it since purchasing because it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> There is a technique you should use, and yes it definitely hurts the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> There was barely any blotchiness at all, and then it went away really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does the exact same thing as a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is my second one because I lost the first one.</li>
            <li> This was a very silly Ideal that I took a chance trying.</li>
            <li> I know you wouldn&#x27;t wanna take that chance of feeling double the pain than the first time you tried.</li>
            <li> She uses it regularly and now has baby soft, smooth facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this Facial Hair Remover Threading Beauty Tool a number of times, but have yet to get it to work consistently.  </li>
            <li> the spring facial hair remover threading beauty tool worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I do admit I didn&#x27;t know how to use it at first since the instructions weren&#x27;t in English, but Youtube helped me on that.</li>
            <li> It does exactly whatvit said it would and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I like the concept but even after a hot shower, this hurts to use on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
            <li> I first used it on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> And as far as cleaning, just stretch the string and the hairs fall out!</li>
            <li> It worked barely, but did a really crappy job at removing any substantial amount of hair.</li>
            <li> like most of the other users said this definitely hurts!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very small, flexible, quality seems to be good enough to do</li>
            <li> The only issue I might have is how to clean it properly, but other than that, worth the $ which isn&#x27;t even that much to begin with!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to get used to how this works, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be amazed with how easy it is.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars only instead of four or five stars despite it being very cheap because it is hard to use at first.</li>
            <li> This item definitely  works , the price is cheap, will have to see how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> Works as expected and super affordable.</li>
            <li> It got all rusty from the first use even though it wasn&#x27;t near any water the only water that it touched was when I cleaned it</li>
            <li> it definitely works, it hurts like no other, but i&#x27;d much rather have all hair pulled with alot of pain fast..</li>
            <li> First, the spring is a larger diameter and doesn&#x27;t bend as easily, so it is much less effective and more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> you can rotate only right hand and let the left hand steady and close to the surface&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a shock the first time you use it on your upper lip (as I expected) but is real fast to get use to.</li>
            <li> You really have to spend a long time to make sure you go over all of the areas, and there may still be a few hairs you missed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every single one (not sure if that is user error or just the product, or maybe nothing could get every hair) but it does the job and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that the pink handles come off really easy.</li>
            <li> - the REM tackles any hair except for your eyebrows easily - but not even that worked which led me to think this is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and needed something to help me remove upper lip facial hair!</li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age, I have reached that point in life where the peach fuzz on my face rivals that of a teenage boy about to sprout a beard.</li>
            <li> (thankful that I&#x27;m smart enough to figure it out -</li>
            <li> Be careful when you first use it or you are in for a shock!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little time, but it&#x27;s definitely doable, and I have not found anything better for this price with this ease and lack of irritation.</li>
            <li> This tool is shorter than what I had before, so it needs little more work while removing the facial hair.</li>
            <li> And you may need to go over and over the same area, pulling the hair out a little more each time.  </li>
            <li> This weird little thing is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> This works especially well on fine hairs as well as those stubborn &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; hairs above the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time deciding whether to buy it or not, but i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Of your hair is soft it will probably work</li>
            <li> The delivery took a really long time, but I was willing to wait for it.</li>
            <li> It works so far and works well.</li>
            <li> Cheap item you will waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> WOULD NOT WASTE MY MONEY ON ANOTHER PRODUCT LIKE THIS</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me so much though to the point where I have to throw the tool away, so it&#x27;s not that big</li>
            <li> (If you are sensitive to pain it will probably hurt you a lot)...</li>
            <li> When I look back at the area after sooo much rolling and twisting there is still hair.</li>
            <li> But it does really remove your facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, works great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , she was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s ease of use and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It pulls hairs out completely including the root.</li>
            <li> I use creams for my lip but the hair grows back somewhat fast.</li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t look natural to me.  </li>
            <li> (My face is too sensitive to use wax or</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin, and I break out after using this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt much, but I guess people have different pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> Removes all the hair and it doesnt grow back as fast as it would with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> but it really does minimize the amount of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but wow it did.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> it doesnt completely removes the hair but it does remove.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin was not irritated at all by it.</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever that I completely forgot about purchasing this</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made and trust me, this product is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well, the directions come in Chinese so you should download an app that will translate.</li>
            <li> This beauty tool really work for me, it remove facial hair like it had advertised.</li>
            <li> These Spring Facial Hair Removers really work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using sparingly to get used to pain in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back if it breaks really soon</li>
            <li> And do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I use R.E.M. spring facial hair remover on regular basis which is more expensive and better quality.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t dare try it on my face nor dare gifting them.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t even touch the sensitive areas with this (like upperlip, cheekbone area...).</li>
            <li> Leaves some peach fuzz, but at least it&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li> First it took a significantly long time for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li> After a while of using, pain is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it took out more than a few hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> but after a few different methods I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I need good hair removal products, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good to thin the entire area.  </li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s somewhat slow</li>
            <li> Regardless I purchased the same product for the same price and the other company was better.</li>
            <li> the two pink ends came right off.</li>
            <li> They are so easy and make unwanted hair a problem no more.  </li>
            <li> I believe this would be great for getting rid of the mustache area and other thin hairs.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little, kind of like a sting, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> I have found that it hurts less if you use it after washing your face or taking a shower, when your pores are really open and the hair can be removed easily.</li>
            <li> anymore i rather use this because it takes out every single hair even if its super short it will pull it out and doesnt burn me like waxing does</li>
            <li> It really takes out all these little unwanted hairs (especially in the mustache section) so quickly and its almost addicting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and if you have previously removed hair before, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other reviews on here make it seem.</li>
            <li> I mean, if you like the feeling of tiny hairs being plucked from your face one at a time by hot irons, by all means, enjoy.</li>
            <li> I usually wax and the hair grows back pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had to try lots of experiments to figure out how to really use.&lt;br /&gt;I find it&#x27;s different depending on the curve you&#x27;re applying on, however, the general idea I found was</li>
            <li> I am a dark-haired woman with parents of european decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short while, but already I&#x27;m pretty attached to it.</li>
            <li> Still overall a decent product</li>
            <li> Luckily it was less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t work well getting out fine hairs but the slightly thicker hairs it gets out</li>
            <li> Having about 30 small hairs all ripped out at the same time has a bit more of a sting...</li>
            <li> I saw the more expensive spring from another company and decided to give this one a try first since it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get it right the first time I had to watch tutorials on youtube.</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;ve read any of the other reviews, you know there may be a bit of pain involved -- but no pain, no gain, right?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> It works to some degree, because I can feel the hairs come out, but it&#x27;s not that easy and it only pulls few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> This came straight from china and took about a month, but I saved nearly $25 compared to tweezerman and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed at how much hair comes out without the lasting pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here but to find out that this really works</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, one of the pink ends fell off.</li>
            <li> I normally get my upper lip threaded</li>
            <li> My lips is back to being normal again without those damned hairs.</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit at first as you have to get used to iy , but than you just too away with minimal to no pain.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I heard a few little yelps from the bathroom as my wife tried this out the first time.</li>
            <li> I have to say this thing is freaking amazing but its hurts so bad the first time you use it!</li>
            <li> and remove just thin hair very good but not provide for thick hair.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail, it had little rust spots on the main wire part, but it works perfectly hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> it.......is extremely painful if you are not used to such a thing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, most certainly, twist quickly.</li>
            <li> I saw these at the NW Women&#x27;s Show years ago and a local store they were more.&lt;br /&gt;Granted these are very inexpensively made, but they are a terrific tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I really like is that it does NOT leave a red mark or red face, unlike tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The upper lip area definitely needs extra attention with this tool; one tip is, with your mouth closed, push your tongue out to make the upper lip area protrude more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast to do and the pain only lasts 5 seconds and yo would only have to do this like once a month.</li>
            <li> Good for random chin hairs that spring out If you don&#x27;t using actual tweezers</li>
            <li> it on the upper lip and after a few attempts found it to be very useful.</li>
            <li> you are hoping to do your arms, legs, and major areas of the body, this probably won&#x27;t be what you want.  </li>
            <li> It is actually the size of a pencil, not a small q-tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to clean it</li>
            <li> This is a powerful little tool.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful little tool.  </li>
            <li> I usually thread my upper lip and that was working fine, but when I heard about this tool I just had to try it</li>
            <li> The same item sells for various prices from less than a dollar to more than ten, but I believe they are all the same.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more painful in certain areas, but that&#x27;s really just because of your body.</li>
            <li> it works i&#x27;m so in love, the only downside is how do you properly get those hard angles done if your wrist won&#x27;t bend that way</li>
            <li> At least they were cheap</li>
            <li> I use it every Friday night to clear out my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Definitely something I am now self conscious about.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to get those light, thin hairs that you can only really see out in the sunny weather.</li>
            <li> and i would rather wax than bare the pain of it.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that it actually worked!</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t want to have a completely hairless upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one for my adult daughter as well, and she also loves it but has the same issue with the plastic handles falling off.</li>
            <li> but I let someone else try it and apparently the pain was unbearable??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never waste money on getting my upper lip waxed again -</li>
            <li> It is much longer than I expected (about the length of my forearm).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I am male, 19 years old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Boy was I surprised when it turned our that this skinny metal spring actually works!</li>
            <li> It also hurts like hell when you do actually grab hairs from sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I must have had some allergic reaction to the material of the metal, or the fact that it came directly from China (with Chinese on the package) and I have no idea what might have touched it.</li>
            <li> So far, have only tried on my face.</li>
            <li> I just received these (apparently from China) and cannot figure out how to use it?  </li>
            <li> I have such low pain tolerance, and I&#x27;m able to slowly do the sides of my face.</li>
            <li> I have been tweezing random hairs on my face for nearly 20 years, so I&#x27;m pretty used to that feeling, and it&#x27;s not really painful to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aging and getting a little fuzz on my face, visible if the sun hits my cheek the right way.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice to get it right, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handles on my spring pop off easily, making it difficult to use effectively.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it daily for new growth, and occasionally use the tweezer for a stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> I do need to use tweezers for the odd stubborn hair, but in all this is simple and fun to use -</li>
            <li> Its quick depending on how heavy your facial hair is.</li>
            <li> got mine a few days ago and figured out how to use it right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;ll have to repeat the process to remove the hair, but i don&#x27;t mind using this, it makes hair removal quick and effortless.</li>
            <li> The hair removal spring gets most of my facial hair out, its a little painful in the first and second uses but after that it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, like when you first pluck your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The first one (like the pink one in the picture) works great, the others are crap.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little but worth it to get rid of facial hair without having to wax at home or spend a ton of $$ at a salon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job, but it didn&#x27;t pull not a single hair from me.</li>
            <li> It is a great &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; way of removing facial hair, but can be painful at times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least ten times as effective as tweezing and hurts less.</li>
            <li> Consider your pain threshold before buying especially since the upper lip can be a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised at how small the hairs it could pull out were.</li>
            <li> There are no other complaints that I have about this product, only that I would have found about this product one or two years ago.</li>
            <li> It works, its a little tricky at first and the pain is tolerable.</li>
            <li> This works to a certain motion, some ways I roll it it doesn&#x27;t work and other ways I roll it it works, and it HURTS!</li>
            <li> Its a bit painful and causes redness so make sure you dont use it right before you go out.</li>
            <li> it is a little painful but the more you do it, the more you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for sideburns, but it&#x27;s tough to get short upper lip hairs.</li>
            <li> The spring will grab the small hairs on your face ten at a time an  pull them out quickly.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought an R.E.M. spring last year and keep telling my mom how much I love it for quickly (while still a bit painfully at times) removing chin and upper lip hairs....</li>
            <li> Now I really notice facial hair on other women...</li>
            <li> There was some &#x27;ouch&#x27; factor using it the first time, so I spread it out over a few days.  </li>
            <li> Yes it stings the first few times.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does hurt a little at first...but the smooth skin left behind is sooooo worth it.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier and it takes less than five minutes to get rid of all your hair.</li>
            <li> less of a hassle than waxing) and really does pull out hairs!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was less than a buck, but I really didn&#x27;t know it would work.  </li>
            <li> Then pull it out straight or give it a slight twist with both wrists.  </li>
            <li> but after I kept using it and kept getting more obsessed with pulling out every hair around my lips, you barely notice the pain.</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts a bit the first few times.  </li>
            <li> For the first few times, I put some analgesic cream on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (a bit painful at first, but you get used to it!)</li>
            <li> this product is super easy to use, you will spend less than a minute to get lip hairs (much less} I recently misplaced this product and in the drug store they have similar ones for MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I think it works, I am not sure if I am doing it right though because the instructions are not in English</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would really hurt but just like traditional plucking it hurts less as you keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wax breaks me out, tweezing takes forever and is almost impossible to do efficiently, hair removal creams break me out &amp; shaving is only good for a day.</li>
            <li> If you have facial hair on which you use other appliances, then this should work for the times when you can&#x27;t use the normal method.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally found that over the upper lip, only a slight bend is needed, whereas courser hairs might need a much stronger bend.</li>
            <li> Takes  a little practice but you can learn fast.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and does the job, but not without a little pain.  </li>
            <li> This little tool really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but very efficient</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little, especially near the lips.  </li>
            <li> It is a little red after I use it but goes away very soon.</li>
            <li> at first it&#x27;s a little strange because you are plucking the hairs all together.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t any more painful than plucking and it really does remove hair.</li>
            <li> The one I got was rusty and it was really hard to pick up hair even though I know I used it in the right way.</li>
            <li> you use both hands, it should be a right direction, which can be hard depending on the surface.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy and fast, much faster than tweezers, and much less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> My main concern was my upper lip &amp; a little on my jaws</li>
            <li> The main con about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out in one role, I have to go over the same spot a few times to get all the hair out.</li>
            <li> It hurts so much and it hardly removed hair from my stomach since i am very hairy, it only cut the hair in half.</li>
            <li> but it is quicker and by far cheaper than any other method I have used (used to wax and use hair removers but had to switch to threading when I started using retinoids on my face).</li>
            <li> Be very careful around eyebrows, just go nowhere near that area, if you need to pluck eyebrows use tweezers.</li>
            <li> Even if you have to buy a new one every three months, for less than a dollar</li>
            <li> I got this because as I get older, I seem to have these stiff chin hairs that I&#x27;m constantly tweezeing  -</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend starting with your upper lip, which is the most painful area by far.</li>
            <li> Used it wrong at first haha.</li>
            <li> I have thicker hairs that grow on my chin and neck area (the infamous &amp;#34;beard hairs&amp;#34;) and I found that this didn&#x27;t get them very well.  </li>
            <li> She described using it to be &amp;#34;as effective as using dull tweezers when your drunk and trying to pluck your own eyebrows with your eyes closed.&amp;#34;  I know thats silly</li>
            <li> I have a few thick facial hair along with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Holding it at first was a bit hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*This is BIG and inflexible unlike the REM which is smaller and flexible so you can easily turn it into a upside down &amp;#34;U: and pull all those unwanted hairs out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much hair is being pulled out.</li>
            <li> You also want to exfoliate each time you wash your face at least for the first week or so to help prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I have minor upper lip and chin hairs</li>
            <li> It takes a long time just to do my upper lip even though I feel hair being pulled out with each twist.</li>
            <li> It DOES HURT,you&#x27;re pulling out a lot of tiny hairs at once, so its not unexpected.</li>
            <li> This just Flat out doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Given that faces aren&#x27;t flat surfaces, some hairs will be easier to grab than others.</li>
            <li> But it is taking so long to get my second delivery.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done only if ur hairs are long.</li>
            <li> I paid around 25 bucks for my rem spring, long back...</li>
            <li> On that note, the product is quite durable and would last as long as it can stay clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin defiantly looks smoother but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long</li>
            <li> It gets all the hairs, whether theyre peach fuzz or thick and goatie-like, it does hurt at first</li>
            <li> It hurts, just like tweezing does, although a little worse since it pulls more hairs out at once.</li>
            <li> Bought this and thought it didn&#x27;t work right at first but realized I was using it wrong!</li>
            <li> would def buy again but this will prob last me a long time!</li>
            <li> it takes a very long time to use it, and it only pulls out 1 or 2 hairs out</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 stars because I doubt it will last very long</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work...not tight or strong enough to actually pull small finer hairs out and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one for far less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less sensitive to it</li>
            <li> It was expensive, messy, and I had to wait forever for the wax to warm up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one for far less.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when I use it on my upper lip I have welted red marks for a few hours; but the same thing happens every time I get my eyebrows waxed, so I kinda expected that too.  </li>
            <li> End the end, I battled my fears and decided to give this item a shot, despite not really understanding how to use it because the packaging it came in was in Chinese and there were only 2 pictures shown to show how to use this item.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes worth of experimenting to figure out how to use it and a few times to get used to the stinging</li>
            <li> For the money, it is a good investment to keep around in a pinch, say the car glove box or the purse, but I have broken down and ordered my first epilator to do the dirty work from now on-lol.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts really bad the first time you use it, but by the second, third, and so on it gets a lot easier, now it only hurts for the really stubborn hairs...</li>
            <li> OMG, it is ridiculous it hurts so much!  </li>
            <li> The skin is left a little red but that is to be expecting since you just ripped hair out of your face, but again, it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap quality, but for what it is that is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> This product works, but there is a trick to getting it to work and it is some kind of painful.  </li>
            <li> It is *NOT* perfect, but for a cheap plastic tool it works for me.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is it&#x27;s so much longer than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> I am Italian and have the dark facial hair.  </li>
            <li> When I sprouted an extra crop of dark hairs above my lip during pregnancy, something had to be done.  </li>
            <li> but it takes really long.</li>
            <li> It does work though so as long as you can handle some pain</li>
            <li> it was purchased so long ago.</li>
            <li> Have a long mustache and beard?</li>
            <li> I guess it works, but takes too long to use to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> It even arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The only minus was it took over a month to receive</li>
            <li> Maybe you need really long hairs</li>
            <li> A couple times I accidentally went too far and it snagged a few strands out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> This thing is just too strange.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t drag this across your face, you have to constantly stop and pull it away to pull out the hairs.</li>
            <li> this product did not take long to come.</li>
            <li> Oh and it also took long to get to me house.</li>
            <li> It work like it says it was much larger than I expected</li>
            <li> so when I saw that I thought I could buy &amp; save money on the long run</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the really long hairs</li>
            <li> once you get the hang of using the tool its easier than waxing or tweezing or even shaving and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It was definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is too flimsy and way too long.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take as long to arrive as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get.</li>
            <li> Plus shipping took a really long time too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s bigger and harder to handle than I</li>
            <li> You could put it in your pocket even though it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its way bigger than I expected  </li>
            <li> and i didnt take as long as tweezing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have to let my hairs grow out really long</li>
            <li> this will cause the spring to roll towards your skin&lt;br /&gt;3)Roll slowly, too fast</li>
            <li> but this method is VERY painful and pulls out most hair but not all, it is really unconfortable to use on your upper lip, it does not work.</li>
            <li> Unless you have long hairs, and I mean looooooonnnnnggg hairs, I don&#x27;t think you will benefit much from this product.</li>
            <li> have pale, sensitive skin and have never seen a sign of redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I have now bought a different one that has a differently shaped handle that is black.  </li>
            <li> This is painful to use, but not much more than using tweezers, plus you can remove more than one or two hairs at a time, so it is much much quicker than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I was debating on getting something more expensive than this little fella here.</li>
            <li> This little spring facial hair remover tool actually works!  </li>
            <li> Waxing leaves me with a scrape-like mark that takes days to wear off while this springy-thing left no indication other than redness that was gone in under an hour.  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a sting similar to plucking except you are taking multiple hairs out at once</li>
            <li> Such a simple little tool that does the job.  </li>
            <li> i have one back up in case of extreme emergency.</li>
            <li> you have a lot of hair around your lip area or other facial areas</li>
            <li> but I think the long hairs is what u want to worry about not the little barely noticeable ones.</li>
            <li> I watched a review for the other product and when I received this tool, I did the same thing</li>
            <li> I read several other reviews before I ordered.  </li>
            <li> The niceEhop Spring Facial Hair Remover Threading didn&#x27;t work on my upper lip hair &amp; irritated my skin (small bumps on my upper lip area).</li>
            <li> it works ok a little difficult to grab hairs</li>
            <li> It works but takes a little extra time and effort to remove all unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I tried on the chin, fuzz and arms (only to see if it would work other places there is not the face), but nothing.</li>
            <li> Definitely does hurt, but as other people said, you eventually get used to it.</li>
            <li> All my little upper lip hairs were completely gone in a matter of seconds, and with only a little bit of pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use wax for my face since I was a teen because I&#x27;m light/medium complexion with very DARK facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is far more efficient and less painful.</li>
            <li> Just as well I wont reccomend doing it on completely dry skin either.</li>
            <li> and I think I didn&#x27;t dry it because I didn&#x27;t expect it to get all rusty.</li>
            <li> Dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I had a few tiny pimples the next day, but not in the way I breakout all over when I thread or wax.</li>
            <li> Results last longer than using a cream and hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as heavy.  </li>
            <li> but it does not hold a single hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going through with my tweezers afterward to get some single hairs here</li>
            <li> I ordered this right after seeing a youtube video on a similar but expensive product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get that deep dark root of the hair</li>
            <li> (my face is kind of numb after all these years!).  </li>
            <li> After awhile though I guess the spring got loose and it doesn&#x27;t work that well anymore.</li>
            <li> I docked the product one star because it arrived loose in an envelope, without any packaging.</li>
            <li> Luckies, the price is not high on this one.</li>
            <li> ordered this product over a month ago and its still not here…i would love to write a rivew on the product its self but its kinda impossible.</li>
            <li> Pretty painful but much quicker than a tweezer</li>
            <li> I noticed it slightly pinches the skin which may feel like its pulling hair (similar to the feeling of threading)</li>
            <li> Following the video I&#x27;d previously seen online did not help either.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely one of those hair removers that it hurts less the longer you use it.</li>
            <li> I have slightly darker peach fuzz on my upper lip and this minimizes it so well!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will hurt less in the future.</li>
            <li> I had assumed this would be the same as one I had used previously.</li>
            <li> Plus, it cleans up all my unwanted facial hair leaving me less trips to the threading salon.  </li>
            <li> , I am a 40 year old in menopause, so I have a small goatee section of little hairs appearing daily on my chin plus strays on my neck and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have delicate old lady skin &amp; no problems!</li>
            <li> Mine came almost half a month later than expected.</li>
            <li> but the spring isn&#x27;t tight enough or something.  </li>
            <li> Yep, apparently this little tool works!</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get use to the method of turning the spring inwards along your face to remove your facial hair.</li>
            <li> It obviously stings a little</li>
            <li> Bye the way, I was just using this on these little baby hairs that aren&#x27;t visible until you get close up, and my upper lip.</li>
            <li> but that is the only place I breakout from using this little hair removal tool.  </li>
            <li> Where has this simple little gadget been all my life?</li>
            <li> It literally pulls all the hair (even the little tiny hair).</li>
            <li> it a little so that the springs actually close when you roll it.  </li>
            <li> The large size does NOT capture small hairs, nor does it work on a small part of the body.</li>
            <li> Is a little painful but works amazing</li>
            <li> This is the most painful thing ever.</li>
            <li> Complicating to use making it more harder and painful than tweezing or epulating on the face.</li>
            <li> In some ways I found it more painful that waxing</li>
            <li> I also find it more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> this thing was more painful than waxing and didn&#x27;t even pull out the hairs.</li>
            <li> ,,,,i am not not sure how to use it, instuctions was not in english and not clear..</li>
            <li> It is what I expected but my hair is too course and it won&#x27;t pull them out just tugs on them</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but that was expected.  </li>
            <li> Then all was quiet for a few minutes and she came out of the bathroom smiling.</li>
            <li> so it was expected.  </li>
            <li> Came faster then I expected but had no paperwork with it</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> Each of the pink ones that I bought had the handles break off.</li>
            <li> It works but the pink is ghastly.   </li>
            <li> I waited awhile but it was expected as it is from China.</li>
            <li> so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> i expected it to be easier to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable, expensive and I think worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but this time the spring was very loose and did not want to pull the hairs out.</li>
            <li> but seriously, it&#x27;s pink, for ladies, not bearded men.</li>
            <li> That means I don&#x27;t have to drag out the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m also a big wimpy baby that does not enjoy even tweezing hair.</li>
            <li> I raved about it so much that my sister is annoyed of me.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail the pink ends immediately fell off the ends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product arrived faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Only downfall, it misses a few hairs and requires a follow up with tweezers.</li>
            <li> It does take out hair but not as I expected</li>
            <li> So far, all well known brand facial waxing gave me terrible bumps and surprisingly, many got tear off my skin.</li>
            <li> I will say be careful not to overdo it because it can cause redness.</li>
            <li> the product is work the amount spent.</li>
            <li> But that was expected.  </li>
            <li> so not much of a loss.</li>
            <li> it was tossed into an envelope not wrapped in anything at all.. not very hygienic imo.</li>
            <li> and it caused some trouble to finally meet up with the mail carrier.</li>
            <li> Than I wanted a few extra to keep in my purse...since I did not plan to use them a lot, I went for the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> and it broke the pink parts</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t get it wet</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> and I was curious.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected with any sort of epilator.</li>
            <li> but I feel there is really no use.</li>
            <li> I can instill use it but the pink part doesn&#x27;t work anymore</li>
            <li> Not really planning on using on my legs</li>
            <li> out.&lt;br /&gt;good to use at night, using it will leave the skin pink</li>
            <li> it may not work completely on all of the coarser facial hair if you have any, so you will need to go behind it with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> I found I get little bumps on the side of my upper lips from ingrown hairs and running my sharp fingernail over it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to remove short, stiff hairs, like those women get after babies or age, you still need to tweeze.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird at first, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it takes a while to get all the hair in a small area--you have to go over the same area several times.</li>
            <li> Much less pain that tweezing, and was able to get all of the annoying fuzz around my mouth, above my lip, etc.</li>
            <li> One major negative:</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to get used to but it will definitely rip out all unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> had a few longer light hairs in my chin that were hard to find and a few dark, thin hairs in my upper lip.</li>
            <li> This is a simple tool to use with very little pain.</li>
            <li> Less painful and more thorough than plucking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit this thing hurts really bad the first time you use it, but if you use it every night it dosent hurt at all as long as you keep up with it, and don&#x27;t let all the hair grow back all at once.</li>
            <li> This received a 3 star because its not useable on other places of your body other than Face.</li>
            <li> No more tweezing upper lip hair for me!</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work the way you&#x27;re twisting it, then try twisting it the other way.</li>
            <li> Threading usually makes my face break out in tiny patchy, pimply areas.</li>
            <li> It will not work on other areas that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much due to price of the product.</li>
            <li> It extremely hurts when you use it.</li>
            <li> Is larger than i imagined and not really sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> I expected that, though!</li>
            <li> I am waiting for it to fall apart like other reviews</li>
            <li> I will recommend other.</li>
            <li> Saw this product or something similar used on &amp;#34;The Real&amp;#34; talk show this past summer</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry around in your purse.</li>
            <li> Depilatories burn, waxing is a messy nuisance, and tweezing takes too long to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to work or find any other use for it.</li>
            <li> Definitely works, but most definitely painful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a glamour tool, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the pink parts came out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would try to use this other than on my neck and face--the longer hairs would jam the tool.  </li>
            <li> I have not used other springs,</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t painless, but neither was the other item.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this will be the case for this facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> All instruction are in a foreign language.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I bought it because the ratings and it was cheaper than other places</li>
            <li> I still tweeze any missed hairs, but there are only a few!</li>
            <li> Works like a dream in a minute or two every other day...</li>
            <li> (bend into an upside down U, place against your skin, and roll the pink handles toward your skin)</li>
            <li> use: bend the pink nodules down to form an arch with the spring.</li>
            <li> the first time i tried to use it, it BROKE IN HALF!!!!!</li>
            <li> Actually, I have very few visible hairs (except those pesky one&#x27;s that flo brings with her) -</li>
            <li> I have a lot of inflammation with waxing, but very minimal with this product.</li>
            <li> The product practically came apart within one little tug to spring loose the hair.</li>
            <li> I usually pluck my upper lip with tweezers every once in a while (to get the really dark noticeable hairs).</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have with it, is I&#x27;m afraid I might be threading my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to remove the small hair since my facial hair is dark.</li>
            <li> It grabs those  little stiff hairs on my chin even when they are still very short.  </li>
            <li> The trick (as mentioned from other reviews) is to curve the spring into an upside down U shape, press it to your skin with the pink ends down and then roll the ends away from your face.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult to get use to using it at first, but I&#x27;ve got it down now.</li>
            <li> Within the next day I had all of these small hard bumps on my face along with red irritation.</li>
            <li> It still tweeze my brow bone and other smaller hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Around the upper lip it can be quite hard to pluck it still does</li>
            <li> It pulls a few thicker, coarser hairs but only after going over the desired area several times and very slowly.</li>
            <li> I examined it very carefully and it did not show any signs of being previously used.</li>
            <li> And when I opened the envelope, the spring is dark and rusty looking.</li>
            <li> waxing, sucks grows back in a week.</li>
            <li> This it not worth anything and could even hurt you when it breaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only painful at first</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother because she was always trying to pull dark hairs on her chin and lip.</li>
            <li> not useful or recommended</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work just breaks off random pieces of hair if that much</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it didn&#x27;t come with any directions on how to use it.  </li>
            <li> I threw it away, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Which sucks when you are short on time.</li>
            <li> but they came in the mail and the metal looked dark and rusty.</li>
            <li> Yes, of course it hurts a bit, but not nearly as messy or frustrating as wax and tweezers and stuff.  </li>
            <li> I even got the box for thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> , it hurts much less than other methods (it still hurts) and much less redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job, but it&#x27;s not very accurate.</li>
            <li> The directions are not very detailed, but they don&#x27;t need to be.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s black and thick and annoyingly obvious.</li>
            <li> , I worry about the unsightly hairs that are looking down at the patients that I am taking care of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m changing from 5 stars down to 3.</li>
            <li> I sit down once every couple weeks for 10 minutes and bing, bang, boom I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is getting the hair under the chin and down into the neck, the cheek area to the ear</li>
            <li> I could not maneuver this into the upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; so I could not get not even one hair out.  </li>
            <li> Just bend it down and roll up, keep trying that you will get it..</li>
            <li> The trick is curve the spring, twist the ends inwards and sweep up (if you go down, it won&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> hold the handles so they&#x27;re almost against your face, pointed down, then roll the spring upwards...</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no significant complaints.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical to order this tool, given the fact that this is only $3 or so and there are other similar tools between $10 and $16.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You slightly pull the spring apart and bring it down against your skin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So Jen, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice from my office down the hall that you seem to have a giant red angry mustache this morning.</li>
            <li> It really depends on the angles and curvatures of the face, as I did get some hairs removed in one area, while in other areas it just resulted in some uncomfortable pinching, but the hairs were left behind.</li>
            <li> It cost less than a pair of tweezers at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly gentler than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I may be half billy-goat.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s faster than plucking and waxing is unpredictable..</li>
            <li> it is also, in my opinion, less pain than using a tweezer.</li>
            <li> I think it rips half the hair but not all from the root.</li>
            <li> I got bored and wanted to look up asian beauty products and buy some cheapo stuff this actually turned out to be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But less than waxing.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to use it is to put it against your skin, stretch it slightly, and then roll up.</li>
            <li> Less than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> But I am not complaining considering I paid less than three bucks, shipping included for 3 springs.</li>
            <li> It hurts less as you get used to it.</li>
            <li> For less than 2 bucks I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Slightly...</li>
            <li> and i have course black hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way less than just getting your moustache waxed at the salon.  </li>
            <li> For me it took mainly a half hour to get it done.</li>
            <li> Less pain doing that.</li>
            <li> It did cause me a bad break out where I used it on my face, would recommend washing face right after and using a toner!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not good at it, so it took long and hurt for longer after (probably all due to the fact</li>
            <li> but I would not use this on my eyebrows since im scared I would make a mess of them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not nearly as good as Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far less painful than waxing (and far less expensive... and far faster..</li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to get used to how it works, but once I got it down</li>
            <li> I notice that using it every few days cuts down on the pain as opposed to using it once a week or so.  </li>
            <li> Yeah it hurts a little but the first time you get your eyebrows done its hurts like crazy</li>
            <li> It is also extremely painful and it makes me cry every single time at first, but after a few twists I suck it up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super painful but it gets the job done no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> However, it is super painful and you have to keep going over the area</li>
            <li> It removes hair quickly and not too painful and from the root.</li>
            <li> when im using it hurts a little bit in the zone i use it</li>
            <li> Shipping was little under a month</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little bit, but</li>
            <li> Takes all the little hairs off that waxing and plucking often miss.</li>
            <li> It took me a little practice to figure out how to work it</li>
            <li> This little device does what it claims, it does remove hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had little finger handles on the end</li>
            <li> so it was a little easier to use.</li>
            <li> It took almost 2 months for this little thing to arrive.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to the technique but it does remove the hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Never really took out the dark course hairs just the small unnoticable ones!</li>
            <li> This little thing helps</li>
            <li> It grabs the little hairs so well</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping said it would take a little over a month...</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little because it is pulling out the hair.</li>
            <li> takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> If their little it won&#x27;t pull them</li>
            <li> After a little trial and error, I found out how to make it work</li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit in the beginning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little time consuming</li>
            <li> takes a little practice and trial &amp; error.  </li>
            <li> All of the products I have tried like this do not get ALL of the little hairs.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit but lets face it, hair removal hurts.</li>
            <li> These little springs have eliminated the need for waxing....</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its hurts veryyy little.  </li>
            <li> You may want to apply a little cream in the area before you star to plug the hair out, cuz it hurts .</li>
            <li> when you have to remove those little hair on your chin</li>
            <li> It removes even the tiniest little hairs.</li>
            <li> after a little while it should be easier.  </li>
            <li> Due to the small price I don&#x27;t believe returns are allowed.</li>
            <li> But after using this tool.. I was quiet amazed to feel the hair on my face.. which is very hard to notice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful at first, but it works!</li>
            <li> I have a few little &amp;#34;beard</li>
            <li> you have to be careful for cleaning your tool before use your treading on your face.&lt;br /&gt;just cleaning is hard.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how hard it is getting the hair under the chin and neck area.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but no this item just doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy it waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try again a few times before I give up.</li>
            <li> Thought I would save a few bucks and buy this spring hair remover.</li>
            <li> Is it too much trouble to include instructions on how to use this product?</li>
            <li> Its been a few months now since I bought it</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t even waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> If the hair is thin or recently plucked/shaved the spring won&#x27;t latch on.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and buy some wax..</li>
            <li> you have the internet and can probably figure out youtube - which has a few how-to videos.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It took me a few minute to practice how to use it.</li>
            <li> was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I can deal with a few pimples.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times, and I&#x27;ll never pick it up again.</li>
            <li> I use it ever few days and it gets easier and faster every time.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of your money - please don&#x27;t buy.  </li>
            <li> I find a few hairs and use it while watching TV.  </li>
            <li> still have trouble getting the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> Seems like it quits holding on to the hair after you use it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Pulls out a few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten it to work a few times and will continue to try.  </li>
            <li> Did not work well at all, basically a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> I read on a few sites online that this might rust after a about 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to do the work</li>
            <li> I gave away a few to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> but messy...</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to order another R.E.M. Spring and instead of saving myself $10, I wasted $5.</li>
            <li> I know, I hate buying cheap stuff from China, too -</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works like charm for heavy hair spots.</li>
            <li> My R.E.M. isn&#x27;t dead or anything, but I figured, for this price, I may as well buy two in case</li>
            <li> For me, I am not a huge fan of pain.</li>
            <li> Some people said it&#x27;s hard to use and the instructions were in foreign language, but even without that you just have to play around with it just a few times then you&#x27;ll get a hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as previous ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little painful and tricky at first</li>
            <li> I have bought other threading tools before but this one sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like a stiff slinky that pulls out some of your hairs.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I burned my face really bad with hot wax.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> It stings a little, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the job it does.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly ..it does remove hair HOWEVER find this to be a painful device!</li>
            <li> It was painful at first</li>
            <li> but of course any hair removal will be painful at first</li>
            <li> It is painful the first time, but it does what it says it would do.</li>
            <li> Since it grabs all the hairs at once the first couple of times you use this product it&#x27;s going to be painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly painful at first.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find it painful at first ...</li>
            <li> I just threw them away since everything that could have gone wrong with this apparently did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m norwegian and apparently we&#x27;re a hairy type of people, so I used to have to get my upper lip waxed like every week, or pluck it which was painful and tedious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to figure out how to use it, but once you figure it out it works wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use and it HURTS bad, it&#x27;s in a box in my closet because I can&#x27;t bare to throw it away, I spent money on it</li>
            <li> and I accidentally ripped out some of his beard hair, so it can even get the little thick hairs too.</li>
            <li> A few days in I pulled way to hard</li>
            <li> This hurts really badly and i cant really tell if the hair is gone</li>
            <li> Personally, it&#x27;s painful and I just don&#x27;t have too much patience for it.</li>
            <li> really helpful, but painful.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of unwanted hair but a bit painful and can&#x27;t really get reach some hair on some parts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite painful to start, but once you get going it really does not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> This tool is a must for me, no more mustache.</li>
            <li> So far this has been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am not skilled at it)</li>
            <li> No! Hurts no more than waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> (Pixnor Portable Manual Facial Hair Remover Threading Epilator Stick Tool (Random Color) )  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Came in small bubble envelope and was intact.</li>
            <li> If you are not sure you can always go to YouTube or look on line</li>
            <li> if you can get past the pain then it works</li>
            <li> Once you get past it, this does remove your hairs.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five is because it starts to develop a weird smell after a while.</li>
            <li> Was not able to get it to remove any hair.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I will breakout under the chin which is a weird area</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I thought it was horrible and was tempted to send it back.  </li>
            <li> But it did not get the small hairs.</li>
            <li> No more lady mustaches.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking to replace one you&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> it took me about 4 minutes total to do my entire face, yes I even have to do my cheeks :(</li>
            <li> so I usually do it while watching TV.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how they will work in an year...</li>
            <li> works, but I think it&#x27;s made for extreamly small fingers.</li>
            <li> is a bit unconfortable, (&amp; I have small hands) but eventually gets you there</li>
            <li> Horrible Do not buy Cheap because it doesnt work well!</li>
            <li> It was in a small brown envelope package.</li>
            <li> but I expected worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a weird device</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I like it or not.</li>
            <li> and sometimes i &#x60;m lazy for cleaning that</li>
            <li> if you know how to use it, it remove even the very tiny thin hairs!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product and it does take a while to actually arrive.  </li>
            <li> And I am not a huge wuss when it comes to pain!</li>
            <li> My reason for rating it a 4  is due to my pain threshold (not as tough as I thought).</li>
            <li> had to sign for the package which was a little ridiculous given the small cost of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less pain when waxing!!</li>
            <li> up all of those annoying little hairs much faster than with a pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> I find it little hard for it to grab very small hair.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I strongly do not recommend it because you will feel the pain of each hair pulling out!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to pick up small ones.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I would pull out the brown and leave bare spots.</li>
            <li> This stupid thing broke the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> and I can tell its faintly gone but not completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It&#x27;s useless for getting that ONE gigantically long beard hair</li>
            <li> Hard to use and does not pluck all of the hair.</li>
            <li> it was really hard to thread with this.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am a little obsessed with this little tool and am planning on buying one for my mom.</li>
            <li> hard to understand how to work it</li>
            <li> It hardly grabs my hair.</li>
            <li> The spring is too hard and for me i prefer epicare or bellaball.</li>
            <li> Kinda of hard to get the hang of</li>
            <li> It is also hard to remove the shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard to use item..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t concentrate too hard on it.</li>
            <li> and theres various ways to numb your skin if youd like in order for you not to feel the pain, but ive never done that haha.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Order at least 2, or 5.  </li>
            <li> but it sucks</li>
            <li> also icky rash, or ingrown hairs - either way -</li>
            <li> , everywhere else just makes, you guessed it, icky rash.</li>
            <li> but I hope it&#x27;s at least helpful to even just one person.</li>
            <li> Sensitive areas are a problem....a ittle painful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re crazy about having no unwanted facial hair like me</li>
            <li> i had to numb my upper lip with ice before i could use it.</li>
            <li> I suggest trying it once at least.</li>
            <li> This is by far the EASIEST and least painful thing I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I came across this product by accident while reading a makeup blog--and it seemed that all the negative reviews pertained to not knowing how to use this--which when I received it, I hadn&#x27;t a clue either.</li>
            <li> and it has lasted me for at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> It sucks</li>
            <li> but I hate this product and have since thrown it away because it is cheap and useless.</li>
            <li> I use this product and I&#x27;ve notice my hair grows at a slower rate and doesn&#x27;t come as thick.  </li>
            <li> overtime it doesn&#x27;t because your hair doesn&#x27;t grow as thick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - get a R.E.M. as this is the worse product ever</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works for thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t buy this unless you want thick and darker hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li> so I have to go over with twizzer for thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;very thick hairs are not always pullled</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing (hate the residue and redness), creams (break out due to the chemicals), plucking, and traditional threading.</li>
            <li> waste of his time!!</li>
            <li> I mean, you are ripping hair from your face.</li>
            <li> I mean of course it&#x27;s going to hurt because it basically rips all the hair out in one tug.</li>
            <li> Other than that ill pass</li>
            <li> Dont waste ur time or money on this product!!</li>
            <li> It was brutal the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I mean, it hurts, but its not excruciating.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> it is getting all the dark annoying hairs as well of the white hairs.</li>
            <li> It does take off very small hairs.</li>
            <li> The youtube review that brought me to this product in the first place did say that it is very painful in the beginning but that the pain does lessen.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it, that after a while the tool loses its springiness.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I use it on my upper lip, waxing gave me big horrible pimples</li>
            <li> it is seriously a snap to use.</li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> very painful on the upper lip, as expected.  </li>
            <li> A little bit difficult to master the technique of hair removal with this tool.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to work</li>
            <li> I tried different methods and ways to use it, and it hurt SO bad.</li>
            <li> It grabs multiple hairs at once so it can be painful.</li>
            <li> Not good for face.</li>
            <li> Creams, they give me icky rash (not attractive).</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> Not good product it doesn&#x27;t work in an easygoing way</li>
            <li> Painful obviously.</li>
            <li> Not good, I couldn&#x27;t discover how I can use it</li>
            <li> It did pull out a few hairs but broke the majority off, so I ended up with weird face stubble.  </li>
            <li> Kinda painful for the upper lip  </li>
            <li> it removed ugly facial hair..</li>
            <li> I hope for other buyers&#x27; sake I&#x27;ve missed something, but I&#x27;m afraid this is just another scam.</li>
            <li> To all those complaining that it is painfully, duh!</li>
            <li> not near as painful as some people are saying.  </li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO USE.</li>
            <li> Even though it was under $3 it is very difficult to use and the instructions are in a foreign language.</li>
            <li> It was very confusing on how to use it.</li>
            <li> This had very slow shipping</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The Spring Facial Hair Remover was difficult and painful to use.  </li>
            <li> It was painful, but it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s painful and came with absolutely no instructions</li>
            <li> I hated using Nair and wax on my face since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get a lot worse BUMPS from waxing and threading.</li>
            <li> however, the ease of use is not great at all.</li>
            <li> Wax removal is much, much worse.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> not attractive.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2, one for me and one for my sister, thick facial hair runs in our family and I needed some kindof a miracle, tweezing one by one would take tp long, and i hated waxing for the fact that i have to wait till the hair cocompletely grows out again :(</li>
            <li> I went for cheaper and got worse.  </li>
            <li> The handle was broken off when I opened the package</li>
            <li> Maybe because my hair is too thin.</li>
            <li> and I was really tired of burning my face with \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; depilatories.</li>
            <li> I have been tweezing for years on a daily basis and hate it.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, pulling hair out from the root!</li>
            <li> Like all epilators it does yank out hair, which is painful, but for a dollar, how could I turn it down?</li>
            <li> It is less painful than threading .</li>
            <li> Waxing is faster and in my opinion less painful because it takes fewer swipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like tweezing so if you&#x27;re use to tweezing you&#x27;re use to the pain but in my opinion this one is less painful</li>
            <li> waxing is less painful.</li>
            <li> Just like waxing but, actually less painful.</li>
            <li> This does hurt, but is less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, it was a little painful.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful in the beginning</li>
            <li> little painful...</li>
            <li> a little painful for those that are not used to threading</li>
            <li> It is a little painful in the beginning</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive so, no great loss but, sad it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> the reason i gave it a 3 because it had a weird smell</li>
            <li> I will use it but not pleasant at all !!</li>
            <li> THE ITEM WAS USELESS AFTER THAT.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy the expensive version, so I got this one instead.</li>
            <li> To minimize pain, I twisted</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This thing breaks off random hairs, it doesn&#x27;t pull from the root.  </li>
            <li> i must be doing it wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect and it requires practice.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> you are using it wrong</li>
            <li> nastyyyyyy never again sorry</li>
            <li> but it will be a welcomed pain as you tear away those nasty facial hair!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product but as soon as I got it</li>
            <li> the packaging was not impressive...</li>
            <li> I saw the expensive version of this tool selling for $30.00 and if on sale, it was $15.00.  </li>
            <li> Also works well for the thin hairs between my eye brows!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this device did not work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> Its not pulling any hair,its useless.</li>
            <li> But, they&#x27;re so wrong.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> weird...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order the expensive one....</li>
            <li> ive googled it and watched youtube videos and its too complicated</li>
            <li> This tool is very painful and is incapable of grabbing the dark hairs that one would want to get rid of.</li>
            <li> A little painful, but not too bad!</li>
            <li> this sucker is painful!</li>
            <li> Doing the repeated twisting motion will numb your fingers and guarentee carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> This item is awkward to use.</li>
            <li> The coils looked dirty and rusted.</li>
            <li> Rusted and dirty when I got it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> This effing thing hurt like a sumbitch though!</li>
            <li> Well I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s legitimately useless!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already obsessed!</li>
            <li> Its cheaper than expensive tweezers and does TWICE the job!</li>
            <li> or I might have been mad .</li>
            <li> Piece of effing crap.</li>

            <li> It really isn&#x27;t painful either.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the REM spring and it is firmer and not as flimsy which is probably why that one isn&#x27;t as painful as this one.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This received a 3 star because its not useable on other places of your body other than Face. And u have to get used to knowing how to work it and i still feel peach fuzz on my lip.would like a different type of hair removal system.</li>
            <li> It works easily. But be careful, it hurts :)</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent idea, I just wish it worked better on the short stubble that is courser. But hey, what do you expect for only $1.29?  I may get it to work better after a while, but for now, it only pulls hair good that is fine and longer.  No instructions came with it at all, and if I hadn&#x27;t read many reviews, I would not have figured it out.  A nice reviewer gave good instructions on how to twirl the ends as you move the spring up toward the hairs.  For the money, it is a good investment to keep around in a pinch, say the car glove box or the purse, but I have broken down and ordered my first epilator to do the dirty work from now on-lol.</li>
            <li> This hair system removal tool works well. I prefer to use this rather than waxing. It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing!  It was difficult to use at first but after the 2nd/3rd use I was able to get the hang of it and removing facial hair is so easy now!  No more tweezing upper lip hair for me!</li>
            <li> Works great... Removes most of the facial hair.😊</li>
            <li> I always used to notice the hair on my forehead, cheek bones, etc...they were fine but still I would notice them and felt like others noticed too.  Saw this, read the reviews, thought to myself it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  Delivery was faster than what I was expecting.  The words on the package weren&#x27;t in English so I looked up videos on YouTube to figure out how to use it. It definitely hurts a bit the first few times.  Although visibly I don&#x27;t see as much hair, my face isn&#x27;t smooth.  It just feels like I had shaved my face and the regrowth is coming up.  Definitely something I am now self conscious about. If I were you, I&#x27;d stick to something that will for sure pull from the root/pore whatever.</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s the solution I&#x27;ve been waiting for. It takes some practice and playing with it get good at it but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few longer light hairs in my chin that were hard to find and a few dark, thin hairs in my upper lip. Not any more! Perfect solution. I use it every 2-3 days. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does pull your hairs out.  I have minor upper lip and chin hairs and you need to pull the spring apart and place on the hairs you wish gone and it does pull from the roots.  A bit stingy but If you are into a bit of pain, no problem.</li>
            <li> listen, this spring won&#x27;t remove all the hairs at once, it took patience and practice but it beats waxing and threading</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work, buyer be ware. This tool is very painful and is incapable of grabbing the dark hairs that one would want to get rid of. Overall, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> takes off all my chin hair and mustache works great good product worth the price you pay i would buy more</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest tool like this I have seen on amazon and it works really well.  It cost less than a pair of tweezers at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I had seen YouTube beauty gurus talk about these hair removing coils before but there was no way I was going to pay $10-15 for one. When I found this I ordered it immediately. It took 2-3 weeks to receive but it was definitely worth the wait! I hated using Nair and wax on my face since I have sensitive skin. Both products would always leave red marks wherever they were placed and it was especially noticeable when I would use them on my upper lip. This product quickly pulls the hair out and leaves the area nice and smooth. I have found that it hurts less if you use it after washing your face or taking a shower, when your pores are really open and the hair can be removed easily. The best part is this was only a couple bucks!</li>
            <li> At first, I was going to stop using it because it hurt so much. It removed hair though. But if you place some ice around the area you plan on getting rid of the hair, then you are good to go. There are no other complaints that I have about this product, only that I would have found about this product one or two years ago.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a few weeks. You bend it, put it up to the area you want to remove hair, and then twist. If it doesn&#x27;t work the way you&#x27;re twisting it, then try twisting it the other way. It works great for my womanly facial hair. The only complaint I have is that it takes a while to get all the hair in a small area--you have to go over the same area several times. It is also extremely painful and it makes me cry every single time at first, but after a few twists I suck it up and I can handle it. Beauty...</li>
            <li> The product is good, but my personal problem is when im using it hurts a little bit in the zone i use it</li>
            <li> It works, but it seems not to catch all of the hairs. You really have to spend a long time to make sure you go over all of the areas, and there may still be a few hairs you missed. I definitely do not regret buying this item, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product, for removing facial hair, worked great! It hurts a bit, but takes out a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my skin has not always reacted the best to hair removal methods. Threading usually makes my face break out in tiny patchy, pimply areas. Although at first this seemed to work with no adverse effects, after a day my skin began to get patchy and red. I have been moisturizing, but the dryness is persistent. I think this may just be me, though. I know a lot of people who have no issues with threading, etc.</li>
            <li> Does a better job than most creams and waxes, and does not subject the user to the unpleasant smell of  most depilatories.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail, it had little rust spots on the main wire part, but it works perfectly hurts really bad. But on the bright side, it works better than everything I have ever used, you will get used to the pain after a while.</li>
            <li> Does the job well. Can smart if twist too slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Quick movements are best</li>
            <li> It is what I expected but my hair is too course and it won&#x27;t pull them out just tugs on them ouch! Of your hair is soft it will probably work</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and is a fairly large product ( It is longer than my hand). It grabs multiple hairs at once so it can be painful. Nonetheless, it works to remove hairs to the roots.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used one look on youtube for a demonstration.  Not for those with a low pain threshold.  It&#x27;s plucking out a bunch of hair at once. My sister screamed yet i dont flinch.</li>
            <li> Awesome tool. My Mom liked it so much she ordered 10 of them for her co-workers.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It does the job</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very much handy. Getting two more of these.</li>
            <li> This thing works well.  It does take a few minutes to get used to how it works, but once I got it down it was easy.  It does hurt, but that was expected.  I only wish it took out more than a few hairs here and there.  It takes a long time just to do my upper lip even though I feel hair being pulled out with each twist.</li>
            <li> works well and is inexpensive</li>
            <li> Works like threading, great for removing the fine baby hair on my face.  Takes  a little practice but you can learn fast.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, one of the pink ends fell off. You have to pull on it a bit to clean it and it just popped off. I guess I could super glue it.  Seems like it works pretty well. Good for on the go when you don&#x27;t have time to stop in for a lip wax or do an at home wax. Also good for peach fuzz without having to wax. It is painful though.</li>
            <li> I have seen many of these tools at different prices but was skeptical about how well hair can be pulled out. It takes awhile to get use to they way you have to turn your wrists to get the hair to cling on. I bought an inexpensive product to see how well it works and it def does work. It takes time! But I will buy this again over the higher priced items.</li>
            <li> It works alright and it&#x27;s painful but it works.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is this does a great job I honestly use it at first it hurts but once one gets use to it, it stop hurting and I ham very happy</li>
            <li> I have used this product with great success.  It takes a little getting used to but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Watched a YouTube video to learn how to use it. It is painful. Tweezers hurt one by one. Magnify the pain intensity by fifty hairs and well there you go.I am still searching for that perfect painless product.</li>
            <li> I tried following what I seen on you tube but it did not work for me need to learn how to use it</li>
            <li> At first it hurts. Need to get used to it. But it works great! Already recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> For under a dollar as an alternative to plucking one by one, waxing, and shaving... This thing works! There is a technic you have to use though but it&#x27;s easy. It shows it on the picture so get it learn it use it NOW for all my hairy ladies lol.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is so easy to use and awesome because now i dont have to wax or bleach.</li>
            <li> This has saved me tons of $… Great for long travel, and if anticipate grooming needs. I will say, the side extensions are cheap, and the does not look shiny new, and silvery. Some of the metal almost looks rusted in some areas, but it did not damage my skin, or cause irritation. I get a lot worse BUMPS from waxing and threading. This is a product that should be treated as disposal after a while. Its dirt cheap so I think its worth the buy if your into new things, and can tolerate pain.</li>
            <li> for the most part works well...my skin was smooth, no blotchiness, but i did break out. not sure why but i currently have bumps on the area that i used the product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works but it does. It&#x27;s slightly gentler than tweezing. Maybe cuz I can&#x27;t quite expect when to feel the pinch. It&#x27;s not that great with the really tough unruly hairs that just don&#x27;t belong there, but it&#x27;s excellent for large spaces and weird curves and all those tiny hairs you&#x27;d never get any other way besides waxing or shaving. Ummm don&#x27;t do your eyebrows, cuz you can&#x27;t get a perfect edge, and you can catch your lashes. Yeah, I tried just to see what&#x27;d happen. Wasn&#x27;t fun. Feel free to laugh at my expense, I deserve it.</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;ve read any of the other reviews, you know there may be a bit of pain involved -- but no pain, no gain, right? Sure enough, I heard a few little yelps from the bathroom as my wife tried this out the first time. Then all was quiet for a few minutes and she came out of the bathroom smiling. Yep, apparently this little tool works! Not much to it, but simple in this case means effective. She&#x27;s used similar hair removers before so she knew what to expect even at first try; for others, a small instruction booklet would be desirable, but then there&#x27;s YouTube for that, I suppose.  What more to say? It&#x27;s cheap and works as designed.</li>
            <li> WOW!&lt;br /&gt;overall this was a great product... great price, easy to use. you gotta be strong when ou use this because it will hurt. and theres various ways to numb your skin if youd like in order for you not to feel the pain, but ive never done that haha.&lt;br /&gt;They hairs grow back the same, not thicker so dont worry. sometimes it is har to get all the hairs, but it gets a majority of the hairs</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do its job .</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed like the physical properties would enable it to work as described. And it does! Amazingly simple concept, perfect for peach fuzz. Much less pain that tweezing, and was able to get all of the annoying fuzz around my mouth, above my lip, etc. It&#x27;s larger than I expected it to be, and so can remove more at once if you need it to. You can hone in on a particular spot by bending it just so. It was a pleasant surprise, and worth waiting the week and a half.</li>
            <li> Had to look up online. Used it wrong at first haha. After learining the correct way, this tool is very good, and yes it does hurt, but I can get my upper lip done in about 2 mins or less, so not bad.</li>
            <li> I had it product before and I needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect. Of course it&#x27;s gonna hurt so that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s fault!!! lol&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I can see that over time it&#x27;s gonna get full with hair and you have to throw it away. But with this price I am sure that you can afford to replace it once in a while ;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t work at all, it throw it away</li>
            <li> I think that the item could have been made with higher quality. Like all epilators it does yank out hair, which is painful, but for a dollar, how could I turn it down? This is good for women who may be self conscious about facial hair.</li>
            <li> Threading tools are wonderful and work very well.  I did receive a variety of different sizes, but each one seems to work well.  I am learning how to use each one, and am very pleased with them.  I do wish I had found them years ago.  They are so easy and make unwanted hair a problem no more.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and does not pluck all of the hair. Do not buy it. It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So far so great! I was debating on getting something more expensive than this little fella here. Boy am I glad I got this though! You just have to know how to use it at first. There&#x27;s videos online, and the shipment came in 10 days earlier than it should&#x27;ve came in. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It just doesnt work, tried it maybe would but no this item just doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy it waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird at first, but it definitely works! You hold it bent like a &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; and the twist both handles in the same direction. There is a speed that works the best, and you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;ve found it when you feel hairs getting yanked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this and not have any skin irritation, where waxing always left my skin red for a day. It was embarrassing and I had to plan around it, because the red marks were even more noticeable than the hairs were! &amp;#34;So Jen, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice from my office down the hall that you seem to have a giant red angry mustache this morning. Is that a thing these days?&amp;#34; :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little time, but it&#x27;s definitely doable, and I have not found anything better for this price with this ease and lack of irritation. If you&#x27;re on the fence, try it out.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes worth of experimenting to figure out how to use it and a few times to get used to the stinging but it works!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. It pulls a few thicker, coarser hairs but only after going over the desired area several times and very slowly. Does not pick up finer strands of hair. In all, it does not do the job.</li>
            <li> its easy to use, cheap, and removes hair. It hurts just as much as tweezing/waxing. the reason i gave it a 3 because it had a weird smell and it completely broke after a week of use, but its cheap enough for me to buy more</li>
            <li> it was really hard to thread with this. I ended up just throwing it out because I was so frustrated with it.</li>
            <li> It good for removing face hair.  Shipping was little under a month but it was from China so it was expected.  But overall the product work great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me...waste of my time and money but just threw it in the trash..wasn&#x27;t worth even bothering to ship it back!! Even if shipping was FREE...I still didn&#x27;t make the ups man come get it...waste of his time!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how awful the thing was!</li>
            <li> The Spring Facial Hair Remover was difficult and painful to use.  I did not have good results with this type facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this tool.  It works better than tweezing or chemicals on my upper lip.  There was some &#x27;ouch&#x27; factor using it the first time, so I spread it out over a few days.  Now I use it daily for new growth, and occasionally use the tweezer for a stubborn hair.  This tool is a must for me, no more mustache.</li>
            <li> So far this has been a disappointment. It doesn&#x27;t seem to pull course facial hairs, even when I twist it.  I&#x27;ll probably try again a few times before I give up.</li>
            <li> This little spring facial hair remover tool actually works!  It&#x27;s really easy and fast, much faster than tweezers, and much less painful than waxing.  It does hurt a little bit, but like I mentioned, it&#x27;s way better than waxing</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. I am very disappointed. I thought it would actually work but I guess not.</li>
            <li> Unless you have long hairs, and I mean looooooonnnnnggg hairs, I don&#x27;t think you will benefit much from this product.</li>
            <li> I forgot to review this thing when I bought it. I still have it, 9 months later and I love it! It DOES HURT,you&#x27;re pulling out a lot of tiny hairs at once, so its not unexpected. Before I bought this I was threading my hairs, which worked ok but I&#x27;m not good at it, so it took long and hurt for longer after (probably all due to the fact I am not skilled at it) this product is super easy to use, you will spend less than a minute to get lip hairs (much less} I recently misplaced this product and in the drug store they have similar ones for MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE! I bought wax strips instead and used one, and while it was just as quick as this spring, it left my skin irritated and I got pimples from it. I&#x27;m really happy I located my springy thing, so I don&#x27;t have to do that again.</li>
            <li> Thought I would save a few bucks and buy this spring hair remover. Item took forever to arrive from China. And when I opened the envelope, the spring is dark and rusty looking. I rubbed my fingers over it and brown stuff came off. I dare not put this on my face. The item is very cheaply made and the spring looks like an industrial spring. I then decided to buy the Made in USA Bellabe and it arrived in just 2 days. When I compared the 2 springs, Bellabe is bright and shiny and new. Bellabe also comes in a reusuable tube that I can store my hair remover and is very convenient and handy. Bellabe is very effective. My skin is very sensitive but yet I did not break out from using it.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything from this product. After becoming pregnant and having my second child, my facial hair has gotta outta control! Wax breaks me out, tweezing takes forever and is almost impossible to do efficiently, hair removal creams break me out &amp; shaving is only good for a day. Yes, this thing does hurt. Is it unbearable? No! Hurts no more than waxing or tweezing. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Came faster then I expected but had no paperwork with it so Im stuck with something I have no idea how to use.</li>
            <li> waxing, sucks grows back in a week. Tweezing? tooo much work. Shaving? Hell no this is the only thing thats worked worth its price and should buy millions before they stop making them. i love this and its so quick</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out how to use it correctly, but it seems to work fairly well. I think if I watch some instructional videos I will like it even more.</li>
            <li> This thing works so much better than I expected considering how inexpensive it was. Takes all the little hairs off that waxing and plucking often miss. Already bought 5 more of these things to stock up! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This item needs to come with instructions in English. Chinese instructions do not help me.</li>
            <li> Does not catch the hair good</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly ..it does remove hair HOWEVER find this to be a painful device! I will use it but not pleasant at all !!</li>
            <li> Came on time and works pretty good but does hurt a little if your not use to plucking.</li>
            <li> PAINFUL! LOOOOOL. XD What was I thinking?!?! MY eyes water every time I use it...</li>
            <li> Spring was rusted and not upto the mark :( I will not recommend this one to my friends ... My old epicare tool is lot better</li>
            <li> The one I got was rusty and it was really hard to pick up hair even though I know I used it in the right way. Is in the garbage now</li>
            <li> This spring can be flimsy sometimes but it works. In my opinion, it only works well for the mustache area and for some areas on the face. It will not work on other areas that I have tried. Would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> This hair removal tool is amazing. Very inexpensive and really easy to use. I highly recommend it. I can use this while watching tv and it will distract me from feeling pain.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and super affordable. The delivery took a really long time, but I was willing to wait for it.</li>
            <li> Was delivered very quickly. Works as well as the  more pricey hair removers</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It was inexpensive and gets the job done. It wasn&#x27;t as painful as I imagined either.</li>
            <li> This was the second Spring Facial hair remover I purchased. I purchased from it from amjimshop. This was REALLY CHEAP. materials were like an actual Spring Facial hair remover. The product practically came apart within one little tug to spring loose the hair. I didn&#x27;t expect much due to price of the product. Regardless I purchased the same product for the same price and the other company was better. I would recommended people not to buy from (AMIJIMSHOP - TOOGOO.)&lt;br /&gt;I do however recommend the seller (Mini-Mart) the Spring Facial hair remover I received was excellent and was NOT a let down.</li>
            <li> Works well but, as videos online will show you, this sucker is painful! It was a little hard to get used to but it will definitely rip out all unwanted facial hair. Be careful when you first use it or you are in for a shock!</li>
            <li> Good for random chin hairs that spring out If you don&#x27;t using actual tweezers</li>
            <li> It works like a charm but you have to be careful not to over do it. You will love it.</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars I would! This is the most painful thing ever. I don&#x27;t know who would want to go through this pain it&#x27;s a joke. DONT BUY</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product and so far I am happy. It does sting, but the pain is so worth it. Been bleaching my face since I was in high school, and it&#x27;s good to finally find a product that won&#x27;t burn my face (like waxing does) or drain my bank account.</li>
            <li> Got this and looked up a YouTube vid tutorial (look for one that appears to be a commercial and not someone else &amp;#34;unpacking&amp;#34; it and playing with it that doesn&#x27;t know what to do).  I was successfully using it within 5 minutes of opening it and am impressed by how smooth my face feels after 5 days.  Yeah, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34;, but not nearly as bad as waxing or tweezing.  Waxing leaves me with a scrape-like mark that takes days to wear off while this springy-thing left no indication other than redness that was gone in under an hour.  I work in a hospital and after the years have creeped up on me, I worry about the unsightly hairs that are looking down at the patients that I am taking care of.  This is a great solution.  I bought 2--one for the house and one to keep in my truck.  Edit - These seem to break easily. Each of the pink ones that I bought had the handles break off. Besides that, they have been mistaken for sex toys by nosy people who were snooping in the bathroom cabinet. I have now bought a different one that has a differently shaped handle that is black.  (Pixnor Portable Manual Facial Hair Remover Threading Epilator Stick Tool (Random Color) )  I&#x27;m changing from 5 stars down to 3. It works but the pink is ghastly.   Cleaning it was super easy--I just bent it and blew on it--voila!  I have been recommending this to everybody so far and with such a cheap price--there&#x27;s no reason to not try it. It took 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a waste of money! It extremely hurts when you use it. I strongly do not recommend it because you will feel the pain of each hair pulling out!</li>
            <li> bought this to try it out.. its okay. i&#x27;m sure if i would buy a more expensive one (the ones that cost around $16-25), it&#x27;d be better. but this does the job... you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nice little gadget. Very helpful for removing cheek and chin fuzz. I do not use it for tiny mustache hairs, as I do not allow them to grow picking them out the moment they just start to appear above skin level. So, probably it will work for this type of hair, too. Cleaning is very easy- you bend it, and the stuff falls out easily, then I just wipe it with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to have this item The worst thing ever</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap quality, but for what it is that is irrelevant. The trick is to bend it. opening up the coil; then straighten, clamping on the hair. A pretty good tool, all in all.</li>
            <li> Best facial tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I had to watch a few youtube videos to figure out how it works, but this product is amazing. I&#x27;m norwegian and apparently we&#x27;re a hairy type of people, so I used to have to get my upper lip waxed like every week, or pluck it which was painful and tedious. This makes it so much easier and it takes less than five minutes to get rid of all your hair. It&#x27;s amazing. It hurts a bit at first, but once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll want to do it all the time. Highly recommend for hairy females.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much for how cheap it was, but it was rusted in numerous places. GROSS! And the size was oddly HUGE!</li>
            <li> I received the product about 3 weeks after ordering it. Came in small bubble envelope and was intact. There are no instructions but that&#x27;s ok I knew how to use it. If you are not sure you can always go to YouTube or look on line they have a similar product called Bellabe or Epicure for like $10-15! So value is very good and product is very similar to what the other sites offer but a heck of a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Why is it this is put in an envelope with no protective packaging and I had no clue what it was when it arrived.  Is it too much trouble to include instructions on how to use this product? Thrown in a drawer likely not to be used. I had to go throughout my orders to figure out what I even ordered.  Send instructions so I can do an accurate review of the product.</li>
            <li> I like using it, it&#x27;s convenient (much faster than plucking, less of a hassle than waxing) and really does pull out hairs!&lt;br /&gt;  It works best if you bend it a little less than shown in the photo there; Practice makes it a lot easier as you figure out what works for you. At first I was surprised at how small the hairs it could pull out were. It also works for the hairs that have grown out. I&#x27;ve had it for a while, too. Don&#x27;t forget to clean it and take care of the areas that you pluck :)</li>
            <li> Good product.  It&#x27;s like threading at home, once you get a flow it will be awesome ! But it kinda hurts, however no marks are left and the job is done ! I would recommend</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THE PRODUCT THE HANDLES BROKE OFF. THE ITEM WAS USELESS AFTER THAT. I WONT BE TRYING THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> works like it should...Hurts like hell but you have to take some pain for beauty lol really though the pain goes away the more often you use it.</li>
            <li> It works but hurts like he!! but what can I say beauty is pain for the price it can&#x27;t be beat and is easily portable and stops you from looking like SHEMAN...lol</li>
            <li> hurts like hell but it works and im happy bc it removes hair easy and quick. very convenient. would def buy again but this will prob last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I got this about a week before the estimated delivery date. It works really well to remove hair, I tryed it on my face and it kind of hurts but if you just do it really fast it&#x27;s not that bad. I like it better than waxing because it didn&#x27;t leave my skin super red where I removed the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this niceEshop Spring Facial Hair Remover. I am always trying to get those light, thin hairs that you can only really see out in the sunny weather. This is the perfect tool for that. It took me a little practice to figure out how to work it but once I did, out those hairs came. There is a little bit of a sting similar to plucking except you are taking multiple hairs out at once so it is more intense. I have to admit I am a little obsessed with this little tool and am planning on buying one for my mom. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get rid of unwanted hair with ease. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Love it! It hurts a bit but after a while you don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> Good Price but not for me.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little but worth it to get rid of facial hair without having to wax at home or spend a ton of $$ at a salon.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is purchasing this item was really worth it because I&#x27;m now in my 20s and all of a sudden these hairs started growing on my chin so i bought this tool. It&#x27;s super painful but it gets the job done no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I waited awhile but it was expected as it is from China. When I got the packet I automatically opened it and noticed that everything is in Chinese. The good thing is that it is a easy product to use, they do include pictures. This device works best on long or semi long hair not on short(stubble) Hair. I began to use it and it&#x27;s painful, it was known to be so as it is pulling hair from the hair follicle. if you are pulling from a area with a lot of hair , you do need patience and a high pain tolerance. Overall, it&#x27;s a great beuty device and it arrived before the estimated time. Also, the shipper kindly included a bracelet and a card.</li>
            <li> Just got this last week after waiting several weeks.  The lady hasn&#x27;t tried it yet... will get back to you</li>
            <li> This is not the best. Complicating to use making it more harder and painful than tweezing or epulating on the face.</li>
            <li> No instructions included in English.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to work well for me. Could have been my error but hurt more than it was worth to try to figure it out.</li>
            <li> if you can get past the pain then it works but I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use. I&#x27;ve barely touched it since purchasing because it doesn&#x27;t really work. Meh.</li>
            <li> Im kinda weirded out by this ordered because it was interesting. Is larger than i imagined and not really sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> Up front. No lie!  I&#x27;ve had facial hair issues since the age 15 and as a women this issues has always made me concerned about my appearance.  I do not burn myself from waxing, I do not pay $40 anymore for someone to rip my skin off and or do I have to sit in the salon for an hour while someone rolls threading string on my face.  I use this product and I&#x27;ve notice my hair grows at a slower rate and doesn&#x27;t come as thick.  Most of all, I do not have to use my tweezers, which I can&#x27;t seem to find because I&#x27;m forever misplacing ;P.  I hope this helps.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t remove hair from a very sensitive place with it, but it work. :) You&#x27;ll drop a couple of tears in the process.</li>
            <li> This pulls your hair out for sure&lt;br /&gt;And makes it faster&lt;br /&gt;Just watch you don&#x27;t  pinch your skin&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I thought it was a cheap buy and so bought it but it does not hold a single hair. By far, I guess Bellabe is the best that I have used but it was painful so I returned it. But please don&#x27;t buy this....Its not even worth spending a $</li>
            <li> I came to find this product because of an offer on groupon for a similar product called the q-stick. They were selling for $15. I decided to do my research, and ended up on Amazon. I found this tool, for a fraction of the price, with free shipping. With it being so cheap I decided to give it a try. I won&#x27;t lie, it was a little painful. I expected that, though! I mean, you are ripping hair from your face. I gave it a four star review, because my electric epilator came in the mail today. It is far more efficient and less painful. This, however, will be great for travel and touch ups.</li>
            <li> This was a great product, great price but OUCH. Something you have to get use to. But if youre looking to smooth your face it works great! Not so great on legs though.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars only instead of four or five stars despite it being very cheap because it is hard to use at first. You have to practice with it. Also you can only use it on areas of your body where you can use both hands to manipulate the tool. Another reason I did not give it full stars is that it can cause acne on your face. I clean it everytime I use it, but maybe sterilizing it with rubbing alcohol before and after every use is a good idea.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to this. Once you get past it, this does remove your hairs. I use it for upper lip hair only.</li>
            <li> No instruction for user. I tried using it and it does not remove a string of hair. If I can get a user manual, it will be appreciated.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and is not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works very well, (which means if you&#x27;re not use to it it&#x27;s going to HURT).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also breaks easy so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price but as a product I didn&#x27;t find nothing too special. Personally, it&#x27;s painful and I just don&#x27;t have too much patience for it. I rather wax.</li>
            <li> This product worked like it said it would. It was painful, but it&#x27;s expected. It pulls many hairs at once. It&#x27;s more painful in certain areas, but that&#x27;s really just because of your body. I give it 5 stars because it does what it said it would.</li>
            <li> Terrible-do not buy. It does not work. I tried it for my eyebrows and I was afraid I would pull out the brown and leave bare spots. Very cheap product.</li>
            <li> This really works! It takes awhile to get used to but once you have the hang of it, it&#x27;s so much fun! At first it hurts, but you get used to the pain. It&#x27;s like using an epilator. It hurts but overtime it doesn&#x27;t because your hair doesn&#x27;t grow as thick. I also love the affordable price. I bought 5 more for my family and friends. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The spring is really simple looking and very cheap (less than $1.00 + free shipping!). It takes a little while to get use to the method of turning the spring inwards along your face to remove your facial hair. It hurts but... no pain, no gain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so quick and easy to remove hair and it saves you soon much time! I am loving this product so I highly recommend this for anyone who is trying to get rid of their girl stash quick lol</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few months now. I use it every Friday night to clear out my upper lip. It works so far and works well. I am waiting for it to fall apart like other reviews pointed. I like it</li>
            <li> i expected it to be easier to use. while using it, and once i got the hang of it, it hurt.</li>
            <li> i dont really know how to use it so i guess i have to practice to get good at it.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how to work it (didn&#x27;t come with instructions) but after a few different methods I absolutely love it. I sit down once every couple weeks for 10 minutes and bing, bang, boom I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Whoever invented this torture device is a terrible person!! Simply awful!! I&#x27;ve had less pain when waxing!! Whoever said that you learn to tolerate the pain is a LIAR!!</li>
            <li> This is something a lot if women need. I personally wear mineral powder make up and the catches the peach fuzz that all women have. My main concern was my upper lip &amp; a little on my jaws (Great y&#x27;all probably think I had a beard before this thing). Anyways I recommend watching YouTube tutorials to understand how to use it, It&#x27;s really simple. I was concerned that it would really hurt but just like traditional plucking it hurts less as you keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product every women should own. Peach fuzz can be embarrassing especially when light hits u</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spring!!  It&#x27;s painful and stupid. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I dont tweeze so I cant say if this hurts anymore than tweezing, to me it feels almost exactly like the threads they use at the Salon I go to. Id reccomend moisturizing the area prior to threading, but not immediately. The softer hair didnt seem to take as well to the threader. Just as well I wont reccomend doing it on completely dry skin either. Over all I like the product, which is a great alternative to chemical waxes and stinky hair removal products.</li>
            <li> It is as described by the seller. but this method is VERY painful and pulls out most hair but not all, it is really unconfortable to use on your upper lip, it does not work. Its a bit tricky to get the hang of it. It hurts so much and it hardly removed hair from my stomach since i am very hairy, it only cut the hair in half. i suggest you go with another waxing method.</li>
            <li> This item did not work. I used it several times with myself and another person and not one hair was removed. Cheap item you will waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> at first it&#x27;s a little strange because you are plucking the hairs all together. it is a little painful but the more you do it, the more you get used to it. i used it a lot in the beginning but i got over it really fast because i had to use it too often and i would rather wax than bare the pain of it. it&#x27;s good for upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> there are no instructions in english.  have no idea how to use it.  i would never have purchased it if i had know everything was written in  chinese</li>
            <li> This little device does what it claims, it does remove hair.  My reason for rating it a 4  is due to my pain threshold (not as tough as I thought). I will continue to use this product however as it truly does the job.</li>
            <li> Removes facial hair wonderfully.  Very easy to use.  I wish I would have discovered it years ago!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only use this if you have aCouple hairs. This hurts bad and is not painless what so ever! This hurts</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy the expensive version, so I got this one instead. Its been a few months now since I bought it and it still really grabs the hair.</li>
            <li> I used it once when i brought it and never used it again cause its hurts really bad, only got it for .64 so its whatever but it takes really long.</li>
            <li> This is so cheap, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy this. I was so surprised that it actually worked! All my little upper lip hairs were completely gone in a matter of seconds, and with only a little bit of pain! There are videos on how to use it, and it&#x27;s simple/intuitive enough. You bend it so the springs have space in them, then unbend/ roll and it just pulls out all your fine hairs! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars is because I feel like it doesn&#x27;t pull cleanly from the root sometimes (rips from the surface, doesn&#x27;t get that deep dark root of the hair so it grows back a stubble). Also, even tho I followed up after with a toner/astringent, it broke me out in my upper lip area since all the pores were exposed! I have sensitive skin so it may just be me, so I would definitely recommend others to clean, sanitize before and after using!</li>
            <li> This tool is shorter than what I had before, so it needs little more work while removing the facial hair.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK ITS A TOTAL RIP OFF BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR WOULD NOT WASTE MY MONEY ON ANOTHER PRODUCT LIKE THIS</li>
            <li> hair removal..... i was expecting for it to work better, but to no avail. I should&#x27;ve bought the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I guess it requires more finesse than I have because I wasn&#x27;t really able to work it very well. Maybe there&#x27;s a tutorial on the web or something...</li>
            <li> It works okay but for me I have to do it almost daily. It does not pick up all of my hairs at one time....so for some hairs I have to tweeze.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and efficiently! Just takes some getting used to at first.</li>
            <li> Couldnt get it to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and you can remove facial hair anywhere and anytime! So convenient - I just wish I knew of it sooner.</li>
            <li> Im no too butt hurt over this product. I only paid a buck for it so its not like I am out too much. But don&#x27;t even waste your time. It doesnt remove much hair at all and you have to keep using it in the same spot over and over again. Now, for some people this won&#x27;t be a problem. For me, I am not a huge fan of pain. I mean, if you like the feeling of tiny hairs being plucked from your face one at a time by hot irons, by all means, enjoy. This effing thing hurt like a sumbitch though! And I am not a huge wuss when it comes to pain!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to use this tool, but I figured it out on the first use. There is a technique you should use, and yes it definitely hurts the first time you use it. But the pain lessens over time and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as waxing or threading. It definitely pulls out a lot of hair. You have to learn to maneuver it effectively. I recommend having a pair of tweezers handy for any stubborn hairs. Oh yeah, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red and irritated. There was barely any blotchiness at all, and then it went away really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Be gone mustache!</li>
            <li> Kind of like a hand held personal epilady. Same idea, but easier to travel with. For the price you definitely can&#x27;t beat it...it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> ordered this product over a month ago and its still not here…i would love to write a rivew on the product its self but its kinda impossible.</li>
            <li> It was really good im just paralyzed that i might have baby hair</li>
            <li> I usually thread my upper lip and that was working fine, but when I heard about this tool I just had to try it so I came right to Amazon and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a WONDERFUL TOOL. It&#x27;s easy to use and if you have previously removed hair before, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other reviews on here make it seem. It obviously stings a little but that&#x27;s normal when removing hair. I think this tool is a must have for those times when you&#x27;re in a hurry and just need to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five is because it starts to develop a weird smell after a while. I&#x27;ve done a lot of things to remove the smell and I can tell its faintly gone but not completely. I think that&#x27;s normal as well, though, with the spring and all. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me so much though to the point where I have to throw the tool away, so it&#x27;s not that big a deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this purchase was great! I&#x27;m thankful I tried it because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back! :)</li>
            <li> never have i been so happy with a product like this. 😄❤️</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work ask well as I thought it would. I think for a buck hair remover that&#x27;s understandable but it would&#x27;ve been nice if the spring plucked out all of my facial hair and not just a few.</li>
            <li> the price was great. however, the ease of use is not great at all. the spring does not allow for maximum epilation. I purchased two of them because they looked practical. however, i have not had much success with them. i would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is a simple tool to use with very little pain. I wish it had little finger handles on the end so it was a little easier to use. But can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This came straight from china and took about a month, but I saved nearly $25 compared to tweezerman and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed at how much hair comes out without the lasting pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time.  it hurts, but its no different than threading.  its the most inexpensive thing ive ever purchases and kept.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome i do not even wax anymore i rather use this because it takes out every single hair even if its super short it will pull it out and doesnt burn me like waxing does</li>
            <li> Good product.  It&#x27;s durable, expensive and I think worth the money.  It&#x27;s not pain-free, but what beauty is?  I like it.</li>
            <li> Works really good on upper lips.I got this yesterday only and tried. Good product. Quality wise too.I will recommend other.</li>
            <li> I think it works, I am not sure if I am doing it right though because the instructions are not in English but I think I will go on youtube to find out if I am doing it right.</li>
            <li> This arrived a month after it was estimated to arrive. It took almost 2 months for this little thing to arrive. Also, I feel it...but I rarely see it. I can feel it pulling and tugging out hairs (If you are sensitive to pain it will probably hurt you a lot)...but I feel like that&#x27;s it. When I look back at the area after sooo much rolling and twisting there is still hair. I haven&#x27;t used it in a while..for me it is just pain and no progress. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right..the directions on the box weren&#x27;t in English..hehe. But I&#x27;m pretty sure I am not that far off. So I rate it a 3 stars...it&#x27;s alright. Just know how to use it, know your tolerance for pain, and don&#x27;t expect it too fast. (From my experience) This is my first one of these types of things..so I have nothing to compare it too. I will say sugaring is much easier for me..but it takes more time and can get messy. Bye the way, I was just using this on these little baby hairs that aren&#x27;t visible until you get close up, and my upper lip. (The upper lip HURTS..but I kept doing it lol) This product isn&#x27;t working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I am still really iffy on this product. My face has a very fine layer of blonde hair and I used to get waxed but currently don&#x27;t have the money to do so. I heard some good things about this so I decided to try it. It  definitely does work as it yanked the hairs out cleanly. However, it is super painful and you have to keep going over the area so I had to take a break every so many times. The youtube review that brought me to this product in the first place did say that it is very painful in the beginning but that the pain does lessen. I am definitely hoping it does although I will continue to use it either way. It does work though so as long as you can handle some pain (I have a low threshold for pain) try it.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Also it is easy to clean and store. You could take this product with you anywhere</li>
            <li> Trashed it. Too painful for me</li>
            <li> I always thought I only have hair on my upper lip... But after using this tool.. I was quiet amazed to feel the hair on my face.. which is very hard to notice. Although u most defenitely get what you pay for! It does an OKAY job... not an excellent one! This was my experiment so I didn&#x27;t wish to pay too much for and I must say I&#x27;m not disappointed... but just wish it was a little better.. Make sure your face is makeup/oil free... to get the all unintended hair off your face...The chinese instructions doesn&#x27;t do any help ! But follow the pictures or you tube videos. I will hang on to it.. and try it again!</li>
            <li> It works very well and does the job, but not without a little pain.  To minimize pain, I twisted both ends quickly.  It removes the tiniest hairs below your lower lip and chin which are not as painful.  I couldn&#x27;t even achieve this with waxing.  Surprisingly good product for under $1.</li>
            <li> There is a reason this thing is so cheap guys, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything. I guess with a bunch of people like me who decide to lose the dollar, it adds up.</li>
            <li> Saw this product or something similar used on &amp;#34;The Real&amp;#34; talk show this past summer so decided to try it.  This product works, but there is a trick to getting it to work and it is some kind of painful.  In some ways I found it more painful that waxing and that&#x27;s saying something....</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was less than a buck, but I really didn&#x27;t know it would work.  Received it, tried it, and was happy.  Easy to use and you don&#x27;t see any new growth until 2-3 weeks.  The only bad thing about it, that after a while the tool loses its springiness.</li>
            <li> Such a simple little tool that does the job.  Many reviews indicated this hair removal system caused pain but not for me.  Wax removal is much, much worse.  Once I figured out how to use it I was very pleased.  Will be buying more for gifts to my family and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - get a R.E.M. as this is the worse product ever (I guess you get what you pay for).  It arrived rusted or discolored and with some type of gunk on the spring, not even close to the picture on the website.  It pulls ZERO hairs.  Both springs are trash worthy from the start.  They also come from Hong Kong so it took quite a bit longer to arrive than a regular Amazon order.</li>
            <li> this product really pain on your face. But it does really remove your facial hairs. And you can see it in the springs. It&#x27;s kinda gross but really cool to look at.</li>
            <li> This spring was reasonably priced, came exactly as described, and is a good alternative to chemicals for facial hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use. (bend into an upside down U, place against your skin, and roll the pink handles toward your skin) It hurts like the dickens, especially at first. It is more for broad areas than specific hairs. I&#x27;m still going through with my tweezers afterward to get some single hairs here and there that are still left. But it&#x27;s so much better than practically chemically burning my skin off and still having upper lip hair. Also, I&#x27;m super sensitive to waxing and always break out afterwards. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with red skin or breaking out after using this spring. I just have to get up the courage to do it periodically because man it hurts!</li>
            <li> this is awesome! it leaves my lip silky smooth. i&#x27;m very satisfied with this and i bought one for my friend too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to figure out how to use it, but once you figure it out it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk. Yeah it&#x27;s cheap but it&#x27;s cheap for a reason. It doesn&#x27;t work! Just pay the extra money for a better product!</li>
            <li> I have bought one of these before a couple of years ago and it was great but this time the spring was very loose and did not want to pull the hairs out. I don&#x27;t know what happened</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool to have! I have a few little &amp;#34;beard hair&amp;#34; lol that bother me and I&#x27;ve been using it on my face. I got it through a promotion and was a great deal, so I am sharing my personal opinion. Great product for the value. Small enough to carry around in your purse.</li>
            <li> It worked well. However, I gave it to my mom because I&#x27;d much rather wax than use it. Does what it was supposed to though, so cant complain.</li>
            <li> painfull until you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Was not able to get it to remove any hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to it so it&#x27;s getting better by every use .I have never seen an item like this so I had to try.</li>
            <li> It does remove hair but not all hair. After using it on my mustache area I have to always go back and remove any left over hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s great!  It didn&#x27;t come with any directions but a quick look online shows you how to use it.  I also pull the ends apart and then let it catch all those tiny lip hairs &amp; then roll it up.  This was cheaper than others but I can&#x27;t imagine that they would be any better.</li>
            <li> Really floppy spring doesn&#x27;t roll in handle at all...</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage. All it is, is a piece of coil that doesn&#x27;t do anything. Never believe what you read!!!</li>
            <li> Why have I not heard of this before? This thing is amazing. I don&#x27;t have to worry about having embarrassing facial hair or waxing. Once you get used to using this tool, it is so easy and quick and you can do it whenever you want. It still tweeze my brow bone and other smaller hard to reach places. This is great for all over your face. Love</li>
            <li> I have yet to receive this item it was purchased so long ago. What&#x27;s the hold up I would like to know</li>
            <li> This little thing might be cheap, but it has worked great for me! It is easy to use, and for me, painless too! It grabs hairs pretty well, but you just have to take your time! Also, if the regular way to use it isn&#x27;t grabbing hairs, try moving it around on your face other ways, that&#x27;s what I do and it pulls out hairs easily! I love this thing!</li>
            <li> it works i&#x27;m so in love, the only downside is how do you properly get those hard angles done if your wrist won&#x27;t bend that way</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be just as good as the other tool I bought {different brand}  Well I was wrong!  It doesn&#x27;t even remove and grab any hairs at all.  In this case it is: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!&amp;#34;  92 cents and free shipping.  I guess I am lucky in one aspect, I know better next time.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This is very useful and handy if you know how to use it. It is less painful than threading . thats what my Wife says</li>
            <li> Arrived early, works great.&lt;br /&gt;This is much cleaner and faster than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 just to be safe but they seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Better than expected for the price. Does a pretty thorough job. Not quite like threading, but hood for those in between times.</li>
            <li> Good product and service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work...not tight or strong enough to actually pull small finer hairs out and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What do you have to do to remove facial hair with this thing? Have a long mustache and beard? Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two years now, so far it&#x27;s the best thing I have found. My biggest problem is getting the hair under the chin and down into the neck, the cheek area to the ear part is very easy and front of chin is also easy.  There is pain but definitely gets better with every use.  Occasionally I will breakout under the chin which is a weird area but that is the only place I breakout from using this little hair removal tool.  I use this once or twice a week. Learning how to use it is very easy, after a few minutes you will have it figured out. My only complaint is how hard it is getting the hair under the chin and neck area. I am still looking for something better but will use this very inexpensive tool until I find something better.  Be very careful around eyebrows, just go nowhere near that area, if you need to pluck eyebrows use tweezers. I purchased mine from a lady in California through eBay, price was the same and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to the technique but it does remove the hair. To all those complaining that it is painfully, duh! You are pulling out hair!</li>
            <li> I guess it works, but takes too long to use to get all the hair. It took a whole month to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Has anyone find this helpful? I got it for my aunt for her facial hair. I tried it on my arm but it didn&#x27;t work at all . I didn&#x27;t see any hair being pulled off.</li>
            <li> Loved the tool.....it is cheap and the usage is painless and effortless for the upperlip,chin, and for overall facial hair. Recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> With this price you can&#x27;t expect more but one you should keep in mind that you should know how to use it in proper way because it doesn&#x27;t have any manual and whatever it&#x27;s written that in Chinese,one who don&#x27;t know chinese they should search it on YouTube for its use.</li>
            <li> Its very painful to use this product as per my wife. Not good for face. Just bought to check what it is and I will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This thing breaks off random hairs, it doesn&#x27;t pull from the root.  You&#x27;ll end up with a face full of itchy red bumps and stubble.  I got several since they were cheap.  I&#x27;m trying to figure how to use them in a craft project since they&#x27;ll never touch my face again.</li>
            <li> I contacted them when my first one did not come in the mail and I was helped 100%. They were very polite and I am very satisfied with is product! I would buy again, and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t any more painful than plucking and it really does remove hair. It even arrived earlier than expected. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works for thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not work on fine or short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Ends came off first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;Not for precise use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around for this after a friend said to get one and was very happy to get such a good deal. I have to say, you get exactly what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to use it the two pink ends came right off. They are not glued on or secured in any way. They pop back on but it makes using the product very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;As I started using it I noticed it doesn&#x27;t work on most of the hair I try to remove. If the hair is thin or recently plucked/shaved the spring won&#x27;t latch on. The only hair I could get it to pull out was leg hair that had grown out for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;I did not get the product for this, but you should note that you should not get this if you are expecting to to fine plucking of eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Painful. Does the exact same thing as a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately the 2nd one I ordered was seized by a girlfrind and we cannot stop using them!&lt;br /&gt;I am ABSOLUTELY going to have to order more.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw these at the NW Women&#x27;s Show years ago and a local store they were more.&lt;br /&gt;Granted these are very inexpensively made, but they are a terrific tool.&lt;br /&gt;Do not order 1.  Order at least 2, or 5.  Your friends and relatives will steal them from you, you WILL need back ups.</li>
            <li> Hair remover does just that...removes hair.  It works great. Can be a bit painful to pull out hair, but who said beauty is easy!?!?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Easy, cheap, effective. The trifecta of beauty products! I strongly recommend for people with facial hair. My mom has a bit of a mustache and I got this for her as a gift, she was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s ease of use and effectiveness. (You can&#x27;t beat the price-point either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used to wax her mustache monthly, now she uses this and she only waxes rarely to get the stubborn hairs. Success!</li>
            <li> I really like this, I use it on my upper lip and it may hurt a bit but its worth it!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would be able to use this item properly or with success.  However I watched several  you tube videos and it was easy to use I did not think it was painful and  had great success and love this product and the price under $1&#x27;00 The only minus was it took over a month to receive but we&#x27;ll worth the wait. Kudos for this one</li>
            <li> After waiting about 2 months to get this item, I was sorely disappointed and through it out. I&#x27;m aging and getting a little fuzz on my face, visible if the sun hits my cheek the right way. I tried this thing every which way and I didn&#x27;t notice it pulling out much hair. Maybe you need really long hairs but seriously, it&#x27;s pink, for ladies, not bearded men. A couple times I accidentally went too far and it snagged a few strands out of my scalp. After throwing it out, I bought one of those mini-shavers for ear hair and stuff. Yes, this means I&#x27;m using a shaver for my face but that cute pink thing simply doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time I ordered six of these all together I gave my daughter some and I kept the rest and they work really well I was thinking about not ordering them because I thought it was a joke but there not they really do work I will buy more as needed</li>
            <li> Hurts like a bitch at first, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Who would make this?&lt;br /&gt;Why did I buy this?&lt;br /&gt;I am so full of pain and regret. Save yourself the trouble and buy some wax..</li>
            <li> This thing is just too strange. i have no idea how it works. i must be doing it wrong but it sucks</li>
            <li> The Threading tool worked okay. I&#x27;m guessing that the more I use it the more facial hair will be removed.&lt;br /&gt; My concern is where it was shipped from...Hong Kong, China.  THE SHIPPING LABEL HAD MY HOME PHONE PRINTED ON IT and I can&#x27;t help but worry about security concerns either by my phone number, or other information, like my credit card information is safe considering it is coming from a out-of-country company.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON hopefully screens who they do business with;Yeah, I&#x27;m sure they do (HA-HA)!  I would spend a little more money and make sure your are ordering from a USA company.&lt;br /&gt; But, I&#x27;m sure that these threading tools are all made in China.  Such is the world today.</li>
            <li> Painful and took almost 2 months to get to me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it. It was painful at first but you get used to it eventually. It only grabs some hair at a time so if you have the patience and time but it but I give up halfway and my face looks patchy</li>
            <li> hard to understand how to work it and when i would get it to work the pain is bearable but it still hurt!</li>
            <li> This thing is the best hair removal tool I&#x27;ve found. Seriously. The Best. Creams, they give me icky rash (not attractive). Waxing? also icky rash, or ingrown hairs - either way - not attractive. Threading? Great for eyebrows, everywhere else just makes, you guessed it, icky rash. Be warned, when using this you&#x27;ll discover you had hairs where you didn&#x27;t think any were growing. I may be half billy-goat. Actually, I have very few visible hairs (except those pesky one&#x27;s that flo brings with her) - but I&#x27;ve always been a little wigged out by the downy fuzz that you can see in bright daylight (or in that damn magnifying mirror that I just had to have). This tool is pretty awesome because it works and you can use it while watching TV. No need to stare at your face for an hour while removing hair. It does take some practice to make it work, and DOES NOT come with instructions. But, I imagine if you&#x27;re reading this you have the internet and can probably figure out youtube - which has a few how-to videos.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It takes a little getting used to. But when you do it often it gets easier. And it is painful it is like threading with thread.</li>
            <li> This had very slow shipping and when I finally got the product it hurts to use! You might as well wax.  Waxing is faster and in my opinion less painful because it takes fewer swipes. You can&#x27;t drag this across your face, you have to constantly stop and pull it away to pull out the hairs. If you&#x27;re like me with fine hair, forget it. It hardly grabs my hair. I&#x27;ll feel it pulling the hairs and when I look at the spring, there&#x27;s nothing there. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this product did not take long to come. but it is painful to remove hair. the thicker the hair the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> I need good hair removal products, unfortunately.  When I first bought this, I thought it was horrible and was tempted to send it back.  Because it was so inexpensive (under $1.25, which included shipping), I decided to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on YouTube and found out how to do it.  It&#x27;s not perfect and it requires practice.  However, it is great for &#x27;between times&#x27; (I use a Braun epilator normally).  It will not remove hairs everywhere--the angle has to be right.  It *will* remove upper lip and chin hairs, but again--not all of them.  And it does hurt some people (my face is kind of numb after all these years!).  One thing I really like is that it does NOT leave a red mark or red face, unlike tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ME, it is great.  That means I don&#x27;t have to drag out the Braun.  Hair removers like Nair and all the rest don&#x27;t even touch my hair, so that leaves tweezing (which I do--and I recommend the Revlon Lighted slant tweezers, but that&#x27;s for another review!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hoping to do your arms, legs, and major areas of the body, this probably won&#x27;t be what you want.  If you have facial hair on which you use other appliances, then this should work for the times when you can&#x27;t use the normal method.  I find that it works better on coarser hair, by the way.  And you may need to go over and over the same area, pulling the hair out a little more each time.  By the way, the hairs it doesn&#x27;t get are easier to pluck because they are pulled out a bit more than they normally would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spring does get looser after a ton of use (it does still work, but not quite as well), so I ordered five of these @ $1.20 or some such price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it FOUR stars for what it does.  It is *NOT* perfect, but for a cheap plastic tool it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teenager and I HAD embarassing facial hair.. And this thing is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G ! It gets all the hair out and it easy very easy to use. Also you can take it anywhere it is very slim and lightweight. I have to admit this thing hurts really bad the first time you use it, but if you use it every night it dosent hurt at all as long as you keep up with it, and don&#x27;t let all the hair grow back all at once. I mean of course it&#x27;s going to hurt because it basically rips all the hair out in one tug. But it&#x27;s faster than plucking and waxing is unpredictable.. I don&#x27;t brake out either. It is a little red after I use it but goes away very soon. I feel SO much more confident now when I&#x27;m close to people, because I have nothing to be afraid about. I love this product and plan on getting it again if it brakes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I have been using it for 4 days now and it is practically painless now. :)</li>
            <li> This little tool was so effective that I bought two more and gave one to my sister.  It does the job with no tweezers, razors or&lt;br /&gt;hair-removal cream. Just roll it across your skin.  It stings a little, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the job it does. The same item sells for various prices from less than a dollar to more than ten, but I believe they are all the same.  Where has this simple little gadget been all my life?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be worried by those reviews saying it doesn&#x27;t work. They just haven&#x27;t figured it out yet. Find yourself some youtube videos on proper usage, and this thing is a gem of a steal for upper lip, chin, face, etc.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I hear from this tool before saw it being used on YouTube and bought owwww must as say it really pools the hair from the root pretty impress....</li>
            <li> it literally pulls the hair from your face. Doing the repeated twisting motion will numb your fingers and guarentee carpal tunnel. Not only that this caused more unsightly ingrown hairs. i have one back up in case of extreme emergency. Other than that ill pass</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my facial hair as an alternative to depilatory creams. The threading beauty tool does not work as well as the creams and it hurts more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take all facial hair.</li>
            <li> Good for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> It hurts more than it takes out hairs. Never really took out the dark course hairs just the small unnoticable ones!</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting those stubborn hard to reach hairs in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much hair is being pulled out. I noticed it slightly pinches the skin which may feel like its pulling hair (similar to the feeling of threading) so I don&#x27;t see a big difference after using this. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age, I have reached that point in life where the peach fuzz on my face rivals that of a teenage boy about to sprout a beard. While a teenaged boy would be pleased and excited about entering this state, I am not. Numerous methods have been tried to rid me of this plague--depilatories, waxing, tweezing--none have had the desired result. Depilatories burn, waxing is a messy nuisance, and tweezing takes too long to remove the hair.  This nifty little tool, though it does hurt a bit, is far more effective than using a pair of tweezers to remove hair, is neat, cleans up well. It does take a bit of learning how to manipulate it effectively, and like tweezing and waxing, there is some discomfort involved. However, now my face is as smooth and a baby&#x27;s bum, and I am pleased with the results of this simple little gizmo.</li>
            <li> worked great for the first 2 minutes.. then it broke :(</li>
            <li> This is my second one because I lost the first one. Yeah it hurts at first but you get used to it. This little thing helps</li>
            <li> There are no instructions included with the spring hair remover.  Following the video I&#x27;d previously seen online did not help either.  I hope for other buyers&#x27; sake I&#x27;ve missed something, but I&#x27;m afraid this is just another scam.</li>
            <li> Its exactly how you thought it would be. It did its job but of course any hair removal will be painful at first but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have thicker hairs that grow on my chin and neck area (the infamous &amp;#34;beard hairs&amp;#34;) and I found that this didn&#x27;t get them very well.  They would sometimes help them up, making them easier to pluck, but didn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;sweep them away&amp;#34; as I had hoped.  I believe this would be great for getting rid of the mustache area and other thin hairs.  But for what I wanted it for (thicker hairs), it didn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> Dosent work well as the bellaball or epicare. The spring is too hard and for me i prefer epicare or bellaball. U get what you pay for i guess. Idk might work for you. Oh and it also took long to get to me house.</li>
            <li> You just have to know how to use this item. It&#x27;s very effective. It was larger than expected, but it worked great. Not to mention with the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?  Hurts like the dickens, but works great &amp; is extremely inexpensive.  My teenager uses is for her upper lip as well and has no problems.  I have a lot of inflammation with waxing, but very minimal with this product.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how people use this.. I tried, but to no avail. It didn&#x27;t successfully remove ANY hair.</li>
            <li> Works too well. Will hurt! I am told that you get used to it but I have been using it for weeks and I&#x27;m still beating the table with my fist after executing hair removal!&lt;br /&gt;Here is how you use it btw:&lt;br /&gt;You slightly pull the spring apart and bring it down against your skin. You should have several hairs in between the spring. Then roll it against your skin in the opposite direction that hair is growing in... wipe your tears away, curse at it, and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;I paid only a few cents for it plus free shipping, so the price was excellent! Shipping was quick considering that it came from overseas.</li>
            <li> This simple tool gets the job done!  The first time it is used hurts a good deal, but after that, daily use is quite pain free and really convenient.  No muss no fuss.</li>
            <li> Kinda of hard to get the hang of</li>
            <li> i thought this would be an interesting alternative to shaving, but was wrong. it takes a very long time to use it, and it only pulls out 1 or 2 hairs out IF im lucky. it hurts and would really only recommend it for people who want to facial hair and have plenty of time and patience and not for legs.</li>
            <li> this honestly world amazing</li>
            <li> This was a very silly Ideal that I took a chance trying. It didn&#x27;t work and even broke the first time I used it. This it not worth anything and could even hurt you when it breaks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really picks up all the hair. so you have to get going over that one spot, and it is painful</li>
            <li> It works if you do it right but it broke too&lt;br /&gt;soon. I stretche it a bit too much trying to shake hair out. It really hurts the first time too</li>
            <li> Works really well , even for courser hair ! Best way to use it ; is by applying baby powder all through out the face , or atleast the areas you want to thread and then you can get started !! X</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this to work</li>
            <li> If you can even figure out how to use this thing, once you do, it does not remove all your hair. It is spotty and inconsistent, not to mention INCREDIBLY painful. I&#x27;d rather use one or two very quick wax strips than sit there and pull my hair 10 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this was only $2.</li>
            <li> It work like it says it was much larger than I expected but that&#x27;s how it works you just twist both ends and your hairs are out like that so easy and quick yes it hurts but not anymore than tweezing them one by one this is far better</li>
            <li> it cheap an nice. it works but it take time to get all the hair. it hurt so much i cry when i do it but it great for the price i would even buy it for t5</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to work or find any other use for it. I gave it to my sister who also couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to remove hair properly. She described using it to be &amp;#34;as effective as using dull tweezers when your drunk and trying to pluck your own eyebrows with your eyes closed.&amp;#34;  I know thats silly but I hope it&#x27;s at least helpful to even just one person.</li>
            <li> You roll it across your skin and it plucks the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;There is a...&#x27;trick&#x27; to using it. You have to roll it while you rub it across your skin--and the instructions are not in English.  But you fiddle w/ it and will get the gist from the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And it hurts--but it hurts no worse than tweezing--and instead of plucking out one mustache hair, it kinda thins the whole area and gets 20 hairs with one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It&#x27;s useless for getting that ONE gigantically long beard hair that&#x27;s black and thick and annoyingly obvious. But it&#x27;s good to thin the entire area.  I&#x27;d never dream of using it for anything except facial hair.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s only painful at first but after a minute I don&#x27;t fell pain at all and I continue to take my hairs off. It looks like I just got a wax. And it saved me a lot of money at the salon, thank goodness I don&#x27;t have to pay 8$ 2 times a month to get my peach fuss waxed.</li>
            <li> The product is good, I just don&#x27;t like that your eyebrows have to be so long before it will pull them properly, and dang does it hurt, but im more of a shaver than a tweezer.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect!! I look forward to doing business with you again!! I have ZERO complaints what so ever!! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this threading tool.  I bought 5 to start with and ordered 10 more.  I gave them to friends who love them.  Facial hair has never been so easy or painless to remove.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time deciding whether to buy it or not, but i absolutely love this product. It removes hair pretty well..</li>
            <li> I bought mine from a website for $15 and then my mom wanted one too. I purchased this one for far less. Almost nothing and it&#x27;s working just as fine. Infact my bellabe has lost the elasticity of the spring but this one is fine till now. It is a little painful in the beginning but now I dont even feel a thing. I use it for my upper lips and cheeks. Works great. I prefer it over hot wax.</li>
            <li> Bought this and thought it didn&#x27;t work right at first but realized I was using it wrong! You have to pull the spring apart and close it on the hair and then roll it. After I figured this out, it worked great!</li>
            <li> It hurts just as bad as threading but it works, some of the ends kept on falling though. I give it 3 stars for arriving on time n not damaged. Consistency is key</li>
            <li> Well sometimes doesnt work as intended and it hurts. and the tip fell off once. not bad anyway</li>
            <li> I remember when you could buy these in a drug store in the 1950&#x27;s to remove blackheads.  Good to see they have not gone out of style.</li>
            <li> I normally get my upper lip threaded so when I saw that I thought I could buy &amp; save money on the long run but it does not work! I threw it away!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says it will. Pulls hairs out and can grab multiple hairs at once. It really isn&#x27;t painful either. I&#x27;m also quite used to it. I love that it pulls hairs out from the root.</li>
            <li> Hey thanks for the product it really works doens&#x27;t need any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> This hurts WAY too much to use!</li>
            <li> It hurts at first but then you get used to it...I use it once every 1-2 months because there is no need to use it more than that! good buy</li>
            <li> I looked like it was used before or something. It got all rusty from the first use even though it wasn&#x27;t near any water the only water that it touched was when I cleaned it and I think I didn&#x27;t dry it because I didn&#x27;t expect it to get all rusty.</li>
            <li> I would never ever recommend this for anyone. Even a tweezer is better than this. It hurts more and sometimes grabs your skin when removing the hair and sometimes it leaves a rash where the hair was removed from and also it easily gets rusted and not durable at all. I wouldn&#x27;t ever get this again because it&#x27;s too much work. You have to bend it because it like a spring. I also won&#x27;t suggest using it for long or grown hairs because it hurts more. also sometimes when you pick the hair to be removed, it doesn&#x27;t get removed sometimes but it will hurt and you would have to try again to remove it. I know you wouldn&#x27;t wanna take that chance of feeling double the pain than the first time you tried. unless you really love pain, you wouldn&#x27;t want to experience using this, trust me.</li>
            <li> This spring hair removal is really excellent. Once you get used to the fact that it&#x27;s pulling the hair from the root, it gets easier and quicker with each use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother because she was always trying to pull dark hairs on her chin and lip. At first, we looked at it with a puzzled eye. But, once she started using it and got over the initial discomfort of it, she has come to love it.  She uses it regularly and now has baby soft, smooth facial skin.  No facial hair at all.  Better than the wax job and much cheaper.  She says she would recommend it for anyone with hair on their face. BTW, my Mom is 84.</li>
            <li> Have tried repeatedly to get this tool to function, nada. Better off plucking with tweezers, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item. Its doesnt work for me. I didnt read the reviews that was my mistake. I just saw price because it was cheap I thought it would be good product which it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It worked some.... But it did not get all the hair out like I was hoping. It seemed to just pull on some hair but not pull them out. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a total waste of money. But it&#x27;s definitely not the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts really bad the first time you use it, but by the second, third, and so on it gets a lot easier, now it only hurts for the really stubborn hairs...you just have to get past the first time cause it feels like tweezing x5.&lt;br /&gt; Also, you should try using the stick in different angles if you can&#x27;t get the hair out, ex: going against the way your hair grows, going with the way your hair grows...all in all though, the product came super fast and the price is amazing for what it does. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> So simple yet it works very nicely! It pulls hairs out completely including the root. Very cheap and very worth it.</li>
            <li> I gave these out as christmas gifts last year and everyone really loved them.  It grabs the little hairs so well</li>
            <li> The facial hair remover definitely does its job. I&#x27;m happy for the low price and on top of that, free shipping. But because it is free shipping, be aware that your product will probably most likely arrive much later than the expected arrival date. Mine came almost half a month later than expected. But I can&#x27;t complain because it&#x27;s a great product with a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this item. It&#x27;s a bit of a shock the first time you use it on your upper lip (as I expected) but is real fast to get use to. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use. I purchased another one just to put in my travel case.</li>
            <li> took off ALL of my peach fuzz with this. I love it</li>
            <li> Too flimsy, piece of crap. It&#x27;s legitimately useless! Guess you get what you pay for. Shipping was good though but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product itself.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, just like the one in the picture. I love i so much that I bought 8 of them. When I ordered the 8, they were not even the same color or metal, much cheaper and broke right away, one was even broke when it arrived. The first one (like the pink one in the picture) works great, the others are crap.</li>
            <li> Got it quiet quick - for that is was shipped from China. It&#x27;s easy to use and really effectiv. More than worth the money.</li>
            <li> Hurts! BUT does a decent job. May have to repeat over certain areas. Sensitive areas are a problem....a ittle painful. Good product though... Better than using chemicals.</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, and so inexpensive, but it works great!</li>
            <li> I have never written a bad review for anyone. But this thing I bought a while ago and after using it, it seemed to work great. But it did not get the small hairs. Then I noticed that my hair had come back. But this time it came back thicker and darker. So don&#x27;t buy this unless you want thick and darker hair. I wish someone had posted something about this. But nobody did at the time I had bought it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It is definitely one of those hair removers that it hurts less the longer you use it. It was a bit difficult to get use to using it at first, but I&#x27;ve got it down now. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It definitely removes some hair, I guess? But maybe it was just more wishful thinking. Eventually it just ended up sitting in my drawer, maybe I hope to use it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, for more reasons than one! It&#x27;s a better alternative for me hair disolving creams because most hair removal creams irritate my skin, and also, I dont have time for waxing very often. The hair removal spring gets most of my facial hair out, its a little painful in the first and second uses but after that it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, like when you first pluck your eyebrows. The main con about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out in one role, I have to go over the same spot a few times to get all the hair out. Other than that this product is very nice and very convinient to have, especially when some hair removal on the go is needed.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised but yes, it hurts a whole lot. Love the product and it pulls out all the hairs</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s small but powerful. It&#x27;s just like tweezing so if you&#x27;re use to tweezing you&#x27;re use to the pain but in my opinion this one is less painful</li>
            <li> I love love this item. I bought two.  I&#x27;m not sure how to clean it but it&#x27;s so cheap and affordable and a great alternative to waxing. I couldn&#x27;t read the instructions but figured how to use it. In the beginning it may hurt but you&#x27;ll get use to it</li>
            <li> It works and got here wayy ahead of time. Of course it hurts youre pulling your hairs out.</li>
            <li> One end of this tool broke while I was removing from the box, before my first use. But it was really cheap, guess you get what you pay for in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this Facial Hair Remover Threading Beauty Tool a number of times, but have yet to get it to work consistently.  I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how it&#x27;s actually supposed to work. For the price I&#x27;m not returning it.</li>
            <li> Really works! Is a little painful but works amazing you can see all the facial hair removed by the epilator.</li>
            <li> it definitely works, it hurts like no other, but i&#x27;d much rather have all hair pulled with alot of pain fast.. then one by one idividually.. (I pluck, no shave, no wax) I use creams for my lip but the hair grows back somewhat fast. Don&#x27;t do it too fast make sure it&#x27;s somewhat slow so you can assure all the hair gripped gets pulled from the root. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase not only because it works, but the price was awesome.. I believe it&#x27;s only cheap because of the pain you have to endure, I am not one who can tolerate much pain.. but for good results in under 5 minutes.. I will gladly endure it. Also, the shipping said it would take a little over a month... got in in two weeks. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It DOES hurt, though.  I never believed the description that said it didn&#x27;t hurt to rip out your hair with this product.  I have slightly darker peach fuzz on my upper lip and this minimizes it so well!  It doesn&#x27;t remove every hair, which is nice.  (I wouldn&#x27;t want to have a completely hairless upper lip.  That wouldn&#x27;t look natural to me.  If you keep going over the hair, though, you would probably be able to remove it all.)  It thins out your hair.  I now don&#x27;t need to bleach my upper lip every week!</li>
            <li> This came in very handy for when I don&#x27;t have time to go to the salon and get my upper lip waxed. It&#x27;s also nice that it gets all of the unwanted peach fuzz without having to wax the whole face.  Its a bit painful and causes redness so make sure you dont use it right before you go out.</li>
            <li> This is painful to use, but not much more than using tweezers, plus you can remove more than one or two hairs at a time, so it is much much quicker than tweezing. Love it!</li>
            <li> Effectively removes hair if used properly.  (Search Youtube for Q stick instructional videos).  My only complaint is that the handles on my spring pop off easily, making it difficult to use effectively.  But for a cheap option I can deal with that.  I purchased one for my adult daughter as well, and she also loves it but has the same issue with the plastic handles falling off.</li>
            <li> I cant figure it out.  No directions.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the really long hairs but it doesn&#x27;t remove the smaller hairs too well. I also find it more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> this thing was more painful than waxing and didn&#x27;t even pull out the hairs. the hairs just broke off! not useful or recommended</li>
            <li> Really liked it! it even made my skin softer! just love everything about it....even the price!!! i would recommend this to anyone especially because it takes out the hair that you can&#x27;t see too well.</li>
            <li> It cool!  I loved that it come earlier than expected! :) And well overall it met my expectations!!! I would recommend it to all who have facial hair problems! :)</li>
            <li> It works quite well. It took me a few minute to practice how to use it. Anw, the result is not bad. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> l give it a 4 star because there were no instructions l like how fast it takes the hair away and l would like everyone to try it</li>
            <li> This product did not work. Did not pull out hair as I was hoping it would. The ends of the remover pop off and are not held/glued on very well.</li>
            <li> It took a while to figure out how to use it. The card backing in the package is not in English - looks like chinese or some oriental writing no help at all.&lt;br /&gt;This was a waste of money and time. I can remove hair faster with a tweezers.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T WORK! Piece of effing crap. I watched reviews &amp; everyone loved it but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use the thing properly for the life of me!</li>
            <li> the first time i tried to use it, it BROKE IN HALF!!!!! it was horrible! i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This thing pulls the hair out by the roots and it really hurts. After awhile though I guess the spring got loose and it doesn&#x27;t work that well anymore. I have resorted back to tweezers. But considering how cheap it is I guess you get what you pay for,</li>
            <li> It will remove your hair, but VERY painful....waxing is less painful.</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected , it hurts but it does work , all my friends love using it</li>
            <li> not in love with this one.  I also ordered the REM spring and it is firmer and not as flimsy which is probably why that one isn&#x27;t as painful as this one.  This one does work though so if you just want to try a spring hair remover or have a high tolerance for pain - go for it.</li>
            <li> When rolling over the skin, metal shards come off onto the skin.  Not good.  Maybe I got a defective one?  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> i WISH IT WORKED BETTER I DONT LIKE IT....HURTS VERY BADLY.  I GOT INGROWNS ID RATHER GO FOUND SOMEONE TO DO THREADING WHICH IS THE SAME TYPE OF HAIR REMOVAL. VERY HARD TO USE.</li>
            <li> Very painful device! Yet gets the job done. Took awhile to get the hang of how to properly use it, but after watching a youtube video it made sense.</li>
            <li> It works, but it hurts like the dickens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so, I&#x27;ve only used it once..for the first time. and I&#x27;ve never had threading done. i&#x27;m also a big wimpy baby that does not enjoy even tweezing hair. (My face is too sensitive to use wax or bleach)&lt;br /&gt;So, this was my alternative. razors seemed to break me out, and my hair grows so fast it didn&#x27;t help much anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I knew it would hurt, and it did. oh lord it most certainly did. Hopefully it will hurt less in the future. I do think it is a very effective way for................ripping the hair from your flesh. Ol&#x27; trusty hair maimer.&lt;br /&gt;I can not in good faith give it a rating of &#x27;i love it&#x27; I just...can not. it.......is extremely painful if you are not used to such a thing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, most certainly, twist quickly. pop em&#x27; out like popcorn. The first couple rolls I had, I went slowly, simply because it hurt and it jolted me some. Going quickly did seem to help a bit, and if nothing else got more hair out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes. it hurts. If you are like me, and have not used ANYthing like it before, it will hurt a truckberries ton. I cried a little.&lt;br /&gt;But, no. Yeah. it works..&lt;br /&gt;it works....&lt;br /&gt;............it..may also make you contemplate life. the universe, and the struggles one faces in this eternal war we are born into.</li>
            <li> it removes facial hair very easily. No more lady mustaches. it is also, in my opinion, less pain than using a tweezer. very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This hurts really badly and i cant really tell if the hair is gone but i can feel it pulling</li>
            <li> It works, but iron part get rusty really easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have sensitive skin, and I break out after using this.</li>
            <li> really helpful, but painful. But I love it</li>
            <li> Love this little tool! I&#x27;ve just received it in the mail and I&#x27;m already obsessed! It doesn&#x27;t hurt much, but I guess people have different pain tolerance. I can take a lot of pain so it&#x27;s great! Thank you for such a neat tool to get rid of this unwanted hair!(:</li>
            <li> When it first came, I did not know how to use it so I did some research online and found out the original one costs a lot of money.  It somewhat works but the hair comes out much quicker than the video said.  It is also hard to remove the shorter hair.  Luckies, the price is not high on this one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great, painful at first but really does work! Amazing price!!!! Use ice on your face and then use this tool and it won&#x27;t hurt as much!</li>
            <li> it hurts but it works. the more you use it the less it hurts though. I think its a good buy for styay hairs here and there though.</li>
            <li> keep your $1, it doesn&#x27;t work at all..i would not refer this product..even thou it was a $1...,,,,i am not not sure how to use it, instuctions was not in english and not clear..</li>
            <li> I ordered 2, one for me and one for my sister, thick facial hair runs in our family and I needed some kindof a miracle, tweezing one by one would take tp long, and i hated waxing for the fact that i have to wait till the hair cocompletely grows out again :( but I saw a version of this on youtube and I knew this was the answer to my prayers! It came neatly packaged for safety, no damage, works perfectly! It gets all the hairs, whether theyre peach fuzz or thick and goatie-like, it does hurt at first but you get used to it</li>
            <li> It took me an hour to really learn the best way to use this tool, even after watching a youtube video. It is a great &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; way of removing facial hair, but can be painful at times. The upper lip area definitely needs extra attention with this tool; one tip is, with your mouth closed, push your tongue out to make the upper lip area protrude more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all over you tube tryin to figure out how to use it effectively. Delivery was good, but instructions in Chinese so bomber. But overall  I just think you have to learn and then get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Love it ~ i don&#x27;t know how it actually works but it does the job! Great tool. Will most likely order more.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work , tweezers are more accurate and faster</li>
            <li> This product simply did nothing for me.  The price definitely reflects the quality.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, PACKAGED WELL AND SPEEDY SHIPMENT.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work just breaks off random pieces of hair if that much</li>
            <li> Really hurts and doesn&#x27;t remove that much hair that I can tell.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It hurts like hell and I stopped using it. I prefer my tweezerman.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice, but you get the hang of it and it doesn&#x27;t rip my skin off like tweezers do. Nice product I hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> This little tool really does the trick. It is painful the first time, but it does what it says it would do. I think it is the perfect medium for me because I breakout with waxes and my skin gets irritated with creams. I have super sensitive skin and needed something to help me remove upper lip facial hair! I had a few tiny pimples the next day, but not in the way I breakout all over when I thread or wax. Finally! I can deal with a few pimples.</li>
            <li> The product came earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I love the free shipping, no damage to the package at all.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for it&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;Removes upper lip hair easily.</li>
            <li> This works like a charm once you get used to using it. I used to do threading but I find this much easier. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Actually removes hair but it takes a bit of practice to get the hang of. Definitely works way better than tweezers.</li>
            <li> I use this for the peach fuzz on my face to give my face a softer look and make my face makeup look more natural. It works great.</li>
            <li> painful at first but wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This product hurt so bad. I tried different methods and ways to use it, and it hurt SO bad. I tried it a few times, and I&#x27;ll never pick it up again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for sideburns, but it&#x27;s tough to get short upper lip hairs. Threading cleans your face so much better. That being said, this is great for someone who needs just a quick little clean up.</li>
            <li> It hurts but it works. In time you might get use to the feeling, kind of the way plucking your eye brows gets easier, but I have not used it that often.</li>
            <li> This does work. It hurts, just like tweezing does, although a little worse since it pulls more hairs out at once. My biggest complaint is it&#x27;s so much longer than it needs to be. I&#x27;m often bending it quite a bit when I use it, or I&#x27;m holding onto the metal parts instead of the handles when I&#x27;m using it. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase however, and I still use it now and then. If you tweeze a lot, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve reviewed this product and says it doesn&#x27;t work then you are using it wrong (go on youtube and watch a tutorial).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand will catch every hair and pull it out as you twist it up. Since it grabs all the hairs at once the first couple of times you use this product it&#x27;s going to be painful. But after a couple of months of using it I&#x27;m less sensitive to it (it&#x27;s like when you first started tweezing your eyebrows and now that you&#x27;ve been doing it for years you don&#x27;t even bat an eye when tweezing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put soothing lotion on afterwards to calm the area.  I highly recommend this for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> painful and did me no justice.</li>
            <li> Ineffective.  It doesn&#x27;t grab the hair at all.</li>
            <li> These work better than the battery-powered type, but the handles fall off almost immediately.</li>
            <li> great product, but the spring breaks easily</li>
            <li> It hurts so bad but it totally works.</li>
            <li> good product use it all the time</li>
            <li> This item comes without instructions, so I got online to see how to actually use it.  For some people this device may work like a charm, but as for myself, I can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s doing anything.  I&#x27;m following the instructions that I downloaded on YouTube, but perhaps I&#x27;m not doing something right or the light facial hair that I have, isn&#x27;t the type that this works best on.</li>
            <li> This wonderful spring works great.  Its just like threading but I&#x27;m able to do it on my own and regularly without leaving my house or paying money for.  If done consistently the hair starts to grow in softer, I&#x27;ve noticed with my chin hair.  I have two, one for my purse or car and one I keep in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This just Flat out doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It works but it hurts more than waxing...</li>
            <li> Works great, but it&#x27;s absolutely NOT pain free.  It can make your eyes water!  However, it gets a lot of hairs at once which makes the process quicker.  I&#x27;m sure at some point I will get used to wanting to curse outloud with every roll of the spring!  ;)</li>
            <li> Eh, doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as the original brand. But still gets the job done</li>
            <li> love it! takes a couple tries to do it correctly but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely works, but most definitely painful!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but it does work.  It does feel like you are pulling a lot of hairs at once so don&#x27;t think it is painless.</li>
            <li> It costs $25 or more to get your entire face threaded or waxed. I bought this thing with shipping for like $4. It removes the hair and its really easy to use. It does what it is supposed to do. Yeah it hurts a little but the first time you get your eyebrows done its hurts like crazy but you get used to it. Seriously this is one of the greatest things ever invented. Its brilliant and women should stop getting threaded and waxed for facial hair besides eyebrows and get one of these babies. I love it!!!! I raved about it so much that my sister is annoyed of me.</li>
            <li> This is exceptionally easy to use. It does hurt a little because it is pulling out the hair. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> This item is awkward to use. It hurts a lot more than just getting it threaded. Don&#x27;t recommend it hurts to much</li>
            <li> Roll roll and roll. I think it rips half the hair but not all from the root. It is tingly and some might say very painful. I would recommend to try just for fun, but don&#x27;t have expectations like you&#x27;ll have a face threading session.</li>
            <li> Pretty painful but much quicker than a tweezer and I don&#x27;t get bumps from this but I do from a tweezer. If you&#x27;re crazy about having no unwanted facial hair like me this is great because you can do it while watching tv or doing something else. The quality isn&#x27;t great but hey its really cheap and works!</li>
            <li> Holy crap this thing works. It&#x27;s honestly WAY better than tweezers. I love this and for a doller? Who could resist! Also it&#x27;s really not hard to figure out</li>
            <li> Great for the price...little painful...but saves you money... If you can tolerate the pain:-)... The cheap ones work just as well as the more costly ones:-)...</li>
            <li> Too FOREVER to arrive all the way from CHINA. It arrived with NO instructions. I have no idea as to how to use it.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Literally like rolling a spring on your face</li>
            <li> takes a little getting used to. if you have a low pain tolerance like me, it might not be the best thing to use. i had to numb my upper lip with ice before i could use it. but that&#x27;s just me. i honestly can&#x27;t take much pain.</li>
            <li> Came with no instructions. It was very confusing on how to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy for the money, works well after you know what you are doing. The REM spring is a better tool. So I would recommend spending the $12. Also , this tool just feels cheaper than the rem tool, but it&#x27;s good for travel.</li>
            <li> Just I guess I don&#x27;t know how to use it, been watching youtube videos but don&#x27;t seem to get it</li>
            <li> This little device is amazing. Yes, I must admit it is the strangest thing when trying to learn how to use it. however, once that five minutes of mind numbing pain is over and you master the task, this little device is great for facial hair :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to replace a more expensive spring that I lost.  They did not work as well.  The coils of the spring are thicker and did not do as good of a job gripping hairs.  I do not recommend them.</li>
            <li> this thing does wonders</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail the pink ends immediately fell off the ends and I didn&#x27;t know how to proceed from that point since I was unaware of how to use the product thinking they would come with instructions on threading or directions of use. No...Notta, nothing.  The coils looked dirty and rusted. I just threw them away since everything that could have gone wrong with this apparently did.</li>
            <li> I had a better one, but this still gets the job done, it just misses some of the smaller hairs so it takes more time to go over the same spots.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get a hang of it. Holding it at first was a bit hard. But it works great. My face feels so much smoother. It hurts a little, kind of like a sting, but it does not last long. The skin is left a little red but that is to be expecting since you just ripped hair out of your face, but again, it does not last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a glamour tool, but it gets the job done. I have lots of fine blonde peach fuzz and this puts a major dent in the supply. It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair in a single pass, which might be a good thing, because it feels just like you would expect from yanking out multiple hairs at the same time. Given that faces aren&#x27;t flat surfaces, some hairs will be easier to grab than others. I use this when I&#x27;m watching TV alone and go over the same area repeatedly with slightly different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale, sensitive skin and have never seen a sign of redness or irritation. I definitely do not recommend starting with your upper lip, which is the most painful area by far. I got used to it around my chin before I moved up. I had no problem getting it to work as soon as I tried it out. Just twist the end pieces gently  until the spring starts to roll UP your face (don&#x27;t push; it needs to roll slowly on its own). You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s working. Ouch. It won&#x27;t do anything moving downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived a week before promised. One major negative: I docked the product one star because it arrived loose in an envelope, without any packaging. At this price it certainly wasn&#x27;t worth returning. I examined it very carefully and it did not show any signs of being previously used. To be on the safe side I gave it a major cleaning and sterilization before I used it. Other than that, I have no significant complaints.</li>
            <li> Yanks the hairs out by rolling a spring against your face. It is so very painful that I do not use it. I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can tolerate the pain It would work pretty well.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  works well.  very painful on the upper lip, as expected.  I have sensitive skin and when I use it on my upper lip I have welted red marks for a few hours; but the same thing happens every time I get my eyebrows waxed, so I kinda expected that too.  it is easy to use and I really don&#x27;t understand all these comments about having to &#x27;learn&#x27; how to use it.  It is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool for removing the hair around my lips. It is easy to use once you get the hang of it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Yes it hurts. You are ripping hair out at the root but it is quicker and by far cheaper than any other method I have used (used to wax and use hair removers but had to switch to threading when I started using retinoids on my face). I use it ever few days and it gets easier and faster every time.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than I thought it would be. Removes all the hair and it doesnt grow back as fast as it would with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this tool and it does just what it says it will do.  It&#x27;s also easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell just go get a wax</li>
            <li> Geez, I thought I was ripping my face off. It really does work though! I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and does remove little facial peach fuzz. Some people said it&#x27;s hard to use and the instructions were in foreign language, but even without that you just have to play around with it just a few times then you&#x27;ll get a hang of it.  Youtube is your friend :P Plus it&#x27;s a cheap alternative to remove those peach fuzz from your face, no complaining there ^^</li>
            <li> I got bored and wanted to look up asian beauty products and buy some cheapo stuff this actually turned out to be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;This did take about a month for it to get shipped to the states. It arrived in a brown bubble folder but it works well and is super cheap. once you get the hang of using the tool its easier than waxing or tweezing or even shaving and lasts a long time. I plan on purchasing more as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  This is a waste of your money - please don&#x27;t buy.  I have a REM spring and it is so much better and effective.  I wanted to buy this since it was cheaper but buyer beware - you get what you pay for.  Here is why comparing this it doesn&#x27;t work vs. the REM Spring:&lt;br /&gt;*This is BIG and inflexible unlike the REM which is smaller and flexible so you can easily turn it into a upside down &amp;#34;U: and pull all those unwanted hairs out.  I could not maneuver this into the upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; so I could not get not even one hair out.  I even tried on my hand to see if it work - the REM tackles any hair except for your eyebrows easily - but not even that worked which led me to think this is a complete waste of money.  Not all replicas are good imitation of the real thing.  Save your money and buy the REM spring.  I am going to get that as a back-up now.  Buyer beware - I had to pay to learn mine with this but fortunately the price was low enough.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do baby hairs I guess but it was only 5 bucks. May work for some folks I guess just didn&#x27;t work real well for me plus I think it was to big.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this instead of the original REM spring. It&#x27;s effective in some areas but did not deliver the results I wanted. Eventually ordered the real thing and am completely satisfied with it. This is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> I ordered this right after seeing a youtube video on a similar but expensive product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it, but bought it either way because it was cheap and there was no shipping/tax fee included. ---f.y.i--it does not feel cheap.--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works! You can feel the spring plucking your hairs out. Originally I thought it would pinch my skin, but it didn&#x27;t Of course, it wont take every single hair out but it really does minimize the amount of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It works so well like a threads from the salon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful at first, but it works!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and well worth the buy. It&#x27;s sort of a trick to figure out, but once you do it works great. It&#x27;s at least ten times as effective as tweezing and hurts less. Obviously it&#x27;s not as painless as a hair remover cream, but you&#x27;ll never run out of quick hair removal as you might with a cream. Even if you have to buy a new one every three months, for less than a dollar it&#x27;s a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I experienced absolutely no redness (despite having highly sensitive skin) and all of the hair from my face that I wanted removed was gone in less than five minutes. The package came early, and the product was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use: bend the pink nodules down to form an arch with the spring. As you glide the arch across your skin, twist the nodules out away from your face. The spring will grab the small hairs on your face ten at a time an  pull them out quickly.</li>
            <li> It worked good once I leared to use it. I suggest watching some youtube videos. My only problem is that the pink handles come off really easy.</li>
            <li> it works, but it&#x27;s really painful. Also, mine did NOT come in the box pictured. mine was put into an envelope. . either way, it&#x27;s a pretty decent thing when you figure out how to work it.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little but very efficient</li>
            <li> This product arrived faster than expected.  I love it and it works so good! not near as painful as some people are saying.  very easy to use and much faster than plucking.  definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> works great just as described. a little painful for those that are not used to threading but it is tolerable. I&#x27;d recommend watching a youtube video on how to use it since it does not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> It works really well, it&#x27;s a shame that doesn&#x27;t come with an instruction, but when you learn how to use it, works perfectly, doesn&#x27;t heart at all.. Just bend it down and roll up, keep trying that you will get it..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it, maybe I don&#x27;t know how, but the way it shows to use it, doesn&#x27;t work! and its flimsy! the pink parts came out! nastyyyyyy never again sorry</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, and could not get all my hair out, I will opt for more expensive things that actually will take out my facial hair</li>
            <li> Product works as described. Only downfall, it misses a few hairs and requires a follow up with tweezers. Other than that, good value</li>
            <li> The pain you get used to.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to yank anything out but wow it did. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t know what I was doing and I accidentally ripped out some of his beard hair, so it can even get the little thick hairs too.</li>
            <li> Ordered this reading the reviews, after taking a month to get here, I tried it and it absolutley does not work. Dont waste ur time or money on this product!!</li>
            <li> this is an okay product....&lt;br /&gt;I can feel it removing some hairs but I would not use this on my eyebrows since im scared I would make a mess of them!&lt;br /&gt;if you have a lot of hair around your lip area or other facial areas then this would work well for you!</li>
            <li> I didn;t know what to expect, but once I got it, it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not come with directions. Really needs them. I can&#x27;t make it useful. Quality seems okay though so if you are looking to replace one you&#x27;ve had in the past this could be it.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the price. it was cheap and i just wanted to try it and see how it was. It works rlly good. Its just like threading. It definetly hurts but atleast you know that it is getting rid of the hair from the roots instead of like shaving. I rlly like this product. make it so much easier and faster to get rid of hair.</li>
            <li> Great for old lady peach fuzz as well as those occasional whiskers!  Several different means of use or techniques.  You can watch videos to learn, but you&#x27;ll develop your own technique.  You can bend it to grab the hairs or simply pull the spring.  It gets all the hairs but leaves the skin unpinched.  Then pull it out straight or give it a slight twist with both wrists.  I do this while I watch TV and eventually my face is super smooth.  I don&#x27;t do facial waxing anymore--I don&#x27;t need to.  I don&#x27;t think I would try to use this other than on my neck and face--the longer hairs would jam the tool.  To clean, just pull the ends apart and blow.  Or you can run it under water.  One of my knobs fell off, but I was probably pulling them apart too vigorously.  The tool works just as well.  Anyway, you get two of them in this package.  But it is taking so long to get my second delivery.  I think they are a great little gift.</li>
            <li> It takes practice before you can get hairs and it&#x27;s hard to pick up small ones. In spite of that, it&#x27;s still a good product to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly effective. It&#x27;s very easy and takes little time to use. I thought it was pretty much painless but I let someone else try it and apparently the pain was unbearable?? She never touched it again. I suggest trying it once at least.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is very easy to use and small. It fits great in my purse, although it would be great if it came with a slip case.</li>
            <li> Well I LOVE THIS! How come these aren&#x27;t popular!? I just ordered five more for gifts to family and friends. Honestly, it will hurt as first (JUST THINK THREADING) it&#x27;ll go quick. I love it! I will purchase more for myself. :) Oh if you use it often, try getting a new one in about 6 months. Hello! It&#x27;s cheap and awesome! Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Came on time and is as described.  The product is okay but doesn&#x27;t do a good job at removing small hairs.</li>
            <li> After some practice and getting used to the bit of pain, I&#x27;ve come to love this product! I&#x27;ll never waste money on getting my upper lip waxed again - this saves me so much money and time. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best $1 i ever spent. It hurts a lot, but it gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing or threading.</li>
            <li> the spring facial hair remover threading beauty tool worked pretty well. The only problem was that it hurt! I guess once you get used to it, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Takes a while to figure out how to use.  Can hurt as it pulls out the hair but is worth it.  I usually wax and the hair grows back pretty quickly.  With this it seems like it took longer for the hair to grow back.  Maybe it is pulling the hair out from the root so the end result is it takes longer for hair to grow back.  I find a few hairs and use it while watching TV.  No mirror necessary.  Would purchase again.  Got 3 so I have them for the future.</li>
            <li> Felt it at first, but got adjusted to it and find it very handy when there are a few hairs that need to be pulled out.</li>
            <li> Never tried one of these before, but this works well!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I dont even use it , if you think that it will take your hair off quick and easy dont buy this . It does take out hair but not as I expected</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.</li>
            <li> It arrived and I had to look up on youtube how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I still have trouble getting the hang of using it. But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done only if ur hairs are long. If their little it won&#x27;t pull them but I think the long hairs is what u want to worry about not the little barely noticeable ones.</li>
            <li> Hair Remover Thresding Beauty tool, was on time,and in good shape. Workes good. My frinds all have one.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Not the worst but not the best.  It worked really good the first time on the lips to remove hair but haven&#x27;t mastered the sides of the face with it.  Seems like it quits holding on to the hair after you use it a few times.  I have tried cleaning it etc but the spring isn&#x27;t tight enough or something.  Like the concept of this though.</li>
            <li> It literally pulls all the hair (even the little tiny hair). I used it only on the Upper lip and it&#x27;s good. Obviously painful but it&#x27;s okay. ( Too painful in the beginning but it&#x27;s bearable when you will get used to it !!)</li>
            <li> This weird little thing is AWESOME!!!! I had to google and watch a couple of videos before I got the hang of it but now I LOVE IT! Yes it stings the first few times. But less than waxing. I use it on my upper lip, waxing gave me big horrible pimples and i was trying to find a better solution. This is great! Works for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on my cheeks too!</li>
            <li> This thing is great! I use it all the time on eyebrow and upper lip areas. The only issue I ran into was using it on the side of my eyebrow, it got caught on my eyelashes and pulled 3 or 4 out- oops! Totally user error, but it works that great to grab those hairs and remove them quickly and easily!</li>
            <li> A little bit difficult to master the technique of hair removal with this tool. Once you do it is fantastic.  Happy to be free of messy waxing or chemical bleaching.  Also once you get the swing of it, the process is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Pulls out a few hairs at a time. It&#x27;s slightly painful at first. Good with peach fuzz and minute, thin hairs. The product does not come with instructions but it&#x27;s easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I saw it because it was so big. It works, its a little tricky at first and the pain is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have to give this 5 stars because it works.  Yes it hurts like a son of a gun, but doesn&#x27;t all hair removal?  Paid a fraction of the price compared to name brand spring and it arrived quickly.  I have not used other springs, just this one and it works great.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it didn&#x27;t come with any directions on how to use it.  After a little trial and error, I found out how to make it work and it does a good job.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any red marks, it is quick and easy to use,  and some of the hairs on my chin have not grown back.  My mom saw me using it and ordered one for herself.</li>
            <li> Awesome book to help me learn and understand my language..thank you!</li>
            <li> First, my skin is way too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not too hairy and my facial hair is very fine except eyebrows. However, after I shaved once my upper lips, the hair started to be somewhat noticeable - I think shaving makes hair more noticeable. Because shaving made it more noticeable and my skin irritated a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I tried waxing. So far, all well known brand facial waxing gave me terrible bumps and surprisingly, many got tear off my skin. So, whenever I wax, I get scars :( I tried tweezers, but it made me cry and those fine hairs are a lot in number wise - I couldn&#x27;t finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decide to give this a shot on this. Before I try this, I heard lots of good words about this and it helped, because otherwise, I would have tossed it away soon. I had to try lots of experiments to figure out how to really use.&lt;br /&gt;I find it&#x27;s different depending on the curve you&#x27;re applying on, however, the general idea I found was&lt;br /&gt;1. you can rotate only right hand and let the left hand steady and close to the surface&lt;br /&gt;if you use both hands, it should be a right direction, which can be hard depending on the surface. Rotating one hand worked best for me for most of parts, but it might be about my curve. try all different combinations of directions until you find something easy and work well.&lt;br /&gt;2. you don&#x27;t always need to bend a lot&lt;br /&gt;slight curve works fine often times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it right, it hurts much less than other methods (it still hurts) and much less redness. And the best part, it never tear or cuts off your skin and doesn&#x27;t cause a break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who can&#x27;t use waxing or shaving because of sensitivity, this is really a good tool. And look at the price! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> 100% upto the mark. I have orderd more for my aunt and I recommand every one to use it</li>
            <li> Not good product it doesn&#x27;t work in an easygoing way</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;This product is super affordable and works just as good as the pricier competitors.&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to use. If uncertain there are videos online you can search.&lt;br /&gt;Safe to use as often as you want.&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair at the rooT,IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT MUCH ...I JUST LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> This product is okay º  it does hurt when you first use the tool, but the pain lessens from your continuous usage of it. I will say be careful not to overdo it because it can cause redness. Overall it¡¦s a nice cheap tool, better than plucking your whole face, and wasting a lot of money to wax.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I burned my face really bad with hot wax.I&#x27;ve had to use wax for my face since I was a teen because I&#x27;m light/medium complexion with very DARK facial hair.I now have a scar from the wax which was too strong,not my normal brand. So, I decided to look up these types of tools for facial hair removal.I saw how inexpensive this was and decided to order it.I could not be happier.I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but all I can say is Wow. I will never use wax on my face again. I only wish I knew about these when I was younger.Could&#x27;ve saved me alot of time, money and pain. The tool didn&#x27;t hurt at all compared to waxing or tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;*My advice how to use it is: 1)Bend the tool and lightly lay it on your skin just enough to grab hair 2)Roll fingertips away from you, like your telling someone to go away, lol,  this will cause the spring to roll towards your skin&lt;br /&gt;3)Roll slowly, too fast and you&#x27;re just rolling over your skin and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps, and BTW it took me about 4 minutes total to do my entire face, yes I even have to do my cheeks :( But now that I have this tool,it&#x27;s alot Easier!!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have gotten some instructions with it to help me figure it out. It is much longer than I expected (about the length of my forearm). it does help remove your hairs though!! just have to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Love this so much much it&#x27;s portable and works well and very cheap :)</li>
            <li> the product is work the amount spent. the pain kind of reminds me of tweezing or the threading method but its worthit</li>
            <li> It does work. but it&#x27;s painful and came with absolutely no instructions (thankful that I&#x27;m smart enough to figure it out - but I did look up instructions online as a &#x27;just in case&#x27;).  Painful obviously. But that was expected.  Just wish it would pull more than two or three hairs at a time (was interested b/c I don&#x27;t have the money for an epilator right  now).  That would make it more worth the pain.  Glad I only paid $0.67 (free shipping).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t buy it&amp;#34;, because for this price and with a free shipping you might want to try, as it just might work for you. It doesn&#x27;t work for me, however, so I can&#x27;t rate it better. It really depends on the angles and curvatures of the face, as I did get some hairs removed in one area, while in other areas it just resulted in some uncomfortable pinching, but the hairs were left behind. So, back to the epilator and tweezers for me. BTW, the shipping took almost 6 weeks - a looong time.</li>
            <li> I am a dark-haired woman with parents of european decent. I am pretty dang hairy. My eyebrows grow back after plucking in like a day. I usually pluck my upper lip with tweezers every once in a while (to get the really dark noticeable hairs). THIS PRODUCT is amazing. It can pluck like 8 hairs at once! The pain, for me, was a bit much at first (especially right under my nose) but it gets easier and easier until you find yourself sitting in front of your computer screen rolling this over your upper lip for fun! I love it! I almost want to buy another just to have a back up.</li>
            <li> I love the Spring hair remover. Very good for removing upper lips and chin hairs, but not so good for removing forehead hairs. I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> i say its good but not that good for some certain spot on ur face. it doesnt completely removes the hair but it does remove. but i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little painful and tricky at first but it gets the job done and is worth it. good price.</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing (hate the residue and redness), creams (break out due to the chemicals), plucking, and traditional threading. This is by far the EASIEST and least painful thing I have ever found. It comes in a package with a couple of pictures and all the directions in Chinese. The easiest way to use it is to put it against your skin, stretch it slightly, and then roll up. It grabs all but the very tiniest hairs and leaves you smooth and mustache free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly pain free (some very minor pain), no residue, and very quick. Less than 5 minutes and I&#x27;m hair free for a couple of weeks. Less painful and more thorough than plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 10-12 days to receive this (East coast US). Worth the wait!</li>
            <li> No directions, no nothing. :(</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great, easy to use and clean. Came fast too.</li>
            <li> A must have tool. You&#x27;ll find it painful at first ... but it will be a welcomed pain as you tear away those nasty facial hair!</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using my face was covered with pimples like a rash. I threw it away, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Hated this. Didn&#x27;t even work. You have to twist and roll and do all these things until 1 hair comes off. It was definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It works okay, did pull out most of the hair, but will need to get use to the tingling feeling. It hurts a little bit in the beginning. Good for this price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it&#x27;s so easy to use, I got it on my first try. The trick is curve the spring, twist the ends inwards and sweep up (if you go down, it won&#x27;t work). I have sensitive skin and my skin was not irritated at all by it. It&#x27;s a little time consuming but it&#x27;s so worth the money you save by not having to go get it done and you can just sit in front of the TV and use it. It hurt the first minute or so but after I kept using it and kept getting more obsessed with pulling out every hair around my lips, you barely notice the pain. Shipping took forever that I completely forgot about purchasing this but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little tool and it is so cheap! This bad boy gets the job done, but hurts like hell. Highly recommended for people with peach fuzz</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. Save your money! It is too flimsy and way too long. buy some tweezers instead</li>
            <li> kind of.  If you&#x27;re trying to remove short, stiff hairs, like those women get after babies or age, you still need to tweeze.  This picks up longer softer hairs.  It&#x27;s okay........</li>
            <li> Just as I was expecting. This tool is a must have for everyone with stubborn facial hair like me. It was brutal the first time I used it but you get used to the pain after a while and its much easier than plucking out each hair with a tweezers. I use mine while I&#x27;m watching tv. Its so convenient!</li>
            <li> I think that anyone who rates this product low just hasn&#x27;t figured out how to use it. You do have to have it positioned just right for it to grab the hair but once you figure that out it is seriously a snap to use.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product but as soon as I got it I tried it and it worked! Its painful but I&#x27;m thinking that it will hurt less the more I use it. It&#x27;s really good for removing those small hairs on your face. Overall its a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Instruction veg, had no idea that it was using a spring to catch the hair. don&#x27;t want to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Really works!  Check you tube for the video of the English girl getting rid of her &amp;#34; &#x27;tashe&amp;#34; to learn how to use it.  Basically, bend it into a U shape &amp; twist one end.  I have delicate old lady skin &amp; no problems!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as previous ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. Next time I will spend more for a better one that actually pulls out hairs.</li>
            <li> It did arrive at the end of the timeframe given, but seemed to take forever. Shipped from Hong Kong.  Can&#x27;t make the item work well after viewing multiple YouTube instructions by others, and trying numerous times over the course of a week or two - but oh well, it was cheap so not much of a loss. Packed adequately for contents.</li>
            <li> i like it ,but sometimes it wont pluck right away, takes some getting use to. but all in all it was i am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It works to some degree, because I can feel the hairs come out, but it&#x27;s not that easy and it only pulls few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> This tool is advertised as being NOT painful.  OMG, it is ridiculous it hurts so much!  Don&#x27;t even try to use it on your upper lip!  Both my daughter and I had the same experience.  Horrifying!!</li>
            <li> this is nice.  takes a little practice and trial &amp; error.  I&#x27;ve gotten it to work a few times and will continue to try.  My package had directions only in another language (chinese maybe?) so the packaging was of no help.</li>
            <li> My mom and I both have one and we love it! Easy to use (a bit painful at first, but you get used to it!) and a small size to not take up much room in the drawer! We use ours all the time and they work great! Xxx</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that you got more than one of these when I made my purchase but received only the one.  The ends do come off but are easily put back on. All in all it does do what it says it does.  It works best at removing the hair over my upper lip and it was really really painful the first time I did it. (I cried, and I&#x27;m not one to wince) But now that I&#x27;m use to it its  not so bad. you do have to make several passes to get all the hairs which seems time consuming but you don&#x27;t have to look in a mirror to do it so I usually do it while watching TV.  I notice that using it every few days cuts down on the pain as opposed to using it once a week or so.  you do have to be careful not to get your hair (from the top of your head that is) tangled in the spring when you doing your jaw line. The chin and jaw line area are the hardest to get.  You also want to exfoliate each time you wash your face at least for the first week or so to help prevent ingrown hairs. I found I get little bumps on the side of my upper lips from ingrown hairs and running my sharp fingernail over it seems to do the trick to release the hair. After using this tool for a while I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t as prone to the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Good product could have received sooner works well also could have had instructions with but I looked them up on line and it was great</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work... it wouldn&#x27;t grip on to my hair. way too big.. it went in my misc drawer and probably won&#x27;t ever be used.&lt;br /&gt;Also the packaging was not impressive...it was tossed into an envelope not wrapped in anything at all.. not very hygienic imo.</li>
            <li> Efficent, there is a learning curve, some directions would help but for .99 what do you want. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I saw the expensive version of this tool selling for $30.00 and if on sale, it was $15.00.  This item was so much cheaper and it looked the same.  I watched a review for the other product and when I received this tool, I did the same thing and it works just fine.  It isn&#x27;t painless, but neither was the other item.  As you use it more it hurts less. Works quickly and is so much better than using a pair a tweezers for excessive hair.  :)</li>
            <li> This stupid thing broke the first time i used it. I have bought other threading tools before but this one sucks.</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have with it, is I&#x27;m afraid I might be threading my skin. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible though but it is a concern of mine. But since I haven&#x27;t gotten any bruises from it, I guess not. The product works well, it removes my facial hairs. I&#x27;m just getting use to it, I think you have to get a hang of the position to which to use it. But for the price, I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I understand the mechanics of this. You bend the spring and the hair gets caught between the metal coils. But it isn&#x27;t easier or fast than tweezing, the area that actually pulls the hair is very minute, and it takes more effort and time than just using a tweezer or an epilator. At least they were cheap</li>
            <li> Once you get past how funny this tool looks - and your husband stops laughing when you tell him what it is used for - you will find that it works surprisingly well. Sure it&#x27;s not exactly comfortable, but I find it easier to deal with than creams or depilatories that leave my sensitive skin with a chemical burn or rash. I would suggest applying a tiny amount of baby or talcum powder before using, but it does just what it claims and removes that pesky peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> This hurt but it got those tiny mustache hairs that I didn&#x27;t know what else to do with.&lt;br /&gt;I had to sign for the package which was a little ridiculous given the small cost of it and it caused some trouble to finally meet up with the mail carrier.</li>
            <li> A bit tricky to use at first. Once you get the just of it. It works and it kinda like threading or tweezers.</li>
            <li> I read several other reviews before I ordered.  It works exactly as described.  Yes, it does hurt a little at first...but the smooth skin left behind is sooooo worth it.  Results last longer than using a cream and hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as heavy.  Bonus...it didn&#x27;t take as long to arrive as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This works especially well on fine hairs as well as those stubborn &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; hairs above the upper lip.  (Though it should be noted, any time you&#x27;re tweezing, waxing, or otherwise pulling out hairs just under the nose, it&#x27;s going to sting like all get-out.)  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for courser hairs or hairs that are on skin that isn&#x27;t quite as taut, such as under the chin and parts of the neck.  I&#x27;m still impressed with the number of hairs this has been removing and how smooth I&#x27;ve been looking, though I may still need to tweeze a few of the courser hairs.  As this cost around a $1 - including shipping - I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s been one of my better investments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** As it didn&#x27;t come with instructions,I had to watch a YouTube video just to make certain I was using it correctly.  I&#x27;ll explain so others know how to use this: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most places, you will need to bend/curve the device for use, though the degree in which you bend the device depends upon the location it&#x27;s being used the the type of hair to be removed. I&#x27;ve personally found that over the upper lip, only a slight bend is needed, whereas courser hairs might need a much stronger bend. Then, simply roll the device in the direction opposite the hair&#x27;s growth.  On most of the face, including over the upper lip, simply rolling it upward will get rid of the hairs.  Sometimes, with more stubborn hairs, the device will need to be placed at an angle before use, depending upon the hair&#x27;s growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a cinch.  Simply bend the device to remove the hairs and use soap/water when necessary.  Dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an easier alternative to remove facial hair. Around the upper lip it can be quite hard to pluck it still does it&#x27;s job. It does hurt, but I think you can get used to it. My hair hasn&#x27;t grown back still after 2 weeks so a definite must purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short while, but already I&#x27;m pretty attached to it. I get occasional thicker hairs that show up on my neck and chin, and this EASILY removes most of them. It doesn&#x27;t get every single one (not sure if that is user error or just the product, or maybe nothing could get every hair) but it does the job and is super easy to use. Also works well for the thin hairs between my eye brows! For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting one!</li>
            <li> For two dollars this works great. Took a long time to get.</li>
            <li> I saw bubzbeauty using a product similar to this and so I bought this product. However, I hate this product because it does not work. Plus shipping took a really long time too. This product is cheaply made and trust me, this product is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try it out... I figured why not since it was so cheap. Overall its good product not a necessity in life but for the price why not?</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect about this item, all I knew is that I was kind of scared to try it. End the end, I battled my fears and decided to give this item a shot, despite not really understanding how to use it because the packaging it came in was in Chinese and there were only 2 pictures shown to show how to use this item. I was very pleased with the results after figuring out how to use this item. I have PCOS so I have problems with facial hair primarily on my chin and underneath it. This item didn&#x27;t pinch too much and was able to grab the hairs and remove them quickly. You just have to pay attention to the pictures on the packaging to figure out which direction to go so it&#x27;ll pull the hairs. I would def. recommend this item, especially if you are suffering from embarrassing facial hair such as myself. I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;ll have to repeat the process to remove the hair, but i don&#x27;t mind using this, it makes hair removal quick and effortless. Loves it!</li>
            <li> It works!!! as good as the original R.E.M spring. I have both kinds and have been using the rem for more than an year. Than I wanted a few extra to keep in my purse...since I did not plan to use them a lot, I went for the cheaper ones. And I was getting 3 for such a low price. But when I got it, I was blown away. They work as good as rem spring. I have been using them only a week and only one has been used so far, so far so good. I am not sure how they will work in an year... my rem spring is as new as the first day. Not sure if this will be the case for this facial hair remover. But I am not complaining considering I paid less than three bucks, shipping included for 3 springs. I paid around 25 bucks for my rem spring, long back... so the maths is simple.....</li>
            <li> This product is not nearly as good as Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.  I went for cheaper and got worse.  The Bellabe is made in the USA.  The niceEshop version is made in China.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the instructions say, nor is it easy to try and use, you should be able to use it on fine hair, however it will only pull out long THICK hair.</li>
            <li> Did not work well at all, basically a waste of money for me.  I have another product very similar, which works great.  Much pricier tho.  This is that product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FXUTUM/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> It gets rid of unwanted hair but a bit painful and can&#x27;t really get reach some hair on some parts.</li>
            <li> Never could figure out how to make it work</li>
            <li> i wish it came with instructions I do not how to use it, I know it is inexpensive but now it is just sitting in my closet because I do not what to do with it</li>
            <li> This is a life saver also very cheap I don&#x27;t have to go in salon to have my upper lips hair remove.my 13 yrs old daughter loves and amazed with this.very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not good, I couldn&#x27;t discover how I can use it</li>
            <li> I am male, 19 years old.  I ordered this product because shaving irritates skin around my lips, waxing causes me to break out and removal cream does both. This product works brilliantly on the hair I want rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried it on the hair around my lower chin, just to see if it would work. The hair there is a lot thicker, and despite the spring pulling and hurting-- the hair would not come out.  This, however, is not the intention of the product-- so I still give it 5 stars for being the first hair remover that doesnt cause me problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite painful to start, but once you get going it really does not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using a post-epilation lotion on the areas after you remove the hair, as it helps a lot with irritation and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was okay. It came coiled in a bubble wrap lined paper pack. I could not find any damage.  On that note, the product is quite durable and would last as long as it can stay clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I had assumed this would be the same as one I had used previously. The spring on this one is much more flexible and I was skeptical about how well it would work. It seems to work just as well. All of the products I have tried like this do not get ALL of the little hairs. However, it will get most if you repeat the threading technique about five or six times per area. It sure beats pulling them all out individually. And, yes, this does come from China. I think mine arrived about a month after I ordered it, but this was very inexpensive and I ordered two this time so I will hopefully have several months of use between the two of them.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, QWIK DELIVERY, LOVE THE CD AND WILL BUY A FEW MORE NOW.  I WILL LOOK TODAY FOR A COUPLE MORE CD&#x27;S</li>
            <li> The package came before the estimated date. Which is good because I was very excited to try this. I do admit I didn&#x27;t know how to use it at first since the instructions weren&#x27;t in English, but Youtube helped me on that. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. I recommend more people to try this!</li>
            <li> This is a hard to use item.. That literally rips hair out of you... It is painful.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well. It hurts a little bit but lets face it, hair removal hurts. I had to look up videos on how to use it correctly but after that it was easy. However I sometimes have trouble getting the more fine hairs and it took a month to be shipped to my house. Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> IT HURTS!!!! IF YOU DONT LIKE PAIN DO DARE GET THIS. I TRIED AND I ALMOST CRIED. SO NO THIS IS A NOO!</li>
            <li> It has never been used as I do not know what to do with it.I use nair for faces for my eyebrows,lip and peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t handle the pain of hair pulling, don&#x27;t buy this. BUT if you are looking for something efficient,inexpensive and does what it claims, THEN BUY THIS! I&#x27;m proud that I took this chance because it was worth it. Easy to use. Overall, just a great alternative to the other brands. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. because its makers are from Hongkong, it will take about 3 weeks for it to reach america. Worth it to save 90% of your money though.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive, yet so effective! This is definitely a go-to for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> works, but I think it&#x27;s made for extreamly small fingers. is a bit unconfortable, (&amp; I have small hands) but eventually gets you there</li>
            <li> I love this gadget! It does exactly whatvit said it would and is very simple to use. I recieved these in the mail right away. I bought three and gave one to my daughter and one to my girlfriend.  They both use theirs weekly.</li>
            <li> Wow! THIS THING WORKS WAY BETTER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED!!! I definately recommend it for anyone who feels the need to remove unwanted facial hair. It&#x27;s far less painful than waxing (and far less expensive... and far faster.. it&#x27;s just better overall). Arrived earlier than anticipated, was larger than anticipated, was REALLY great quality. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it, it seems a bit tricky to use. The plastic endings are cheaply made but what can you expect? It is not a bad product, just a bit tricky to figure out.</li>
            <li> this was so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;cleared up all of those annoying little hairs much faster than with a pair of tweezers&lt;br /&gt;it does still hurt though. haha</li>
            <li> This product worked very well, the directions come in Chinese so you should download an app that will translate.</li>
            <li> Broke the second it came out of the package!!!</li>
            <li> Works well for the price. I read on a few sites online that this might rust after a about 2 to 3 months.Nonetheless I think its a good investment if you&#x27;re looking for something fast and convenient although it&#x27;s not entirely painless.Also I used this only for the upper lip area so I can&#x27;t speak for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this item, unique concept.  Pulls facial hair right out without any problems or concenrs, dont need to focus on mirror, can just use it and watch tv</li>
            <li> OK.. Yes the first time you try this it hurt a bit but so did tweezing your eyebrows the first time. When you get the hang of it its quick and you get use to it real easy.  I am Italian and have the dark facial hair.  This thing gets the hair by the roots and your face is smooth. I was even able to get those hairs that have a tendency to get in grown.  Give your face a good go around the first time and then its just maintenance.  I have not had to use my tweezer on my face.  This tool is not for your eyebrows for that you need the tweezer.  There are youtube videos and watching them helped me.  I now can do this quickly and effectively.  You have to go on angles for some hairs that grow that way on your loer chin/neck area as an example. Wash your face first to get the oil out and the hairs up.  I also wiped my face with alcohol.  Don;t let the tool get oily.. wipe it off if you are using it for a lengthy amount of time so it can grip the hair.  I also clean it with alcohol.  I am so thrilled with this I am buying a second one to keep at my other home.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool! I have suffered from facial hair for years and have never had a smooth result! After this review I am ordering 5 more so I am never without this product. It hurts at first but given the results I am sure I will get used to it!</li>
            <li> I love it. Good quality. i will recommend this product. Reasonable price, fast shipping, always available, easy to use, good size packaging, good brand name. It works</li>
            <li> But this product. It takes a second to figure out how to use it. I actually had to google and find a you tube video. But it is awesome and cheap.  A few days in I pulled way to hard and it broke the pink parts went flying across the room. I thought I broke it. But no it goes right back together. AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> It clings to your small unwanted hair and your able to pluck away quickly.great item to have I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li> Works  good but you will have to learn how to use it.  Easier than trying to pluck every strand of hair on your face.  I have tiny light facial hair on the side of my face by my ears and it worked like magic!</li>
            <li> I use this device almost daily on my chin and upper lip to catch all those irksome hairs. I do need to use tweezers for the odd stubborn hair, but in all this is simple and fun to use - I can even use it watching TV...</li>
            <li> Seemed to work when my friend tried it and bought one. I happened to see it here so I got one for me and one for my mother.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Glad it was only $2.</li>
            <li> This beauty tool really work for me, it remove facial hair like it had advertised. I was very happy and buy a second one for my sister. Try it!!  Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Hair removal with a simple tool. It takes a few times to do the work but if you keep at it regularly, all those fine fuzzies are gone. And let your male friends, relatives, and spouses try it - more fun could not be had.</li>
            <li> Need translation. All instruction are in a foreign language. Don&#x27;t think that I am doing it correctly just by the pictures.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Don&#x27;t concentrate too hard on it. Just experiment with how much of a bend you put on it and the angle you use to go across your face. Painful? Not terribly. I like this way better than tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this device did not work at all for me.  From the reviews that I read, I gathered that it was not the easiest thing to figure out, but I tried every possible twist and bend and pull imaginable.  It did pull out a few hairs but broke the majority off, so I ended up with weird face stubble.  I am back to using Olay facial hair removal duo for the upper lip, which works great but I was just hoping to find something with longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> maybe i didn&#x27;t use it right, but it didn&#x27;t come with instructions anyway. randomly pulled a couple hairs ( which hurt more than if i had tweezed them.) its just sitting in my drawer.</li>
            <li> This works to a certain motion, some ways I roll it it doesn&#x27;t work and other ways I roll it it works, and it HURTS!</li>
            <li> These Spring Facial Hair Removers really work!&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use and dont pull too much. Also they dont leave any redness on my face.</li>
            <li> Yes this thing hurts ... but so does wax and threading.This thing works and i love it. Its way cheaper than some brand. I had mine for over 2 years now and it still works and I&#x27;m still a fan :)</li>
            <li> it works but hurts as it ripped your hair out by the roots</li>
            <li> Works great once you get the hang of it.  Check out tutorials on you-tube. Use different angles and pull it out daily to stay hairfree.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly for upper lip hair. It hurts a bit every time, but it is worth than spending $3 dollars on threading every 2nd week.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool.  I do it once a month when watching TV.  It does hurt a little, especially near the lips.  I use it on my neck, all the way up to eye-level.  When finished, I can&#x27;t get over how smooth my face looks.  Now I really notice facial hair on other women... this is so cheap and effective.  Getting one for my neighbor.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair out at the root. My skin defiantly looks smoother but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long</li>
            <li> I can feel the tool pulling out the hairs, but with further inspection, I noticed it doesn&#x27;t remove all of it. Still overall a decent product</li>
            <li> Horrible Do not buy Cheap because it doesnt work well!</li>
            <li> I like the concept but even after a hot shower, this hurts to use on the upper lip. Consider your pain threshold before buying especially since the upper lip can be a sensitive area.</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as pulling out hairs one by one but sometimes it grabs on to the hairs and gives you pain but doesn&#x27;t pull them out also don&#x27;t get it wet the water takes forever to get out</li>
            <li> It takes some work to get the hang of this but once you do, it is a good way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I figured out how to use this by just looking at the pictures on the back although the directions were in a different language.  it hurts to do it but it works good</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Truly disappointed. It&#x27;s just like a stiff slinky that pulls out some of your hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th spring facial hair remover. I gave away a few to my friends. Very easy to use, I use it while watching TV. Very effective way to keep the fuzz at bay!</li>
            <li> Its not pulling any hair,its useless. Springs have more gap, that&#x27;s why its not pulling any hair. I wasted my money. Would recommend not to buy.</li>
            <li> The niceEhop Spring Facial Hair Remover Threading didn&#x27;t work on my upper lip hair &amp; irritated my skin (small bumps on my upper lip area). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers, I have had no problems getting this to remove hair. I looked up some youtube videos before purchasing, and have had no issues. It does hurt, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It hurts less as you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Back to the creams!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I liked it. It took time to get the maneuver right. You have to sort of play with it twisting the two sides until you find the right way. It does take off very small hairs. However, my upper lip has pretty strong hairs and it takes a while to get all the hairs. The product is good but the time it takes to get every hair I could have just swiped a razor across. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied but not overly excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap and I was curious.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it did, though it took me a couple minutes to figure out how to use it.  The twisting-away-from-face part is the key, and now I have no mustache!  Yes, of course it hurts a bit, but not nearly as messy or frustrating as wax and tweezers and stuff.  It took all of a couple minutes to remove almost all of it.  Overall, this is totally worth it.  Whoever made this thing is a genius.</li>
            <li> I bought this without very high expectations, I thought its cheap why not...&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I surprised when it turned our that this skinny metal spring actually works! I use it on the fine hairs in my upper lip and it grabs and plucks so easy, it&#x27;s not hard to use either. I was able to figure out how to use this within a few minutes of trying. I love it! I no longer have to spend any money threading my lip. :) I can do it at home in just a few minutes every couple weeks and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m so happy with it. And I only paid a dollar and some change. Can&#x27;t beat that. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure this thing out...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bigger and harder to handle than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Really don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this.</li>
            <li> I rated a 3 because while this tool is very effective, It HURTS like a MOTHER! I used it one time on my lip and could not even finish it. While the product does exactly what it says it will do.... pull your hairs out.... it hurts soooo bad. I had my sister and best friend try it and they will never use again either. waste of money but at least it was cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this right now. It really takes out all these little unwanted hairs (especially in the mustache section) so quickly and its almost addicting. The only issue I might have is how to clean it properly, but other than that, worth the $ which isn&#x27;t even that much to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt all that much when you pluck the hairs out, and it doesn&#x27;t leave huge red spots all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money. Does nothing. I tried it multiple times. It was literally like throwing money away. Dont order.</li>
            <li> it works okay, i use it on my upper lip(femstache) it misses a lot of hairs so it takes forever to get all of it. gets rusty pretty fast. and its painful but that&#x27;s to be expected with any sort of epilator. it works alright for the money</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this. It was in a small brown envelope package. It wasn&#x27;t wrapped in anything. it was just the item. It&#x27;s pretty big. it goes from the tip of my hands to a portion of my arm. I first used it on my upper lip. It hurt but, only a pinch just like tweezers would but, pulls out a lot of hair at once. it worked on my chin too.It even works on coarse hair. This thing pretty much saved me from embarrassment and spending huge money. My mother bought me that olay facial hair remover cream and, I absolutely hated it. It irritated my skin and wouldn&#x27;t even get all of the hair off. I even got the box for thick coarse hair. I also hate the after waxy feel of it. What bothered me the most was that it&#x27;s like 25 dollars for 8 ozs. This is so much better. you can actually feel the hair coming out. It&#x27;s so cheap and has amazing results. It&#x27;s fast to do and the pain only lasts 5 seconds and yo would only have to do this like once a month. Just like waxing but, actually less painful. You can take it with you anywhere. You could put it in your pocket even though it&#x27;s long. A lot of people say that, cheap stuff from china is junk. But, they&#x27;re so wrong. I bought thingd from China for years and I was never once dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it just hurts so much! And u have to go over areas repeatedly to get everything over all it good</li>
            <li> The product is looks exactly as advertised but I cannot figure out how it works!! Luckily it was less than a dollar. MC</li>
            <li> It rips the hairs out ladies. Kinda painful for the upper lip  but you have to get use to it.</li>
            <li> it works ok a little difficult to grab hairs</li>
            <li> Remember the &amp;#34;Epi-Lady?&amp;#34; OUCH, if you can get it to grab anything!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful little tool. thouth the pain was intense at first, I could used to it. I like that you can twist it either way depending on what angle it is at. It seems to do the best with the fine hairs,</li>
            <li> I ordered it, came after 2 months and it has barely been used as I dont find them useful and effective. Better to invest on some wax.</li>
            <li> I loved a more expensive version of this I bought so I decided to give this a try. For less than 2 bucks I had nothing to lose. It may work ok for baby fine hair but the spring is too large for more stubborn hair. Buy the more expensive version with the smaller spring for good results.</li>
            <li> This got the job done. It should be obvious to trim the hairs a bit. It&#x27;s like waxing; it will hurt for longer hairs but if trimmed too much, the wax cannot grip. It is painful. But beauty is pain.</li>
            <li> i knew it would hurt but i never pulled hair from my top lip ooohhh the pain IT DOES WORK THOUGH</li>
            <li> It is painful, but does the job. After use, it does not leave bumps and pimples like after waxing. I am using sparingly to get used to pain in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Not that great and doesn&#x27;t really work. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> UMMM . SO SO&lt;br /&gt; / / / / / / / /itss Okaayy  / / / /  ! ! !</li>
            <li> Love love love this!! It came really fast and it works great!!</li>
            <li> This cheap tool is good for getting cheek hair, but doesn&#x27;t do a good job on upper lips and chins. It also hurts like hell when you do actually grab hairs from sensitive areas. I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this! I ordered one off eBay for about a dollar and free shipping, so even if it hadn&#x27;t worked I wasn&#x27;t out much at all. I&#x27;m a licensed ex hairdresser and used to have my own professional waxing setup--but what a mess for home use. It was expensive, messy, and I had to wait forever for the wax to warm up. I&#x27;ve never been happy with the microwave kits, and even sugaring seemed a pain. When I sprouted an extra crop of dark hairs above my lip during pregnancy, something had to be done.  I came across this product by accident while reading a makeup blog--and it seemed that all the negative reviews pertained to not knowing how to use this--which when I received it, I hadn&#x27;t a clue either. There was no instructions whatsoever. Luckily there are a million YouTube videos about it, and after trying it awhile I finally got the hang of it. And, as they say, the proof is in the pudding...i can see tons of hairs in the spring--root and all. Painful? Slightly...but I expected worse. My intention is only for upper lip/chin/possibly jawline, NOT eyebrows...i can&#x27;t imagine how catastrophic that could be. I tweeze my brows and am fine with that. I don&#x27;t even need a mirror with this, I just grab it while watching tv and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all. I&#x27;m placing another order for a multiple set, as I&#x27;m going to be giving these to friends and family!  ****one more tip****  When I first tried it, I was holding it so the handles were pointed straight away from my face, and wasn&#x27;t grabbing much hair..hold the handles so they&#x27;re almost against your face, pointed down, then roll the spring upwards...yowza does it grab alot! And as far as cleaning, just stretch the string and the hairs fall out! Easy!</li>
            <li> Even though it was under $3 it is very difficult to use and the instructions are in a foreign language. I would definitely bot recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from a website for $15 and then my mom wanted one too. I purchased this one for far less. Almost nothing and it&#x27;s working just as fine. Infact my bellabe has lost the elasticity of the spring but this one is fine till now. It is a little painful in the beginning but now I dont even feel a thing. I use it for my upper lips and cheeks. Works great. I prefer it over hot wax. It&#x27;s just a bit smaller in length. I would prefer it to be a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;Also, clean the spring atleast once a week with cotton and some facial cleanser. Thats what I use and it hasn&#x27;t corroded.</li>
            <li> If you have tried about every product out there (nair, waxing, etc..) this is a win win!! It is painful but just like plucking all at once!! I will buy more for gifts!! I am light skin and i have course black hair so this beats plucking and burning your face!! I even thought about laser facial hair remover but this is a money saver!! Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Okay i first decided to buy thins thing cause it was so cheap. I didnt expect it to works as well as it did.  I have waxed before and that hurts so much more.  I just did this at work in the mirror and it took me about a min for my upper lip.  Seriously, pulling hair out from the root!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect much. But it&#x27;s dang hurt. !!! But it works though. It takes off my tiny facial hairs</li>
            <li> This item does not remove facial hair as promised. It it wasn&#x27;t so cheap, I would have returned it instead of throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Okay when i first opened the box i was like what the hell is this?? But once i figure how to use it i liked it..i used it to removed some facial hair.. the pain is like tweezers plucking ur eyebrows only all over ur face..u get use to it in a minute or so.. but hey it worked.. it removed ugly facial hair..</li>
            <li> This product works well for removing hair. I have to give it that. However, I used this product to remove hair on my face, my face was red from irritation and never cleared up. Within the next day I had all of these small hard bumps on my face along with red irritation. I must have had some allergic reaction to the material of the metal, or the fact that it came directly from China (with Chinese on the package) and I have no idea what might have touched it. I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I Ordered 4.  They came with no English instructions only in Chinese language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So I tried to use it had friends try it without any success.  Complete waste of money. I couldn&#x27;t remember where I ordered them from (I thought it was eBay) else they would have gone back.  First purchase from amazon I was really disappointed with.</li>
            <li> It works it does what it&#x27;s made to do gets the hair off you can feel it pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li> It works really well!👍🏼 It hurts just a bit the first couple of times but you get used to it. It leaves your skin felling smooth. I use it over my lip and I love it! Also mine came in green💚.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for myself and one for my mom. This is a nice product to remove lots of hair at once. Kind of think tweezing a bunch of hair at the same time. A little painful, but not too bad! It takes a while to get the hang of how to use it, and honestly sometimes I feel like I can get it to work, and sometimes I can&#x27;t. You twist the product in an upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape, and kind of roll it up your face (or wherever) to pull the hair out at the root. For the price, it is a nice hair removal tool to have in my arsenal!</li>
            <li> Unless you are trying to remove hair from your head, this spring is way too big to grab tiny facial hairs. It&#x27;s literally 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li> This is a quick way for me to remove unwanted hair without having to go to the salon and wait 45 minutes. Which sucks when you are short on time.</li>
            <li> The handle was broken off when I opened the package but I was able to pop it right back on. I feel like it works best when you bend it into a U shape &amp; then straighten it to rip out the hairs. I like it, cheap quality but I still use it &amp; would recommend it. I use it to remove the peach fuzz around my mouth</li>
            <li> It does what is suppose to do. I find it little hard for it to grab very small hair. I have to remove the small hair since my facial hair is dark. Otherwise I like using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought this would work. It&#x27;s such a weird device</li>
            <li> Cheap but really doing a good job removing fine hair.</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell, but works very well and isn&#x27;t messy like waxing.</li>
            <li> Works great! Really hurts, of course. It did cause me a bad break out where I used it on my face, would recommend washing face right after and using a toner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job, but it&#x27;s not very accurate. It&#x27;ll pull a bit here, but not all of it. I&#x27;ve used it once or twice. It&#x27;s currently at the back of my mirror cabinet collecting bathroom cabinet crumbs.</li>
            <li> These little springs have eliminated the need for waxing.... but more importantly everyone has had a lot of fun with them....wondering what they were for..... a great fun and useful gift.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work like it should have</li>
            <li> really big and bulky, doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Great device and received this item even days before the suggested time it would take to deliver!</li>
            <li> I could not see that it removed any facial hair. It is inexpensive so, no great loss but, sad it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get it right the first time I had to watch tutorials on youtube. It hurts but it works you get use to it though</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe it is me, but this thing is awkard and coming with no directions, I had to look up on the internet how to use the dang thing. It does work, but even picture directions would be nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this handy tool and I use it on my face, especially on my mustache area. Is a bit painful but it works well.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use. NO instructions.</li>
            <li> yes it really hurts.  but same thing with twizzer and waxing. I have a few thick facial hair along with fine hair. only removes fine ones. so I have to go over with twizzer for thick hair. so I&#x27;m not sure I like it or not. waxing takes care all the hair. but messy...&lt;br /&gt;so if you have just fine baby hair, go for it.  and you need kind a play around to find out how to use it efficiently.</li>
            <li> I think that the product is easy for carry and i can have that any time with me. nice price. but i put on any place and sometimes i &#x60;m lazy for cleaning that and then i used that. you have to be careful for cleaning your tool before use your treading on your face.&lt;br /&gt;just cleaning is hard. and remove just thin hair very good but not provide for thick hair.</li>
            <li> You pay what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 1st time ever removing hair on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it actually came our great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its hurts veryyy little.  You get used to the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair hasnt grown back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been over 2 weeks... weird... but hey it does its job (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im glad I bought this item. Dont have to pay someone to do a 2 min job.</li>
            <li> Its way bigger than I expected  but it does it job! You may want to apply a little cream in the area before you star to plug the hair out, cuz it hurts . Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use and it HURTS bad, it&#x27;s in a box in my closet because I can&#x27;t bare to throw it away, I spent money on it and it&#x27;s brand new! I would return it but I feel there is really no use.</li>
            <li> If you are asking yourself if there is a difference between a $16 spring and a $5 spring and why should you pay more for something so simple, then this is a review for you. I originally had the R.E.M. Spring and it has lasted me for at least 3 years. I still have it and use it several days a week. I wanted another to keep on hand, and thought I would try to save myself $10 and try this one. First, the spring is a larger diameter and doesn&#x27;t bend as easily, so it is much less effective and more difficult to use. Then, within 10 minutes of trying to get a feel for it and make it work for me, the handle broke off. So there you go. Now I&#x27;m going to order another R.E.M. Spring and instead of saving myself $10, I wasted $5.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use wax any more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one would be a hurt compare to wax.. but I think it&#x27;s normal...It&#x27;s very sufficient to remove my hair on face :)</li>
            <li> Rusted and dirty when I got it. I had to throw it away. Good thing it was cheap, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> For $1 it can&#x27;t be beat!  Plus, it cleans up all my unwanted facial hair leaving me less trips to the threading salon.  Can do your whole face except for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> For $1 I thought I&#x27;d try it. It works, but I could not get in the habit of using it regularly, so mine pretty much sits in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times, but couldn&#x27;t get this product to remove any hairs, anywhere from my face. I even tried it on my legs, and couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything there either. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Dear lord this thing hurts.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 stars because I doubt it will last very long but at this price who can complain?  I know, I hate buying cheap stuff from China, too - but it works and it&#x27;s way less than just getting your moustache waxed at the salon.  I figure even if it lasts a month or two it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine a few days ago and figured out how to use it right away.  No directions on the package - unless you can read chinese.  There are videos on youtube that show you how to use these type of devices.  As I said, it&#x27;s easy to use.  Yes, it does hurt - especially on the upper lip but so does waxing.  I got this because as I get older, I seem to have these stiff chin hairs that I&#x27;m constantly tweezeing  - well, this did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the investment.  I&#x27;ll report back if it breaks really soon or I find some flaw in it.</li>
            <li> It hurts. it&#x27;s difficult to use. Seriously don&#x27;t bother. And do not waste your money on this product. It sucks</li>
            <li> At the second time of use broke it ..I can instill use it but the pink part doesn&#x27;t work anymore</li>
            <li> The item came ahead of the delivery date. It does exactly what the company says it will do. I wish I would have found this sooner. I may order another for someone I know. It is great. The price is great too. It works, who would have thought something like this would work.</li>
            <li> I should have know by the value that this was not what it is even worth. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Never did work out for me...</li>
            <li> Once you know how to use it does work it hurts but u get used to it ...just gotta know how to use it</li>
            <li> it is a scam and doesn&#x27;t work.. so save your money.. tried all the ways and doesn&#x27;t take any hair out even if you to take one hair out..</li>
            <li> For some reason my stupid skin just loves to breakout after waxing or plucking.  Tend skin helps me on my legs but not on my face it drys it out really bad.  I tried it once broke me out so I gave it to my mom who has awesome skin and her face is as smooth as a babies bottom overall a great product.  Takes practice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> have been using similar product since the &amp;#34;menopause&amp;#34; whiskers started showing up, but can&#x27;t beat the price on this. I use it while watching TV</li>
            <li> This item works really great. You bend it towards your face, bring it to touch your lips, straighten it so it catches the hairs, and then pull away to take those pesky hairs away. My lips is back to being normal again without those damned hairs. Very happy with this product, it does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Takes some time to find the right way to use it, but once you get the hang of it it works great.</li>
            <li> This works.  It grabs those  little stiff hairs on my chin even when they are still very short.  The first time I used under my nose it was a little stingy maybe because there was more hair, but now I feel the pull but it isn&#x27;t really painful.  You do have to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; it a little so that the springs actually close when you roll it.  Convenient, no shower necessary, no shaving lotion, no razor.  So far, have only tried on my face. Not really planning on using on my legs but I might try it there. And, good grief, the price could not be better.</li>
            <li> Effective- takes a little practice but each person can find their comfort zone and use&lt;br /&gt;accordingly.  Does the job well.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful little tool.  At first the pain was intense, but after a while I became used to it.  I like that you can twist it either way depending on what angle it is at.  It seems to do the best with the fine hairs, as occasionally I will still have to get the tweezers out for a tough hair.</li>
            <li> I love this method of removing facial hair, it is very efficient and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;Great deal! I got extras for my friends!</li>
            <li> I also own the myspringit from myspringit.com and I honestly think that the one I ordered here on amazon for $14 dollars cheaper is the much better product.</li>
            <li> this thing only work on the firts day i use it after that it didn&#x27;t work as it was so not recommend it.</li>
            <li> ONCE it came in the mail I was excited to get rid of the unwanted hair.Although the way the condition of the item itself seem as if someone opened it at the edge of the top corner.The product seem fined as if no one used it so i didn&#x27;t return it,but REMINDER THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS ALL IN MANDARIN SO YOU WONT BE ABLE TO READ THE DESCRIPTION ETC.Also the shipping came a bit earlier then excepted.</li>
            <li> Learning to make it function properly but think it is a good tool. Would recommend for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use creams or just for a fast hair removal. Overall think it does what it is suppose to and would recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a great hair romover!takes off the hairs fast !</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here but to find out that this really works it&#x27;s really worth the wait!!! Its quick depending on how heavy your facial hair is. For me it took mainly a half hour to get it done. Girls, it does work!  Its cheaper than expensive tweezers and does TWICE the job! The technique is just to bend and straighten it right at the hairs. Goodbye tweezers. Hello spring it!</li>
            <li> For a buck it&#x27;s a great deal.  Definitely watch the youtube video to show you how to use it - I would never have figured it out without seeing it.  Yes it hurts but it does a nice job on those fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t take off ALL the hair. It&#x27;s not even as painful as everyone&#x27;s exclaiming to to be. I mean, it hurts, but its not excruciating.</li>
            <li> I just received these (apparently from China) and cannot figure out how to use it?  Everything on the package is in Chinese INCLUDING THE DIRECTIONS!  Where can I get instructions on how to use this?</li>
            <li> This product really works for removing unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Used it on the upper lip and after a few attempts found it to be very useful.</li>
            <li> I use R.E.M. spring facial hair remover on regular basis which is more expensive and better quality. I got this cheaper version of it to carry with my while traveling so that I don&#x27;t have worry about losing it or damaging it in the bag. It works but takes a little extra time and effort to remove all unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because sometimes it works for me and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. But hey it was pretty cheap. I would say give it a try it might be just right for you.</li>
            <li> Even though not all of my facial hair can be pulled out, but it works for most of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> A bit bulkier than the other product of kind, but it is still effective.  Just have to get used to the shorter and stouter feel in the hands.  Love the price; would have liked it if the instructions were in English though😜</li>
            <li> Ordered three. One to try and one to give to some girlfriends but they came in the mail and the metal looked dark and rusty. I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t dare try it on my face nor dare gifting them.</li>
            <li> it works great once you get used of it it doesnt hurt! it works easily also because you just twist it down</li>
            <li> It works like charm for heavy hair spots. For the lighter areas I still have to use the plucker. I recommend this product as an alternate to speeden hair removal process.</li>
            <li> This product shipped accordingly and works just as described. It hurts a bit at first as you have to get used to iy , but than you just too away with minimal to no pain. I loved this product! Will definitely order one for my mom as well.</li>
            <li> The product works fine. I just hated it because it hurts like hell! Someone else might like this product I just did not.</li>
            <li> treading is really easy with it. its really good for upper lips. I used to use hair removal cream for my upper lips. but after sometime i found that my hairs getting more thicker and thicker. then I found this product. Now I can do my upper lips every day. and its so easy and fast.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working well...&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because the ratings and it was cheaper than other places but idk...</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I use it for the space between my eyebrows and my mustache area. It&#x27;s very painless and useful for the upper lip area. Especially because I have a mole above my lip, and I cut myself often while using razors. I did not have this problem with this product! Would recommend, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I just love it ! when you have to remove those little hair on your chin and you don;t want to run for your tweezers haha,,,  only grab this and is really fast !!!!</li>
            <li> My friend showed me this product and said how great it was so I decided to try it. I went with this particular one because it costs less and since I was just trying it I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much. But this hair removing stick did not work at all, my friend that already has experience using this tried it and it didn&#x27;t work for her either. I suggest you save your money or buy a better one.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it does and i didnt take as long as tweezing. So worth the wait. Deffiantly think people should buy this!!!</li>
            <li> This item definitely  works , the price is cheap, will have to see how long it lasts...I received prompt follow up from customer service...happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This device is very flexible and easy to control it works great if you know how to use it, it remove even the very tiny thin hairs! i recommend it and recommend to look for review videos before to know how to use it</li>
            <li> I have to say this thing is freaking amazing but its hurts so bad the first time you use it! But the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get use to it and not feel pain! I would totally recommend this for anyone!! XD</li>
            <li> For what I paid, I wasent expenting much. But its not the easiest thing to use, the results don&#x27;t last long, and it barely catchs the hair. I have to go over the same spot multiple times. Better if hair is kind long.</li>
            <li> This item is great!&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders and is pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I was used to using a regular string of thread&lt;br /&gt;so this is a nice adjustment.</li>
            <li> This product does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s just ridiculously painful. But it&#x27;s not that bad. I have such low pain tolerance, and I&#x27;m able to slowly do the sides of my face. But I can&#x27;t even touch the sensitive areas with this (like upperlip, cheekbone area...). I think it&#x27;s worth the price. DEFINITELY BETTER THAN WAXING!</li>
            <li> This product is really worth more than the low price it is offered at. It is a little difficult to work but once you get the hang of it, it works really well! I am going to buy more as gifts!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me, I can feel the hais being pulled, but they slip out before they are removed.  Disappointing but the cost was low.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even work!!!!</li>
            <li> hurts but pulls out hair</li>
            <li> I love this! It works and you get use to the pain if you pluck your mustache. I learn quick to just grab and pull fast! Less pain doing that. :) who ever invented this is the coolest person ever!</li>
            <li> It does remove hair but not all of it. Threading with a thread does a better job.</li>
            <li> I love it! It removes hair quickly and not too painful and from the root.</li>
            <li> It simply didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve tried in several different ways and nothing. Maybe because my hair is too thin. I have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;It is very small, flexible, quality seems to be good enough to do it&#x27;s job, but it didn&#x27;t pull not a single hair from me. I tried on the chin, fuzz and arms (only to see if it would work other places there is not the face), but nothing. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it hurt, but it did remove all the fine hairs that I have been struggling to remove for years.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical to order this tool, given the fact that this is only $3 or so and there are other similar tools between $10 and $16. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t order the expensive one.... This little tool works so good on my damn hairy face. I watched some youtube videos even before getting this thingy, so the moment I got it... I started doing it right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not gonna wax my face ever again.. This little thing is not only cheap but it works so good. It hurts a bit though but totally worth it. I love this tool and will order more to gift my sisters:-)</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t work well getting out fine hairs but the slightly thicker hairs it gets out just fine. What can I say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works well once you get the hang of it. Definitely does hurt, but as other people said, you eventually get used to it. For the first few times, I put some analgesic cream on my upper lip. It doesn&#x27;t get all hairs, so I had to tweeze to get the remaining hairs. Leaves some peach fuzz, but at least it&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know if I have to let my hairs grow out really long but it couldn&#x27;t even grab the peach fuzz I have on my cheeks.  I tried it on my boyfriend&#x27;s arm and it hurt but it didn&#x27;t remove any hair.</li>
            <li> I saw a similar product that was supposedly &amp;#34;recommended by Oprah&amp;#34; for about $12 more than this one.  I decided to try this one to see if it was something I would like.  It&#x27;s a simple tool.  It works as advertised.  The directions are not very detailed, but they don&#x27;t need to be.  It takes a little bit to get used to how this works, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be amazed with how easy it is.  I have been tweezing random hairs on my face for nearly 20 years, so I&#x27;m pretty used to that feeling, and it&#x27;s not really painful to me.  Having about 30 small hairs all ripped out at the same time has a bit more of a sting...but again...I quickly got used to it.  This product works well and is a great alternative to the other, more costly brand, and a good way to determine if you will like it without spending as much money.</li>
            <li> this works great on medium sized hairs, not super short or long.&lt;br /&gt;very thick hairs are not always pullled out.&lt;br /&gt;good to use at night, using it will leave the skin pink/red.&lt;br /&gt;but it is getting all the dark annoying hairs as well of the white hairs.</li>
            <li> I thought this item would be much smaller than the size pictured. It is actually the size of a pencil, not a small q-tip. The spring mechanism doesn&#x27;t appear to be working very well to remove hair. The packaging and all directions appear to be in an Asian language, with no English. I tried to use the pictures, and people&#x27;s product reviews, to get this item to work. It worked barely, but did a really crappy job at removing any substantial amount of hair. It definitely did not remove ANY face hair (I bought this tool to do my eyebrows). The large size does NOT capture small hairs, nor does it work on a small part of the body. Did I just not see the dimensions on the product page? Am I the dummy for buying this? I don&#x27;t know - but I hate this product and have since thrown it away because it is cheap and useless.</li>
            <li> I love it. Work perfectly. The best thing I used to remove hair from my upper lip. Very simple and easy to use. I recommended to every woman.  Hurts a little bit but amazing results.</li>
            <li> Delivered in 17 days which is not too bad! And it does the job well. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I needed to deal with cheek, chin, and upper lip fuzz and I was really tired of burning my face with \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; depilatories. I saw the more expensive spring from another company and decided to give this one a try first since it was inexpensive. And it works like a charm! It removes even the tiniest little hairs. My face is SO smooth! Yes, it does hurt a great deal above and just below the lip--actually brings tears to my eyes. But it works so well that it&#x27;s worth the pain. The company is reliable, too, and the spring actually arrived before the listed shipment date.</li>
            <li> First it took a significantly long time for it to arrive.  I&#x27;ve used it several times on various lengths of hair on my face and it did not remove any.  very disappointed</li>
            <li> Well, I bought an R.E.M. spring last year and keep telling my mom how much I love it for quickly (while still a bit painfully at times) removing chin and upper lip hairs.... cheeks too if I really want to feel pain. So, I bought two of the these because they are so much cheaper ($1.95 vs. $13.75) to see if they compare. My R.E.M. isn&#x27;t dead or anything, but I figured, for this price, I may as well buy two in case they are fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uhmm... fabulous? Not at all. First of all, the ends are two bulbous plastic pink knobs that are not nearly as small or easy to use as the R.E.M. and the spring is thicker and less flexible on these, which makes it a challenge to grab the hairs effectively. So, if you are looking to just TRY a spring remover, then MAYBE buy one of these. If you&#x27;re looking for a useful hair removal tool, then I would recommend buying the R.E.M...Do your due diligence and read the reviews on the different brands, but I am super happy with my R.E.M.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I am a 40 year old in menopause, so I have a small goatee section of little hairs appearing daily on my chin plus strays on my neck and cheeks. I am saving for laser removal, but until then I am using the R.E.M. and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this &amp;#34;beauty tool.&amp;#34; Good luck.</li>
            <li> I am still learning to use this item. There aren&#x27;t directions in english, so I got tips from from the reviews I read as well as u-tube. It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected it might, but then again, I will keep trying to get better at using it. &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the item for a while now. I would drop my rating to 3 stars. It is good for peach fuzz, but I don&#x27;t think that it does as well on  hair that is a bit more coarse.  It&#x27;s ok, but not quite \\&quot;the answer\\&quot; I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> like most of the other users said this definitely hurts! but it will get rid of the hair. it may not work completely on all of the coarser facial hair if you have any, so you will need to go behind it with a tweezer. For the price it definitely beats buying wax</li>
            <li> The reviews I read before were right... This does hurt, but is less painful than waxing. After a while of using, pain is almost completely gone.  Great for price!</li>
            <li> i cant get this damn thing to work! ive googled it and watched youtube videos and its too complicated i guess!</li>
            <li> It does hurt.  either try to get a little hair at a time or use some kind of numbing cream the first couple times.  after a little while it should be easier.  it&#x27;s so worth it bc it is so cheap and you can use it all the time.</li>
            <li> It takes several times of usage to get the hairs I wanted to pull out.  So I recommend using this tool while you are watching TV or during some downtime because it takes awhile.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews so this is just what I was expecting. It does take a little practice to get it right, but it does the job. I have fine fuzzy hair on my chin and lip, and it works great on it. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s good thing it was dollar or I might have been mad . This thing is  a piece of junk . Save your money .</li>
            <li> Allow six weeks to arrive from china. There is no tracking and expect the package to be damage. I was trying to cancel this order because I didn&#x27;t realize that it was coming from china and was not allow to cancel. Due to the small price I don&#x27;t believe returns are allowed. You do have to play around with it to figure it out since there are no instructions and the writing on the package is Chinese. after practicing for days, I got the hang of it and would say that it works good but quite painful. The item is much larger than the picture.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product and it does take a while to actually arrive.  I have been tweezing for years on a daily basis and hate it.  The trick (as mentioned from other reviews) is to curve the spring into an upside down U shape, press it to your skin with the pink ends down and then roll the ends away from your face.  It will hurt but it does get better.  It is quicker than tweezing and gets the little hairs better.  I still tweeze any missed hairs, but there are only a few!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really think anything so simple could do such a fantastic job. Used to get my lip waxed monthly with lots of plucking in between. No more! Works like a dream in a minute or two every other day...</li>
