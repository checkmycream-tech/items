            <li>and I am so happy!</li>
            <li>great works just likesalon</li>
            <li>Great my skin looks near flawless!</li>
            <li>This will burn the most but it ensured a good even coating.</li>
            <li>and she is thrilled how she is showing redness and &#x27;frosting.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Since I applied it at home, I was able to go at my own pace.</li>
            <li>I just think we can be more thorough and go at our own pace at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I got a hang of applying the 15% with great success, I will order the 20%.</li>
            <li>Glad that i did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Peel better than the 125 peel.</li>
            <li>But my skin did look better &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Skin tone and eveness much better.</li>
            <li>But if your skin doesn&#x27;t have any breakouts this may be perfect for overall brightening.</li>
            <li>: Start with a completely clean face!</li>
            <li>My face actually got the best results and was all glowy and fresh with some mild peeling around my chin by day 3.</li>
            <li>He also applied it in one clean swoop which gave me no relief from the burning.</li>
            <li>, I have continued to try this product I now see a very light peeling, I can now say that I am glad I started out with this low concentration</li>
            <li>after I use this for a while I will feel much more confident to move to the next level, 20%</li>
            <li>The Dr. missed a lot of spots (mostly around the cheeks and lower jaw area) and applied it so fast I didn&#x27;t feel he was very thorough.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have no makeup, sunscreen, lotion, toners, natural body oils, or anything else on your face.</li>
            <li>Just strong enough to use more often - really like that!</li>
            <li>Then I would apply it to my right jaw area.</li>
            <li>Works really fast!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much gone!</li>
            <li>I will be sure to use gloves or a a-tip next time!</li>
            <li>It was my first official peel.</li>
            <li>I applied it myself and had a peel that was ten times better than the dermatologist gave me for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I do not plan on going any higher than that ever.</li>
            <li>You want the peel to penetrate- not be blotchy because you have a barrier on your face due to either cosmetic products or your skin&#x27;s own oil secretions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Wash and gently exfoliate your face</li>
            <li>I would not have really understood how to apply or use this if not for letting a professional apply it first.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m 43 and have some mild to moderate sun damage on my lower legs.</li>
            <li>Well the solution soaked through and my finger tips now feel like sandpaper and look like my fingers are 200 years old!</li>
            <li>, I took a cotton ball, soaked it with the product, and quickly swabbed my entire face as if I was applying facial toner.</li>
            <li>I used this 15% on my face , so far nothing has happened.</li>
            <li>So far nothing happened and I will use it again</li>
            <li>I have used this twice, so far nothing has happened.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell nothing happened.</li>
            <li>mother, who is in her 60&#x27;s has thicker, more aged skin and received a peel at the same time as me with the same dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Tried everything for a wart for my daughter - even burning in the docs office - A year later of trying so much, we tried this and 3 weeks later, it&#x27;s completely gone!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip 2: I highly suggest starting off with a 15% and working your way up to a 20%.</li>
            <li>, I do not want to walk around with red burned skin, with this I never did get red just a little peeling which is fine for a beginner to learn how to use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of doing my entire face in one quick application, I did little sections at a time with rests in between.</li>

            <li> Great my skin looks near flawless!</li>
            <li> I used this 15% on my face , so far nothing has happened. no burning no redness no peeling or dry skin I was afraid because I read a lot pros and cons if you don&#x27;t use the right %. So far nothing happened and I will use it again</li>
            <li> Works really fast! It works well on acne. My acne dried up in like an hour. Prom season is coming so I needed something to get rid of my scars. I keep layering and it helps.</li>
            <li> great works just likesalon</li>
            <li> Tried everything for a wart for my daughter - even burning in the docs office - A year later of trying so much, we tried this and 3 weeks later, it&#x27;s completely gone!!</li>
            <li> Strong stuff, start out slow!!</li>
            <li> I been going to my plastic surgeon and getting chemicals peels. I was paying 125 everytime that i went. But i want try a peel at home. Glad that i did. This product really works. I love it. Peel better than the 125 peel. Will continue using this stuff.</li>
            <li> The strength on this product is definitely off! This is NOT TCA 15% - it must be 2% - don&#x27;t buy this !!!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 43 and have some mild to moderate sun damage on my lower legs. I thought I&#x27;d try this to see if it would help with that. I&#x27;ve had a TCA peel at my dermatologists office several years ago on my face (I think it was a 30%) the &amp;#34; ugly &amp;#34; day factor on that was a bout a week. Under my eyes turned brown like I was a football player! But my skin did look better &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; . So the directions say to use a q-tip to apply. USE A Q-TIP!!!!! I didn&#x27;t because I was applying to a larger area and thought it would be too tedious. I used a cotton circle pad. Well the solution soaked through and my finger tips now feel like sandpaper and look like my fingers are 200 years old! Yikes! So I ended up applying to my legs, tops of arms, hands and my face. My face actually got the best results and was all glowy and fresh with some mild peeling around my chin by day 3. The tops of my hands are still peeling and not much difference on my legs. I think I might try a 30% on my legs. I had some millia around my eyes and it&#x27;s pretty much gone! Skin tone and eveness much better. I will be sure to use gloves or a a-tip next time! Lesson learned! Oh, I just washed off the 15% tca after a few minutes I didn&#x27;t even use the buffer solution that came with it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This product is just not strong enough for my skin. It gave me a very slight peel not enough to clear my acne. But if your skin doesn&#x27;t have any breakouts this may be perfect for overall brightening. I will buy again after I use a 30% peel. The 15% peel I will use to maintain my skin</li>
            <li> Skin got darker on my face.&lt;br /&gt;No results at all on elbows or knees.</li>
            <li> Just strong enough to use more often - really like that!</li>
            <li> I have used this twice, so far nothing has happened. no burning no redness no peeling. I followed the directions. there is so much talk about TCA, being dangerous in high concentrations I thought I would start with the lowest. As far as I can tell nothing happened. I don&#x27;t hate it but I can&#x27;t see that anything is going on. I thought I would try again and then repost what happened. perhaps this is just to low of concentration to be useful.&lt;br /&gt; 8/9/2014  edit, I have continued to try this product I now see a very light peeling, I can now say that I am glad I started out with this low concentration, I do not want to walk around with red burned skin, with this I never did get red just a little peeling which is fine for a beginner to learn how to use this product. after I use this for a while I will feel much more confident to move to the next level, 20%</li>
            <li> Acid appears to be a little weak for what I know bout TCA.  No frosting occurred when I used it.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I paid $80 to get a 20% TCA peel at the dermatologist. It was my first official peel. The Dr. missed a lot of spots (mostly around the cheeks and lower jaw area) and applied it so fast I didn&#x27;t feel he was very thorough. He also applied it in one clean swoop which gave me no relief from the burning. He stopped the peel early due to my discomfort which disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one off of Amazon to get what he missed and I am so happy! I applied it myself and had a peel that was ten times better than the dermatologist gave me for a fraction of the price. Since I applied it at home, I was able to go at my own pace. This was my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of doing my entire face in one quick application, I did little sections at a time with rests in between. After applying the product using a long cotton swab to my chin, for example, I would rest my face in front of my fan for a couple of minutes to let the burning subside. Then I would apply it to my right jaw area. Then take a break in front of the fan. Then my left jaw area. Another fan break. I repeated this apply-then-rest technique until my entire face was covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I took a cotton ball, soaked it with the product, and quickly swabbed my entire face as if I was applying facial toner. This will burn the most but it ensured a good even coating. After that, I rested in front of the fan for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother, who is in her 60&#x27;s has thicker, more aged skin and received a peel at the same time as me with the same dermatologist. She was also disappointed in the results. She came over yesterday and let me apply my peel to her face and she is thrilled how she is showing redness and &#x27;frosting.&#x27; I just think we can be more thorough and go at our own pace at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution: I highly suggest getting an official TCA peel at your dermatologist at least once so you can get an idea of the technique. I would not have really understood how to apply or use this if not for letting a professional apply it first. I have a feeling I would have over done it and ended up burning myself. So, I am grateful I went and had a peel at a dermatologist first to learn how to apply it even if I was disappointed with his application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Start with a completely clean face! Make sure you have no makeup, sunscreen, lotion, toners, natural body oils, or anything else on your face. Wash and gently exfoliate your face *immediately* before beginning. You want the peel to penetrate- not be blotchy because you have a barrier on your face due to either cosmetic products or your skin&#x27;s own oil secretions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 2: I highly suggest starting off with a 15% and working your way up to a 20%. Now that I got a hang of applying the 15% with great success, I will order the 20%. I do not plan on going any higher than that ever.</li>
