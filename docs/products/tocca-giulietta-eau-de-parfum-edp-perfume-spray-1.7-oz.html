            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but when I smelled this one I was in love.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Love this scent, truly one of my most favorites.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Very clean but feminine.</li>
            <li>The notes are floral and sweet, with hints of rose and musk.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel so special to wear it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and feminine, and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this one - and have ordered the lotion to go along with it as well.</li>
            <li>everything went smoothly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blended so smoothly that you can&#x27;t pick it out.</li>
            <li>I also like Tocca Graciella, which is a light, pear based fragrance.</li>
            <li>light, feminine, fresh!</li>
            <li>It is light and clean.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much, this is the first time ever that I bought a matching lotion, shower gel, and roller ball in addition to the spray.</li>
            <li>So fresh, clean and sweet!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and feminine and it lasts all day without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It smells sweetly ethereal.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweetly comforting.</li>
            <li>My experience has been that it seems to go away quickly, but then I&#x27;ll start to smell it again.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money, there&#x27;s a generous amount in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very sweet and floral, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell up the entire office when you go to work.  </li>
            <li>A good product, but other than that I ordered.</li>
            <li>It is very feminine and yet clean and not at all over powering.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something light soft and airy</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s almost a musk element, but it&#x27;s more an essence of musk, like the warmth of musk in the drydown, not an actual musk smell.</li>
            <li>And itxsme pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It arrived very timely.  </li>
            <li>thanks my wife loves it</li>
            <li>I smelled that, but don&#x27;t remember having the reaction I did to this one, where I bought it on first sniff, after smelling many other high end fragrances (Tom Ford, Chanel, Mugler, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not a strong scent which makes it perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>This smells soft, sweet, and fresh out of the shower clean, as if you&#x27;d bathed with the most expensive, fragrant soaps.</li>
            <li>It is hard to describe, but I think it is light and clean with a hint of floral.  </li>
            <li>I got a little sample of this and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This scent is much more subtle than most of the other Tocca fragrances.</li>
            <li>This perfume spray has a very classy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>So, although I really like the perfume, I cannot recommend it due to the fact that the smell fades so fast.</li>
            <li>Not long-lasting, but I prefer subtle, so it&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li>I use it with the solid perfume and it makes the fragrance last that much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER been a fan of perfume, mostly because anything that doesn&#x27;t smell like straight up alcohol is usually fairly expensive.  </li>

            <li> Floral and spicy, but not in-your-face-sweet. A light-weight scent that works well layered with the shower gel or the body cream. Not long-lasting, but I prefer subtle, so it&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> This scent is much more subtle than most of the other Tocca fragrances. It&#x27;s light and feminine, and not at all overpowering. The notes are floral and sweet, with hints of rose and musk. Unfortunately for me, though, the staying power of this fragrance is very poor. So, although I really like the perfume, I cannot recommend it due to the fact that the smell fades so fast.</li>
            <li> I got a little sample of this and fell in love with it. Had to buy the big bottle.  It does not change scents on me and lasts a long time. Makes me feel so special to wear it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It is hard to describe, but I think it is light and clean with a hint of floral.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Perfume is a very individual thing - and I was scared to order without smelling it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  What is odd, is that I have read that Tocca fragrances in general do not last long.  My experience has been that it seems to go away quickly, but then I&#x27;ll start to smell it again.  I&#x27;ve also asked several of the people who are close to me on a daily basis if I am one of those people that you can smell coming, going, and long after I&#x27;m gone (since I changed scents).  I have been assured I do not have a cloud of perfume following me around!  I enjoy this one - and have ordered the lotion to go along with it as well.</li>
            <li> I received a different product. A good product, but other than that I ordered. I hope that in the future my orders will be corrected.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume. Very clean but feminine. I so wish Tocca would make a perfume stick in this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! And itxsme pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This perfume spray has a very classy fragrance.  I just love it!  I purchased the shower gel and lotion too!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume but when I smelled this one I was in love.  The scent is sweet and feminine and it lasts all day without being overpowering.  This is well worth the money, there&#x27;s a generous amount in the bottle.  I get compliments every time I wear it, too!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!.  It is light and clean.  My husband and sons always compliment me on the smell.  It also has good staying power.  It is very feminine and yet clean and not at all over powering.  It is a great purchase.amazon was the best price I found for this product.  It arrived very timely.  I was very pleased with everything about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Its light, feminine, fresh! I get lots of compliments on my perfume - Makes me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER been a fan of perfume, mostly because anything that doesn&#x27;t smell like straight up alcohol is usually fairly expensive.  However after getting two free samples of this scent from Sephora, I was addicted.  The scent is very sweet and floral, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell up the entire office when you go to work.  I find myself smelling my wrists every so often just to get a nice whiff of it, lol!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! It is light and perfect. It is not a strong scent which makes it perfect for everyday. If you are looking for something light soft and airy this is for you.</li>
            <li> So fresh, clean and sweet! I feel like I just stepped out of the shower all day long. It does lack staying power but I keep the roller ball in my purse. Love it!</li>
            <li> thanks my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Love this scent, truly one of my most favorites.  I use it with the solid perfume and it makes the fragrance last that much longer.  I take the roll-on perfume, in the same scent, with me in my purse to enhance it as the day goes by.</li>
            <li> everything went smoothly</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;m so picky about fragrances, and Tocca&#x27;s don&#x27;t dry down chemically on me. This smells soft, sweet, and fresh out of the shower clean, as if you&#x27;d bathed with the most expensive, fragrant soaps. I loved it so much, this is the first time ever that I bought a matching lotion, shower gel, and roller ball in addition to the spray. Some people have likened the fragrance as similar to bath and body works Japanese Cherry Blossom. I smelled that, but don&#x27;t remember having the reaction I did to this one, where I bought it on first sniff, after smelling many other high end fragrances (Tom Ford, Chanel, Mugler, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to list the notes -- for example, there&#x27;s apple in there, but it&#x27;s not noticeable, say, like DKNY Be Delicious. It&#x27;s blended so smoothly that you can&#x27;t pick it out. It smells sweetly ethereal. There&#x27;s almost a musk element, but it&#x27;s more an essence of musk, like the warmth of musk in the drydown, not an actual musk smell. There&#x27;s no heaviness. If you&#x27;re tired of the frutichouli stuff out there, and want something other than a sweet vanilla, I&#x27;d suggest giving this a sniff. I love it so much, I put it on before bed, so when I wake up in the night, I can smell it. It&#x27;s sweetly comforting. I also like Tocca Graciella, which is a light, pear based fragrance.</li>
