            <li>I totally love Mary KAY minerals ..looks so natural and feels so light..</li>
            <li>I have been using a different, popular brand of mineral powder for eight years.</li>
            <li>I rate 5 Stars with a big smile!!!</li>
            <li>better than bare minerals cheaper too</li>
            <li>I wanted more coverage, so I have been trying different brands.</li>
            <li>This is a nice big size, not small like the BMs and others sold in high end dept stores.</li>
            <li>It is certainly a close second, if you want to save some money this will be a fine powder to try.  </li>
            <li>I really need</li>
            <li>It also blends with the skin color very well.</li>
            <li>As advertised, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I love this product lasts all day and night matches my extremely tanned skin I am always in the sun getting my bronze on.perfect</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable if you compare it to the high end brands and for the quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a light Mary Kay foundation and then gently, loosely powder over with this mineral product that helps set my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>First I use Mary Kay Moisturizer, then Mary Kay Primer, and then a little cover up on a few tiny red veins, and then this beautiful light powderly foundation.  </li>
            <li>I believe the coverage is a little better than what I have used, but I don&#x27;t feel this lasts through the day.</li>
            <li>love the Beige 1.5, I usually wear Beige 1 in the winter and 2 in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Looks very natural and not heavy, if you use it this way.</li>
            <li>I really like this because it is so light feeling , almost feels like you have no makeup on at all , the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a few hours my oily skin starts to show as with any makeup I have used .</li>
            <li>natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would have tried a different shade, but I really didn&#x27;t care for the amount of coverage...or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>It was a good product, just ordered the wrong color.</li>
            <li>I think, overall, this product may be a good product, but to use it is extremely difficult; especially if you are concerned about shaking too much out and then wasting it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it too dark at 1.5 beige, thinking that since I&#x27;m olive toned with a bit of summer tan, it would be just right.</li>
            <li>The seller was very expedient, and I received the product before expected delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that there are no lines, and I don&#x27;t look dirty with too much bronzer.</li>

            <li> Ill have to find out wat color</li>

            <li> I have been using a different, popular brand of mineral powder for eight years. I wanted more coverage, so I have been trying different brands. I believe the coverage is a little better than what I have used, but I don&#x27;t feel this lasts through the day. I will probably not reorder.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay mineral powder is absolutely perfect for my skin. It Is applied smoothly onto my skin giving out a flawless look. I&#x27;ve tried other mineral foundation which always thens to dry or irritate my delicate skin. But nothing compares to this product. Although Mary Kay is quite expensive throughtheir website, I always suggest to buy from amazon. But make sure the seller is truthful with their products.</li>
            <li> I really like this because it is so light feeling , almost feels like you have no makeup on at all , the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a few hours my oily skin starts to show as with any makeup I have used . But other than that it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li> Great deal. Will order again when Imrun out.</li>
            <li> This makeup goes on well and creates a smooth appearance.  I usually look washed out but this makes me look like I have some life in me!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation for the summer. Light-weight and easy to reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> great foundation to set makeup especially in the summer</li>
            <li> It was a good product, just ordered the wrong color. Ill have to find out wat color I really need</li>
            <li> I use a light Mary Kay foundation and then gently, loosely powder over with this mineral product that helps set my makeup.  Looks very natural and not heavy, if you use it this way.</li>
            <li> This foundation makes my skin looks great. It does not make me look cakey. It also blends with the skin color very well. Excellent foundation.</li>
            <li> I like this foundation.  First I use Mary Kay Moisturizer, then Mary Kay Primer, and then a little cover up on a few tiny red veins, and then this beautiful light powderly foundation.  I don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;made up!&amp;#34;  Just nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I totally love Mary KAY minerals ..looks so natural and feels so light..easy to apply with the right Kabul brush ....I rate 5 Stars with a big smile!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome foundation. Goes on very light and is pretty unnoticeable. Not too great if you&#x27;re trying to cover something up (even after concealer) but I just needed it to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> As advertised, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> With the foundation that I used of Mary Kay, this product gives me a perfect natural look at my face and it blends very easily.</li>
            <li> good quality. A little bit goes a long way. great value. Feels like I have nothing on but the results were just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. The product itself is very good. However, it is a pain to get out enough to use it. I had to flip the tabs, and shake vigorously just to get a little bit to come out. I think, overall, this product may be a good product, but to use it is extremely difficult; especially if you are concerned about shaking too much out and then wasting it. The seller was very expedient, and I received the product before expected delivery.</li>
            <li> Price is UNbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;The coverage can be varied based on the type of brush you use, and how you apply.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great by itself or with foundation underneath.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Beige 1.5, I usually wear Beige 1 in the winter and 2 in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for spring when I don&#x27;t quite have a tan, but I also don&#x27;t want to look like a ghost. It&#x27;s so light that there are no lines, and I don&#x27;t look dirty with too much bronzer.</li>
            <li> Smooth! color blends well with other shades for perfect match.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation to try in comparison to BareMinerals powder.  It is certainly a close second, if you want to save some money this will be a fine powder to try.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as bareminerals and color seems to be a tiny bit darker than the comparable beige of bareminerals.  Good medium light shade though, feels light on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice big size, not small like the BMs and others sold in high end dept stores. The cap measures 2-1/2 inches across the top. That&#x27;ll give you an idea of the size. I&#x27;ve been impressed as it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried Mary Kay&#x27;s mineral foundation. The price is reasonable if you compare it to the high end brands and for the quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was in choosing the color. I ordered it too dark at 1.5 beige, thinking that since I&#x27;m olive toned with a bit of summer tan, it would be just right. Next time, in winter, I will go lighter a notch to the 1.0 beige. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the color samples online. I kept it and am using it mostly as a blush/bronzer and liking it a lot. I ordered the primer for it which another reviewer recommended, and it glides on like silk. Glad I bought that too. I love it and it makes your foundation blend better and stay on. Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product lasts all day and night matches my extremely tanned skin I am always in the sun getting my bronze on.perfect better than bare minerals cheaper too</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a number of years and love it! Comes in several shades as my skin color changes with the season. Light weight on my skin - my skin care specialist was pleased that I was using this.</li>
            <li> The color was a bit on the orange side.  I would have tried a different shade, but I really didn&#x27;t care for the amount of coverage...or lack thereof.</li>
