            <li>The amount of chemicals in the ingredients was surprising, since this seems to be marketed as a more natural/organic lotion, but its still the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>liked the smell of the vanilla plum best, i bought the combo but liked both of them it helps keep your skins color.</li>
            <li>Pleasant to use.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The lotion doesn&#x27;t soften me as well as others do which is surprising because there are silicones in the ingredient list.</li>

            <li>Smells great, feels great, and much cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>But honestly, all I&#x27;m looking for is quenched skin and the lotion does provide that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep a purse-size bottle and refill from the nice 17oz. loader.</li>
            <li>And boys love how good I smell</li>
            <li>This lotion is really nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and consistency but cannot use this product.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion, but the smell can be overbearing.</li>
            <li>also then they ask where I got it and tell them so they can order there own.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful summer scent that absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated while smelling yummy.</li>
            <li>Great for summer months, and is true to word with the 12 hours of moisture.</li>
            <li>cannot explain the delightful fragrance except to say it smells good enough to drink!</li>

            <li>It smells a lot like the original too!</li>
            <li>Not greasy, smells great and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very, very sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a VERY sweet orange scent.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the lotion makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to so many scents but this one is a light citrus--delightful actually--and it soaks in, isn&#x27;t sticky, and it works.</li>
            <li>Love the light citrus blossom fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, the scent stays with you all day, my skin absorbs the moisture and feels refreshed and smooth</li>
            <li>Love the light citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE MY HEMPTZ IN ALL SCENTS, BUT THIS CITRUS IS UP THERE WITH THE ORIGINAL SCENT FOR ME.  </li>
            <li>Gave several for Christmas gifts and the recipients loved this product!</li>
            <li>, I like this way better than the original or vanilla plum</li>
            <li>Get it if you love the clean scent of oranges.</li>
            <li>Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I ordered every scent trying to find one that was not so strong and I ran out of scents to buy, and ended up giving them all out as gifts.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of oranges, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it fades after a while.</li>
            <li>the citrus blossom scent is WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>scent is strong and WILL stay noticeable for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was too strong for me</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit too sweet for me to love it, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find out that there were more scents available, so I decided to try the Citrus Blossom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this lotion - it has a lovely, light scent and it the perfect consistency - not too thick and not too runny.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>This lotion is also much more runny than the original, and didn&#x27;t seem to soak into my skin like the original does.</li>
            <li>I like how quickly it absorbs!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the fact that it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Decided to try something new and wow, very impressed.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite lotion and as long I can get this amazing price I&#x27;ll keep stocking up on it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Hempz lotions.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that what goes into this stuff, goes into your body...</li>
            <li>and I paid about $13 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Light and fruity with the signature</li>
            <li>It a light but moisturizing lotion that lasts.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great in the summer, but I find it not quite enough in the winter.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s light, yet moisturizing and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer fantastic.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>you will enjoy this scent (though Hempz isn&#x27;t as strong).&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>cause again, your skin is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this.</li>
            <li>So happy I finally found a lotion that I can use WHENEVER and get the moisture I want!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a crisp, refreshing citrus scent that isn&#x27;t strong or artificial-smelling at all.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, clean, citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a new scent and its very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving the new scent!  </li>
            <li>I have a new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>This is a new scent for me, but I love it!  </li>
            <li>and it really makes my dry skin feel great!</li>
            <li>First time buying already planning on buying more</li>
            <li>Lotion works great in dry mountain air.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry skin....</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The first Hempz lotion that I purchased was the citrus blossom, Love this great fragrance, I&#x27;ve now ordered four other fragrance&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>For awhile I was using their original scented lotion but decided to be a bit bold and try the citrus blossom one.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>But overall a really good lotion for the price.</li>
            <li>Horribly sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The smell was so sweet and fruity</li>
            <li>I love this product, it really make my skin feel</li>
            <li>but it is definitely different and not as good.</li>
            <li>A lot more reasonable than buying it from a salon too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sold on Hempz for years, but now I can buy more at a reasonable price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works very well most of the year</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and your skin is so soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and fresh, if you like Bath and Body</li>
            <li>I wish that it was more infused with aloe, but for the price and availability, I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>Gave it away and went back to the original one, and now I love it again :)</li>
            <li>I really hated the smell of the original Hempz, it was just too sugary sweet for me, but I loved the lotion itself, so I tried the citrus and plum and those are much more mild and pleasant smells with the same great texture and results!</li>
            <li>I have been always hempz lotion for the past couple years, but this was my first purchase of citrus version, it smells great and keeps my skin moisturized, but I have to apply a lot, more than I would with original</li>
            <li>lotion does not have a greasy residue and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I am super picky when it comes to scents of lotions</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as shown.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into skin quickly and lasts through hand washing.</li>
            <li>As expected, my skin feels soft and smells delicious just after one use!</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This cream is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much, HEMPTZ!</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth in just the first use.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said that just because a produce is made from a natural substance does not mean it is good.</li>
            <li>Only for those who love strong citrus scents.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great skin lotion, and can afford to splurge a little, 5 Stars, get this.</li>
            <li>was super excited to get it and smell it, but the scent was much stronger than I prefer.</li>
            <li>Soothing on sunburns and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>And I love the soft scent</li>
            <li>I have tried the fresh coconut and watermelon,original, and citrus blossom....</li>
            <li>The scent is very lovely and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Citrus Blossom is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I like trying to find lotions that are made out of natural ingredients and that make your skin feel like it&#x27;s able to breath again.</li>
            <li>It moisturizers ok and ingredients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li>Goes well worth my cologne ..</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and this lotion doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy while keeping my hands soft.</li>
            <li>However, it is a pretty good non-sticky moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an alright smell I guess, but the original is a much calmer and softer smell</li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy or sticky and has just the right amount of scent.</li>
            <li>Price is far better than she has been able to find locally, too!</li>
            <li>I rotate with the Hempz Triple Whip, which is also a favorite of mine, familiar yet strange fragrance - don&#x27;t know what it is, but I like it.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and not as refreshing as some other citrus fragrances around.</li>
            <li>I am guessing the others smell great as well and will try a different one next</li>
            <li>happy with my purchase, can not wait to try a different scent on my next order.</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to strong smells</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it and the shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>This soaks in very fast and leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL</li>
            <li>Also helps get rid of sunburns pretty much over night!</li>
            <li>I first learned about this lotion when I got my nails done at the salon.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>that I personally like 10 times more than this one.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients and feels SO smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this particular scent with the intent to match the quickly warming weather</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t feel coated in the hot weather from using shea butter</li>
            <li>Thanks, Hempz!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering a Hempz product.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this lotion was the smell-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the last 40 years, in all price ranges and HEMPZ&#x27;s body moisturizer (lotion)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only ever able to buy unsented lotion because of my psoriasis but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this one is the scent.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This smells exactly like Pez candy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes fairly well but doesn&#x27;t stick around too long which is fine if you don&#x27;t have an issue with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great product same smell as classic Australian gold products</li>
            <li>I love the original and the Exotic Green Tea  &amp; Asian Pear.  </li>
            <li>I love Hempz because it&#x27;s not greasy and my skin feel moisturized for a long time after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft after using this lotion.</li>
            <li>smells good but , doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>If you scrub dry, you&#x27;ll strip your own natural oils and moisture).</li>
            <li>My hands are very dry from cleaning and since I have been using this morning and night they are much better.</li>
            <li>soaks into skin very quickly with minimal rubbing and can get dressed right away with no worry about getting it onto your clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also feel like the bottle is pretty high quality and the pump will outlast the lotion</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this product...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, and you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price!</li>
            <li>lotion absorbs really well, and does not leave a greasy texture.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Hempz lotion line.</li>
            <li>Works really well to heal diabetic legs.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels much softer after using it.</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say I&#x27;m a real lotion woman, it&#x27;s a must have for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend Hempz!</li>
            <li>It smells like oranges and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>you may not like this one to much.</li>
            <li>You are much cheaper than the salons.</li>
            <li>Its very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of this one at all.</li>
            <li>I have one bottle on my nightstand and one by the remotes ( when i finally sit down at the end of the day, I give myself a nice hand rub!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite strong enough for my needs in the winter, but I think that for someone with normal or oily skin this lotion would be a real winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it is rich, creamy, and totally hydrating.  </li>
            <li>This product does not make my skin greasy as so many other lotions do.</li>
            <li>Hempz goes on greaseless, leaves your skin  soft and drys so quickly that I can go right back online!  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin mostly during the winter time and was looking to purchase something that would moisturize my skin and keep it soft during the day without me having to reapply it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of sweet citrus fragrances, you&#x27;ll definitely like this one.  </li>
            <li>I love that it goes on smooth, moisturizes and does not leave any residue behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy another when this one runs low; I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I enjoy the other scents as well but not as much as this one.</li>
            <li>The citrus is a little overpower, but I love the lotion.</li>
            <li>is by far one of my very favorites.  </li>
            <li>These are normally $23</li>
            <li>Hempz Citrus Blossom Herbal Body Moisturizer is a thin, lightweight lotion that applies smoothly and soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a new staple at our house.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Smells like SKITTLES &amp; makes my skin soft all day!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li>First picked up a sampler bottle at a spa and have since moved on to this giant container.</li>
            <li>The lotion was not double sealed and it leaked out of the top and got on some of my other products.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky soft and keeps my tan longer!</li>
            <li>It is little strong and will stay noticeable for awhile</li>
            <li>So light but long lasting and summery.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>
            <li>And to be clear, Hempz is by no means alone in this.</li>
            <li>I definitely have a sensitive sniffer, but even my husband says this is way too much.</li>
            <li>or I got an old bottle</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I am 80 years old.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands so soft.</li>
            <li>MUCH CHEAPER at Amazon than in local stores.</li>
            <li>I used it primarily for my hands which have become extremely dry due to using hand sanitizer for work.</li>
            <li>Smells kinda artificial and not as strong and yummy as the original</li>
            <li>We recently moved to SW New Mexico - super-dry here - Joe</li>
            <li>All hempz lotions work very well for my dry skin</li>
            <li>It works very well for my dry skin in winter time.</li>
            <li>I really like this as a summertime lotion, but in the winter I have to add oil to it since my skin is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>Very dry winters in the high desert</li>
            <li>Like most lotions, if you don&#x27;t add a little bit of water to your hands, it will feel greasy at first and then leave behind a dry film.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, but not really thick, but not thin and runny.</li>
            <li>Issue #1, it&#x27;s basically impossible to retrieve all the lotion from the container because of the super narrow top, and the pump action straw.</li>
            <li>This can be a good thing or a bad thing-</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The amount of chemicals in the ingredients was surprising, since this seems to be marketed as a more natural/organic lotion, but its still the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> liked the smell of the vanilla plum best, i bought the combo but liked both of them it helps keep your skins color.</li>
            <li> Pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Introduced to this by our nephew in Mississippi-it is a great moisturizer with a wonderful, clean scent, don&#x27;t plan to be without it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The lotion doesn&#x27;t soften me as well as others do which is surprising because there are silicones in the ingredient list.</li>

            <li> Smells great, feels great, and much cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> But honestly, all I&#x27;m looking for is quenched skin and the lotion does provide that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep a purse-size bottle and refill from the nice 17oz. loader.</li>
            <li> And boys love how good I smell</li>
            <li> This lotion is really nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and consistency but cannot use this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion, but the smell can be overbearing.</li>
            <li> also then they ask where I got it and tell them so they can order there own.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful summer scent that absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated while smelling yummy.</li>
            <li> Great for summer months, and is true to word with the 12 hours of moisture.</li>
            <li> cannot explain the delightful fragrance except to say it smells good enough to drink!</li>
            <li> :) love IT!</li>
            <li> The smell of this particular one was very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very pleasing and feels very good on my skin.  </li>

            <li> I loved the smell so much that I immediately went to amazon and ordered it!</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like the original too!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, smells great and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very, very sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a VERY sweet orange scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the lotion makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to so many scents but this one is a light citrus--delightful actually--and it soaks in, isn&#x27;t sticky, and it works.</li>
            <li> Love the light citrus blossom fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, the scent stays with you all day, my skin absorbs the moisture and feels refreshed and smooth</li>
            <li> Love the light citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE MY HEMPTZ IN ALL SCENTS, BUT THIS CITRUS IS UP THERE WITH THE ORIGINAL SCENT FOR ME.  </li>
            <li> Gave several for Christmas gifts and the recipients loved this product!</li>
            <li> , I like this way better than the original or vanilla plum</li>
            <li> Get it if you love the clean scent of oranges.</li>
            <li> Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I ordered every scent trying to find one that was not so strong and I ran out of scents to buy, and ended up giving them all out as gifts.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly of oranges, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it fades after a while.</li>
            <li> the citrus blossom scent is WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> scent is strong and WILL stay noticeable for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was too strong for me</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit too sweet for me to love it, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find out that there were more scents available, so I decided to try the Citrus Blossom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - it has a lovely, light scent and it the perfect consistency - not too thick and not too runny.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> This lotion is also much more runny than the original, and didn&#x27;t seem to soak into my skin like the original does.</li>
            <li> I like how quickly it absorbs!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Decided to try something new and wow, very impressed.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite lotion and as long I can get this amazing price I&#x27;ll keep stocking up on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Hempz lotions.</li>
            <li> It is important to note that what goes into this stuff, goes into your body...</li>
            <li> and I paid about $13 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Light and fruity with the signature</li>
            <li> It a light but moisturizing lotion that lasts.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great in the summer, but I find it not quite enough in the winter.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s light, yet moisturizing and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer fantastic.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> you will enjoy this scent (though Hempz isn&#x27;t as strong).&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> cause again, your skin is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this.</li>
            <li> So happy I finally found a lotion that I can use WHENEVER and get the moisture I want!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crisp, refreshing citrus scent that isn&#x27;t strong or artificial-smelling at all.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, clean, citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a new scent and its very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the new scent!  </li>
            <li> I have a new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> This is a new scent for me, but I love it!  </li>
            <li> and it really makes my dry skin feel great!</li>
            <li> First time buying already planning on buying more</li>
            <li> Lotion works great in dry mountain air.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry skin....</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The first Hempz lotion that I purchased was the citrus blossom, Love this great fragrance, I&#x27;ve now ordered four other fragrance&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> For awhile I was using their original scented lotion but decided to be a bit bold and try the citrus blossom one.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> But overall a really good lotion for the price.</li>
            <li> Horribly sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The smell was so sweet and fruity</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really make my skin feel</li>
            <li> but it is definitely different and not as good.</li>
            <li> A lot more reasonable than buying it from a salon too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sold on Hempz for years, but now I can buy more at a reasonable price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works very well most of the year</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and your skin is so soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and fresh, if you like Bath and Body</li>
            <li> I wish that it was more infused with aloe, but for the price and availability, I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> Gave it away and went back to the original one, and now I love it again :)</li>
            <li> I really hated the smell of the original Hempz, it was just too sugary sweet for me, but I loved the lotion itself, so I tried the citrus and plum and those are much more mild and pleasant smells with the same great texture and results!</li>
            <li> I have been always hempz lotion for the past couple years, but this was my first purchase of citrus version, it smells great and keeps my skin moisturized, but I have to apply a lot, more than I would with original</li>
            <li> lotion does not have a greasy residue and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I am super picky when it comes to scents of lotions</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and just as shown.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into skin quickly and lasts through hand washing.</li>
            <li> As expected, my skin feels soft and smells delicious just after one use!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This cream is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, HEMPTZ!</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth in just the first use.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said that just because a produce is made from a natural substance does not mean it is good.</li>
            <li> Only for those who love strong citrus scents.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a great skin lotion, and can afford to splurge a little, 5 Stars, get this.</li>
            <li> was super excited to get it and smell it, but the scent was much stronger than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Soothing on sunburns and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> And I love the soft scent</li>
            <li> I have tried the fresh coconut and watermelon,original, and citrus blossom....</li>
            <li> The scent is very lovely and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Citrus Blossom is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I like trying to find lotions that are made out of natural ingredients and that make your skin feel like it&#x27;s able to breath again.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers ok and ingredients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li> Goes well worth my cologne ..</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and this lotion doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy while keeping my hands soft.</li>
            <li> However, it is a pretty good non-sticky moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright smell I guess, but the original is a much calmer and softer smell</li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy or sticky and has just the right amount of scent.</li>
            <li> Price is far better than she has been able to find locally, too!</li>
            <li> I rotate with the Hempz Triple Whip, which is also a favorite of mine, familiar yet strange fragrance - don&#x27;t know what it is, but I like it.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and not as refreshing as some other citrus fragrances around.</li>
            <li> I am guessing the others smell great as well and will try a different one next</li>
            <li> happy with my purchase, can not wait to try a different scent on my next order.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to strong smells</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it and the shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> This soaks in very fast and leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL</li>
            <li> Also helps get rid of sunburns pretty much over night!</li>
            <li> I first learned about this lotion when I got my nails done at the salon.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> that I personally like 10 times more than this one.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients and feels SO smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this particular scent with the intent to match the quickly warming weather</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t feel coated in the hot weather from using shea butter</li>
            <li> Thanks, Hempz!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering a Hempz product.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this lotion was the smell-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the last 40 years, in all price ranges and HEMPZ&#x27;s body moisturizer (lotion)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only ever able to buy unsented lotion because of my psoriasis but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this one is the scent.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like Pez candy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes fairly well but doesn&#x27;t stick around too long which is fine if you don&#x27;t have an issue with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product same smell as classic Australian gold products</li>
            <li> I love the original and the Exotic Green Tea  &amp; Asian Pear.  </li>
            <li> I love Hempz because it&#x27;s not greasy and my skin feel moisturized for a long time after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft after using this lotion.</li>
            <li> smells good but , doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> If you scrub dry, you&#x27;ll strip your own natural oils and moisture).</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry from cleaning and since I have been using this morning and night they are much better.</li>
            <li> soaks into skin very quickly with minimal rubbing and can get dressed right away with no worry about getting it onto your clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also feel like the bottle is pretty high quality and the pump will outlast the lotion</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, and you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price!</li>
            <li> lotion absorbs really well, and does not leave a greasy texture.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Hempz lotion line.</li>
            <li> Works really well to heal diabetic legs.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much softer after using it.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I&#x27;m a real lotion woman, it&#x27;s a must have for me.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend Hempz!</li>
            <li> It smells like oranges and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> you may not like this one to much.</li>
            <li> You are much cheaper than the salons.</li>
            <li> Its very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of this one at all.</li>
            <li> I have one bottle on my nightstand and one by the remotes ( when i finally sit down at the end of the day, I give myself a nice hand rub!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite strong enough for my needs in the winter, but I think that for someone with normal or oily skin this lotion would be a real winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it is rich, creamy, and totally hydrating.  </li>
            <li> This product does not make my skin greasy as so many other lotions do.</li>
            <li> Hempz goes on greaseless, leaves your skin  soft and drys so quickly that I can go right back online!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin mostly during the winter time and was looking to purchase something that would moisturize my skin and keep it soft during the day without me having to reapply it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of sweet citrus fragrances, you&#x27;ll definitely like this one.  </li>
            <li> I love that it goes on smooth, moisturizes and does not leave any residue behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy another when this one runs low; I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I enjoy the other scents as well but not as much as this one.</li>
            <li> The citrus is a little overpower, but I love the lotion.</li>
            <li> is by far one of my very favorites.  </li>
            <li> These are normally $23</li>
            <li> Hempz Citrus Blossom Herbal Body Moisturizer is a thin, lightweight lotion that applies smoothly and soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is a new staple at our house.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells like SKITTLES &amp; makes my skin soft all day!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> First picked up a sampler bottle at a spa and have since moved on to this giant container.</li>
            <li> The lotion was not double sealed and it leaked out of the top and got on some of my other products.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel silky soft and keeps my tan longer!</li>
            <li> It is little strong and will stay noticeable for awhile</li>
            <li> So light but long lasting and summery.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>
            <li> And to be clear, Hempz is by no means alone in this.</li>
            <li> I definitely have a sensitive sniffer, but even my husband says this is way too much.</li>
            <li> or I got an old bottle</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 80 years old.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands so soft.</li>
            <li> MUCH CHEAPER at Amazon than in local stores.</li>
            <li> I used it primarily for my hands which have become extremely dry due to using hand sanitizer for work.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda artificial and not as strong and yummy as the original</li>
            <li> We recently moved to SW New Mexico - super-dry here - Joe</li>
            <li> All hempz lotions work very well for my dry skin</li>
            <li> It works very well for my dry skin in winter time.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a summertime lotion, but in the winter I have to add oil to it since my skin is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> Very dry winters in the high desert</li>
            <li> Like most lotions, if you don&#x27;t add a little bit of water to your hands, it will feel greasy at first and then leave behind a dry film.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but not really thick, but not thin and runny.</li>
            <li> Issue #1, it&#x27;s basically impossible to retrieve all the lotion from the container because of the super narrow top, and the pump action straw.</li>
            <li> This can be a good thing or a bad thing-</li>
            <li> To prevent that, I only use a small amount of this lotion on my slightly damp hands and, after rubbing it in completely, it softens my hands nicely without leaving behind any greasiness or residue.</li>
            <li> Came in a pink pump which makes me really girly looking to have it on lotion thought it would be black since the picture is.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time with daily use.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to cut the container in half and dredge out the lotion, something I actually consider with Hempz because it is expensive and good enough that I don&#x27;t want to waste any.  </li>
            <li> Yet it keeps the skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when this new fragrance came out</li>
            <li> There are several other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of this lotion</li>
            <li> and then it feels dry again</li>
            <li> Hempz not only helped my skin not feel or look dry immediately after use but helped resolve my dry skin in less than a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dry skin soaks it up like a sponge!  </li>
            <li> packaging left a little to be desired..kind of smashed and some of the product leaked out.</li>
            <li> I recommend that one of you want something thicker that sinks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> When I apply the lotion, my skin will retain it but for only a few hours</li>
            <li> It is one of a very small list of lotions she can use with her highly sensitive skin, and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this lotion, but it is not quite moisturizing as other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> after doing some on-line research about the specific contents of Hempz skin care products, I am not sure I will buy them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Issue #2, sometimes the pump action assembly arrives broken / malfunctioning, and once the whole cap was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Hempz and HempNation brands for the past 5 years and used several bottles.</li>
            <li> for the lotion, I think its performance is like any other brand name lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely moisturinzing without leaving any greasy or oily</li>
            <li> I wish I brought with different scent :/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, which makes the container issues more frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fragrants, its to strong ... gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Less than half the price than at Ulta.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> almost half the price from a store</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shower and apply directly to dry skin, its not so bad, but for ultimate effectiveness, apply immediately after toweling off(pat dry, don&#x27;t scrub dry by the way.  </li>
            <li> Not very pleased with the confusion ...</li>
            <li> but now I use it all year round after my shower.  </li>
            <li> in just a few days she said her skin changed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I ve had trouble with a itchy rash for years.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the vitamin C and E and it has noticeably improved the texture and tone of my skin after using it just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but I do tend to need a lot, or something stronger, in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a new formula or a fake</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do your homework and select carefully if you have concerns about just what all those crazy ingredients on the label actually are and whether they might pose any health issues......</li>
            <li> the wrong product and the correct product was on back order which is what shipped today according to the email</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it but was disappointed when first smelled it.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy that resulted in lots of small bumps and then a bad case of eczema.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this unless you don&#x27;t like citrus smells or like dry skin....</li>
            <li> The Citrus Blossom Herbal Body Moisturizer is thick and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> I may even try a different scent if I get bored with this one!</li>
            <li> it usually costs me $23 a bottle at Ulta!</li>
            <li> Subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this lotion would do it for me, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> The small one that fits in your purse is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> its all very confusing...</li>
            <li> Hempz scent behind it.</li>
            <li> Tried the cheaper version and was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The lotion got today in the post , I cannot even return because it was damaged and exploded all over the extremely poor packaging.</li>
            <li> but I cannot even correct their error as their packaging was so poor</li>
            <li> its all a lot of unnecessary confusion for lotion I know...</li>
            <li> i never finish a bottle of lotion because I have psoriasis and everything ends up irritating my skin</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this lotion.</li>
            <li> luv the lotion , bit this time it was delivered and the lotion was  leaking  in the bag... not happy about that</li>
            <li> The scent has an artificial sweetness to it that is not satisfying, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.</li>
            <li> (nothing is worse than when a pump fails and there is lotion left!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot return the wrong lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for almost a year, and I&#x27;m obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> It smells so weird.  </li>
            <li> I also received an email that Citrus Blossom was being shipped to me, which was very weird considering as I received the package today with the wrong lotion and the email I received  today</li>
            <li> Though slightly artificial in fragrance, it&#x27;s still a pleasing scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost artificial candy like orange smell.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this lotion.</li>
            <li> it literally made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> The Citrus Blossom scent has a slightly artificial scent, but I do appreciate that the citrus aspect of the scent is unmistakable! &#x3D;</li>
            <li> If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  </li>
            <li> Hated the scent!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells amazing can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Like most lotions, if you don&#x27;t add a little bit of water to your hands, it will feel greasy at first and then leave behind a dry film. To prevent that, I only use a small amount of this lotion on my slightly damp hands and, after rubbing it in completely, it softens my hands nicely without leaving behind any greasiness or residue. The citrus scent smells sort of like Children&#x27;s Chewable Tylenol from the 80&#x27;s. Overall, a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Yes, I Received My Order In Perfect Condition.  Thank You. I Would Rate My Experience A 5 !!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells like SKITTLES &amp; makes my skin soft all day! Perfect to use after sun exposure...helps with the dry/itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft after using this lotion. The smell is a bit too sweet for me to love it, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion in any scent but, when they came out with Citrus Blossom I bought two! I love the fresh, clean, citrus scent.  I have one bottle on my nightstand and one by the remotes ( when i finally sit down at the end of the day, I give myself a nice hand rub!).</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works quite well, as all Hempz lotions do but didn&#x27;t care for scent.  Made a nice gift for my mom, however.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - it has a lovely, light scent and it the perfect consistency - not too thick and not too runny.  The seller delivered as described and on time.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry from cleaning and since I have been using this morning and night they are much better. And I love the soft scent</li>
            <li> smells good but , doesn&#x27;t last long. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer;I have several scents.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing!  Will order over and over.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this lotion, but it is not quite moisturizing as other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product same smell as classic Australian gold products</li>
            <li> Good quality moisturizer. Pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the product.</li>
            <li> Favorite hand lotion of all time!!</li>
            <li> i love your hempz lotion i use it all the time it smells so good and it works very good thank you very much you have my business always thank you lorna inman</li>
            <li> love the scene and excellent quality product!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product... and it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;But after doing some on-line research about the specific contents of Hempz skin care products, I am not sure I will buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;It is staggering and worrisome when you look at what some of the ingredients of 90% of skin care products today. And to be clear, Hempz is by no means alone in this. It is important to note that what goes into this stuff, goes into your body... Your skin is a giant sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Do your homework and select carefully if you have concerns about just what all those crazy ingredients on the label actually are and whether they might pose any health issues......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite Hempz lotion!  LOVE the smell!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but the smell is not the best, i would suggest the original scent. But overall a really good lotion for the price.</li>
            <li> oh my word!  Sells so clean, refreshing and citrusy!  cannot explain the delightful fragrance except to say it smells good enough to drink!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of pomaberry better!</li>
            <li> the best moisturizer you will buy . takes all of the hurt out of sunburn and smells amazingggg. great price online, it is double the cost in salons</li>
            <li> Awesome product that is great for post-tanning salon. Amazon has it at a great price too. These are normally $23 and I paid about $13 with free shipping. This is a new scent and its very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 10th purchase of Hempz lotion. This cent is my favorite! Light and fruity with the signature Hempz scent behind it. Great for a summertime lotion. Soothing on sunburns and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the lotion makes my skin feel really smooth. Tried the cheaper version and was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I am allergic to so many scents but this one is a light citrus--delightful actually--and it soaks in, isn&#x27;t sticky, and it works. Amazon has the BEST deals on this, forget Ulta and the rest who want $22 a bottle--it&#x27;s a rip off. Amazon, thank you.</li>
            <li> These are the best lotions, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, but leaves your skin soft. I have tried the fresh coconut and watermelon,original, and citrus blossom....which is my favorite ! Smells absolutely delicious!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the HEMPZ lotion for 10 + years now.  I use to only use it after using the tanning salon or going to the beach but now I use it all year round after my shower.  It lasts all day and the scent is amazing.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great lotion.</li>
            <li> WHO WOULDN&#x27;T LOVE HEMPTZ.  FIRST OF ALL I LOVE MY HEMPTZ IN ALL SCENTS, BUT THIS CITRUS IS UP THERE WITH THE ORIGINAL SCENT FOR ME.  WONDERFUL..</li>
            <li> Introduced to this by our nephew in Mississippi-it is a great moisturizer with a wonderful, clean scent, don&#x27;t plan to be without it.</li>
            <li> I love how yummy this lotion smells! My kids always tell me I smell amazing after I get out of the shower.  It a light but moisturizing lotion that lasts.  This is definitely my favorite lotion and as long I can get this amazing price I&#x27;ll keep stocking up on it! Get it if you love the clean scent of oranges.</li>
            <li> Horribly sweet fragrance.  It&#x27;s probably just me, but I could not tolerate this moisturizer.  The smell was so sweet and fruity it literally made me sick to my stomach.  I had to get it away from me.  I love Hempz lotions, just not this one.  I love the original and the Exotic Green Tea  &amp; Asian Pear.  Mmmmm, lovely!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Hempz Citrus Blossom Herbal Body Moisturizer, 17 ounce bottle. It is just what it says it is and just what I ordered! Also helps get rid of sunburns pretty much over night! Thank you (:</li>
            <li> My wife loves this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  It  feels great and the smell is wonderful. I recommend it.  Only for those who love strong citrus scents.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this lotion when I got my nails done at the salon. When they were massaging my hands they used this lotion and it smelled ridiculously delicious and made my hands super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does not have a greasy residue and dries quickly. The scent is very lovely and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> love love the scent of this</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, like candy or something. All hempz lotions work very well for my dry skin but this is the absolute best scent they have</li>
            <li> This lotion is great in the summer, but I find it not quite enough in the winter. Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Love the light citrus blossom fragrance.  Very nice smell and feels wonderful on the skin!  Will order this item again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really make my skin feel&lt;br /&gt;soft and supple. It really smells great it really is a good product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the lotion and was glad that I got it thru you. I will order again once out of the bottle</li>
            <li> The Hempz lotion is great stuff, I just wish there was a version that was not so darn fragrant!  The scents are just way too overpowering, and everywhere you go, everyone else is hit with the scent as well.  If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.  I ordered every scent trying to find one that was not so strong and I ran out of scents to buy, and ended up giving them all out as gifts.</li>
            <li> Bought this for Christmas gift for a friend who loves HEMPZ and decided to get one for myself.....I&#x27;m sold!!  Will be buying more when this runs out.  Even use it on my face for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The lotion will sooth and moisturize your skin.  The fragrance will take you to paradise with citrus blossoms filling the air!</li>
            <li> I really love Hempz brand lotions. I like that it&#x27;s light, yet moisturizing and long-lasting. My skin feels so good when I use this stuff. It smells strongly of oranges, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it fades after a while. I probably will purchase a different scent next time. Nothing against Citrus Blossom, but I want to try them all.</li>
            <li> There are several other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of this lotion and they all are great.  These lotions actually sink into your skin and moisturize you all day.  At tanning salons, they sell them for $50, so buy on Amazon for a better price!</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. And the citrus blossom is our favorite scent. It&#x27;s expensive, which makes the container issues more frustrating. Issue #1, it&#x27;s basically impossible to retrieve all the lotion from the container because of the super narrow top, and the pump action straw. You&#x27;d have to cut the container in half and dredge out the lotion, something I actually consider with Hempz because it is expensive and good enough that I don&#x27;t want to waste any.  Issue #2, sometimes the pump action assembly arrives broken / malfunctioning, and once the whole cap was broken. Maybe the last one was a shipping issue, but for something this expensive in relative terms, isn&#x27;t there a better way to deliver the lotion to our skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great skin lotion, and can afford to splurge a little, 5 Stars, get this. If you&#x27;re price-sensitive for these products, and don&#x27;t want the hassle and frustration of container issues, keep shopping.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion to use in the spring/summer. It&#x27;s so lightweight, dries instantly, so you don&#x27;t feel like you are putting clothes on over sticky skin. Yet it keeps the skin moisturized all day long. I really hated the smell of the original Hempz, it was just too sugary sweet for me, but I loved the lotion itself, so I tried the citrus and plum and those are much more mild and pleasant smells with the same great texture and results! Highly recommend it, and you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price!</li>
            <li> This lotion is a new staple at our house.  I am super picky when it comes to scents of lotions so I was happy when I found the Citrus Blossom scented Hempz. I am guessing the others smell great as well and will try a different one next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs really well, and does not leave a greasy texture.  I also feel like the bottle is pretty high quality and the pump will outlast the lotion (nothing is worse than when a pump fails and there is lotion left!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase, can not wait to try a different scent on my next order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Hempz and HempNation brands for the past 5 years and used several bottles. Something is different with this one. It feels more like a gel than an oil emulsion. Not sure if this is a new formula or a fake or I got an old bottle but it is definitely different and not as good. Can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;ve used it an hour later.</li>
            <li> I use this to moisturize after tanning and I love it!! It keeps my skin from drying out and peeling and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Smells good!!</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin, but the scent was not pleasing to me; however some that I know loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this lotion. The scent is great; it smells like Pez. It is a wonderful summer scent that absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated while smelling yummy. I will continue to purchase this product. I may even try a different scent if I get bored with this one!</li>
            <li> I love the Hempz lotions. They smell great, are gluten free, Vegan and not tested on animals. Natural and all feel great on!</li>
            <li> Bottle was busted, lotion was everywhere. Pump doesn&#x27;t work. Nought another bottle that came in the same package from a different company and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for fragrance and moisturizing. Absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. LOVE this scent. I wish they sold just the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the scent stays with you all day, my skin absorbs the moisture and feels refreshed and smooth</li>
            <li> I really like the Hempz lotion line. First picked up a sampler bottle at a spa and have since moved on to this giant container. Such a yummy, creamy citrus smell.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and was shipped very promptly and safely!  A lot more reasonable than buying it from a salon too.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Not greasy or filmy. Very pleasant scent. I would buy this again and again. Good day:)</li>
            <li> Firstly, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. To me it smelled like rotten oranges (but, my daughter loved it, so to each their own). I used it two times a day and noticed a build-up when I bathed. I feel like it coated my skin, but didn&#x27;t truly moisturize. Gave it away and continued my quest for a body lotion I could stand using.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  It smells great and it really makes my dry skin feel great!</li>
            <li> This is fabulous lotion! The scent is perfect.  And such a great deal on it too! I&#x27;ll be ordering more when this is used up!</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, and much cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good, it last for awhile, and the price was great. Less than half the price than at Ulta.</li>
            <li> Hated the scent!  Gave it away and went back to the original one, and now I love it again :)</li>
            <li> Citrus smell just ok. Moisturizer fantastic.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted in a lotion, lve the feel and smell!! Looks great, great for after tanning, love it on my face!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and not as refreshing as some other citrus fragrances around. Not the best citrus fragrance out there. However, it is a pretty good non-sticky moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Hempz Citrus Blossom Herbal Body Moisturizer is a thin, lightweight lotion that applies smoothly and soaks in very quickly.  My dry skin soaks it up like a sponge!  It&#x27;s not quite strong enough for my needs in the winter, but I think that for someone with normal or oily skin this lotion would be a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is wonderful, too.  If you&#x27;re a fan of sweet citrus fragrances, you&#x27;ll definitely like this one.  It reminds me somewhat of orange creamsicles, but the fragrance leans more towards floral than to foodie.</li>
            <li> I have used the original Hempz lotion for years and have always loved it! I was so excited to find out that there were more scents available, so I decided to try the Citrus Blossom.&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to get it and smell it, but the scent was much stronger than I prefer. It&#x27;s an alright smell I guess, but the original is a much calmer and softer smell that I personally like 10 times more than this one. This lotion is also much more runny than the original, and didn&#x27;t seem to soak into my skin like the original does. This leaves more of a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;When I told my husband I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it he said he liked the smell fine, so instead of returning it he is using it up. (So maybe I&#x27;m just too picky)&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Triple Whipped Hempz lotion after trying this and I LOVE it! I recommend that one of you want something thicker that sinks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. It smells a lot like the original too!</li>
            <li> What a great deal!  The small one that fits in your purse is quite expensive.  Love the light citrus scent.  I need to be on a tropical island!</li>
            <li> We recently moved to SW New Mexico - super-dry here - Joe and I absolutely LOVE this lotion - it is rich, creamy, and totally hydrating.  We just ordered 4 bottles.  Thank you very much, HEMPTZ!</li>
            <li> I love this product and in all the scents...great price</li>
            <li> Great smell! Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Arrived quickly and just as shown.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.  The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s not sticky or tacky at all.</li>
            <li> Love Hempz products. Great lotion and moisturizer. Have a bottle in 2 bathrooms, by kitchen sink and my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Hempz lotions. Citrus Blossom is by far my favorite scent. It smells like Pez and I love that it goes on smooth, moisturizes and does not leave any residue behind. Cheaper than what I use to pay at Ulta.</li>
            <li> I order this product in Citrus Blossom , I received Vanilla Plum. I also received an email that Citrus Blossom was being shipped to me, which was very weird considering as I received the package today with the wrong lotion and the email I received  today stated the correct lotion was being shipped to me today... its all very confusing... The lotion got today in the post , I cannot even return because it was damaged and exploded all over the extremely poor packaging. So that product is trash as the packaging of it broke and the lotion needed to be thrown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am guessing someone shipped me the wrong product and the correct product was on back order which is what shipped today according to the email but I cannot even correct their error as their packaging was so poor I cannot return the wrong lotion. Not very pleased with the confusion ... as of now I had to check that I did not get double charged... its all a lot of unnecessary confusion for lotion I know... that is what I thought as well. ... I buy many things off amazon but I do not think I will buy from this seller again...Lets just hope when the proper lotion comes in that it makes it to my door with out being damaged during shipping... lets hope for better shipping packaging.</li>
            <li> Product was as described...love the smell...packaging left a little to be desired..kind of smashed and some of the product leaked out.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz because it&#x27;s not greasy and my skin feel moisturized for a long time after using it. I also think it help&#x27;s keep my tan longer.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Go to fav for my hubby</li>
            <li> AMAZING smell.  Natural ingredients and feels SO smooth.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Came in a pink pump which makes me really girly looking to have it on lotion thought it would be black since the picture is.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells AMAZING and does a very good job at moisturizing my skin. I used it primarily for my hands which have become extremely dry due to using hand sanitizer for work. This lotion has done a good job at re moisturizing my hands, with the great bonus of smelling sooooo good!</li>
            <li> The Citrus Blossom Herbal Body Moisturizer is thick and absorbs well.  Plus it smells heavenly, just like a clementine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..</li>
            <li> I like trying to find lotions that are made out of natural ingredients and that make your skin feel like it&#x27;s able to breath again. It moisturizers ok and ingredients are mostly natural. The smell of this particular one was very pleasant. Ok product.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, excellent job keeping my skin hydrated and its non greasy but the citrus blossom scent is WAY too strong. I definitely have a sensitive sniffer, but even my husband says this is way too much.</li>
            <li> Everyone is always using my lotion because of the citrus smell, but the smell fades after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!! It absorbs into skin quickly and lasts through hand washing.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this at my beauticians office.  I loved the smell so much that I immediately went to amazon and ordered it!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells and works wonderfully!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy another when this one runs low; I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Works really well to heal diabetic legs.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Terrific scent and consistency.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> An exceptional product for your skin. I am 80 years old. I have been using Hempz for years and my skin is in very good shape. I sent my sister (85) a couple of bottles and in just a few days she said her skin changed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I love the smell an is a nice lotion</li>
            <li> My skin became itchy and irritated when i used</li>
            <li> this lotion is great and smells good too!</li>
            <li> The citrus blossom smells so good! It&#x27;s my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> Love Hempz and this scent smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2.5 years now. Love it.</li>
            <li> I ve had trouble with a itchy rash for years. This helped with itching better than meds from the dr. My entire family uses it.I like it so well a gave it for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> Received my bottle of Hempz swiftly (in two days; I&#x27;d like to thank the vendor Since 1901 and Amazon Prime, HAHA!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lotion, I think its performance is like any other brand name lotion. It moisturizes and gets the job done. I like how quickly it absorbs! The Citrus Blossom scent has a slightly artificial scent, but I do appreciate that the citrus aspect of the scent is unmistakable! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong and WILL stay noticeable for quite awhile. This can be a good thing or a bad thing- all dependent on your preferences. I bought this particular scent with the intent to match the quickly warming weather and so I don&#x27;t feel coated in the hot weather from using shea butter like I do in the winter. Though slightly artificial in fragrance, it&#x27;s still a pleasing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion doesn&#x27;t soften me as well as others do which is surprising because there are silicones in the ingredient list. But honestly, all I&#x27;m looking for is quenched skin and the lotion does provide that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars~ Thanks, Hempz!</li>
            <li> This product does not make my skin greasy as so many other lotions do. The smell is moderate but not overpowering. My skin looks and feels much softer after using it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Smells amazing and makes my skin feel so soft. I bought it for the vitamin C and E and it has noticeably improved the texture and tone of my skin after using it just a few weeks. The amount of chemicals in the ingredients was surprising, since this seems to be marketed as a more natural/organic lotion, but its still the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, and that exist IMHO😁!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely moisturinzing without leaving any greasy or oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;It soaks into skin very quickly with minimal rubbing and can get dressed right away with no worry about getting it onto your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it on my face in a pinch and it didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout or to have any oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering a Hempz product. I have dry skin mostly during the winter time and was looking to purchase something that would moisturize my skin and keep it soft during the day without me having to reapply it. The first thing I noticed about this lotion was the smell- I was defintely expecting a better scent. The scent has an artificial sweetness to it that is not satisfying, but it&#x27;s not unbearable. When I apply the lotion, my skin will retain it but for only a few hours and then it feels dry again and I have to apply more. I was really hoping that this lotion would do it for me, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> Smells great works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I needed.  My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a lotion junkie and have tried so many.  This is by far the best lotion I have ever used.  Not greasy, smells great and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I&#x27;m a real lotion woman, it&#x27;s a must have for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the last 40 years, in all price ranges and HEMPZ&#x27;s body moisturizer (lotion) is by far one of my very favorites.  Hempz&#x27;s is one of the least expensive I&#x27;ve used, great savings here on Amazon compared to Ulta.  The first Hempz lotion that I purchased was the citrus blossom, Love this great fragrance, I&#x27;ve now ordered four other fragrance&#x27;s.  Hempz goes on greaseless, leaves your skin  soft and drys so quickly that I can go right back online!  Highly Recommend Hempz!</li>
            <li> I love the Hempz moisturerizers.  The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  Hempz moisturizers are some of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> First time buying already planning on buying more i never finish a bottle of lotion because I have psoriasis and everything ends up irritating my skin but this is amazing AND smells amazing! I&#x27;m only ever able to buy unsented lotion because of my psoriasis but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever...the citrus smells the best, and I can&#x27;t believe how much the stores are charging! 25.00!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sold on Hempz for years, but now I can buy more at a reasonable price through Amazon. This is my favorite scent. I keep a purse-size bottle and refill from the nice 17oz. loader. Lotion works great in dry mountain air.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my friend in Pennsylvania. It is one of a very small list of lotions she can use with her highly sensitive skin, and she loves it! Price is far better than she has been able to find locally, too!</li>
            <li> This smells so delicious. Everyone uses it at work. I just bought it and I&#x27;m already half way through the bottle. It&#x27;s thick, but not really thick, but not thin and runny. It makes my skin feel very soft. And boys love how good I smell, I get compliments all the time and the smell lasts.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really nice. I&#x27;ve used Hempz before and love it. Works very well most of the year but I do tend to need a lot, or something stronger, in the dead of winter. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about this one is the scent. It&#x27;s just not for me. My boyfriend said it reminded him of pez candy or something. It&#x27;s just very, very sweet. I think I just prefer more mellow scents than this but the lotion itself works great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how it hydrates my skin. Very dry winters in the high desert and this has been a life-saver.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!! The smell is amazing &amp; is great for all over body use!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. It works very well for my dry skin in winter time. Fragrance is not the best citrus but it is okay. I will try different fragrance next time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product!  The fragrance is very pleasing and feels very good on my skin.  Gave several for Christmas gifts and the recipients loved this product!</li>
            <li> My fav lotion, and Amazon has it for the best price, gotta love that!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry skin....&lt;br /&gt;and almost half the price from a store</li>
            <li> liked the smell of the vanilla plum best, i bought the combo but liked both of them it helps keep your skins color.</li>
            <li> The lotion was not double sealed and it leaked out of the top and got on some of my other products.</li>
            <li> Works just like the rest of the product. Another great scent to add to the family.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and smells good too. I just love it. Way cheaper on here then in salons, I would buy again</li>
            <li> The citrus is a little overpower, but I love the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite scent! This is so energizing and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for almost a year, and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. I order two at a time so I don&#x27;t run out. It smells like oranges and is very moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin and this lotion doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Love it and will buy more.. It smells so nice and your skin is so soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I have been always hempz lotion for the past couple years, but this was my first purchase of citrus version, it smells great and keeps my skin moisturized, but I have to apply a lot, more than I would with original, I like this way better than the original or vanilla plum</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this lotion! It is light and absorbs quickly. Hempz not only helped my skin not feel or look dry immediately after use but helped resolve my dry skin in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and fresh, if you like Bath and Body Works Peach Citrus you will enjoy this scent (though Hempz isn&#x27;t as strong).&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell! So light but long lasting and summery. The lotion is the best we have used. Lasts a long time. Moisturizes all day and night. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this unless you don&#x27;t like citrus smells or like dry skin....cause again, your skin is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Excellent, best lotion for our very dry skin and love the smell excellent excellent excellent excellent will buy more for sure</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz lotion.  The Lavender Vanilla is the best.  The Citrus Blossom is okay.  I will not buy it again but will buy the Lavender.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lotion at the mall and feel in love with its scent. I am now on my second bottle of this lotion. It smells great and the lotion really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Gave some away for Christmas presents</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!! It is little strong and will stay noticeable for awhile so if you are sensitive to strong smells you may not like this one to much. I love all the Hempz lotions but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fragrants, its to strong ... gives me a headache. I like the moisturizer but not the scent .</li>
            <li> Love it, it smells so good!! My hands and elbows are already softer!! I will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not greasy, but the smell reminds me of candy. It&#x27;s a VERY sweet orange scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a summertime lotion, but in the winter I have to add oil to it since my skin is extremely dry.  Otherwise, it leaves the skin feeling like silk and the smell is great too, not overpowering at all!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing lotion. Subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought several different bottles of HempZ and used them for several months. I developed an allergy that resulted in lots of small bumps and then a bad case of eczema. My dermatologist said that just because a produce is made from a natural substance does not mean it is good. I liked the smell and consistency but cannot use this product.</li>
            <li> BEST hand lotion you can buy!  Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is a new scent for me, but I love it!  Hempz is the best!</li>
            <li> The citrus smell is very very potent. The lotion works wonderful. I love hempz lotions and have used them for years. I swear by their lotions!</li>
            <li> I brought this lotion and I thought it would smell good but nope. It smells so weird.  I wish I brought with different scent :/</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Smells amazing and works great.</li>
            <li> Goes well worth my cologne ..soft fragrance, great lotion!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this lotion. Makes my skin feel silky soft and keeps my tan longer! amazon has the best deal for buying- it usually costs me $23 a bottle at Ulta!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at a TJMaxx and it smells amazing! Yes, the smell is strong but it&#x27;s delightful. Makes my hands so soft. Really enjoy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when this new fragrance came out but I absolutely love it.  I came across it a local salon.  Hempz has always produced a quality lotion and I&#x27;m loving the new scent!  I will continue to buy it and the shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Hempz lotion! For awhile I was using their original scented lotion but decided to be a bit bold and try the citrus blossom one. As expected, my skin feels soft and smells delicious just after one use! To me, it smells just like fruit snacks. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>
            <li> this is a good price on this lotion, it sells for twice this amount in tanning centers</li>
            <li> luv the lotion , bit this time it was delivered and the lotion was  leaking  in the bag... not happy about that</li>
            <li> The lady who does my manicures got me hooked on this lotion...have used for years.  Recently discovered on Amazon.  Great for hands &amp; body both.  Lasts a long time with daily use.  Smells wonderful.  MUCH CHEAPER at Amazon than in local stores.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. great way to moisturize your skin. LOVE the brand. the Pomegranate scent is also amazing.</li>
            <li> Great for summer months, and is true to word with the 12 hours of moisture. Love the smell and the fact that it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The only lotion I will buy!! Love the pomegranate and citrus scents.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not greasy. Absorbs quickly. Good fragrance. Have used this product for a couple of years and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> Great smooth and moisturizer. I am waiting for the one I ordered to be finished to order another one.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful, it smells so good and makes you skin nice and smooth! I will buy again soon!</li>
            <li> Good lotion. It smells so good!!!  We all fight over it &amp; will probably be needing more soon.</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like Pez candy.  Not a fan at ALL.</li>
            <li> This soaks in very fast and leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth. Every time I use it, I get compliments on the scent! It&#x27;s a crisp, refreshing citrus scent that isn&#x27;t strong or artificial-smelling at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I love the smell, got a compliment on how great I smelt the first night I USED IT! :) love IT! I went tanning and used \\&quot;all dolled up\\&quot; with this LOVED the results. My skin is so smooth in just the first use. So happy I finally found a lotion that I can use WHENEVER and get the moisture I want!</li>
            <li> I do not like floral smells.  This is great.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but smell not so great , I think I&#x27;ll stick to the o.g. I wanted to like it but was disappointed when first smelled it. Smells kinda artificial and not as strong and yummy as the original</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion, but the smell can be overbearing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was too strong for me so I gave both bottles away. The silky feel was heavenly, though!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! I love the smell, and my skin is so soft. I would recomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has the most amazing smell EVER. GET IT!</li>
            <li> This cream is not greasy and it absorbs quickly. It leaves your skin silky and smelling great. There are several different fragrances too.</li>
            <li> All the hempz products are great I like this fragrance and them pomegranate one the best....definitely would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love all of Hempz lotions, but this citrus one just smells funky. Almost artificial candy like orange smell. I will stick with all the others besides thsi one in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and this lotion doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy while keeping my hands soft.</li>
            <li> have ordered all the smells! Love them all  and have them through out my home for anyone else to use when they come to my home. also then they ask where I got it and tell them so they can order there own. You are much cheaper than the salons. thank you again and please keep the prices low for me!</li>
            <li> Decided to try something new and wow, very impressed. I&#x27;ve tried various lotions over the years and can&#x27;t remember trying one that literally keeps away the dryness all day and night.  The smell isn&#x27;t over powering and being a guy, you can&#x27;t tell that I have a &#x27;Citrus Blossom&#x27; scent on.  Will definitely keep this in stock from now on at home!</li>
            <li> Its very drying to the skin. Not moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of this one at all.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the speed of the delivery of my lotion it was incredible.  And this lotion is the best in the world if you are used to Hempz products this is even better it seems to make you skin even smoother and it smells great. Thank you again for the speedy service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell!</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma and somewhat durable.  It takes a moment to absorb in, so try an give yourself about 30 between shower/application and dressing, otherwise your clothes stick to you.  If you don&#x27;t shower and apply directly to dry skin, its not so bad, but for ultimate effectiveness, apply immediately after toweling off(pat dry, don&#x27;t scrub dry by the way.  If you scrub dry, you&#x27;ll strip your own natural oils and moisture). I wish that it was more infused with aloe, but for the price and availability, I can&#x27;t really complain.  I rotate with the Hempz Triple Whip, which is also a favorite of mine, familiar yet strange fragrance - don&#x27;t know what it is, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion -- it is the best I have used and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands. It does not feel greasy or sticky and has just the right amount of scent. I have this on my favorites list and have reordered more than once.</li>
            <li> great price this is my favorite and the best offer I could find Great Product</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this lotion. It moisturizes fairly well but doesn&#x27;t stick around too long which is fine if you don&#x27;t have an issue with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It hydrates well, and smells great! I enjoy the other scents as well but not as much as this one.</li>
