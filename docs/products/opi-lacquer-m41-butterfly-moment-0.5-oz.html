            <li>Can&#x27;t return so I&#x27;m not too happy about that.</li>
            <li>Definitely best with shiny top coat over it.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and has great staying power!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s OPI, so it&#x27;s a good quality:</li>
            <li>Polish was in good condition</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous pinky-peachy neutral.  </li>
            <li>I gave it stars because the product itself is good.</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>My favorite color!</li>
            <li>and I guess popular since it was to find.</li>
            <li>But this was wrapped well and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more sparkly, but it still has a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at what a gorgeous color this is!!  </li>
            <li>it is so natural and perfect.</li>
            <li>The shade is gorgeous and the service was great- came early and packaged well as not to crack or spill.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and perfect product</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.  </li>
            <li>and I love the quality.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I used the Sally Hansen Nail Treatment Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend trying out this color. :D</li>
            <li>Color is a lovely shimmery nude.  </li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>I Love it for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on your web site.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a nude</li>
            <li>The color is also pretty opaque so two coats and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great seller, I got this very quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this purchase was definitely a true OPI color and goes on smooth and lasts a long time. :D</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li>The color just saturates my nails so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It looks very shiny after you top it off with a layer of top coat-</li>
            <li>I originally saw it at Ulta, but they were out of this color, so I ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>- I just wanted my nails to look neat and clean.  </li>
            <li>As we all know Lacquer is dull when you apply it to the nails, but with a top coat it is Beautiful color.</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>My daughter likes glitter &amp; unusual colors more than I do.</li>
            <li>This color is absolutely gorgeous but close enough to skin color to disguise breaks or flaws.</li>
            <li>Even though the nail polish was not exactly as I wanted it to be, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It looks fabulous I would really recommend on getting it!</li>
            <li>I would suggest this color for anyone looking for something understated, or who wanted a more natural look while covering nail stains or problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really sexy and classy looking.</li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>The color peels or scrapes right off.</li>
            <li>Mostly for when my nails are short.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault since it got shipped on June 30th, but just be warned that USPS may not get it to you exactly on time.</li>
            <li>As for the nail polish, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>This was my first OPI nail polish</li>
            <li>You can never really go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li>It strikes me as more of a teen color.</li>
            <li>I bring it with me to the pedicure and the first time lasted 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Great color for spring and summer - thick and has staying power.  </li>
            <li>Although I really prefer opi and like the pinks, nudes and nice dark colors...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite color, especially with a summer tan!</li>
            <li>Really like this color - very neutral</li>
            <li>Yet Lavender really femmed it up.</li>
            <li>Also I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for fair/pink skin because it will make your fingers look more pink than ever.</li>
            <li>Very neutral if they is your goal.</li>
            <li>Very lovely for a natural look and has slight amount of iridescence.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>I found a very close Essie color, but since it has no shimmer/glittery stuff at all, it looks flat against my skin and actually stands out more.</li>
            <li>It is a little plain on its own, but is a great color to use with other colors!</li>
            <li>I went for a manicure on my half hour lunch break and chose this color pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It my new go to neutral</li>
            <li>While I do not love the color, I love OPI.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s relatively fast drying and only needs 2 coats.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my 13 yr old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little darker than it appears in the picture and is more pink than peach/tan.</li>
            <li>and I usually wear bold or deeper colors.</li>
            <li>A little too golden for me, especially for my paler skin.</li>

            <li> I usually wear a light pink color, but I was looking for something between beige/ tan and pink.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be anything but ordinary</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Definitely not tan OR pink, but both.</li>
            <li> And have came across other colors that do the same .</li>
            <li> I found a Sally Hansen color that needed 5 coats and took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> The Pink</li>
            <li> This is key for me as I have uneven nail beds.</li>
            <li> but it was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have recently been having trouble with my nails.  </li>
            <li> It wears extremely well.</li>
            <li> I tried it and my skin color was not right for the color.  </li>
            <li> I like lite shades in the spring and summer and dark in the fall and winter</li>
            <li> Sometimes I am convinced that the color has been watered down.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the cold weather or if the nail polish was just old, but it did not go on well at all.  </li>
            <li> The other things it was packaged with was broken..</li>
            <li> Anyways, so I ordered this on Amazon, because it was the cheapest I could since it is usually ridiculously expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> sadly I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for me.</li>
            <li> The color is correct as shown but it will not stay on dull in color too. :(</li>
            <li> This is the worst polish I bought .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect neutral color.</li>
            <li> I love this so much im wearing it now. But i would like for them to deliver at my door we thives here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to stock up because this is the color I&#x27;ve been searching for. The reviews tell you all you need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OPI, so it&#x27;s a good quality: it&#x27;s relatively fast drying and only needs 2 coats. I would suggest this color for anyone looking for something understated, or who wanted a more natural look while covering nail stains or problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a color that blended into my pinkish skin tone. Mostly for when my nails are short. This is it. My husband couldn&#x27;t tell I had nail polish on until I pointed it out (he doesn&#x27;t pay a lot of attention to these things). It does have some shimmer and is opaque so my white nail tips are covered. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of colors for this, and this is the winner. I found a very close Essie color, but since it has no shimmer/glittery stuff at all, it looks flat against my skin and actually stands out more. I found a Sally Hansen color that needed 5 coats and took forever to dry. So, thank you Mariah Carey and OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, I got this very quickly and undamaged. Polish was in good condition and I didn&#x27;t get any bubbles or anything.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color.  It&#x27;s a gorgeous pinky-peachy neutral.  I originally saw it at Ulta, but they were out of this color, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It wears extremely well.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was supposed to arrive sometime between the 7th and the 9th of July, but was not delivered until the 17th. It wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault since it got shipped on June 30th, but just be warned that USPS may not get it to you exactly on time. As for the nail polish, it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, but I still like it. It&#x27;s a little darker than it appears in the picture and is more pink than peach/tan. I was hoping it would be more sparkly, but it still has a nice shimmer. This was my first OPI nail polish and I love the quality. It dries very quickly and has great staying power! The color is also pretty opaque so two coats and you&#x27;re good to go. Even though the nail polish was not exactly as I wanted it to be, I am happy with my purchase. It looks natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> The color and consistency are great.</li>
            <li> Arrived when stated.  Really like this color - very neutral and I guess popular since it was to find.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. You can never really go wrong with OPI. Anyways, so I ordered this on Amazon, because it was the cheapest I could since it is usually ridiculously expensive in stores. I tried this a few days ago and all you need to apply is 1-2 coats because it is very pigmented already. It looks very shiny after you top it off with a layer of top coat- I used the Sally Hansen Nail Treatment Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat. I would definitely recommend trying out this color. :D</li>
            <li> Color is a lovely shimmery nude.  Definitely best with shiny top coat over it.  Great neutral for darker skin tones like mine.  Absolutely perfect for beach and summertime!</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It is neutral enough to go with all color combinations.  The color lasts from manicure to manicure.</li>
            <li> The shade is gorgeous and the service was great- came early and packaged well as not to crack or spill.</li>
            <li> As we all know Lacquer is dull when you apply it to the nails, but with a top coat it is Beautiful color. I Love it for spring and summer. I like lite shades in the spring and summer and dark in the fall and winter, I get a lot of complements when I wear this polish .</li>
            <li> I went for a manicure on my half hour lunch break and chose this color pretty quickly.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be anything but ordinary - I just wanted my nails to look neat and clean.  I was pleasantly surprised at what a gorgeous color this is!!  Really sexy and classy looking.</li>
            <li> I love this color! it is so natural and perfect. It goes with everything and just creates a touch of shine over your nails! It looks fabulous I would really recommend on getting it! You will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I chose it because my friend was wearing it.  It looked beautiful on her.  I tried it and my skin color was not right for the color.  Although ai Like the color it just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> Although I really prefer opi and like the pinks, nudes and nice dark colors... I wasn&#x27;t too fond of this one. It strikes me as more of a teen color. I ended up giving it to my 13 yr old. It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t clump but it just didn&#x27;t look right. Like it couldn&#x27;t decide between glitter or traditional. I like French, reg and even hand painted designs. My daughter likes glitter &amp; unusual colors more than I do. (She was happy to have it.) sadly I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for me. I gave it stars because the product itself is good. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I had searched every where for this nail polished.  I was so glad to find it on your web site.</li>
            <li> A little too golden for me, especially for my paler skin. On someone else it would be pretty...not for me.</li>
            <li> This is the worst polish I bought . The color peels or scrapes right off. And have came across other colors that do the same . Thinking it OPI is having a problem with some colors. The color is correct as shown but it will not stay on dull in color too. :(</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is so feminine. It has a pearling effect. The Pink Yet Lavender really femmed it up. It is a little plain on its own, but is a great color to use with other colors!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and perfect product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite color, especially with a summer tan! It my new go to neutral, it&#x27;s a great color for your summer wardrobe!</li>
            <li> My favorite color! Very lovely for a natural look and has slight amount of iridescence. It also lasts a long time. I bring it with me to the pedicure and the first time lasted 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great color for spring and summer - thick and has staying power.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> While I do not love the color, I love OPI. The color just saturates my nails so smoothly and evenly. This is key for me as I have uneven nail beds.</li>
            <li> Havent used it yet. Just arrived today. But it arrived in one piece..that&#x27;s a start. The other things it was packaged with was broken..glass everywhere..ugh! But this was wrapped well and looks nice. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a nude and I got a copper/pink/mauve metallic.  I&#x27;ll still wear it but it was not what I expected.  Also I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for fair/pink skin because it will make your fingers look more pink than ever.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the cold weather or if the nail polish was just old, but it did not go on well at all.  Disappointe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing OPI for years and I usually wear bold or deeper colors. I have recently been having trouble with my nails.  This color is absolutely gorgeous but close enough to skin color to disguise breaks or flaws. Even if nails are perfect, a gorgeous color for formal events.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a light pink color, but I was looking for something between beige/ tan and pink. This is the perfect &amp;#34;between&amp;#34; shade and I love it! Definitely not tan OR pink, but both. Very neutral if they is your goal. I like OPI, but have had mixed results over the internet. Sometimes I am convinced that the color has been watered down. Anyway, this purchase was definitely a true OPI color and goes on smooth and lasts a long time. :D</li>
            <li> I had the understanding that this polish was part of the liquid sand collection but it is not. Nice color but not what I was hoping for. Can&#x27;t return so I&#x27;m not too happy about that.</li>
