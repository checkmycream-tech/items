            <li>I love the size of the curls as well!</li>
            <li>for the price- amazing.</li>
            <li>I used a friend of mines before buying my own and I fell in love with it.</li>

            <li>Makes gorgeous curls and gets hot quick!</li>
            <li>This is the only iron I have ever found that works great.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is clipless, it heats up quickly, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, and it delivers great curls that last for days!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands and price ranges, and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>110-220v feature is super useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought a curling iron before, but I really like this product and how well it works!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, frizzy hair and this does an excellent job getting a nice big barrel curl.</li>
            <li>i have very fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use especially when I brought to Europe.</li>
            <li>The only issue is the glove doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>Glove is really a shower glove.</li>
            <li>the curls are amazing and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I can curl my whole head in 5 minutes as opposed to 20 with a normal curling iron.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>unless it&#x27;s professionally done- holds this style</li>
            <li>The end is a professional grade wand and heats to professional temps.</li>
            <li>My hair is pin straight fine hair that refuses to curl, but as this curling iron heats up to about 400-450, my hair curls beautifully no problem.</li>
            <li>so while disappointing it was not too surprising.</li>
            <li>I usually brush them out for a soft, wavy look and my fine hair that doesn&#x27;t typically hold</li>

            <li> I am obsessed with this curling wand! I have naturally curly hair and it is a frizzy mess. This is the only iron I have ever found that works great. My hair will actually hold the curl all day without the use of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected it! PERFECT!</li>
            <li> for the price- amazing. i have very fine, long hair. works great for me</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. Keeps the curl all day and I can even sleep with the curls and only have to touch up in the morning, although the curls are looser, but I like it because they are loose beachy waves. My hair is pin straight fine hair that refuses to curl, but as this curling iron heats up to about 400-450, my hair curls beautifully no problem. If you have straight, hard to curl hair, and don&#x27;t want to pay $60 and up, this is the curling iron for you. Just take 1&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34; sections instead of bigger sections so that the heat is applied to every strand. Oh and do watch out not to burn yourself. The glove helps but it annoys me so I don&#x27;t use it, and then of course every once in a while I burn myself when I get careless</li>
            <li> I thought I had to spend upwards of $100 for a good curling wand... After reading these reviews I gave this one a shot. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase!! I can curl my whole head in 5 minutes as opposed to 20 with a normal curling iron. I usually brush them out for a soft, wavy look and my fine hair that doesn&#x27;t typically hold unless it&#x27;s professionally done- holds this style all day!!&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase and looking forward to trying it overseas! (Big plus!)</li>
            <li> its just what my daughter wanted for xmas, a lot of one line shopping is bad on delivery. all shippers are so backed up we are so happy she had this for xmaS</li>
            <li> This wand it&#x27;s amazing at providing smooth, crimpless curls but for the love of skin, do NOT touch the barrel! The glove is only for accidental exposure to the barrel. The end is a professional grade wand and heats to professional temps. My finger strayed onto the barrel and adding for an hour!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have pin straight, hard to curl hair and this gets the job done! Love it</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because it&#x27;s Revlon and not some way expensive brand, but it performs JUST as well as any expensive brand and the curls are amazing and long lasting. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Better than a curling iron!!!</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> Best thing that ever happened to my hair! So glad I purchased this..I even get compliments at the end of the day,</li>
            <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
            <li> Makes gorgeous curls and gets hot quick!</li>
            <li> This made my hair looking like I came from the salon. I made curls and loosened them for a blown out effect.  It lasted two days. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a curling iron before, but I really like this product and how well it works!</li>
            <li> Curls great I love it</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used a friend of mines before buying my own and I fell in love with it. I have long, thick, frizzy hair and this does an excellent job getting a nice big barrel curl.</li>
            <li> My second time buying it. Super easy to use. Great price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. The only issue is the glove doesn&#x27;t fit so I just use it without the glove. Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this iron does not keep my hair curled for more than a few hours. My hair is very hard to curl so while disappointing it was not too surprising.</li>
            <li> Curls my hair perfectly and curls last all day! I love the size of the curls as well! Perfect purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand. I bought 1 for myself then i bought 2 more for my sisters. Easy to use especially when I brought to Europe. 110-220v feature is super useful.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter happy with product</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.  Waste of money. Glove is really a shower glove. Ended up in donation pickup!  Will have to purchase traditional curling iron soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron. I have curly hair and use curling irons all the time for touch ups. I have tried so many brands and price ranges, and this one is by far my favorite. I own 2! It is clipless, it heats up quickly, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, and it delivers great curls that last for days! (Obviously be careful of the barrel and be cautious with your skin/fingers! The glove is useless though.)</li>
