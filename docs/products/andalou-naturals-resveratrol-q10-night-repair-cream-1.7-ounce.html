            <li>while i use a number of great products, since using this item, i have noticed reduction in fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Every Andalou product I have tried has been amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus a great price, not tested on animals, and GMO FREE.</li>
            <li>She quickly recommended this saying that Resveratrol was great for acne.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>Nothing about it is offensive, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most effective.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I looked here on Amazon and found a good price and stocked up.</li>
            <li>/burn free!</li>
            <li>I bought more of this here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li>I also use the Andalou cleansing milk which I love too.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Light and creamy!</li>
            <li>I did not buy this lovely night cream from Amazon, and I paid dearly for that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling or looking greasy, it absorbs leaving a healthy hydrated look and feel.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fruity smell.</li>
            <li>My skin felt silky and wonderful the next day.</li>
            <li>This works much better than many products I have tried at 4 times the price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is an ok moisturizer but have not seen any difference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, don&#x27;t see a difference in better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I am currently using nothing but these wonderful products and refuse to change to anything else!!</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent, like all the Andalou products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not slathering my skin with chemicals any more.</li>
            <li>Love it and use all their products</li>
            <li>The best part is that I&#x27;ve had NO breakouts and the ones from the last cream I was using have cleared.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>No nasty ingredients</li>
            <li>FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will absolutely buy this product again.  </li>
            <li>I have used, I love.</li>
            <li>I love using this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I will not be able to use it if this continues.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received this product.  </li>
            <li>Love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>There is something really great about it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like overly aromatic creams on my face, and this just has a nice fresh scent that I can handle.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Such a good value, too!</li>
            <li>Either way, my jar was runny and watery - not the rich, creamy moisturizer that I&#x27;d come to love.</li>
            <li>Because I am 1/8th Hungarian, I have a very very quick growing beard.</li>
            <li>Without all the fuss, this is the absolute best product I&#x27;ve used on my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was trying different night creams (when I ran out of Germaine de Capuccini Hydracure that worked beautifully for my skin), and this Andalou Naturals Resveratrol Q10 Night Repair Cream is one of the bunch</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly, absorbs easily, it is non-greasy and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it has helped some fine lines and makes my skin feel smooth and look brighter.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic night cream.</li>
            <li>light, not greasy.</li>
            <li>my skin looks great and people think I&#x27;m much younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>The light cocoa smell is yummy, too.</li>
            <li>ALL NATURAL...goes on smooth</li>
            <li>There is no annoying smell.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, light citrus smell.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and it goes on light.  </li>
            <li>so I have good skin despite never haven spent more than $30 on any skincare cream (snicker).</li>
            <li>Great for aging dry, thinning skin</li>
            <li>I used to have to use medicated creams for my perioral dermatitis, but I switched to all natural and vegan soaps and this lotion, and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe I exaggerate a bit, but she is very picky on the lotions that she uses on her face, and she swears by this product.</li>
            <li>Loved this night cream - had purchased it several times!</li>
            <li>the skin feels nice and soft after applying the cream.  </li>
            <li>Double good.</li>
            <li>I read that a person who had rosacea liked it, so I ordered it as I have Rosacea and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Like sweet chocolate, but it quickly dissipates and does not interfare with my perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the rich creaminess, and how soft my skin feels after applying.</li>
            <li>and it absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and react to a lot of the funky altered ingredients in most products.</li>
            <li>worth giving it a try and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles</li>
            <li>But the product is worth it, at this point.</li>
            <li>so I must have thought it was okay the first time, but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for a night cream for me.</li>
            <li>for little money and a good result.</li>
            <li>Just to be funny</li>
            <li>the real winner here is me!</li>
            <li>Really hydrating!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the night repair cream.</li>
            <li>warning:  will want to use it generously -  skin will be soft, never greasy, lightweight, great for sensitive and combination skin, gentle organic fragrance - yet use it sparingly so it will last forever.</li>
            <li>(where I can look at it before purchasing) and see what I get.&lt;br /&gt;***I checked at Whole Foods (12/16) and the sample jar they had was also runny and not the same cream that I had come to love.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like most products (even natural ones) do.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as thick as what I&#x27;ve used before but the more I use it the more I like it.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how very fast it absorbs too, knowing that I tend to use a bit too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough on skin, but I use this cream day and night - it works great.</li>
            <li>I was at Whole Foods one day and asked an expert to recommend a product for my wife.</li>
            <li>I buy it for her on Amazon because I can get it so much cheaper than I can at retail stores.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it is a formula change</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fussy about my creams.</li>
            <li>It is a light enough formula for me to wear to bed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>smooth, slightly cooling, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>In terms of making my face look/feel better, not as much as other products I&#x27;ve used like Derma-E.</li>
            <li>Ok, not 100% but like at least 80% better then the last 15 years of shaving!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes dry skin well, yet feels light.  </li>
            <li>She likes it even better than the more expensive lotions that claim to defy gravity.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product based on her wholehearted approval of it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bouncing back between so many different creams as my skin is very sensitive (prone to breakouts/allergic reactions/hives).</li>
            <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or react badly with my skin in any way (combination skin), makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>like I normally do, got out of the shower</li>
            <li>I will only be able to see result long term since i&#x27;m using it as repair and preventative.</li>
            <li>FINALLY, a cream worth</li>
            <li>And normally nothing makes me break out or anything.</li>
            <li>cream feels very light and silky to touch, like very fluffy ice cream.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds funny, but I have had a constant razor rash on my neck for 15 years!</li>
            <li>and I will most likely look on here for my re-order, once I run out of all the other moisturizers in my drawer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many in the past that were heavier and made it feel like I was wearing a mask.  </li>
            <li>everything I&#x27;ve used in the past has irritated my skin, but this night repair cream regenerates my skin, restores moisture without greasiness, and gives me a clean and clear glow...and it only takes a light dab or two from the bottle each night.  </li>
            <li>Not my face, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand overall.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and not heavy or &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>or if it just sat in a hot mail truck too long.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and believe I have used every cream there is in the market that promises to help your skin....</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mean what is there not to love?</li>
            <li>It has helped my sensitive, dry and red face so much.</li>
            <li>Everything from the high end, to the low end, the all natural, the organic, every single mens only line of products...</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local organic grocery store, it was far more expensive than what I see on here.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert (AZ) and the weather is usually very dry.</li>

            <li> But the product is worth it, at this point.</li>
            <li> so I must have thought it was okay the first time, but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for a night cream for me.</li>
            <li> for little money and a good result.</li>
            <li> Just to be funny</li>
            <li> the real winner here is me!</li>
            <li> Really hydrating!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the night repair cream.</li>
            <li> warning:  will want to use it generously -  skin will be soft, never greasy, lightweight, great for sensitive and combination skin, gentle organic fragrance - yet use it sparingly so it will last forever.</li>
            <li> (where I can look at it before purchasing) and see what I get.&lt;br /&gt;***I checked at Whole Foods (12/16) and the sample jar they had was also runny and not the same cream that I had come to love.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like most products (even natural ones) do.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick as what I&#x27;ve used before but the more I use it the more I like it.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how very fast it absorbs too, knowing that I tend to use a bit too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough on skin, but I use this cream day and night - it works great.</li>
            <li> I was at Whole Foods one day and asked an expert to recommend a product for my wife.</li>
            <li> I buy it for her on Amazon because I can get it so much cheaper than I can at retail stores.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it is a formula change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fussy about my creams.</li>
            <li> It is a light enough formula for me to wear to bed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> smooth, slightly cooling, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> In terms of making my face look/feel better, not as much as other products I&#x27;ve used like Derma-E.</li>
            <li> Ok, not 100% but like at least 80% better then the last 15 years of shaving!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes dry skin well, yet feels light.  </li>
            <li> She likes it even better than the more expensive lotions that claim to defy gravity.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product based on her wholehearted approval of it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bouncing back between so many different creams as my skin is very sensitive (prone to breakouts/allergic reactions/hives).</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or react badly with my skin in any way (combination skin), makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> like I normally do, got out of the shower</li>
            <li> I will only be able to see result long term since i&#x27;m using it as repair and preventative.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, a cream worth</li>
            <li> And normally nothing makes me break out or anything.</li>
            <li> cream feels very light and silky to touch, like very fluffy ice cream.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds funny, but I have had a constant razor rash on my neck for 15 years!</li>
            <li> and I will most likely look on here for my re-order, once I run out of all the other moisturizers in my drawer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many in the past that were heavier and made it feel like I was wearing a mask.  </li>
            <li> everything I&#x27;ve used in the past has irritated my skin, but this night repair cream regenerates my skin, restores moisture without greasiness, and gives me a clean and clear glow...and it only takes a light dab or two from the bottle each night.  </li>
            <li> Not my face, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand overall.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and not heavy or &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> or if it just sat in a hot mail truck too long.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and believe I have used every cream there is in the market that promises to help your skin....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I mean what is there not to love?</li>
            <li> It has helped my sensitive, dry and red face so much.</li>
            <li> Everything from the high end, to the low end, the all natural, the organic, every single mens only line of products...</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local organic grocery store, it was far more expensive than what I see on here.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert (AZ) and the weather is usually very dry.</li>
            <li> Black African / Oily to Normal to Tretinoin</li>
            <li> I had let my beard grow a little bit, normally I shave twice a week.</li>
            <li> Far less redness and</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t handle scents, or else I sneeze all day long</li>
            <li> Love this line, i am so obsessed i want to try all the creams in this line!</li>
            <li> Last night it made my face sting a little.  </li>
            <li> The jury is still out, but I do feel like my face looks more youthful and moisturized when I get up in the morning than when I was using proactiv (which I also thought smelled bad).  </li>
            <li> The cream was thick but not heavy on my face</li>
            <li> Have used lots of other brands, although nothing obnoxiously overpriced like some women buy.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as other products.</li>
            <li> My most recent purchase of this night cream from Amazon (9/16) was awful and I returned it!</li>
            <li> have previous buying of this brand.</li>
            <li> dried out skin.</li>
            <li> However, would not recommend this for oily skin, as it would probably be too heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I waited too late to return this product.  </li>
            <li> No more break outs!</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin survive the cold, dry winter.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re 40 something and people (men and women) are confusing you for a 20 something (on looks not behavior!)</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle and does not disturb eyes/nose.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so thick, with its heavy aloe base</li>
            <li> (I always shave in the shower, if you are not doing this then you are doing it wrong my friend) and looked at my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to get used to the faint smell</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for another night cream :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> If this continues, I will be very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have been cursed with horrible razor rash</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best eye cream/moisturizer that won&#x27;t burn your eyes!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and it&#x27;s just OK. I am not going to buy Andalou products again. They just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I am a guy. I start with that so that you will all learn from my experience with this product. My wife was on a mission to find a product that would help with her facial acne and redness. I was at Whole Foods one day and asked an expert to recommend a product for my wife. She quickly recommended this saying that Resveratrol was great for acne. I bought it on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also tell you that I myself am a product junkie. Every since I was in my 20&#x27;s I have been cursed with horrible razor rash / burn on my neck after I shave. Because I am 1/8th Hungarian, I have a very very quick growing beard. I am always on the lookout for a product that will cure this. And trust me when I say I have tried every-single-product out there. Everything from the high end, to the low end, the all natural, the organic, every single mens only line of products... I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I come home with this. I tell my wife to put it on her face before we go to bed. Just to be funny I also applied it to my neck, jokingly saying, &amp;#34;Hey what if this product actually works?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did this together for a week, each night applying the cream, her to her face and me to my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I shaved. I had let my beard grow a little bit, normally I shave twice a week. I shaved like I normally do, got out of the shower (I always shave in the shower, if you are not doing this then you are doing it wrong my friend) and looked at my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck was razor rash/burn free! Ok, not 100% but like at least 80% better then the last 15 years of shaving! I was astonished! I had actually found a product that worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife you ask? How was her redness and acne. Well, she got results too. Far less redness and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real winner here is me! I not longer have razor burn. I bought more of this here on Amazon. I use it every night on my neck. My neck looks so much more attractive... I know that sounds funny, but I have had a constant razor rash on my neck for 15 years! NOW IT&#x27;S GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this for any guy suffering from the same affliction as me. Trust me!ad a constant razor rash on my neck for 15 years! NOW IT&#x27;S GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this for any guy suffering from the same affliction as me. Trust me!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I use it on my neck and my chest. Not my face, I have sensitive skin. Some of the ingredients dont react well with my skin (Face), causing my pores to clog. I will only be able to see result long term since i&#x27;m using it as repair and preventative. I really like this brand overall.</li>
            <li> for little money and a good result.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this. Have used lots of other brands, although nothing obnoxiously overpriced like some women buy. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s but am mistaken for my 30&#x27;s all the time so I have good skin despite never haven spent more than $30 on any skincare cream (snicker). I switched to this after buying it on sale at a local store. Loved it so much I looked here on Amazon and found a good price and stocked up. I love the smell, the rich creaminess, and how soft my skin feels after applying. My skin looks good too. I also use the Andalou cleansing milk which I love too. This is now my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this stuff. I buy it for her on Amazon because I can get it so much cheaper than I can at retail stores. Though she is almost 50, she looks like she is 20 ever since she started using this stuff. Okay, maybe I exaggerate a bit, but she is very picky on the lotions that she uses on her face, and she swears by this product. She likes it even better than the more expensive lotions that claim to defy gravity. I highly recommend this product based on her wholehearted approval of it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic night cream. It is moisturizing and not heavy or &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;. I have been using it for almost a year and plan to continue doing so. Such a good value, too! Every Andalou product I have tried has been amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this. Light and creamy! I will put it on in the mornings just for a refreshing feel!</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> warning:  will want to use it generously -  skin will be soft, never greasy, lightweight, great for sensitive and combination skin, gentle organic fragrance - yet use it sparingly so it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Loved this night cream - had purchased it several times! I don&#x27;t like overly aromatic creams on my face, and this just has a nice fresh scent that I can handle. But...read below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** My most recent purchase of this night cream from Amazon (9/16) was awful and I returned it! I really don&#x27;t know if it is a formula change or if it just sat in a hot mail truck too long. Either way, my jar was runny and watery - not the rich, creamy moisturizer that I&#x27;d come to love. I am so disappointed. I am going to try it locally (where I can look at it before purchasing) and see what I get.&lt;br /&gt;***I checked at Whole Foods (12/16) and the sample jar they had was also runny and not the same cream that I had come to love. I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for another night cream :(</li>
            <li> I did not buy this lovely night cream from Amazon, and I paid dearly for that. I was trying different night creams (when I ran out of Germaine de Capuccini Hydracure that worked beautifully for my skin), and this Andalou Naturals Resveratrol Q10 Night Repair Cream is one of the bunch I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels very light and silky to touch, like very fluffy ice cream. I am amazed at how very fast it absorbs too, knowing that I tend to use a bit too much. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling or looking greasy, it absorbs leaving a healthy hydrated look and feel. I wear the moisturizer during the day as well, and I do not need to reapply it. My face stays hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is divine. Like sweet chocolate, but it quickly dissipates and does not interfare with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite affordable here on Amazon and I will most likely look on here for my re-order, once I run out of all the other moisturizers in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;35+ Black African / Oily to Normal to Tretinoin dried out skin.</li>
            <li> Really hydrating!  I was expecting to have to put a separate moisturizer on at night, but with this it&#x27;s not needed</li>
            <li> the skin feels nice and soft after applying the cream.  It has a nice light fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but after using this one night I had to share how much I loved it. My skin felt silky and wonderful the next day. This works much better than many products I have tried at 4 times the price. Would highly recommend. However, would not recommend this for oily skin, as it would probably be too heavy</li>
            <li> I use it for daytime for moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t burn and keeps my skin&#x27;s elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;I use something with retinol 3-4 times a week for night recovery</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and am always happy with it ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fussy about my creams. I have sensitive skin and react to a lot of the funky altered ingredients in most products. This cream smells DELICIOUS!!! Totally keeps my face hydrated at night and is working wonders on the anti-aging. When you&#x27;re 40 something and people (men and women) are confusing you for a 20 something (on looks not behavior!), you know you&#x27;re number one face cream is doing an awesome job. LOVE THIS CREAM!!!</li>
            <li> smooth, slightly cooling, absorbs quickly. light, not greasy. while i use a number of great products, since using this item, i have noticed reduction in fine lines around the eyes. bottom line, smells &amp; feels good, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I live in the desert (AZ) and the weather is usually very dry. It&#x27;s tough on skin, but I use this cream day and night - it works great. It makes my skin so soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like most products (even natural ones) do. There is something really great about it for sensitive skin. I will continue to buy and love the price of this!</li>
            <li> I waited too late to return this product.  It is horrible.  I saw a review that stated the wax issue.  Wish I would have reconsidered the purchase.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.....not unless you like that waxy feeling!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this product.  I love the smell and it is an ok moisturizer but have not seen any difference&lt;br /&gt;in my skin.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a light enough formula for me to wear to bed.  I&#x27;ve tried many in the past that were heavier and made it feel like I was wearing a mask.  Then I would get over heated.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and believe I have used every cream there is in the market that promises to help your skin....this product delivers much better than any expensive product I&#x27;ve used.  Give it a try and continue using to see great results....my skin looks great and people think I&#x27;m much younger than I am.  I use it sometimes both day and night;  worth giving it a try and the price is amazing for the great ingredients.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, don&#x27;t see a difference in better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am currently using nothing but these wonderful products and refuse to change to anything else!! These products took 20 years off my face!! I am 63 and look 43!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teri Rader</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the night repair cream. It has a lovely scent, like all the Andalou products. The cream was thick but not heavy on my face and it absorbed quickly. I&#x27;ve noticed it has helped some fine lines and makes my skin feel smooth and look brighter. I used to use Mychelle lotions and serums but have switched over to Andalou and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Good. Good. Double good.</li>
            <li> Wish it didnt have soy. Soy was created as a glue and causes cancer.</li>
            <li> Use this product day or night. I have sensitive skin. Does not break out my skin. You do t need to use alot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this cream twice so I must have thought it was okay the first time, but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for a night cream for me.</li>
            <li> In getting rid of my longtime Procter &amp; Gamble cosmetics, I switched to this cream based on the reviews. It isn&#x27;t as thick as what I&#x27;ve used before but the more I use it the more I like it.  I&#x27;ve had to get used to the faint smell but it&#x27;s getting easier to ignore. I like that I&#x27;m not slathering my skin with chemicals any more.</li>
            <li> Use it every night . Love it and use all their products</li>
            <li> FINALLY, a cream worth it&#x27;s weight! I&#x27;ve been bouncing back between so many different creams as my skin is very sensitive (prone to breakouts/allergic reactions/hives). I also can&#x27;t handle scents, or else I sneeze all day long and it makes my eyes water. I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks now and each morning I wake up with dewy, glowing skin! The best part is that I&#x27;ve had NO breakouts and the ones from the last cream I was using have cleared. The scent is very subtle and does not disturb eyes/nose. Non-greasy too and works perfect under my makeup. I bought this at my local organic grocery store, it was far more expensive than what I see on here. I&#x27;ll be buying from Amazon from now on. Yay!</li>
            <li> Without all the fuss, this is the absolute best product I&#x27;ve used on my extremely sensitive skin.  I have rosacea and everything I&#x27;ve used in the past has irritated my skin, but this night repair cream regenerates my skin, restores moisture without greasiness, and gives me a clean and clear glow...and it only takes a light dab or two from the bottle each night.  The light cocoa smell is yummy, too.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. I use it day and night. I used to have to use medicated creams for my perioral dermatitis, but I switched to all natural and vegan soaps and this lotion, and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or react badly with my skin in any way (combination skin), makes my skin feel soft and smooth. No nasty ingredients</li>
            <li> GREAT SMELL..ALL NATURAL...goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Love this line, i am so obsessed i want to try all the creams in this line! It soaks in and actually dirs what it claims plus its non gmo.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  No more break outs!</li>
            <li> FABULOUS!  This cream is wonderful!  It moisturizes dry skin well, yet feels light.  There is no annoying smell. I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out, but I do feel like my face looks more youthful and moisturized when I get up in the morning than when I was using proactiv (which I also thought smelled bad).  I&#x27;m in my early 40s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles so I didn&#x27;t buy this looking for a miracle fix for some problem.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will absolutely buy this product again.  And, as a bonus, they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> Every product by Andaou I have used, I love. I would recommend to friends and I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, absorbs easily, it is non-greasy and it smells fantastic. My skin feels hydrated in the morning as well, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I love using this product. It has helped my sensitive, dry and red face so much. Wish it came in a larger container though. And the price has increased a lot in the last 3 months. But the product is worth it, at this point.</li>
            <li> My skin is breaking out. I had really good skin and never was like this before. I hate this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pleasant. Smells good, feels good, made of all sorts of warm, fuzzy stuff from nature. In terms of making my face look/feel better, not as much as other products I&#x27;ve used like Derma-E. I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so thick, with its heavy aloe base, it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as other products. Nothing about it is offensive, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most effective.</li>
            <li> It came and all is well.  thank you</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great for aging dry, thinning skin</li>
            <li> have previous buying of this brand. Love it. You won&#x27;t waste your money. Not greasy, light citrus smell. love it.Plus a great price, not tested on animals, and GMO FREE.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It has helped my skin survive the cold, dry winter.</li>
            <li> (Something keeps happening to my review.)  I read that a person who had rosacea liked it, so I ordered it as I have Rosacea and sensitive skin.  Last night it made my face sting a little.  If this continues, I will be very disappointed.  I will not be able to use it if this continues.  Paid $25 including postage.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. My skin drinks it!  It is not greasy, and it goes on light.  I see improvement in my skin.  I recommend this product line</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it. I mean what is there not to love? However, it makes me get these bumps on my face. Not a break-out but bumpy boils. I don&#x27;t know what else to call it. And normally nothing makes me break out or anything.</li>
