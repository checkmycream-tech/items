    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I began using cermide time capsuls about 4 months ago and have been nothing but impressed.</li>
            <li>As always this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li>Great Product-</li>
            <li>This seems to work as a good night treatment for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Looks like this is the best deal for large Qty.  </li>
            <li>This, however, is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Nothing helps, I&#x27;ve tried most creams, etc.</li>
            <li>and I can say that the Ceramide capsules moisturizes    my face better than any of the creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>I would still recommend spending the money on the gold capsules, because they are lovely.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast service</li>
            <li>it soak in thoroughly before applying cream on top</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older and you haven&#x27;t used lotions in your life, these might hydrate you very nicely.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>it absorbs in about 10    minutes without leaving any oily feeling...and I can either wear    make-up or not and feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and find that it is very helpful for the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li>it is what I am looking for, I use it every time after wishing face,  makes me feel fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li>so sometimes it&#x27;s better not to skimp on the real thing</li>
            <li>I cleared up a skin condition on my right index finger i had had for years.  </li>
            <li>The drugstore products work pretty well, but for some patients who want an upscale department store product that feels like a nightly \\&quot;treat,\\&quot; this product is the one.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my pores are smaller and my skin is moist, my powder foundation goes on beutifully.  </li>
            <li>and they smell of chip fat when using one of the caps it made my skin hot and sore to touch</li>
            <li>And easy to open.</li>
            <li>and I have moisturized my face my whole life, so</li>
            <li>Im very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I have been using Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Time Capsules for face and throat for a few years and love this product.  </li>
            <li>These moisturize nicely but the capsules are pretty hard to open.</li>
            <li>I like this capsule to use and no problem I even had so far.</li>
            <li>I am 74 and find that this product keeps my skin young.</li>
            <li>She told me it should be soft.</li>
            <li>I think this product she got was must be old or expired.</li>
            <li>Old product.</li>
            <li>so I knew this was an old product which is why it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>These are not the real thing,I have Elizabeth Arden caps and the ones I just purchased from here are a different colour</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and last all day.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This seems to work as a good night treatment for my skin.  Do not wake up with my face feeling dry and pulled.</li>
            <li> I have the driest skin ever. Nothing helps, I&#x27;ve tried most creams, etc. This, however, is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my skin so soft and last all day.</li>
            <li> Looks like this is the best deal for large Qty.  But i am confused from the photo. It is one container with 90 capsules or 3x30, total is 90?  Does any one can help me on that?</li>
            <li> Ceramide moisturer works well on my skin....it absorbs in about 10    minutes without leaving any oily feeling...and I can either wear    make-up or not and feel comfortable.  I had laser work done on my    face for Rosacea and I can say that the Ceramide capsules moisturizes    my face better than any of the creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I run an acne clinic, and I recommend ceramide moisturizers to almost every patient. The drugstore products work pretty well, but for some patients who want an upscale department store product that feels like a nightly \\&quot;treat,\\&quot; this product is the one.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Time Capsules for face and throat for a few years and love this product.  The area around my eyes is very dry, so I thought I would order the Ceramide Time Capsules for eyes.  Although this product stated \\&quot;eyes\\&quot; in the description, it is not for eyes, it is for face and throat. After further research, it seems the time capsules for the eyes is a different colour capsule.</li>
            <li> I began using cermide time capsuls about 4 months ago and have been nothing but impressed. I use it twice a day on my face, throat and yes hands.  I cleared up a skin condition on my right index finger i had had for years.  Fluke or not it worked.  I love this product, my pores are smaller and my skin is moist, my powder foundation goes on beutifully.  try it.</li>
            <li> These moisturize nicely but the capsules are pretty hard to open. I&#x27;m only 36 and I have moisturized my face my whole life, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to look too much different. If you&#x27;re older and you haven&#x27;t used lotions in your life, these might hydrate you very nicely. I would still recommend spending the money on the gold capsules, because they are lovely. And easy to open.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes entire face when I use it at nighttime. I like this capsule to use and no problem I even had so far.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service</li>
            <li> As always this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> Great Product- Not so well known but been around and proven for years!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product- Not so well known but been and proven for years!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and find that it is very helpful for the skin around your eyes. I am 74 and find that this product keeps my skin young.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother last year. And I recently heard from her that the capsule was very hard like a stone and she dumped it into trash. She told me it should be soft. I think this product she got was must be old or expired.</li>
            <li> These capsules seem to be watered down. Consistency of fluid is not as thick, and use of the product does not show same effects as store bought product.</li>
            <li> Old product. They made pink capsules years ago. They are gold now so I knew this was an old product which is why it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I use only at night with a cream on top&lt;br /&gt;Let it soak in thoroughly before applying cream on top</li>
            <li> it is what I am looking for, I use it every time after wishing face,  makes me feel fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eliz Arden products for quite some time ... I have very dry skin and this product makes my face feel moisturized all day long!</li>
