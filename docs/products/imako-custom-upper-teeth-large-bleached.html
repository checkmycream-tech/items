            <li>this product is cheap and does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>I watched the video on YouTube on how to fit them.</li>
            <li>Are they a great temporary fix while you save up the money to get the actual dental procedure you need done?</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to custom fit and way better then secrets file</li>
            <li>I found exceptionally rich was the paragraph in the instructions about reducing staining that says</li>
            <li>but thought this would be better as an overall, honest, and &#x27;what the hell are these things?&#x27;</li>

            <li>follow with the cool water to set.</li>
            <li>wonderful  - if you don&#x27;t burst into flames you can enjoy having ill fitting, horrendous looking tooth decals coated with toxic NAIL POLISH swimming around your mouth.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, once you get them to fit the way they should!</li>
            <li>every time you have a hot drink you can repeat this action without notice and maintain a good seal &#x27;tween the imakos and what you</li>
            <li>every time you have a hot drink you can repeat this action without notice and maintain a good seal &#x27;tween the imakos and what you</li>
            <li>It takes quite a bit of time and refitting to get them to fit right and stay in place.</li>
            <li>( they were to big my fault not the companies) but he has a gorgeous smile now.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S AN EMBARASSEMENT AND CAUSES LACK OF FAITH IN AMAZON&#x27;S LOYAL CUSTOMERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, super speedy shipping.</li>
            <li>, i got the first set to fit</li>
            <li>For 2 reasons: first, they are the easiest to fit.</li>
            <li>a bowl of cool (not cold) water.and some hot-ish water.</li>
            <li>a bowl of cool (not cold) water.and some hot-ish water.</li>
            <li>These fit very well.</li>
            <li>that folks is nothing to smile about.</li>
            <li>AND IF YOU SMILE YOU LOOK LIKE MR.</li>
            <li>I have had loads of fun with them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get them right on the first try, don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li>Yes, I refit them several times in warm water, but I still can&#x27;t get them just right to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>[...]  it is a very nice site and will answer ALL your questions with a few clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right canine.</li>
            <li>have one set (the ones i have in right now) for home.</li>

            <li>till you get it right.</li>
            <li>novelty is right.</li>
            <li>.Conventional dentistry, with a full upper denture, may be a better solution.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As if having to boil these choppers, mold them to your teeth without scalding your mouth isn&#x27;t enough -The founder who is not a dentist but plays one in the how to apply video advises you not to ever drink , eat, expose to sunlight as they stain so very easily - and  to expect to have difficulty talking to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made sure to measure my teeth before ordering (I kinda resent the horse teeth reviews I&#x27;ve seen, my natural teeth are large</li>
            <li>Natural color s whiter than my own natural color</li>
            <li>now, i get it right pretty much first time, every time.</li>
            <li>now, i get it right pretty much first time, every time.</li>
            <li>The teeth are made from some form of plastic and are very, very porous.  </li>
            <li>The Imako teeth looks very real and I am planning to order another pair.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable.</li>
            <li>the large size barely covers mine, so take your time when fitting</li>
            <li>/&gt;i first came across these via a google search of &#x27;cosmetic teeth&#x27; (as i was about to be homeless, my teeth were a WRECK</li>
            <li>you get your first set.</li>
            <li>you simply reheat them and smoosh the fitting material around and try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you are gonna give up after the first try.</li>

            <li>is more, I can see Imako press on, nail polish coated teeth preventing people from seeking out proper dental and periodontal</li>
            <li>Thanks imako!</li>
            <li>where did you get them done!&amp;#34; hahaha!</li>
            <li>We did have a few good laughs trying them on.</li>
            <li>I also had to customize it by filing down the gums to fit me better</li>
            <li>(&#x27;cept for soft stuff like oatmeal, ice cream, yogurt, applesauce and stuff like that...and even then you will want to clean them asap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>get your hot water ready.</li>

            <li>i moved to the &#x27;large&#x27; as they were easier to fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i learned i need a large.</li>
            <li>these are designed to stay in place with pure &#x27;mechanics&#x27; they grab your existing teeth and gums and snap into place.</li>

            <li>and heat your imakos till ONLY the OUTER layer of the fitting material is soft.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...brought life back to smile without major dental work.</li>
            <li>I used the YOU-tube videos to do the EXACT procedure they tell me to do, and still I had NO SUCCESS at all in getting them to fit in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do wear a tiny bit of adhesive with them, just to feel extra safe.</li>
            <li>But I got these today and they far surpassed my expectations!!</li>

            <li>then swish the cool water with the same action.</li>
            <li>, if your hesitating on buying this item...DO NOT I HAVE MY SMILE BACK!!!!</li>
            <li>the first set i got was &#x27;small&#x27; and still looked fine.</li>
            <li>We are going to buy a new set again here soon.</li>
            <li>and another set fit to the same dimensions for &#x27;public presentation&#x27; the home set to &#x27;hold&#x27; the contours of my gums,</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Not real easy to fit or wear though.  </li>
            <li>i got my first set from a third party as stated.</li>
            <li>Second They are the most comfortable, thin design, for looks.</li>
            <li>its cheaply made and not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I only wish there could a little space between the front teeth for an even more realistic effect.</li>
            <li>I have bought several of these with one problem: they yellow, and rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I now have confidence to go back out in the social world and not be so conscious about my smile..  </li>
            <li>the Imako teeth with clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>you went to far.</li>
            <li>you went to far.</li>
            <li>i say &#x27;patience young padawa&#x27;</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME  </li>
            <li>A punch out of paper thin plastic that looks exactly like cheap press on stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m not one to usually write reviews, but since the positive reviews were what made me make my decision, i figured mine could help someone as well.</li>
            <li>I mean if you have no teeth , they perhaps would be better then nothing, but those poor people would probably be better off just using an orange rind</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have recently got a new set, and this is what i plan to do...</li>
            <li>(even if it takes a few or more tries) when you think you have them set.</li>
            <li>(even if it takes a few or more tries) when you think you have them set.</li>
            <li>They are thin but that helps them feel more natural is what he says.</li>
            <li>Plus the gum color is gross-my gums are deep pink, the gums on these when you receive them are like some 80 year old&#x27;s dentures- light pink, like there is a layer of plaque covering them.  </li>
            <li>They can be difficult to fit, as I have very large teeth &amp;</li>
            <li>makes you look like you  have huge thick teeth , almost like buck teeth.</li>
            <li>They look great &amp; now that I&#x27;ve spent some time dealing with them, I notice the amount of contrived smiles in public.</li>
            <li>Bought 2nd set, bleached ones, &amp; used the clear nail polish/lighter method to try to keep them from staining.  </li>
            <li>This 3rd set, I&#x27;ve done the clear nail polish/lighter w/3 coats of polish/lighter after each application.  </li>
            <li>swish the hot-ish (dont burn yourself) with the same action.</li>
            <li>swish the hot-ish (dont burn yourself) with the same action.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue purchasing these as needed until that&#x27;s complete.</li>
            <li>when im out eating, since I&#x27;m used to chewing with my back teeth anyways, i don&#x27;t recommend eating directly with the imakos.</li>
            <li>but it really only last&#x27;s one month, I have to keep buying a new one every month ,as no matter what I do to keep them &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li>if you mess up on the first try...reheat and do it again.</li>
            <li>if you mess up on the first try...reheat and do it again.</li>
            <li>I bought him a pair of the natural ones in the smaller size and myself a pair of the larger ones ( being I am 5 ft 9</li>
            <li>and if you take your time and fit them right you will NOT look like a donkey, or a scary bunny, or any of the other comparisons ive read here.</li>

            <li>not good for crooked teeth, ok for temp solution until partial comes in.</li>
            <li>very hard to install and fit is terriable.  </li>

            <li> Pretty easy to custom fit and way better then secrets file</li>
            <li> I found exceptionally rich was the paragraph in the instructions about reducing staining that says</li>

            <li> wonderful  - if you don&#x27;t burst into flames you can enjoy having ill fitting, horrendous looking tooth decals coated with toxic NAIL POLISH swimming around your mouth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, once you get them to fit the way they should!</li>

            <li> It takes quite a bit of time and refitting to get them to fit right and stay in place.</li>

            <li> , i got the first set to fit</li>
            <li> For 2 reasons: first, they are the easiest to fit.</li>

            <li> AND IF YOU SMILE YOU LOOK LIKE MR.</li>
            <li> I have had loads of fun with them.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get them right on the first try, don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> Yes, I refit them several times in warm water, but I still can&#x27;t get them just right to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> [...]  it is a very nice site and will answer ALL your questions with a few clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> .Conventional dentistry, with a full upper denture, may be a better solution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As if having to boil these choppers, mold them to your teeth without scalding your mouth isn&#x27;t enough -The founder who is not a dentist but plays one in the how to apply video advises you not to ever drink , eat, expose to sunlight as they stain so very easily - and  to expect to have difficulty talking to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made sure to measure my teeth before ordering (I kinda resent the horse teeth reviews I&#x27;ve seen, my natural teeth are large</li>
            <li> Natural color s whiter than my own natural color</li>
            <li> now, i get it right pretty much first time, every time.</li>
            <li> now, i get it right pretty much first time, every time.</li>
            <li> The teeth are made from some form of plastic and are very, very porous.  </li>
            <li> The Imako teeth looks very real and I am planning to order another pair.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable.</li>
            <li> the large size barely covers mine, so take your time when fitting</li>
            <li> /&gt;i first came across these via a google search of &#x27;cosmetic teeth&#x27; (as i was about to be homeless, my teeth were a WRECK</li>
            <li> you get your first set.</li>
            <li> you simply reheat them and smoosh the fitting material around and try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thanks imako!</li>
            <li> where did you get them done!&amp;#34; hahaha!</li>
            <li> We did have a few good laughs trying them on.</li>
            <li> I also had to customize it by filing down the gums to fit me better</li>
            <li> (&#x27;cept for soft stuff like oatmeal, ice cream, yogurt, applesauce and stuff like that...and even then you will want to clean them asap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I used the YOU-tube videos to do the EXACT procedure they tell me to do, and still I had NO SUCCESS at all in getting them to fit in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do wear a tiny bit of adhesive with them, just to feel extra safe.</li>
            <li> But I got these today and they far surpassed my expectations!!</li>

            <li> , if your hesitating on buying this item...DO NOT I HAVE MY SMILE BACK!!!!</li>
            <li> the first set i got was &#x27;small&#x27; and still looked fine.</li>
            <li> We are going to buy a new set again here soon.</li>
            <li> and another set fit to the same dimensions for &#x27;public presentation&#x27; the home set to &#x27;hold&#x27; the contours of my gums,</li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Not real easy to fit or wear though.  </li>
            <li> i got my first set from a third party as stated.</li>
            <li> Second They are the most comfortable, thin design, for looks.</li>
            <li> its cheaply made and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I only wish there could a little space between the front teeth for an even more realistic effect.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these with one problem: they yellow, and rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I now have confidence to go back out in the social world and not be so conscious about my smile..  </li>
            <li> the Imako teeth with clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> you went to far.</li>
            <li> you went to far.</li>
            <li> i say &#x27;patience young padawa&#x27;</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME  </li>
            <li> A punch out of paper thin plastic that looks exactly like cheap press on stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m not one to usually write reviews, but since the positive reviews were what made me make my decision, i figured mine could help someone as well.</li>
            <li> I mean if you have no teeth , they perhaps would be better then nothing, but those poor people would probably be better off just using an orange rind</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have recently got a new set, and this is what i plan to do...</li>
            <li> (even if it takes a few or more tries) when you think you have them set.</li>
            <li> (even if it takes a few or more tries) when you think you have them set.</li>
            <li> They are thin but that helps them feel more natural is what he says.</li>
            <li> Plus the gum color is gross-my gums are deep pink, the gums on these when you receive them are like some 80 year old&#x27;s dentures- light pink, like there is a layer of plaque covering them.  </li>
            <li> They can be difficult to fit, as I have very large teeth &amp;</li>
            <li> makes you look like you  have huge thick teeth , almost like buck teeth.</li>
            <li> They look great &amp; now that I&#x27;ve spent some time dealing with them, I notice the amount of contrived smiles in public.</li>
            <li> Bought 2nd set, bleached ones, &amp; used the clear nail polish/lighter method to try to keep them from staining.  </li>
            <li> This 3rd set, I&#x27;ve done the clear nail polish/lighter w/3 coats of polish/lighter after each application.  </li>
            <li> swish the hot-ish (dont burn yourself) with the same action.</li>
            <li> swish the hot-ish (dont burn yourself) with the same action.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue purchasing these as needed until that&#x27;s complete.</li>
            <li> when im out eating, since I&#x27;m used to chewing with my back teeth anyways, i don&#x27;t recommend eating directly with the imakos.</li>
            <li> but it really only last&#x27;s one month, I have to keep buying a new one every month ,as no matter what I do to keep them &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> if you mess up on the first try...reheat and do it again.</li>
            <li> if you mess up on the first try...reheat and do it again.</li>
            <li> I bought him a pair of the natural ones in the smaller size and myself a pair of the larger ones ( being I am 5 ft 9</li>
            <li> and if you take your time and fit them right you will NOT look like a donkey, or a scary bunny, or any of the other comparisons ive read here.</li>
            <li> and if you take your time and fit them right you will NOT look like a donkey, or a scary bunny, or any of the other comparisons ive read here.</li>
            <li> not good for crooked teeth, ok for temp solution until partial comes in.</li>
            <li> very hard to install and fit is terriable.  </li>
            <li> It took me 3 days to finally get the right fit, and once i got frustrated, i would walk away and try again later or the next day.</li>

            <li> HOW YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN HOT WATER TO GET IT HARD.</li>
            <li> The 1st set I got in the natural &amp; they were too dark for my lower teeth, then continued to get darker.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has top front teeth missing (ugly smile).  </li>
            <li> There is NO definition in the teeth, it like a paper strip with teeth painted on, flat.</li>
            <li> So far they seem to be staying whiter than the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> When dry run the flame of a disposable lighter back and forth across the teeth to seal the nail polish\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like the people who wrote such negative reviews didn&#x27;t take the time to really customize them, but hey, they aren&#x27;t for everyone i guess.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to try them, because a few years ago, i tried a product similar and it was a HUGE waste of money.</li>
            <li> Make sure when you&#x27;re finished, to detail the teeth but cutting the excess plastic from around each tooth.</li>
            <li> i say &#x27;patience young padawa&#x27;as i did, a few times)</li>
            <li> As long as you know this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review this long</li>
            <li> how careful you are with eating, cleaning, etc., they will inevitably yellow.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like for a long time.</li>
            <li> You MUST coat them with clear nail polish, then bond the polish to the teeth with a flame from a small lighter.  </li>
            <li> i can pop mine out in under half a second and no one</li>
            <li> (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) you will only end up with a mess and frustrations you dont need.</li>
            <li> (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) you will only end up with a mess and frustrations you dont need.</li>
            <li> A HOT MESS !!!!</li>
            <li> I altered them with some scissors and made them a little bucked and crooked, and now they look like Tom Hank&#x27;s teeth in the movie &amp;#34;The Lady Killers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> to cover damage, missing teeth, work in progress, crooked teeth, things of that sort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME PRODUCT IS OBVIOUSLY AN EMPLOYER OF THIS SCAMMING IMAKO COMPANY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up removing almost all of the pink stuff because with it, it was too bulky.</li>
            <li> SHOULD SNAP IN UPPER TEETH...AND SHOULD HOLD FIRMLY..</li>
            <li> if all else fails but youre close...have your hot water.</li>
            <li> if all else fails but youre close...have your hot water.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay to have my confidence back!</li>
            <li> Oh Yea, They are flexable, soo they dont break like other types.</li>
            <li> Gave 4 stars due to staining issues.</li>
            <li> but will still order small in bleached to get that extra sparkle,</li>
            <li> I also usually just drink water with them in, but i have drank white wine and beer with them in, with no staining, but I also used the staining trick that&#x27;s in the book.</li>
            <li> Have an unusual cheek bone issue so a few upper-side teeth have broken off.  </li>
            <li> if still not right.</li>
            <li> if still not right.</li>
            <li> However, the polish can eventually come off slightly, but with no real significant noticeable yellowing.  </li>
            <li> I was just bored and  before I get real veneers I decided to see what they would look like</li>
            <li> this should cut down on the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMAKO</li>
            <li> dearly wanted them to work, and yet not one time would they stay in place much less drink a glass of tea or talk in front of anyone.</li>
            <li> you WILL probably mess it up.</li>
            <li> My money is really tight</li>
            <li> but with a little care, you can extend the life of each set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll was a little leery of these after reading literally every review of these.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look bad if you just do a half smile.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical on this purchase at first, I personally have an enamel issue and that being said I have lost several teeth and also have bad spots</li>
            <li> Contemplating front veneers, I came across these and thought they might at the very least give me an idea of how veneers might look and possibly</li>
            <li> (as i did, a few times) just take your time and keep working at it.</li>
            <li> but i am so embarrased with 2 up front teeth missing.</li>
            <li> My husband has 2 missing teeth in his front.</li>
            <li> She wears them everyday.</li>
            <li> wear these out so its money wasted.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT FIT.. COMES OUT.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference in these and a previous implant!</li>
            <li> That is for smokers or heavy coffee drinkers but usually you just treat them like dentures and&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to talk with..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money!</li>
            <li> but even the small worked.</li>
            <li> if loose...heat them to just &#x27;a bit soft&#x27; have cold bowl of water.</li>
            <li> but even the small worked.</li>
            <li> if loose...heat them to just &#x27;a bit soft&#x27; have cold bowl of water.</li>
            <li> if a woman, no buy small otherwise you will look like Mr. Ed.</li>
            <li> If you have Small teeth</li>
            <li> ordering small today.  </li>
            <li> I had the problem of the glue or whatever it is poking past the teeth.</li>
            <li> FIRST IT WAS STUPID</li>

            <li> They are a great option if one cannot afford extensive dental work.</li>
            <li> great product! Easy to use...brought life back to smile without major dental work. I now have confidence to go back out in the social world and not be so conscious about my smile..  Yes i would order it again and recommend this my friends.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. Don&#x27;t even waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very easy to fit and looks great</li>
            <li> this is an update of an earlier review. ive seen many questions and have answered a few one-by-one. but thought this would be better as an overall, honest, and &#x27;what the hell are these things?&#x27; sorta review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first. if you have any questions that i dont answer here go to the official IMAKO website. [...]  it is a very nice site and will answer ALL your questions with a few clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i first came across these via a google search of &#x27;cosmetic teeth&#x27; (as i was about to be homeless, my teeth were a WRECK and i was desperate)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i clicked on the link for these at the JOHNSON SMITH co. (remember them, kids?) and with the last of my &#x27;liquid&#x27; cash got a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long story short. i ended up in a shelter for homeless vets, managed to get into the dental program there and had my &#x27;imakos&#x27; on standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they took 14 of my teeth (or what was left of them) one day and scheduled me for repair of what was left. that was in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here is breakdown of what was taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lower...right canine. and all molars aft of pre-molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;upper...all four incisors and left pre-molar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after i was healed up enough from that. i got my &#x27;imakos&#x27; and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after some trial and error, i got the first set to fit and i looked human again. (tho the first set i got was too small, they still worked...i now buy the large size) the &#x27;imako&#x27; site has sizing guides...tho as i say. the first set i got was &#x27;small&#x27; and still looked fine. i moved to the &#x27;large&#x27; as they were easier to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;longer story short....i now am no longer homeless. and as such not longer qualify for free dental from the VA. so these are the way to go for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the IMAKO cosmetic teeth breakdown. good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have read me mention the IMAKO website here several times. great place for info. not a great place to order. i got my first set from a third party as stated. when i got them, the packaging had the imako site. i tried two times to order sets from that site. neither time worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use the site for info. order them from amazon. same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these ARE NOT dentures! they are intended only for cosmetic purposes! to cover damage, missing teeth, work in progress, crooked teeth, things of that sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can NOT eat with them in. (&#x27;cept for soft stuff like oatmeal, ice cream, yogurt, applesauce and stuff like that...and even then you will want to clean them asap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once you get use to fitting them, you will become adept at popping them out (say, dinner out...i can pop mine out in under half a second and no one notices)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they stain VERY easily!!!!  &#x27;specially if you are a coffee drinker or smoker. but with a little care, you can extend the life of each set. (i go thru two sets a year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is suggested that you take them out while at home to lessen the chance of stains. this will increase the life of your set. but may give you pain when you put them in (my own experience) as when they are not in. your gums will start to &#x27;fill out&#x27; any gaps (as gums do) and when you put them back in. you may feel pain or they wont fit as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have recently got a new set, and this is what i plan to do...have one set (the ones i have in right now) for home. and another set fit to the same dimensions for &#x27;public presentation&#x27; the home set to &#x27;hold&#x27; the contours of my gums, the public set for...well...public. this should cut down on the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMAKO does NOT make any covers for the lower teeth. they are not trying to be mean. it just wouldnt work. if you need lowers. you need real dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, drawbacks...cant eat with them. they stain easily. no lowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the good side. consider this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are not too pricey. and for what they are. they work VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when you get your first set. you WILL probably mess it up. (as i did, a few times) just take your time and keep working at it. the greatest thing about these is the fact that they are endlessly re-fit-able! you get it wrong, try again. till you get it right. you simply reheat them and smoosh the fitting material around and try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my first set was a small. i learned i need a large. but even the small worked. after some &#x27;re-tries&#x27;.... now, i get it right pretty much first time, every time. if you mess up on the first try...reheat and do it again. this is not a &#x27;one shot&#x27; thing! keep at it till you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are VERY thin. so even if you only need to cover crooked or crowded uppers they should work. and if you take your time and fit them right you will NOT look like a donkey, or a scary bunny, or any of the other comparisons ive read here. if you are gonna give up after the first try. then dont waste you cash just to write a nasty or even worse, useless &#x27;they dont work! garbage!&#x27; review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you find they want to escape (dont fit) DO NOT try to use denture adhesives to hold them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) you will only end up with a mess and frustrations you dont need. just take some time and re-work them until they click into place. these are designed to stay in place with pure &#x27;mechanics&#x27; they grab your existing teeth and gums and snap into place. (again see &#x27;imako.net&#x27; for more details)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;heres a couple of tips for a good solid fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1...set up....get your hot water ready. have a bowl of cold water on hand. heat and fit them. (even if it takes a few or more tries) when you think you have them set. swish the cold water around to instantly &#x27;set&#x27; them. spend some time and see how they feel. if loose or painful. try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2...set up...if loose...heat them to just &#x27;a bit soft&#x27; have cold bowl of water. fit them, remove them carefully and bend them &#x27;in&#x27; at the ends. dip in the water to set. this may help the &#x27;snap fit&#x27; work. and make them more secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3...set up...if all else fails but youre close...have your hot water. a bowl of cool (not cold) water.and some hot-ish water. and heat your imakos till ONLY the OUTER layer of the fitting material is soft. if the whole thing goes &#x27;floppy&#x27; you went to far. keep an eye on it. when you start to see the OUTER material go transparent its time to get to work. pop them in. use your tongue to create a vacuum between the imako and your teeth and gums. then swish the cool water with the same action. if still not right. swish the hot-ish (dont burn yourself) with the same action. this should seat the imako teeth to your teeth and gums. follow with the cool water to set. once set. every time you have a hot drink you can repeat this action without notice and maintain a good seal &#x27;tween the imakos and what you got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then just keep them as clean as you can. replace them as needed. they aint perfect. but they sure as hell beat nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope this has helped. i love these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and to all the negative reviewers here i say &#x27;patience young padawa&#x27;as i did, a few times) just take your time and keep working at it. the greatest thing about these is the fact that they are endlessly re-fit-able! you get it wrong, try again. till you get it right. you simply reheat them and smoosh the fitting material around and try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my first set was a small. i learned i need a large. but even the small worked. after some &#x27;re-tries&#x27;.... now, i get it right pretty much first time, every time. if you mess up on the first try...reheat and do it again. this is not a &#x27;one shot&#x27; thing! keep at it till you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are VERY thin. so even if you only need to cover crooked or crowded uppers they should work. and if you take your time and fit them right you will NOT look like a donkey, or a scary bunny, or any of the other comparisons ive read here. if you are gonna give up after the first try. then dont waste you cash just to write a nasty or even worse, useless &#x27;they dont work! garbage!&#x27; review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you find they want to escape (dont fit) DO NOT try to use denture adhesives to hold them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            <li> I like this item...... but it really only last&#x27;s one month, I have to keep buying a new one every month ,as no matter what I do to keep them &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; .  They turn &amp;#34;Yellow &amp;#34; I follow their instuctions too&amp;#34;.  As long as you know this.  It works as a Temporary Fix ONLY</li>
            <li> these are awesome gave me back my confidence!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll was a little leery of these after reading literally every review of these. But I got these today and they far surpassed my expectations!! I made sure to measure my teeth before ordering (I kinda resent the horse teeth reviews I&#x27;ve seen, my natural teeth are large but I was always complimented on them, until the impact from my wisdom teeth caused one to crack and break). Take your time when molding, literally roll the mold in plastic to the size of a spaghetti noodle. Make sure when you&#x27;re finished, to detail the teeth but cutting the excess plastic from around each tooth. I used a straight razor. When I finished I immediately asked my mom how my teeth looked, she didn&#x27;t even know they weren&#x27;t mine. She thought I just finished a whitening treatment. I also texted pics to two more people just to make sure. No on knew they weren&#x27;t mine. I only wish there could a little space between the front teeth for an even more realistic effect. My implant process will take about four months. I will definitely continue purchasing these as needed until that&#x27;s complete. A small price to pay to have my confidence back! I&#x27;ve never written a review this long</li>
            <li> This product is a joke , please don&#x27;t buy this , maybe for halloween or something like that, but i was so disappointed with this imako teeth ......DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT ......DONT WASTE YOU MONEY !!!</li>
            <li> Makes your lip push out bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous dental veneers, cosmetic teeth. And I love the Imako The best. For 2 reasons: first, they are the easiest to fit. Second They are the most comfortable, thin design, for looks. Only drawback is if you smoke, you will ruin them immediately. permanently stained it seems. Oh Yea, They are flexable, soo they dont break like other types. Dont smoke with these and you will love them!!! I do!</li>
            <li> this product is cheap and does not work at all.  very hard to install and fit is terriable.  its cheaply made and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> novelty is right. if a woman, no buy small otherwise you will look like Mr. Ed. Video made them look good and easy. I took my wife and had dental bonding done. cheaper than crowns cost $400 for 2 teeth but look great. maybe ok for emergencies</li>
            <li> Awful!! Comfy but I look like a scary bunny rabibit! Wanted them for my sister&#x27;s wedding... But I guess you get what you pay for... Holy crap if u have bad tooth to gum ratio don&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li> Awesome..recommend totally</li>
            <li> These teeth look nice If you have Small teeth like i do Your gonna have to buy the Big set,The thing i dont like about these fake teeth is They dont have any adheasive to keep them in place I wouldnt recommend Buying these unless you buy some adheasive to go with them!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, it is good to see the person that I got them for smile again. They look great! Very natural.</li>
            <li> My money is really tight but i am so embarrased with 2 up front teeth missing. I would not even go out anymore. I thought I have to di something and this was it. I cant believe how great they are. Easy to fit, but I did have some help, but really didnt need it. They look wonderful!!!!! Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these with one problem: they yellow, and rather quickly. I tried everything from soaking them overnight with peroxide, denture cleanser, and both, but nothing did the trick.  I realized what I was doing wrong. You MUST coat them with clear nail polish, then bond the polish to the teeth with a flame from a small lighter.  It is the only way to protect and preserve the color.  The teeth are made from some form of plastic and are very, very porous.  It makes no difference how careful you are with eating, cleaning, etc., they will inevitably yellow.  I have had my last pair now for over 2 months, and since coating them, they have remained the bleached white.  However, the polish can eventually come off slightly, but with no real significant noticeable yellowing.  I simply reapply the polish after cleaning, if I notice a spot of yellowing.  I love these things.  NO ONE knows I have \\&quot;fake\\&quot; teeth in, and I receive compliments all the time on my beautiful smile.  Love them!!! Directions on how to apply polish comes with the teeth.</li>
            <li> This may solve a cosmetic problem for many, but not for me, and not for everyone.  I give it three stars only to encourage people to consider reality before making the purchase.  .Conventional dentistry, with a full upper denture, may be a better solution.</li>
            <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> These are okay.  Not real easy to fit or wear though.  It takes quite a bit of time and refitting to get them to fit right and stay in place. I guess for the price, they are acceptable.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I purchased these because I lost the others. Great product! This works very good, fits good, &amp; look good. I have been looking for something like for a long time. These fit very well. Easy to setup with instructional video online.</li>
            <li> not good for crooked teeth, ok for temp solution until partial comes in.</li>
            <li> My husband has 2 missing teeth in his front. He never smiles. I bought him a pair of the natural ones in the smaller size and myself a pair of the larger ones ( being I am 5 ft 9 and he is 5 ft 3) I looked like something from hee haw ( they were to big my fault not the companies) but he has a gorgeous smile now.  They have lasted about two years and have only needed reformed once ( he left them in a cup out in the sun) We are going to buy a new set again here soon. He loves his teeth..  I recomend these to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt; * As for the nail polish thing. That is for smokers or heavy coffee drinkers but usually you just treat them like dentures and&lt;br /&gt;its not needed.&lt;br /&gt;There is cons Shaping them takes a bit. But Hey then they are one of a kind..&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really eat with them. Smoke, drink, but my husband always takes his out to eat. They are thin but that helps them feel more natural is what he says. All and all hes very happy and has even repurchsed a spare before.. and you know its good if he spends money cause That MAN IS STINGY.... hope this helps</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look bad if you just do a half smile.They do make the upper lip area protrude</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical on this purchase at first, I personally have an enamel issue and that being said I have lost several teeth and also have bad spots, if your hesitating on buying this item...DO NOT I HAVE MY SMILE BACK!!!! I LOVE THIS PRO DUCT AND FITTING WAS A BREEZE!!!</li>
            <li> would not stay in, formed well, looked great just wish they stayed in</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd set. Have an unusual cheek bone issue so a few upper-side teeth have broken off.  Dentist is trying to find another to figure out the problem.  So while I wait I use these.  The 1st set I got in the natural &amp; they were too dark for my lower teeth, then continued to get darker.  Tried using the denture cleanser but it didn&#x27;t help.  Bought 2nd set, bleached ones, &amp; used the clear nail polish/lighter method to try to keep them from staining.  They stained anyway but it took longer.  This 3rd set, I&#x27;ve done the clear nail polish/lighter w/3 coats of polish/lighter after each application.  I don&#x27;t keep them on while drinking coffece now.  So far they seem to be staying whiter than the previous ones.  They can be difficult to fit, as I have very large teeth &amp; the large size barely covers mine, so take your time when fitting &amp; then you can always refit if the 1st time, 2nd time...doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t recommend coffee/smoking/sodas while wearing these. I do eat some things w/them on, soup, tuna salad-soft foods seem ok.  Fine for urrent needs. Gave 4 stars due to staining issues.</li>
            <li> The Imako teeth looks very real and I am planning to order another pair. My family and friends have comment on how great the Imako teeth looks.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to put on, be aware...stains easily. Had to order a back-up pair.  No further complaints.  Very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This item enabled me to make a temporary cap until I can have the dentist make the repairs to my briken cap.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Imako teeth last week, I received them in four days! They are gorgeous! Its very easy to get them fitted. They are a little hard to talk with.. I guess I have to get used to that, it also gave me an overbite...well a worse one than I had to begin with. I ordered the large bleached set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a before and after picture, email me!&lt;br /&gt;samanthablaire@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product, my teeth have been breaking off and they look horrible. I&#x27;m trying to get dental implants, bit its pricey. So this will do for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> A HOT MESS !!!! WAS OF MONEY !!!!</li>
            <li> Always on time. Perfect product for its purpose.</li>
            <li> Contemplating front veneers, I came across these and thought they might at the very least give me an idea of how veneers might look and possibly feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To any of you who remember the toy &#x27;Color forms\\&quot; these are in every way exactly what they are.  A punch out of paper thin plastic that looks exactly like cheap press on stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if having to boil these choppers, mold them to your teeth without scalding your mouth isn&#x27;t enough -The founder who is not a dentist but plays one in the how to apply video advises you not to ever drink , eat, expose to sunlight as they stain so very easily - and  to expect to have difficulty talking to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found exceptionally rich was the paragraph in the instructions about reducing staining that says and I kid you not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Paint the Imako teeth with clear nail polish. When dry run the flame of a disposable lighter back and forth across the teeth to seal the nail polish\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wonderful  - if you don&#x27;t burst into flames you can enjoy having ill fitting, horrendous looking tooth decals coated with toxic NAIL POLISH swimming around your mouth. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better option out there for temporary cosmetic improvements for better looking teeth however I do know that this product is as ridiculous as it is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is more, I can see Imako press on, nail polish coated teeth preventing people from seeking out proper dental and periodontal care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that folks is nothing to smile about.</li>
            <li> Had no problem fitting, looked great except too big for me.  ordering small today.  Nice looking good finish!! Can&#x27;t wait for the smalle ones.  Natural color s whiter than my own natural color but will still order small in bleached to get that extra sparkle,</li>
            <li> Terrible product. I watched the video on YouTube on how to fit them. I had the problem of the glue or whatever it is poking past the teeth. Well it said in the video to pull and pinch it off but that only made the glue peel back and now it won&#x27;t stick. Won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> AMAZON SHOULD PULL THIS FROM THEIR CITE BC IT&#x27;S AN EMBARASSEMENT AND CAUSES LACK OF FAITH IN AMAZON&#x27;S LOYAL CUSTOMERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANY REVIEW TELLING ENCOURAGING YOU TO BUTH IS REDICULOUS, WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME PRODUCT IS OBVIOUSLY AN EMPLOYER OF THIS SCAMMING IMAKO COMPANY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PEOPLE TRUST ME. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME  NOR GET YOUR HOPES UP THAT THIS WILL IN ANY WAY GIVE YOU EVEN A MOMENT OF A NICE SMILE.  READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. THOSE ARE REAL PEOPLE. FIRST IT WAS STUPID HOW YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN HOT WATER TO GET IT HARD. THEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND IT&#x27;S LIKE WEARING COLORED FOAM. YOU CAN&#x27;T CLOSE YOUR MOUTH ALL THE WAY AND IF YOU SMILE YOU LOOK LIKE MR. ED THE HORSE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR FRAUD!!!!!  BE WARE!</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister and she loves them! She wears them everyday. I personally didn&#x27;t think they would work but they did until she was able to get her teeth for the dentist!</li>
            <li> I always wanted some quality &amp;#34;joke&amp;#34; teeth, and these work well for that purpose.  I altered them with some scissors and made them a little bucked and crooked, and now they look like Tom Hank&#x27;s teeth in the movie &amp;#34;The Lady Killers&amp;#34;.  I have had loads of fun with them.</li>
            <li> i love imako they where so easy to used and no one knows they are fake i love them and will be buying more they fit so great  i love that i dont have to use any denture cream it is worth the money !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ended up getting my money back on this product it was so bad. I used the YOU-tube videos to do the EXACT procedure they tell me to do, and still I had NO SUCCESS at all in getting them to fit in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I dearly wanted them to work, and yet not one time would they stay in place much less drink a glass of tea or talk in front of anyone. Just awful experience and I tried it 5 times.</li>
            <li> really cant --wont wear these out so its money wasted.  We did have a few good laughs trying them on. But there is no way you could wear these and pretend they are believeable.  Plus the gum color is gross-my gums are deep pink, the gums on these when you receive them are like some 80 year old&#x27;s dentures- light pink, like there is a layer of plaque covering them.  There is NO definition in the teeth, it like a paper strip with teeth painted on, flat.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m not one to usually write reviews, but since the positive reviews were what made me make my decision, i figured mine could help someone as well. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and have had horrible teeth for a few years. It took a hit on my self esteem big time, and people who don&#x27;t understand what that feels like won&#x27;t understand what a blessing a product like this is. I was skeptical at first to try them, because a few years ago, i tried a product similar and it was a HUGE waste of money. (I think it was the dr bailey&#x27;s) It took me 3 days to finally get the right fit, and once i got frustrated, i would walk away and try again later or the next day. I ended up removing almost all of the pink stuff because with it, it was too bulky. I also had to customize it by filing down the gums to fit me better but once i did, they fit me great. I do wear a tiny bit of adhesive with them, just to feel extra safe. I also do eat with them in occasionally, like when im out eating, since I&#x27;m used to chewing with my back teeth anyways, i don&#x27;t recommend eating directly with the imakos. I also usually just drink water with them in, but i have drank white wine and beer with them in, with no staining, but I also used the staining trick that&#x27;s in the book. I feel like the people who wrote such negative reviews didn&#x27;t take the time to really customize them, but hey, they aren&#x27;t for everyone i guess. Are they a permanent solution? No. Are they a great temporary fix while you save up the money to get the actual dental procedure you need done? Absolutely, once you get them to fit the way they should! If you have the patience to tweak them a bit, I say go for it! I&#x27;m glad i did and wish i would have found and tried them sooner.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has top front teeth missing (ugly smile).  For $35.00 your horrible smile won&#x27;t be noticed.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I like this style but they havnt came yet</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 6 years. Love it, the bleached looks great!</li>
            <li> Got these today and love them! Can&#x27;t tell the difference in these and a previous implant! If you don&#x27;t get them right on the first try, don&#x27;t give up! Once you get the fit right, they are so worth it! Thanks imako! Also, super speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe any one would sell these. They literally \\&quot; bite\\&quot; ,  It was  like putting a tooth over a tooth&lt;br /&gt;which  makes you look like you  have huge thick teeth , almost like buck teeth. Great concept, but not  do-able. I don&#x27;t care what anyone has written.  You get what you pay for. I did not expect much and that is just what I received.  I mean if you have no teeth , they perhaps would be better then nothing, but those poor people would probably be better off just using an orange rind lol....I was just bored and  before I get real veneers I decided to see what they would look like , \\&quot; forget about  it \\&quot; .</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT FIT.. COMES OUT. SHOULD SNAP IN UPPER TEETH...AND SHOULD HOLD FIRMLY.. I DO NOT LIKE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to custom fit and way better then secrets file</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and helped ease pain of exposed nerves, easily adjusted to my fit.</li>
            <li> Worn this for a recent pageant I did. Everyone thought they were real. I woman that I have known for a while said, &amp;#34;Your teeth look great...where did you get them done!&amp;#34; hahaha!</li>
            <li> Yes, I refit them several times in warm water, but I still can&#x27;t get them just right to my satisfaction. They look great &amp; now that I&#x27;ve spent some time dealing with them, I notice the amount of contrived smiles in public. I now can pick out dentures, fake teeth, lumineers with little to no effort. When using BE SURE TO PRESS FIRMLY AS THEY COOL AGAINST YOUR FRONT TEETH or you will notice your top lip is pushed out greatly.</li>
