    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is probably a great product for a lot of people but not for me!</li>
            <li>the seller attencion was the best.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results of Neo Strata HQ Skin Lightening Gel!!!!</li>
            <li>but the best part is that it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>and my face looks great now.  </li>
            <li>The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell very nice but who cares?  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li>the product arrived in good condition and complies with all the features.</li>
            <li>I purchased the NeoStrata HQ because I liked the fact of a gel.  </li>
            <li>I find the hyperpigmentation areas responding most, followed by the sun spots.  </li>
            <li>I had stubborn age spots that wouldn&#x27;t respond to most over the counter advertised products.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many products  </li>
            <li>I mostly used it at night and on days when I was not in the sun.  </li>
            <li>So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Good Product ...unfortunately didn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
            <li>so my skin is neither light nor olive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of age spots and they are still light</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that it was the Kojic Acid.  </li>
            <li>Used nightly over a period of time, spots become significantly lighter.</li>
            <li>Even so, I am very happy with the results so far and also should note that there has been absolutely no skin reaction.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I was not one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li>It took me about a month to be able to clear it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for a brown spot &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product I could see that my spots faded a little bit after one month using every night.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has made my spots disappear and I&#x27;ve tried many.....</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li>I saw reviews that where positive</li>
            <li>know your brand and in the past I have had good results</li>
            <li>and/or may not change much.  </li>
            <li>and I was really looking forward to a product that would lighten my skin</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermatologist for my blemishes and really works wonders.</li>
            <li>so I have a very medium skin type</li>
            <li>it really works, when you apply it every day.</li>
            <li>but this work really fast on my face almost 3 weeks</li>
            <li>It really helps lighten your skin.</li>
            <li>It wasn’t until I found this product that even my aesthetician commented on how much my spots have faded.  </li>
            <li>I had a lot of brownish areas, used it steadily</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this gel to anyone with age spots, sun spots, \\&quot;liver\\&quot; spots or what have you.</li>
            <li>I am sorry for this review but its honest!</li>
            <li>the skin looks white, you just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>I washed it off and was left very hot and red.</li>
            <li>Anyway, just proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps clear up the dark spots.</li>
            <li>I received this item not long ago</li>
            <li>Products with just Hydroquinone have never bothered me, but I remembered (too late) that something I used several years ago with Kojic Acid also affected me, but not nearly as bad as this time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> While it works a bit slow, my motto is slow and steady wins</li>
            <li> It seems that may work, but very slow, I will keep buying it to see if it really lightens my skin.</li>
            <li> The result before anf after are tiny; hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was ineffective in even lightening my dark spots, I used it twice per day as recommended for 3 weeks and had no results</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how long it will take for my sun spot to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have been using the gel for less than a month now</li>
            <li> This has a NASTY smell and once I applied it, my face got reallllly hot within the first 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried it but gave up half way throughout the tub.  </li>
            <li> but I am slightly fare</li>
            <li> It was much less money</li>
            <li> so can go to work or any place without this little pieces of skin in your face.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm even after little use.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my dermatologist a few month ago.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It really works, you peel but not too bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was the only benefit it had!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product instead of the very expensive and difficult to source Tri-Luma..</li>
            <li> The product is weak and not good for lightning the skin or removing spots.  </li>
            <li> I think that my skin got worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a severe contact allergy to this product.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the smell.</li>
            <li> This product gave me really bad rash in the face.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out really bad.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed by this product</li>
            <li> but this is the WORST!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It really works, you peel but not too bad so can go to work or any place without this little pieces of skin in your face.</li>
            <li> It was prescribed by a doctor. Works like a charm even after little use.</li>
            <li> I came across the Neostrata line of products while researching on the web how to lighten skin spots.  I have been using the gel for less than a month now and I do actually see a difference.  I have dark spots on my face and neck which are due to sun, hyperpigmentation from tweezing and a large one from the hormones of pregnancy which appeared 25 years ago when I had my younger daughter.  I find the hyperpigmentation areas responding most, followed by the sun spots.  The hormone spot hasn&#x27;t changed but it is the largest and the oldest so it may take longer and/or may not change much.  Even so, I am very happy with the results so far and also should note that there has been absolutely no skin reaction.  No redness or irritation at all.  The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell very nice but who cares?  I would highly recommend this gel to anyone with age spots, sun spots, \\&quot;liver\\&quot; spots or what have you.</li>
            <li> does not work.  I have used the product for 3 months applying once at night then again in the morning and no change at all</li>
            <li> It really works! I bought this and the cream. This is the only product that has made my spots disappear and I&#x27;ve tried many.....</li>
            <li> my mom loves neostrata. she&#x27;s gonna test it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just over a month now and have noticed that darker spots located on my cheek bones are now fading.  While it works a bit slow, my motto is slow and steady wins the race-- So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I think that my skin got worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend,since it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but it is the truth.</li>
            <li> Works great. I had stubborn age spots that wouldn&#x27;t respond to most over the counter advertised products.  My dermatologist recommended this brand</li>
            <li> I just purchased this and I was really looking forward to a product that would lighten my skin but this is the WORST!!!! This has a NASTY smell and once I applied it, my face got reallllly hot within the first 10 minutes. I washed it off and was left very hot and red. I am so disappointed by this product</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my blemishes and really works wonders.</li>
            <li> I purchased the NeoStrata HQ because I liked the fact of a gel.  Unfortunately this was the only benefit it had!  The product is weak and not good for lightning the skin or removing spots.  I tried it but gave up half way throughout the tub.  I saw reviews that where positive but I guess I was not one of the lucky ones.  BTW I&#x27;m from Spain so my skin is neither light nor olive but I am slightly fare so I have a very medium skin type.... I am sorry for this review but its honest!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lighten the sun damage spots at all but did help keep any acne flair ups under control. Don&#x27;t plan on buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin. Every time I get an outbreak the acne leaves a hyper pigmentation scar. This product really helps clear up the dark spots. For the users saying it doesn&#x27;t work...you have to be patient. You have to apply this product consistently daily. You will see a difference. I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2012. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> it really works, when you apply it every day.</li>
            <li> This product gave me really bad rash in the face. It took me about a month to be able to clear it up. I started breaking out really bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a severe contact allergy to this product.  I am pretty sure that it was the Kojic Acid.  Products with just Hydroquinone have never bothered me, but I remembered (too late) that something I used several years ago with Kojic Acid also affected me, but not nearly as bad as this time.  I did some research and learned that Kojic Acid can cause such problems.  Anyway, just proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin.  This is probably a great product for a lot of people but not for me!</li>
            <li> I like this products.&lt;br /&gt;It help my skin to be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I would keep buying from this vendor again, because it does its job.</li>
            <li> It was like putting toothpaste on your skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of age spots and they are still light but this didn&#x27;t effect them at all. Sorry.</li>
            <li> i have been used this product around 3 weeks, however i did not see anything change on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i should continue to use to see the effect. i will try to see it.</li>
            <li> I tried so many products  no one work but this work really fast on my face almost 3 weeks the melasma despair it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product I could see that my spots faded a little bit after one month using every night.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week. After three weeks the spots are almost totally gone. My wife has now commanded me to get a tube for her. I highly recommend the product instead of the very expensive and difficult to source Tri-Luma..</li>
            <li> the product arrived in good condition and complies with all the features. the seller attencion was the best.The effect of the product takes time, like all the skin care products, but they are differences. the skin looks white, you just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> It was ineffective in even lightening my dark spots, I used it twice per day as recommended for 3 weeks and had no results</li>
            <li> It seems that may work, but very slow, I will keep buying it to see if it really lightens my skin.</li>
            <li> Just what my Mom wanted!</li>
            <li> Good Product ...unfortunately didn&#x27;t really work for me...I needed something stronger!</li>
            <li> It really helps lighten your skin. I recommend it to my friends &amp; siblings.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my dermatologist a few month ago.  When I was running out, I went to Amazon to repurchase.  It was much less money but the best part is that it is a great product.  I had a lot of brownish areas, used it steadily and my face looks great now.  I mostly used it at night and on days when I was not in the sun.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for a brown spot &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  This gel really does fade brown spots, in some cases with only a few applications.  Used nightly over a period of time, spots become significantly lighter.</li>
            <li> Even though product was recommended by my doctor, I&#x27;ve using it for 4 months and spots are still there...I am switching to another brand that a friend already tried and worked.</li>
            <li> This product works but not enought. The result before anf after are tiny; hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I know your brand and in the past I have had good results but I think the percentage of hydroquinone was bigger then.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling melisma on my face for years.  It wasn’t until I found this product that even my aesthetician commented on how much my spots have faded.  I have done laser, peals and monthly facials and nothing has truly worked.  I am thrilled with the results of Neo Strata HQ Skin Lightening Gel!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to see results any time too soon after you begin use.  It can take weeks/months to see any benefits.</li>
            <li> Received on time. Smaller than I used to buy. They dont give the size or weight on the page. Too expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> I received this item not long ago and I started using it so I am not sure how long it will take for my sun spot to disappear. I will continue using it until i finish the container. I am not impressed with the smell. I have used the lightening serum from Obagi-c RX Serum with the HQ and I must say it also smells, so I think it has to do with the HQ ingredient in the product.</li>
