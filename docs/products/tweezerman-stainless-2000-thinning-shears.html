            <li>I had to buy this to fix and upkeep my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>It you just want to fade or add some texture to your hair on your own</li>
            <li>I considered it a &#x27;no brainer&#x27; and went with the new shears and am extremely happy with the quality....ease of use and the accuracy that they afford me !!</li>

            <li>Couldn&#x27;t do better...</li>
            <li>I find that manual texturing will yield better results.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality on sheer but since im not using it that often its ok for the price</li>
            <li>It does not work as a standard scissors, there&#x27;s a learning curve to get best results.</li>
            <li>Operator error for sure.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is they are comfortable to use</li>
            <li>and now I love them.</li>
            <li>They have a nice weight and they don&#x27;t pull on your hair like cheap shears do.</li>
            <li>They were appropriate for her classes without being too exorbitantly priced.  </li>
            <li>More information on this can be found on their website.</li>
            <li>They were advertised as being able to be sharpened by the Tweezerman company.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness he is an adorable toddler and society</li>
            <li>So, I am mostly pleased with how they help me get cute bangs.  </li>
            <li>If you groom your own dogs, it helps to be able to buy good quality tools at a decent price.</li>

            <li>I am not professional , but this tool is really good!</li>
            <li>Very solid and comfortable, and they both cut great.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The quality is exceptional and they are packaged nicely in a folded sheet plastic box with a molded tray which can be used for storage if you are careful in opening and closing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>they were a great deal, so far they have been very sucessful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to cut my hair in the shower many many times, and they still look brand new.</li>
            <li>Fabulous service, high quality of product, easy to use, like, love, adore, cherish.</li>
            <li>This helps keep it clean between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have owned these for nearly a year now, and I love them!</li>
            <li>I researched many thinning shears and selected these due to the good quality for a low-medium prince.</li>
            <li>I still need to learn how to use these exactly, but they fit my fingers perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Works great, I use it pretty regularly.</li>
            <li>A good investment as a &amp;#34;first pair&amp;#34; or student&#x27;s tool, especially as she has since decided not to pursue that career path.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and proved to be a first class product.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but the scissors are great and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, one of my best investments / purchases from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I definitely have used better ones but given the lack of places to get thinning shears, this would still be much better than the seki edge scissors on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lost it&#x27;s edge rather quickly and pulled the hair at times rather than cut it.</li>
            <li>If you want to do a reasonably quick job at thinning someone&#x27;s hair, do not buy these.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li>They have a nice weight and feel, they&#x27;re sharp, very precise cut.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, good quality material and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for thinning thick hair - easy to use, and nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>They cut great and are very sharp.</li>
            <li>very sharp and great product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it ir paid for itself!</li>
            <li>they are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>These are very nice, quality shears and they are sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li>They do not get jammed with a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li>Great product - mildly heavy, but that works for me as it is not flimsy and feels secure in my hand; and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this kind of scissors on my own hair, but 2 weeks after a haircut my hair gets too thick.  </li>
            <li>Okay, against advice I&#x27;m trimming and cutting my own pixie with good results.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t worth returning them...</li>
            <li>Definitely it is cheaper to trim your hair on your own with this pair of shears than going once a month to a hair salon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good as I expected</li>
            <li>i am telling you right now...</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>While I found that thinning your own hair can be a nightmare, these actually work pretty well.</li>
            <li>On my first attempt to cut my own hair, I sliced my finger open.</li>
            <li>I personally think they cut great, in fact, you have to be careful, because you can cut off too much :)</li>
            <li>These helped me change my Yorkie from a giant sweeping mop with matting, into a really cute dog with less matting :P</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two of these thinning shears over the past two years.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be able to get a better product at this price or even double, especially because of Amazon&#x27;s awesome price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten proficient at cutting my own and other people&#x27;s hair, and one friend in particular was so impressed with the result of the cut with this pair that I could see that he wanted a pair.</li>
            <li>These shears are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to create layers in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first pair of thinning shears, but given how expensive they can be, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work pretty well</li>
            <li>Its much better than trimmming with traditional scissors.</li>
            <li>I used them on my bangs and they worked exactly how I was hoping they would.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>These shears are cheap and cannot hope to be considered a professional shear.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I bought these shears as a gift for a niece interested in trying her hand at a career of hair styling.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them as a first pair or for the home user.</li>
            <li>of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product.</li>
            <li>I just make sure I open and close them</li>
            <li>If you are only using it for the tips of your hair it is ok.</li>
            <li>but I did cut my own hair for roughly 3 years.</li>
            <li>These tended to cut unevenly and so they didn&#x27;t do a good job of thinning the hair out.</li>
            <li>Regarding other reviews about them being dull and catching hair, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, and am happy with these, but I *have</li>
            <li>These thinning shears are sharp, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I guess the old axiom, you get what you pay for, is true.</li>
            <li>They open and close easily.</li>
            <li>I recently started trimming my own bangs, and these are exactly what I need (paired with regular shears).</li>
            <li>They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw.</li>
            <li>Your can always make hair thinner later, but you can&#x27;t make it thicker as quickly!</li>
            <li>I figure I&#x27;ll still need to get it cut in a shop every 3 months or so, but I&#x27;ve already saved more $$$$ than I spent on the scissors</li>
            <li>I really doubt if it can cut anything.</li>
            <li>These are great to thin out the thickness</li>
            <li>i absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A bit too much money</li>
            <li>Merci, danke,  thanks so much</li>
            <li>These shears do their job really well.  </li>
            <li>They work really really well.</li>
            <li>quality product with fast shipment to cut my hair..</li>
            <li>This product works VERY well</li>
            <li>was a bit concerned when I read all the reviews before purchasing, but these have worked out very well for my cocker spaniels.</li>
            <li>Work very well.  </li>
            <li>Had to be more careful with them</li>
            <li>Those people that rated them 4 or 5 star likely do not realize that for a few more dollars you can a much better product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfactury.</li>
            <li>scissor handles are very comfy.</li>
            <li>Well these were very inexpensive and work really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am really unsure how this shear generated (some)</li>
            <li>However, when helping me getting a really fast haircut on my son, the pulling is a bit troublesome.  </li>
            <li>These thinning shears cut quite well, but honestly, they&#x27;re not really necessary for a proper haircut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d most definitely recommend it to anyone, whether you&#x27;re a professional or not, they do the job for a decent price.</li>
            <li>This scissors is slightly better than the seki edge junk that I bought previously.</li>
            <li>This scissors is slightly better than the seki edge junk that I bought previously.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, because the will cut you as easy as they cut hair.  </li>
            <li>These are only adequate.  </li>
            <li>The GR has lot&#x27;s of hair and body oils tend to result in tangles around the ears, in particular.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for a particular grooming job</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably a fine investment for a professional hair stylist but far too much for my personal use.</li>
            <li>These are okay, just a little heavy and would appear more as pewter than stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Since acquiring these I can cut my own hair, which grows so fast that to have it short is beyond my ability or budget for weekly haircuts - these make all the difference and cover a multitude of sins … In other words, you don&#x27;t have to be a precision haircutter to get the look of a precision cut!  </li>
            <li>Professional quality!!  </li>
            <li>Does a lovely job of cutting hair, allowing an amateur to cut hair at home and produce a pretty good hair cut!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Used rarely but are sometimes necessary in between haircuts.</li>
            <li>I bought the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears to help trim the long hair around my Golden Retriever&#x27;s (GR) ears.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman shears are exceptionally well made and so sharp you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>These shears are nice quality and much less money than the same at a pet supply store.</li>
            <li>Since they are not the scissors I use to get the basic shape I don&#x27;t suppose it really matters if they are really</li>
            <li>I recently ordered the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears to accompany my Tweezerman Stainless 2000 shears and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li>These round out the set and are a nice addition to the 7-1/2&amp;#34; &amp; 5-1/2&amp;#34; shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shears works well on the tough horse hair and we are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>is very forgiving of bad haircuts on cute toddlers.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>With only a few snips, I am able to reduce the thickness of the hair, when it took me much longer before.</li>
            <li>If you are a stylist in training or a professional stylist, do not purchase these texturizers!  </li>
            <li>Could be a problem, you could cut off too much hair if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, they are clean looking, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I get a little scissor-happy because shears are fun, so gotta watch out and not cut off too much hair!</li>
            <li>blades are sharp enough and its light, but very sturdy.</li>
            <li>My bangs grow very quickly and I don&#x27;t like to have to go to the salon every few weeks for a trim.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to make some serious mistakes.</li>
            <li>Several of the other reviews mentioned that the shears were not sharp but I couldn&#x27;t find another similar product that I liked, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super sharp and well made.  </li>
            <li>A great addition to my arsenal of hair cutting implements.</li>
            <li>They have a clear plastic case that they came in.</li>
            <li>I would say professional quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and have gotten by without these, but I end up with a much nicer and even cut having real thinning shears.  </li>
            <li>After reviewing many &amp;#34;how to groom your dog&amp;#34; sites I learned that a thinning shears is a must (at least for my dog).</li>
            <li>It really ticks me off when a product is not properly represented.  </li>
            <li>I got them for about $30.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them once so far.</li>
            <li>I am not a barber or a professional at all</li>
            <li>If you are a professional hairdresser, I can see how these scissors would drive you nuts.  </li>
            <li>His hair also isn&#x27;t as soft afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being able to thin out her coat makes brushing and combing her much easier.</li>
            <li>I use the product to thin out my own hair.  </li>
            <li>These shears are made well, open and close easily, and are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp!</li>
            <li>They cut very cleanly through my thick, wavy hair, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>This is always very necessary as my older boy has hair that grows thicker, rather than longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These things are not sharp at all!</li>
            <li>They are small in size and fit into your hand</li>
            <li>Soft metal, thumb loop too small, tends to bind on fine hair such as a dog&#x27;s undercoat.</li>
            <li>It NOT SHARP and BARELY CUTS!</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and cut exactly what I want them to.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe reviewers who claim this unit is not sharp.</li>
            <li>They are not sharp, bend the hair and pull.  </li>
            <li>These work fine on my husband&#x27;s thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly, doesnt grab my hair or leave split ends as others have complained about.</li>
            <li>not as well as expected, also doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li>Purchased for grooming my dog, a golden retriever mix with heavy undercoat.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and IMO a very substantial pair of thinning shears.  </li>
            <li>A little stiff but ok.  </li>
            <li>As others reviewed before, they are NOT sharp enough!   </li>
            <li>Not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li>I got my shear yesterday and can&#x27;t wait to try it right away, but once I open the scissor, it got stock and can&#x27;t be closed!!!</li>
            <li>But they are exactly what I needed to thin the clump of hair on the very crown of my sons&#x27; head.</li>

            <li> It leaves a nice spiky look.</li>
            <li> Use these to cut my own hair.</li>

            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> It you just want to fade or add some texture to your hair on your own</li>

            <li> Not the best quality on sheer but since im not using it that often its ok for the price</li>
            <li> It does not work as a standard scissors, there&#x27;s a learning curve to get best results.</li>
            <li> Operator error for sure.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is they are comfortable to use</li>
            <li> and now I love them.</li>

            <li> We have owned these for nearly a year now, and I love them!</li>
            <li> I researched many thinning shears and selected these due to the good quality for a low-medium prince.</li>
            <li> I still need to learn how to use these exactly, but they fit my fingers perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use it pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> A good investment as a &amp;#34;first pair&amp;#34; or student&#x27;s tool, especially as she has since decided not to pursue that career path.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and proved to be a first class product.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but the scissors are great and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, one of my best investments / purchases from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I definitely have used better ones but given the lack of places to get thinning shears, this would still be much better than the seki edge scissors on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lost it&#x27;s edge rather quickly and pulled the hair at times rather than cut it.</li>
            <li> If you want to do a reasonably quick job at thinning someone&#x27;s hair, do not buy these.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li> They have a nice weight and feel, they&#x27;re sharp, very precise cut.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, good quality material and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for thinning thick hair - easy to use, and nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> They cut great and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> very sharp and great product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it ir paid for itself!</li>
            <li> they are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These are very nice, quality shears and they are sure to last a long time.</li>
            <li> They do not get jammed with a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Great product - mildly heavy, but that works for me as it is not flimsy and feels secure in my hand; and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this kind of scissors on my own hair, but 2 weeks after a haircut my hair gets too thick.  </li>
            <li> Okay, against advice I&#x27;m trimming and cutting my own pixie with good results.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t worth returning them...</li>
            <li> Definitely it is cheaper to trim your hair on your own with this pair of shears than going once a month to a hair salon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good as I expected</li>
            <li> i am telling you right now...</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> While I found that thinning your own hair can be a nightmare, these actually work pretty well.</li>
            <li> On my first attempt to cut my own hair, I sliced my finger open.</li>
            <li> I personally think they cut great, in fact, you have to be careful, because you can cut off too much :)</li>
            <li> These helped me change my Yorkie from a giant sweeping mop with matting, into a really cute dog with less matting :P</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these thinning shears over the past two years.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be able to get a better product at this price or even double, especially because of Amazon&#x27;s awesome price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten proficient at cutting my own and other people&#x27;s hair, and one friend in particular was so impressed with the result of the cut with this pair that I could see that he wanted a pair.</li>
            <li> These shears are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to create layers in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first pair of thinning shears, but given how expensive they can be, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work pretty well</li>
            <li> Its much better than trimmming with traditional scissors.</li>
            <li> I used them on my bangs and they worked exactly how I was hoping they would.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> These shears are cheap and cannot hope to be considered a professional shear.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears as a gift for a niece interested in trying her hand at a career of hair styling.  </li>
            <li> I recommend them as a first pair or for the home user.</li>
            <li> of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product.</li>
            <li> I just make sure I open and close them</li>
            <li> If you are only using it for the tips of your hair it is ok.</li>
            <li> but I did cut my own hair for roughly 3 years.</li>
            <li> These tended to cut unevenly and so they didn&#x27;t do a good job of thinning the hair out.</li>
            <li> Regarding other reviews about them being dull and catching hair, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, and am happy with these, but I *have</li>
            <li> These thinning shears are sharp, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I guess the old axiom, you get what you pay for, is true.</li>
            <li> They open and close easily.</li>
            <li> I recently started trimming my own bangs, and these are exactly what I need (paired with regular shears).</li>
            <li> They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw.</li>
            <li> Your can always make hair thinner later, but you can&#x27;t make it thicker as quickly!</li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll still need to get it cut in a shop every 3 months or so, but I&#x27;ve already saved more $$$$ than I spent on the scissors</li>
            <li> I really doubt if it can cut anything.</li>
            <li> These are great to thin out the thickness</li>
            <li> i absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A bit too much money</li>
            <li> Merci, danke,  thanks so much</li>
            <li> These shears do their job really well.  </li>
            <li> They work really really well.</li>
            <li> quality product with fast shipment to cut my hair..</li>
            <li> This product works VERY well</li>
            <li> was a bit concerned when I read all the reviews before purchasing, but these have worked out very well for my cocker spaniels.</li>
            <li> Work very well.  </li>
            <li> Had to be more careful with them</li>
            <li> Those people that rated them 4 or 5 star likely do not realize that for a few more dollars you can a much better product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactury.</li>
            <li> scissor handles are very comfy.</li>
            <li> Well these were very inexpensive and work really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am really unsure how this shear generated (some)</li>
            <li> However, when helping me getting a really fast haircut on my son, the pulling is a bit troublesome.  </li>
            <li> These thinning shears cut quite well, but honestly, they&#x27;re not really necessary for a proper haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d most definitely recommend it to anyone, whether you&#x27;re a professional or not, they do the job for a decent price.</li>
            <li> This scissors is slightly better than the seki edge junk that I bought previously.</li>
            <li> This scissors is slightly better than the seki edge junk that I bought previously.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, because the will cut you as easy as they cut hair.  </li>
            <li> These are only adequate.  </li>
            <li> The GR has lot&#x27;s of hair and body oils tend to result in tangles around the ears, in particular.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for a particular grooming job</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably a fine investment for a professional hair stylist but far too much for my personal use.</li>
            <li> These are okay, just a little heavy and would appear more as pewter than stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Since acquiring these I can cut my own hair, which grows so fast that to have it short is beyond my ability or budget for weekly haircuts - these make all the difference and cover a multitude of sins … In other words, you don&#x27;t have to be a precision haircutter to get the look of a precision cut!  </li>
            <li> Professional quality!!  </li>
            <li> Does a lovely job of cutting hair, allowing an amateur to cut hair at home and produce a pretty good hair cut!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Used rarely but are sometimes necessary in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears to help trim the long hair around my Golden Retriever&#x27;s (GR) ears.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman shears are exceptionally well made and so sharp you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> These shears are nice quality and much less money than the same at a pet supply store.</li>
            <li> Since they are not the scissors I use to get the basic shape I don&#x27;t suppose it really matters if they are really</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears to accompany my Tweezerman Stainless 2000 shears and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> These round out the set and are a nice addition to the 7-1/2&amp;#34; &amp; 5-1/2&amp;#34; shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shears works well on the tough horse hair and we are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> is very forgiving of bad haircuts on cute toddlers.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> With only a few snips, I am able to reduce the thickness of the hair, when it took me much longer before.</li>
            <li> If you are a stylist in training or a professional stylist, do not purchase these texturizers!  </li>
            <li> Could be a problem, you could cut off too much hair if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, they are clean looking, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I get a little scissor-happy because shears are fun, so gotta watch out and not cut off too much hair!</li>
            <li> blades are sharp enough and its light, but very sturdy.</li>
            <li> My bangs grow very quickly and I don&#x27;t like to have to go to the salon every few weeks for a trim.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to make some serious mistakes.</li>
            <li> Several of the other reviews mentioned that the shears were not sharp but I couldn&#x27;t find another similar product that I liked, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super sharp and well made.  </li>
            <li> A great addition to my arsenal of hair cutting implements.</li>
            <li> They have a clear plastic case that they came in.</li>
            <li> I would say professional quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and have gotten by without these, but I end up with a much nicer and even cut having real thinning shears.  </li>
            <li> After reviewing many &amp;#34;how to groom your dog&amp;#34; sites I learned that a thinning shears is a must (at least for my dog).</li>
            <li> It really ticks me off when a product is not properly represented.  </li>
            <li> I got them for about $30.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them once so far.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber or a professional at all</li>
            <li> If you are a professional hairdresser, I can see how these scissors would drive you nuts.  </li>
            <li> His hair also isn&#x27;t as soft afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being able to thin out her coat makes brushing and combing her much easier.</li>
            <li> I use the product to thin out my own hair.  </li>
            <li> These shears are made well, open and close easily, and are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp!</li>
            <li> They cut very cleanly through my thick, wavy hair, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> This is always very necessary as my older boy has hair that grows thicker, rather than longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These things are not sharp at all!</li>
            <li> They are small in size and fit into your hand</li>
            <li> Soft metal, thumb loop too small, tends to bind on fine hair such as a dog&#x27;s undercoat.</li>
            <li> It NOT SHARP and BARELY CUTS!</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and cut exactly what I want them to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe reviewers who claim this unit is not sharp.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp, bend the hair and pull.  </li>
            <li> These work fine on my husband&#x27;s thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly, doesnt grab my hair or leave split ends as others have complained about.</li>
            <li> not as well as expected, also doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li> Purchased for grooming my dog, a golden retriever mix with heavy undercoat.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and IMO a very substantial pair of thinning shears.  </li>
            <li> A little stiff but ok.  </li>
            <li> As others reviewed before, they are NOT sharp enough!   </li>
            <li> Not sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> I got my shear yesterday and can&#x27;t wait to try it right away, but once I open the scissor, it got stock and can&#x27;t be closed!!!</li>
            <li> But they are exactly what I needed to thin the clump of hair on the very crown of my sons&#x27; head.</li>
            <li> If you have wavy or crazy unpredictable hair like me, it also helps to straighten your hair first to be able to get weight even across the head.</li>
            <li> Common sense right?</li>
            <li> I love it, makes cutting my suped thick hair so much easier, great for cutting dead ends off when your in a hurry or when your super lazy.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber or a professional stylist, so i don&#x27;t know how super professional cutting tools should be like.</li>
            <li> long and wispy - so a haircut would last me a couple weeks</li>
            <li> Bought these because my hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> These thinning sheers are very sharp and texture my hair so well that it looks like a professional cut them.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that the cutting action is not as smooth as I would like it.  </li>
            <li> The metal quality is some of the lowest and they will probably last a few sharpening before completely falling apart.  </li>
            <li> The previous reviewer so stated the small size, and he was right.  </li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than some might be expecting, but that definitely does not mean they are any less effectual!</li>
            <li> Just need to remember to start in the middle/end of the hair shaft, and do not do too much cutting on the top of your hair so that there is not any choppy/split looking hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional and these worked well after watching a video on UTUBE</li>
            <li> I use these to trim my dog&#x27;s long fur...</li>
            <li> The product description said that this product was 8\\&quot; long.  </li>
            <li> I bet they will be in service for as long as my clippers are working.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> This is pretty sharp shears unlike what some reviewers claim to be dull.  </li>
            <li> Just keep it well oiled and dry, and it will work well for you.</li>
            <li> i use this on almost every single dog...</li>
            <li> I have average sized male hands &amp; fingers.</li>
            <li> My hands are larger than average and I felt no discomfort at all while thinning my husbands and my hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased them to thin my dog&#x27;s hair, and for that purpose they are okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for anyone who plans to thin a lot of human hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of it getting loose</li>
            <li> Very sharp and solid.</li>
            <li> (And yet from the look of the previous reviews, they probably tried to cut big bulks of hair)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently bought this item since my wife cuts my hair for me, and our previous unit was getting blunt and started pulling my hair.</li>
            <li> Use these in between hair appointments to make my cut last a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I like the little notch they added for your middle finger.  </li>
            <li> I use this to thin out my very thick hair and keep the need for going to the hair stylish for a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional and of average size.</li>
            <li> They get the job done but with some level of pain as the teeth are rough and get caught in hair with each cut.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just saying that if you&#x27;re careful, you *</li>
            <li> Not really much else to say.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair every month, and these make it possible for me to cut the back without looking and without it looking too horribly patchy.</li>
            <li> Careful not to get carried away with these.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> cut as expected.  </li>
            <li> Bought to use for dog grooming, but they did not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> The teeth are widely spaced apart which cut a lot of hair when thinning.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinning shears to thin out the fun ponytail I had bought that was too heavy for me to wear</li>
            <li> A little short, but they&#x27;re sharp and don&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for previous set of thinning shears but did not live up to expectations or reviews.  </li>
            <li> These thinning shears are sharp and easy to use, but they awkwardly stick a little sometimes.</li>
            <li> no idea how they compare to other thinning shears</li>
            <li> - they are solid, kinda small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT saying that those other reviewers don&#x27;t know how to use scissors or cut hair</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull like other review say.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and well weighted.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> These are sharp</li>
            <li> Yes, they are sharp and they work.  </li>
            <li> Scissors ARE in fact sharp.</li>
            <li> Mine is razor sharp and cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, i.e. no pulled hair.</li>
            <li> and I think those negatives reviews does a disservice to other people who are shopping for a thinning shear.</li>
            <li> A few snips can go a long way!</li>
            <li> * noticed that that happens when I try to cut too much hair at once or when I&#x27;m careless and kindof drag the scissors.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I may not be needing them all that much, since my hair appears to be thinning on its own!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The average prices were around $250.</li>
            <li> on your head.. if you have big thick hair.. you can reduce the bulk.  </li>
            <li> I have short (but thick) hair</li>
            <li> If you are a professional these will work well for you, yet you may desire an increased or decreased cut size between teeth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and tight</li>
            <li> It also cuts down on the matting.</li>
            <li> Very sharp thinning shears.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the feeling that these are very sharp.</li>
            <li> It is especially thick near the back of her body.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was a little hesitant when I read that they weren&#x27;t very sharp but ordered them anyway.</li>
            <li> a little and blend things together.  </li>
            <li> Any time I have that little piece of hair that is out of place I trim it with this and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> Paying $19.34 is NOT worth it!</li>
            <li> When it was tried in the hair cutting mode it did the job very well.  </li>
            <li> If its too much hair then I split it in two and cut each piece so that theres no problem cutting.</li>
            <li> quite a few bucks over the course of a year.</li>
            <li> The thinning shears that I have been using, for several years, have been, progressively, getting worse to use.</li>
            <li> Waste of $.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I do a horrible job on my son&#x27;s hair, so the quality scissors is hardly going to make him look like less of a goober.  </li>
            <li> Cutting surface is only 2&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I will use them on now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go overboard with these.</li>
            <li> Instead, they were small, childlike scissors.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why others thought it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue is.</li>
            <li> I usually like tweezerman products</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read my other dog product reviews, you know I have a Wheaten with a very thick coat.</li>
            <li> Thinning shears need to be uniformly sharp in order for them do evenly thin the hair.</li>
            <li> The cutting area for this scissor is a little short for what I am using.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, anyone can thin hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I have a short thick hair and it&#x27;s difficult to cut hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not suitable for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, I found these disappointing due to the sharpness.</li>
            <li> They do perform the job of thinning hair reasonably well, but they are also very small, the size of a child&#x27;s scissors, and the finger holes are also very small, making them somewhat painful to use for any length of time.  </li>
            <li> My hair got stuck and can hardly be cut.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t hardly feel it</li>
            <li> cuz he&#x27;s dirty, man... gross.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t come up with one complaint.</li>
            <li> The hinge in the middle unscrews with each cutting motion.</li>
            <li> negative reviews</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and cut it yourself, then this product is a must.</li>
            <li> They work well for thinning my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and it is just for my cut to keep its shape after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually pay 150.00 to 250.00 for shears and these have been a steal!</li>
            <li> My hair is unbelievably thick and I am so tired of paying a ton to go get it trimmed/thinned out every few months!</li>
            <li> These are VERY VERY small scissors.</li>
            <li> Cut shallow and sparingly.</li>
            <li> My kids have my thick hair, I&#x27;m not a hair stylist, I bought this just to thin out their hair.  </li>
            <li> It was disgusting when I wan assured they were new.</li>
            <li> Sharp cutting edges.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are only one sided blades and they are very dull and gave me split looking hair. :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very sharp thinning shears.  Works great for in between hair cuts. I would say professional quality.</li>
            <li> These are VERY VERY small scissors. They work but they are child sized. Cutting surface is only 2&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> on your head.. if you have big thick hair.. you can reduce the bulk.  they work well... just don&#x27;t let your gf try to use them on the shaggy dog cuz he&#x27;s dirty, man... gross.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a licensed beautician, I would not recommend buying this product.  It is very easy to make some serious mistakes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the feeling that these are very sharp. But they are exactly what I needed to thin the clump of hair on the very crown of my sons&#x27; head. Since they are not the scissors I use to get the basic shape I don&#x27;t suppose it really matters if they are really sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my kids&#x27; hair and have been dong it for year with no training besides trial and error. These were a good price and met my need. They do seem sturdy enough that they will last until my kids refuse to let me cut their hair.</li>
            <li> These shears are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to create layers in my hair. They open and close easily. Tweezerman is such a good brand! I get a little scissor-happy because shears are fun, so gotta watch out and not cut off too much hair!</li>
            <li> My title says it all.    Excellent quality, feel and length.    I&#x27;m really glad I selected this product and expect to own them for many years.</li>
            <li> The scissors can in a timely fashion however they are too short.  Buy 7\\&quot; size.  I am not a professional and of average size. I am a bit disappionted in them.  I should have known better.  A mistake for expensive scissors.</li>
            <li> These shears are made well, open and close easily, and are very sharp.  They do the job well.  I can&#x27;t come up with one complaint.</li>
            <li> In todays economy.....learning to cut your own hair, or in having someone assist you, will help you shave ( pun intended !) quite a few bucks over the course of a year. The thinning shears that I have been using, for several years, have been, progressively, getting worse to use. The price for having them sharpened and \\&quot;tuned up???\\&quot;, as the guy at the tool sharpening place put it....was almost twice the price of these Tweezerman model 2000 Shears. I considered it a &#x27;no brainer&#x27; and went with the new shears and am extremely happy with the quality....ease of use and the accuracy that they afford me !! Get yourself a pair and have at it !!!</li>
            <li> I returned this product one day upon receiving it, its absolutely terrible! It NOT SHARP and BARELY CUTS! DONT  BUY THIS</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and cut it yourself, then this product is a must.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for previous set of thinning shears but did not live up to expectations or reviews.  They get the job done but with some level of pain as the teeth are rough and get caught in hair with each cut.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on reviews by others who bought the product. It is indeed an excellent tool for home use - I do recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love them for home hair cuts to help textures my hair.  Love Tweeerman</li>
            <li> I have short (but thick) hair but I like the bangs long and wispy - so a haircut would last me a couple weeks and then I&#x27;d trim my bangs and it might or might not look good.  So I got these to help me trim my bangs better - but then I got carried away and trimmed the sides and tops too.  (And with a with a hand mirror and regular scissors trimmed the back.)  I did it over a couple of days but then everyone started complementing me on my hair! It is now shorter, kind of stand-up and wispy on the top and with wispy bangs.  I love it!  I figure I&#x27;ll still need to get it cut in a shop every 3 months or so, but I&#x27;ve already saved more $$$$ than I spent on the scissors and I like it better then I get it cut in the shop and can keep it trimmed between.  I wish I&#x27;d started doing this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have no idea how they compare to other thinning shears - they are solid, kinda small but that makes them lightweight.</li>
            <li> These work fantastic!</li>
            <li> These are okay, just a little heavy and would appear more as pewter than stainless steel. At this price I knew better than to expect the quality hair thinning sheers I have had before.</li>
            <li> My kids have my thick hair, I&#x27;m not a hair stylist, I bought this just to thin out their hair.  The first time I used it ir paid for itself!</li>
            <li> I really doubt if it can cut anything. My hair got stuck and can hardly be cut.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> This scissors is slightly better than the seki edge junk that I bought previously. It is heavier therefore stronger and also sharper. The metal is of pretty good quality and it feels good in your hands. This I would say is a mid level product. I definitely have used better ones but given the lack of places to get thinning shears, this would still be much better than the seki edge scissors on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this to do hair cut for my son. I am not professional , but this tool is really good!</li>
            <li> This scissors is slightly better than the seki edge junk that I bought previously. It is heavier therefore stronger and also sharper. The metal is of pretty good quality and it feels good in your hands.</li>
            <li> This is my first pair of thinning shears, but given how expensive they can be, I am impressed. They work well for thinning my thick head of hair. Good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a good thinning shear i have ever owned with the reasonable price.  Then this product is a must</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it seemed to be good balance between quality and price. When I received I was disappointed. I regret not ordering more expensive ones. This one does not look good and it is blunt. Moreover, there was hairs on the scissors. Prabably I got the ones that someone used and returned!</li>
            <li> I am not a barber or a professional stylist, so i don&#x27;t know how super professional cutting tools should be like. But these shears DO THEIR JOB!!!! I was really impressed the way they cut hair! There were some reviews that said these scissors don&#x27;t cut. I personally think they cut great, in fact, you have to be careful, because you can cut off too much :) To sum up, this is A GREAT PURCHASE FOR A GREAT PRICE!!!!!! I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair. Use these in between hair appointments to make my cut last a little longer. Love the Tweezerman brand, have had my tweezers for years.</li>
            <li> Works great for taking some of the weight out of the hair and to help smooth the cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pro but i cut my own hair.  These are great to thin out the thickness a little and blend things together.  Feel like great quality.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to groom a dog...you need this i am telling you right now...i use this on almost every single dog...i get those nice natural edges :D i love it!!!</li>
            <li> While I found that thinning your own hair can be a nightmare, these actually work pretty well. They do not get jammed with a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li> PERFECT - HEAVY DUTY- WELL MADE &amp;#34;&amp;#34;QUALITY&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> I bought these thinning shears to thin out the fun ponytail I had bought that was too heavy for me to wear like it was. These shear did a splendid job. I just put them on my finger and started wacking and with in minutes was lighter and looked great. Not sure what I will use them on now but I&#x27;m sure something will come to mind.     Plus I just wanted to say. I looooooooooooove Amazon and all the reviews and the Prime program.</li>
            <li> i absolutely recommend this product. this stainless steel thinning shears does the job perfect. blades are sharp enough and its light, but very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Bought these because my hair is pretty thick and I needed something to thin it out. It seemed to work pretty well...thinned out my hair just enough. I still need to learn how to use these exactly, but they fit my fingers perfectly fine. I have average sized male hands &amp; fingers. Would recommend for anyone looking for thinning shears.</li>
            <li> I have a faux hawk and use this to trim in between hair cuts. This has definitely saved me some money. Any time I have that little piece of hair that is out of place I trim it with this and the problem is solved. It leaves a nice spiky look. Its much better than trimmming with traditional scissors. This way it won&#x27;t look like your mom cuts your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Tweezerman shears to cut my husband&#x27;s hair for years now. I decided to up my hair cutting game and get these too. His haircuts are way better now. They actually do help. Regarding other reviews about them being dull and catching hair, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, and am happy with these, but I *have* noticed that that happens when I try to cut too much hair at once or when I&#x27;m careless and kindof drag the scissors. I&#x27;m NOT saying that those other reviewers don&#x27;t know how to use scissors or cut hair, I&#x27;m just saying that if you&#x27;re careful, you *can* work around it. Maybe good shears should never do that, I dunno. But for home haircuts, I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> These are only adequate.  They do perform the job of thinning hair reasonably well, but they are also very small, the size of a child&#x27;s scissors, and the finger holes are also very small, making them somewhat painful to use for any length of time.  I purchased them to thin my dog&#x27;s hair, and for that purpose they are okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for anyone who plans to thin a lot of human hair.</li>
            <li> Love them.  They don&#x27;t pull like other review say.  They are great and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman shears are exceptionally well made and so sharp you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Use these for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.  I have been using them regularly for over a year and I love them.  Sharp and well weighted.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t well tighten.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product, everything is win win. I love it, makes cutting my suped thick hair so much easier, great for cutting dead ends off when your in a hurry or when your super lazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these thinning shears over the past two years.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be able to get a better product at this price or even double, especially because of Amazon&#x27;s awesome price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten proficient at cutting my own and other people&#x27;s hair, and one friend in particular was so impressed with the result of the cut with this pair that I could see that he wanted a pair. I gave him that pair and bought another for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They R Good.  A bit too much money but they are not going to rust.  They are pretty small though, I though they were going to be a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> They work!  Should save me money.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears to accompany my Tweezerman Stainless 2000 shears and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. They cut very cleanly through my thick, wavy hair, which is a plus for me. As an added bonus, free sharpening for life! Couldn&#x27;t do better... great quality and great product that I look forward to using for years to come.</li>
            <li> Fabulous service, high quality of product, easy to use, like, love, adore, cherish. use weekly.  Merci, danke,  thanks so much</li>
            <li> I bought the Tweezerman scissors and now these shears. They&#x27;re both great quality. Very solid and comfortable, and they both cut great. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but the scissors are great and sharp.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I cut my boys&#x27; hair, and I have always had challenges to easily reduce the thickness of their hair. This is always very necessary as my older boy has hair that grows thicker, rather than longer. The Tweezerman makes this so simple. With only a few snips, I am able to reduce the thickness of the hair, when it took me much longer before. Great product - mildly heavy, but that works for me as it is not flimsy and feels secure in my hand; and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this kind of scissors on my own hair, but 2 weeks after a haircut my hair gets too thick.  These thinning shears are sharp, easy to use and clean.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and have gotten by without these, but I end up with a much nicer and even cut having real thinning shears.  They&#x27;re well constructed, smooth, easy to clean, and light in the hands. A great addition to my arsenal of hair cutting implements.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and proved to be a first class product. When it was tried in the hair cutting mode it did the job very well.  A good product that I can recommend.</li>
            <li> Use these to cut my own hair. Helps prevent ugly blunt cuts that are dead giveaway for home haircuts. If you&#x27;re going to cut your own hair, better have good quality shears.</li>
            <li> works great on my hair .Using for years and still great now</li>
            <li> Being away from SoCal for grad school in the middle of PA has been hell.  I had to buy this to fix and upkeep my own hair.  Blade are sharp and each cut is perfect with not tearing or yanking.</li>
            <li> These shears do their job really well.  They&#x27;re sharp and tight and I like the little notch they added for your middle finger.  Not really much else to say.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected! great!</li>
            <li> Seriously, one of my best investments / purchases from Amazon. I cut my own hair every month, and these make it possible for me to cut the back without looking and without it looking too horribly patchy. They work really really well. I&#x27;ve used them to cut my hair in the shower many many times, and they still look brand new.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read my other dog product reviews, you know I have a Wheaten with a very thick coat. It is especially thick near the back of her body. Being able to thin out her coat makes brushing and combing her much easier. It also cuts down on the matting. I found these shears to be comfortable in my hand and to do the job well.</li>
            <li> We have owned these for nearly a year now, and I love them! They are perfect for thinning thick hair - easy to use, and nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> These thinning shears cut quite well, but honestly, they&#x27;re not really necessary for a proper haircut. I find that manual texturing will yield better results. Careful not to get carried away with these. Cut shallow and sparingly.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality on sheer but since im not using it that often its ok for the price</li>
            <li> Tweezerman delivers! They do a good job thinning my mop and these guys sharpen for life. I have the tweezers too and those are great.</li>
            <li> quality product with fast shipment to cut my hair.. I am not a professional and these worked well after watching a video on UTUBE</li>
            <li> Good scissors and hood price</li>
            <li> These shears do what they say. I&#x27;m very happy to be able to do bangs/fringe trims between haircuts. Don&#x27;t go overboard with these. You could easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem....I wish I purchased these years ago.</li>
            <li> THIS shears is VERY GOOD! Purchased for grooming my dog, a golden retriever mix with heavy undercoat. After reviewing many &amp;#34;how to groom your dog&amp;#34; sites I learned that a thinning shears is a must (at least for my dog). Cheaper scissors gave me blisters. This product works VERY well, it&#x27;s sharp and easy to use. It does not work as a standard scissors, there&#x27;s a learning curve to get best results.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use it pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> These are the worst thinning shears. The hinge in the middle unscrews with each cutting motion. After 10 snips you have to tighten the screw, because the two blades are almost separated. So aggravating!!! I thought I bought a quality product from Tweezerman. My mind has definitely changed on this brand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I may not be needing them all that much, since my hair appears to be thinning on its own!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the construction on this is excellent. Just keep it well oiled and dry, and it will work well for you. Also, be conservative with your cuts! Your can always make hair thinner later, but you can&#x27;t make it thicker as quickly! A few snips can go a long way!</li>
            <li> These scissors are great. They are small in size and fit into your hand just right. Easy to clean and use</li>
            <li> My bangs grow very quickly and I don&#x27;t like to have to go to the salon every few weeks for a trim.  These thinning sheers are very sharp and texture my hair so well that it looks like a professional cut them.  They fit great in my hand and have a nice weight to them.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Lost it&#x27;s edge rather quickly and pulled the hair at times rather than cut it. I guess the old axiom, you get what you pay for, is true. Thinning shears need to be uniformly sharp in order for them do evenly thin the hair. These tended to cut unevenly and so they didn&#x27;t do a good job of thinning the hair out.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Sharp cutting edges.  I did give myself a bad hair cut when I was experimenting, but it was not the fault of the instrument. Operator error for sure.</li>
            <li> was a bit concerned when I read all the reviews before purchasing, but these have worked out very well for my cocker spaniels. My fingers sometimes get stuck in the finger holders, but for the excellent price, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was a little hesitant when I read that they weren&#x27;t very sharp but ordered them anyway. And,I&#x27;m glad I did!  I used them on my bangs and they worked exactly how I was hoping they would. They cut great and are very sharp. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered them!</li>
            <li> They work great! I use them on wigs for cosplay and they haven&#x27;t failed yet. Good for beginners like myself.</li>
            <li> I got my shear yesterday and can&#x27;t wait to try it right away, but once I open the scissor, it got stock and can&#x27;t be closed!!! The jaw totally stock! I&#x27;m so disappointing the quality control, this might be someone returned it or manufacturer defective, send it back today, too bad!</li>
            <li> Works, but quite clunky.</li>
            <li> The shears work great.  Speedy service.</li>
            <li> These scissors have great craftsmanship.Very sharp and solid.Very easy to handle.They are built to last.The nice thing is they are comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, I found these disappointing due to the sharpness. I use them for dog grooming.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 3 months ago and have used it about five times. It works greatly. I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of it getting loose and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition. I am happy about the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these to trim my dog&#x27;s long fur...they are exactly what I was looking for! Great price and if you know how to use them, they work just as advertised! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It was suppose to come with a pair of scissors also that were not included.  Thinning shears work fine.</li>
            <li> This is pretty sharp shears unlike what some reviewers claim to be dull.  I did notice that the cutting action is not as smooth as I would like it.  There&#x27;s some resistance and metallic scraping sounds as I cut but it does its job well nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Does a lovely job of cutting hair, allowing an amateur to cut hair at home and produce a pretty good hair cut! Best thinning shears we&#x27;ve used. Comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> not as well as expected, also doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li> Since acquiring these I can cut my own hair, which grows so fast that to have it short is beyond my ability or budget for weekly haircuts - these make all the difference and cover a multitude of sins … In other words, you don&#x27;t have to be a precision haircutter to get the look of a precision cut!  LOVE these!</li>
            <li> Super sharp! Be careful. Great for thinning my daughters bangs. Easy to take apart for cleaning.</li>
            <li> cut as expected.  Good handles and works well.</li>
            <li> These shears are cheap and cannot hope to be considered a professional shear.  The metal quality is some of the lowest and they will probably last a few sharpening before completely falling apart.  If you are a stylist in training or a professional stylist, do not purchase these texturizers!  Invest in quality tools. [...] (SEE the difference)</li>
            <li> Work very well.  A good length. A little stiff but ok.  Used rarely but are sometimes necessary in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> These scissors worked great on my hair, I was very happy with the results and easy of use. I thought they were a good weight. I haven&#x27;t purchased thinning shears before and am happy with this choice.  On my first attempt to cut my own hair, I sliced my finger open. Be careful! These are sharp so I didn&#x27;t hardly feel it but it was deep. Have better luck than I did!</li>
            <li> These Shears appear to be crafted well and have a good weight to them.    But their cutting ability is another story. As others reviewed before, they are NOT sharp enough!   The shears do cut, but pull on your hair. Paying $19.34 is NOT worth it! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> These work great for my puppy&#x27;s grooming.  Be careful though, because the will cut you as easy as they cut hair.  My fault, but I did get cut a couple of times.  Had to be more careful with them and now I love them.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and well made.  Do as god as a job as they. Possibly could considering I&#x27;m not that great at using them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinning shears as a backup pair to a more expensive pair and used them just hours after they arrived.  They are sharp and IMO a very substantial pair of thinning shears.  My hands are larger than average and I felt no discomfort at all while thinning my husbands and my hair.  The order arrived within a couple of days and was packaged well.  I am very happy with these shears and will gladly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The product description said that this product was 8\\&quot; long.  I thought I was getting eight inch shears.  Instead, they were small, childlike scissors.  The box may be eight inches, but the product is around 6 inches.  This product works, yes, but it&#x27;s like trying to cut your lawn with it.  The previous reviewer so stated the small size, and he was right.  It really ticks me off when a product is not properly represented.  If you want to do a reasonably quick job at thinning someone&#x27;s hair, do not buy these.  Yes, they are sharp and they work.  Those people that rated them 4 or 5 star likely do not realize that for a few more dollars you can a much better product.</li>
            <li> Great product  love it</li>
            <li> Bought them to cut my kids hair- it does great job for the money i paid. very sharp and great product. have regular scissors from the same company as well</li>
            <li> 9-22-12. I bought the Tweezerman Stainless 2000 Thinning Shears to help trim the long hair around my Golden Retriever&#x27;s (GR) ears.  The GR has lot&#x27;s of hair and body oils tend to result in tangles around the ears, in particular.  These shears do  great job of reducing the hair volume and aid in grooming.  The blades are sharp and cut exactly what I want them to. I researched many thinning shears and selected these due to the good quality for a low-medium prince. Very satisfactury.</li>
            <li> Scissors ARE in fact sharp. Not sure why others thought it wasn&#x27;t. It cuts smoothly, doesnt grab my hair or leave split ends as others have complained about. I have medium to thick hair. I grab sections in my layered hair that look bulky and thin it out. If its too much hair then I split it in two and cut each piece so that theres no problem cutting. Common sense right? (And yet from the look of the previous reviews, they probably tried to cut big bulks of hair)&lt;br /&gt;The scissor handles are very comfy. It does exactly what I need it to do. I&#x27;d most definitely recommend it to anyone, whether you&#x27;re a professional or not, they do the job for a decent price. Plus, tweezerman has a lifetime of sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty picky, I did the research and compared a lot of brands, these are the best ones I can find in my student budget. Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my purposes.</li>
            <li> A little short, but they&#x27;re sharp and don&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
            <li> Okay, against advice I&#x27;m trimming and cutting my own pixie with good results. I have thick hair, and it is just for my cut to keep its shape after a couple of weeks. This helps keep it clean between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very nice. They have a nice weight and they don&#x27;t pull on your hair like cheap shears do.</li>
            <li> Despite the brand (Tweezerman makes the best eyebrow tweezers!), these thinning shears didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34;.  Not sharp enough.  Bought to use for dog grooming, but they did not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> GOOD VALUE, GOOD QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;. .......... .......... ........... .......... ............ . .......... .. ..... .......... .. . ....... . .....</li>
            <li> Recently bought this item since my wife cuts my hair for me, and our previous unit was getting blunt and started pulling my hair. Don&#x27;t believe reviewers who claim this unit is not sharp. Mine is razor sharp and cuts effortlessly. A good buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these shears as a gift for a niece interested in trying her hand at a career of hair styling.  They were appropriate for her classes without being too exorbitantly priced.  A good investment as a &amp;#34;first pair&amp;#34; or student&#x27;s tool, especially as she has since decided not to pursue that career path.  I recommend them as a first pair or for the home user.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman thinning shears are great!  They are easy to hold and don&#x27;t hurt my fingers or hand. Professional quality!!  Quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li> These shears are nice quality and much less money than the same at a pet supply store. If you groom your own dogs, it helps to be able to buy good quality tools at a decent price.</li>
            <li> good scissors. Save me money in between cuts</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife since she does all of the hair cutting and trimming in our family. Retired now are her plastic-handled cheapos bought from a local discount store that didn&#x27;t cut all that well and wound up causing her hands to cramp and become tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are an impressive pair of thinning shears that should stand up to many years of use. They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw. My wife says they are really comfortable and cut well. These round out the set and are a nice addition to the 7-1/2&amp;#34; &amp; 5-1/2&amp;#34; shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is exceptional and they are packaged nicely in a folded sheet plastic box with a molded tray which can be used for storage if you are careful in opening and closing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product. More information on this can be found on their website. It appears that the only cost to you would be the shipping to get the product to them. They also have a &amp;#34;sharpening tracker&amp;#34; that will send out email updates as they process your product for service.</li>
            <li> with hair on it. It is like they used then on someones damp hair and just put them in the box. If they would have cleaned them off I wouldn&#x27;t have known that they used them prior to shipment. It was disgusting when I wan assured they were new.</li>
            <li> Great pair of thinning shears.  I use this to thin out my very thick hair and keep the need for going to the hair stylish for a bit longer.  Great trick to updating your layers and angles!</li>
            <li> These thinning shears are sharp and easy to use, but they awkwardly stick a little sometimes. I just make sure I open and close them well a few times before cutting, and then they are smooth to use. I recently started trimming my own bangs, and these are exactly what I need (paired with regular shears).</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy a pair of thinning shears for a while but was worried if I didn&#x27;t spend a lot they wouldn&#x27;t work as well. Well these were very inexpensive and work really well. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This tool is really amazing. I have a short thick hair and it&#x27;s difficult to cut hair. Works great. Thanks</li>
            <li> It you just want to fade or add some texture to your hair on your own these are great.  The shears do not tear at your hair, rather the cut is smooth. If you are a professional these will work well for you, yet you may desire an increased or decreased cut size between teeth.</li>
            <li> These thinning shears work great, for the price i paid they were a great deal, so far they have been very sucessful! I usually pay 150.00 to 250.00 for shears and these have been a steal!</li>
            <li> Soft metal, thumb loop too small, tends to bind on fine hair such as a dog&#x27;s undercoat. I use - or tried to use - these shears for pet grooming. They&#x27;re not suitable for that purpose.</li>
            <li> These work fine on my husband&#x27;s thick curly hair. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These thinning shears are typical of &amp;#34;tweezer-man &amp;#34;items, quality was excellent for the price. I have very thick hair and these combined with tweezer man blunt scissors help me save a ton of money with home haircuts!</li>
            <li> I use these a ton. They have a nice weight and feel, they&#x27;re sharp, very precise cut. Everything I wanted in thinning shears.</li>
            <li> this product is well made.  but I should have read the description.  The cutting area for this scissor is a little short for what I am using.  I use the product to thin out my own hair.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake, buy a longer version.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, good quality material and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> We had a need for an easier way to keep the mane of our horse properly thinned and groomed. This shears works well on the tough horse hair and we are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The teeth are widely spaced apart which cut a lot of hair when thinning. Could be a problem, you could cut off too much hair if you are not careful. If you are only using it for the tips of your hair it is ok. The price is good compared  to others. Quality is very good.</li>
            <li> I would give these thinning shears 0 stars if I could.  They are not sharp, bend the hair and pull.  Bought these for a particular grooming job but they didn&#x27;t work at all and it wasn&#x27;t worth returning them...just threw them away!!  Waste of $.</li>
            <li> These scissors don&#x27;t match up.  I thought tweezerman was a good name.  But not in scissors.&lt;br /&gt;When you open them up you can&#x27;t close them together.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, quality shears and they are sure to last a long time. I bet they will be in service for as long as my clippers are working.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price. Definitely it is cheaper to trim your hair on your own with this pair of shears than going once a month to a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I ordered the thinning shears to reduce the amount of &#x27;hair&#x27; on my microfiber wigs.&lt;br /&gt;No stylist in my area would work on a this type of wig so I decided to try it&lt;br /&gt;myself. IT WORKED GREAT! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected. Works just as well as the expensive salon shears.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised</li>
            <li> Great quality. Sharp, anyone can thin hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I searched for a pair of thinning shears for my personal use. The prices ranged from $6 (that sounded too cheap and I couldn&#x27;t imagine them holding an edge at that price.) to over $1000. (I don&#x27;t know who would want to spend money that way.) The average prices were around $250. That&#x27;s probably a fine investment for a professional hair stylist but far too much for my personal use. Then I found the Tweezerman shears. They were advertised as being able to be sharpened by the Tweezerman company. This told me that that the metal they are made from is a good quality. I got them for about $30.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them once so far. They are sharp, i.e. no pulled hair. They have a clear plastic case that they came in. I got the sticky glue from the tape they had been sealed with off, by applying baby oil to it.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber or a professional at all but I did cut my own hair for roughly 3 years. I am really unsure how this shear generated (some) negative reviews and I think those negatives reviews does a disservice to other people who are shopping for a thinning shear. I know for me it did. I was hesitant to purchase because of some of those reviews and held off for a while. But I&#x27;m glad I pulled the trigger because frankly, I see nothing wrong with the shears. They are sharp, they are clean looking, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. Not sure what the issue is.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but it is alright.</li>
            <li> These scissors are only one sided blades and they are very dull and gave me split looking hair. :(</li>
            <li> These helped me change my Yorkie from a giant sweeping mop with matting, into a really cute dog with less matting :P</li>
            <li> I usually like tweezerman products so I decided to give this a shot. Several of the other reviews mentioned that the shears were not sharp but I couldn&#x27;t find another similar product that I liked, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are not sharp at all! As soon as you use them, they start pulling on your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these thinning shears.  They are high quality and do a great job of thinning.  They are a little smaller than some might be expecting, but that definitely does not mean they are any less effectual!</li>
            <li> My hair is unbelievably thick and I am so tired of paying a ton to go get it trimmed/thinned out every few months! I was worried about the quality since it is such a great price, but these work great. Just need to remember to start in the middle/end of the hair shaft, and do not do too much cutting on the top of your hair so that there is not any choppy/split looking hair.  If you have wavy or crazy unpredictable hair like me, it also helps to straighten your hair first to be able to get weight even across the head.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good as I expected</li>
            <li> If you are a professional hairdresser, I can see how these scissors would drive you nuts.  However, I only need to trim my bangs and my son&#x27;s hair.  To be honest, I do a horrible job on my son&#x27;s hair, so the quality scissors is hardly going to make him look like less of a goober.  Thank goodness he is an adorable toddler and society is very forgiving of bad haircuts on cute toddlers.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors do pull on the hair a bit when you are thinning out the hair.  I do worry that I am stripping the hair and possibly ruining some of the ends.  So, I am mostly pleased with how they help me get cute bangs.  However, when helping me getting a really fast haircut on my son, the pulling is a bit troublesome.  His hair also isn&#x27;t as soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I plan to continue give haircuts, I will A) try to learn less goober-ish hair cutting techniques, and B) Buy some sharper, more expensive shears.</li>
