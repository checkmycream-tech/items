    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Always an excellent choice for skin conditions with results that excelled my expectations.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li>Very good product, wish it was available on the Amazon.ca web site.</li>
            <li>My husband uses Perrin&#x27;s Blend on cancerous and precancerous spots with great success.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>but it truly works,very pleased</li>
            <li>More importantly, many of my co-workers have commented on how good my skin looks and ask what I am doing different.</li>
            <li>This creme was recommended by a friend and it was fine, no noticeable difference for me.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I find that it subsides after several hours to a bearable smell, otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Very good for the face have not used it long enough to tell, but hoping for good results.</li>
            <li>Even more amazing was that he&#x27;d had a wart on his foot for many years, and that one completely vanished without having applied the cream directly to it!  </li>
            <li>However, since it&#x27;s red and honey-based it&#x27;s a bit more challenging to use on his face during the work day.</li>
            <li>This may be useful for some things, but the smell is unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that its all natural.</li>
            <li>We know that warts are viruses and that often the ones on different parts of the body all stem from the same virus, but to see his body respond that way to the [accidental] application of the cream to his finger was unexpected but great!</li>
            <li>The lichen sclerosis looks better and I will continue to use perrins cr&amp;egrave;me complete to stay away from cortisone as much as I can.  </li>
            <li>COMPLETE is the best title because this is the ONLY skin care product that I have EVER used that I feel does not need to be supplemented with other products.</li>
            <li>It melts so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I reluctantly tried this product because one of my dearest friends highly recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>Really like this cream, all natural and my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>Considering how long it lasts it is not expensive!  </li>
            <li>I have used high end skin care products all of my adult life and all I can say is that I am Completely Amazed by this one.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll never be able to use it long enough to find out because I simply can&#x27;t stand the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I still have more than a half jar left.</li>
            <li>I told a friend about it and she has recovered completely.</li>
            <li>but so far I still need to use cortisone creams from time to time.  </li>
            <li>So about 3 weeks ago he started using Perrin&#x27;s Creme Complete to keep the areas treated.</li>
            <li>This cream really helps, but I find I must use daily and the SMELL!!!</li>
            <li>Has completely taken away a precancerous sore on my nose.</li>
            <li>Extremely thick, I love it..</li>
            <li>I know this product is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used Creme Complete for several years to keep lichen sclerosis under control.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> A few days ago he noticed that the wart had completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> so I only use them when I have absolutely no choice.</li>
            <li> And I can continue to smell it a long time after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> Spreads a long way!  </li>
            <li> I had some dry patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> With everything else I have ever used, I begin to feel dry by mid-afternoon.</li>
            <li> and so are all the other symptoms.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try all of the other things they make.</li>
            <li> I also am putting it on some dark spots from sun damage and they are going away.</li>
            <li> I have always used a serum or other product beneath my moisturizer, but this one does not need it; AND it works all day!</li>
            <li> I have been using it less than a week and the itching is gone</li>
            <li> Like a previous purchaser said, &amp;#34;it smells like a sewer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> What a relief and no more cortisone creams for me.</li>
            <li> No scar - no trace - no more tender spot.</li>
            <li> Cortisone creams thin your skin</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> The product has not helped the condition, which was disappointing.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Always an excellent choice for skin conditions with results that excelled my expectations. Would recommend this to anyone who is concerned with repairing damaged skin.</li>
            <li> This may be useful for some things, but the smell is unbearable.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Great product. Said what it was going to starting in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> This product works. I have tried everything for LS including cortisone creams. I have been using it less than a week and the itching is gone and so are all the other symptoms. I also am putting it on some dark spots from sun damage and they are going away. I know this product is a little pricey but worth it. I am so glad I found it. I will never go without it. What a relief and no more cortisone creams for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Creme Complete for several years to keep lichen sclerosis under control. This is the only thing I have found that actually gets rid of lichen sclerosis. I used it twice a day in the beginning and now I only use it about once a week. I told a friend about it and she has recovered completely.</li>
            <li> I have lichen sclerosis and it helps with the itching but so far I still need to use cortisone creams from time to time.  The lichen sclerosis looks better and I will continue to use perrins cr&amp;egrave;me complete to stay away from cortisone as much as I can.  Cortisone creams thin your skin so I only use them when I have absolutely no choice.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I&#x27;m about 20 yrs younger.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  My husband uses Perrin&#x27;s Blend on cancerous and precancerous spots with great success. However, since it&#x27;s red and honey-based it&#x27;s a bit more challenging to use on his face during the work day. So about 3 weeks ago he started using Perrin&#x27;s Creme Complete to keep the areas treated. He applied it daily with his forefinger, which happened to have a wart on it. A few days ago he noticed that the wart had completely disappeared! No scar - no trace - no more tender spot. Even more amazing was that he&#x27;d had a wart on his foot for many years, and that one completely vanished without having applied the cream directly to it!  We know that warts are viruses and that often the ones on different parts of the body all stem from the same virus, but to see his body respond that way to the [accidental] application of the cream to his finger was unexpected but great!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that it would help my lichensclerosis, but I saw no difference.  It was expensive and did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Use  * Toothpick * to twirl some creme, then apply on area of face. Extremely thick, I love it..</li>
            <li> Really like this cream, all natural and my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> I had some dry patches on my face.  After using it for about a week they have been noticeably reduced.  I like the fact that it has non-toxic ingredients. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> It helped with the itching from my LS, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from chronic lichen for over ten years.  This cream really helps, but I find I must use daily and the SMELL!!! Like a previous purchaser said, &amp;#34;it smells like a sewer&amp;#34;.  I find that it subsides after several hours to a bearable smell, otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very good for the face have not used it long enough to tell, but hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 6 months now for pre cancerous (actinic keratosis) areas  on my face. They have disappeared!  A side effect that will keep me using this: wrinkles also disappear!  I still have more than a half jar left. Considering how long it lasts it is not expensive!  Spreads a long way!  Definitely an anti-aging cream!</li>
            <li> This creme was recommended by a friend and it was fine, no noticeable difference for me. It melts so don&#x27;t use too much. Too expensive but might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> It takes a while but it truly works,very pleased</li>
            <li> I have used it for one month and saw no change at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a skin condition that has persisted for some time.  The product has not helped the condition, which was disappointing.  My search continues...</li>
            <li> Very good product, wish it was available on the Amazon.ca web site. Love the fact that its all natural.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly tried this product because one of my dearest friends highly recommended it to me. I have used high end skin care products all of my adult life and all I can say is that I am Completely Amazed by this one. COMPLETE is the best title because this is the ONLY skin care product that I have EVER used that I feel does not need to be supplemented with other products. I have always used a serum or other product beneath my moisturizer, but this one does not need it; AND it works all day! With everything else I have ever used, I begin to feel dry by mid-afternoon. I never feel dehydrated with this product. I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my skin. More importantly, many of my co-workers have commented on how good my skin looks and ask what I am doing different. I cannot wait to try all of the other things they make.</li>
            <li> This works wonders.  Has completely taken away a precancerous sore on my nose.</li>
            <li> This cream may work wonders but I&#x27;ll never be able to use it long enough to find out because I simply can&#x27;t stand the smell of it.  And I can continue to smell it a long time after I apply it.  I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for something else.</li>
