            <li>This is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size and very cute. :)</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and is very realistic (which i didnt expect for the price).</li>
            <li>This is a fine brand and a great smelling cotton candy spray.</li>
            <li>A KIND OF COLOGNE FOR WORK.</li>
            <li>the best cotton candy smell I have found yet,it really smells like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>If the scent was a bit lighter  my daughter might have liked it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance of all - just loved the cotton candy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Really, for a scent this great, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>this and the vanilla kind.</li>
            <li>Came fast, smells great, lots of compliments!</li>
            <li>I would say it smells like some kind of raspberry candy.  </li>
            <li>Both scents mix well with my own chemistry.</li>
            <li>It is nice to wear a fragrance again that I like.</li>
            <li>It makes my own scent that I get a lot of compliments on at work</li>
            <li>This smells so nice like you want to eat your self up and can&#x27;t wait to get more, Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Its a very light refreshing scent and the comments you&#x27;ll get from it!</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower, body mists are great for that.</li>
            <li>Nice light cotton candy smell that doesn&#x27;t take over and overpower you like perfume does and reminds me of being at the carnival or the fair.</li>
            <li>Many friends of mine went out and bought it and love it too!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff! :)</li>
            <li>It lasted about 6 hours so pretty good!</li>
            <li>but I found it kind of overwhelmingly powerful, like I had been involved in some kind of industrial accident involving a cotton candy booth at a state fair.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing my kids love this product</li>
            <li>IT IS A SOFT WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE...</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Also, be prepared for a lot of compliments, girls think this smell is pretty good, but guys LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light scent.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, the price is very cheap</li>
            <li>it smelled more like licorice to me than cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I love the sweetness of this one...</li>
            <li>how could you not just love this?</li>
            <li>so people love that I smell and look like yummy candy.</li>
            <li>I use it more as a room freshener rather than a body spray</li>
            <li>But I just love, love, love this scent</li>
            <li>I love cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE COTTON CANDY BODY SPRAY.</li>
            <li>I almost threw it away, but within a minute, I noticed a lovely cotton candy scent.</li>

            <li>With a touch of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love it.</li>
            <li>Smelled like mostly alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>Love this body spray.  </li>
            <li>it smells appropriate for girls 10-13, but i don&#x27;t know any girls that age who wear perfume.  </li>
            <li>Maybe i just doesn&#x27;t smell inspiring to me.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite scented body spray of all time</li>
            <li>Really glad I got it, and the price is veerrrryyy affordable.  </li>

            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even get better.</li>
            <li>for many years on me.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s lovely again</li>
            <li>I love this body spray</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I even bought two, confident that I would love it.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on it from people at work.</li>
            <li>I love this body spray.</li>
            <li>After about five minutes though it smelled FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>SMELLS SWEET AND NICE LIKE</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product!</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews...i noticed one reviewer who said the scent was too strong.</li>
            <li>so it was my only body mist I owned at the time, and surprisingly it lasted me (the bottle did) for a good couple years until I threw it out.</li>
            <li>and I loved the scent so much that I wanted to get more.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet and feels light and refreshing !</li>
            <li>I got curious about this stuff after doin&#x27; an online search for a delicious, dessert scented...scent.</li>
            <li>My nine year old daughter doesn&#x27;t quite agree but still thinks it smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells just like cotton candy and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>it has a strong cotton candy smell</li>
            <li>it smells like a strong alcohol smell</li>
            <li>or so it has a STRONG smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li>This body spray smells really good, sweet, exactly like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>not so strong you can not stand it.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>but if you love sweet and suttle this is for you.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and lovely.</li>
            <li>When it arrived it came in a nice size, but when I first sprayed it I gagged.</li>
            <li>This is my moms favorite scent of body spray, so she&#x27;ll be pretty glad that there is an 8 oz.</li>
            <li>It has quickly become my favorite body spray.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and is one of my favorite senses.  </li>
            <li>It has a sort of chemical odor to me that is a huge turn-off.</li>
            <li>lol I get compliments almost daily.</li>
            <li>Simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, This body spray straight up smells like medicine.</li>
            <li>and i found a great link that allowed the product to be shipped to my home at the same price it would have cost if i were to purchase it in the store.</li>
            <li>The scent is cheap...</li>
            <li>and I find I like to take a bottle like that and mix that one with Midnight Rose by Tresor and Victoria Beckham&#x27;s Intimately Yours.</li>
            <li>I followed the reviews and most people said they loved it more than Pink Sugar, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews, I must have been sent old stock or diluted bottles.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like cotton candy!!</li>
            <li>This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  </li>
            <li>But it came pretty fast so thats one good thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, sweet and fruity, and I always receive compliments when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this body spray...</li>
            <li>this is a great value - I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it</li>
            <li>But, I do highly recommend this brand because it isn&#x27;t to over powering and gives a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li>the old version (maybe 10 years or more) was a better product with stronger scent and it lasted longer</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a nice soft scent!</li>
            <li>Right NOW!</li>
            <li>, Aurora is RIGHT ON!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>Was a gift to my daughter, in my opinion this is too sweet smelling, but, my daughter likes it alot</li>
            <li>Glad I did get this for a friend and was very please with this Body Spray.</li>
            <li>I prefer sweet candy and fruity scents</li>
            <li>But, a Sweet End for me.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was so cool.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much and its so sweet...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back up there, making a special trip, to get this!!!  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t super sweet smelling</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to smell softly sweet &amp; yummy...and as most of the reviewers have said...</li>
            <li>This particular brand and scent is my favorite.</li>
            <li>lucky them.  </li>
            <li>At first it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and fun and reminds you of summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells sweet and fresh</li>
            <li>I may buy it again at some point but not right now, I own way to many perfumes and what not.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like cotton candy!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t at first!</li>
            <li>REALLY!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent and doesn&#x27;t last long, but I feel happy, light and fresh whenever I wear it.  </li>
            <li>The bottle came with a cute little protector for the pump top; since I travel alot, this will come in handy to avoid spillage -- an unexpected plus.</li>
            <li>This smells exactly like cotton candy but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Smells just like cotton candy fresh off of the machine...</li>
            <li>I used this body spray years ago and remembered how much i liked it recently so decided to place an order.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the plastic cap has pretty fairies dancing on it, which is cool.</li>
            <li>I love natural scents instead of flowery perfumes and this one hits the spot.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no &#x27;artificial&#x27; undertone to it</li>
            <li>If your willing to wait just a short time for it to dry, it will smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>Originally I bought this for a friends daughter, but ended up being my favorite scent to wear for several years.  </li>
            <li>Normally you have a strong alcohol scent but this one is out of the world</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t buy it around here anymore, or only rarely, so the price was higher than I liked but nothing to be done about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a scent/perfume that smells right on like cotton candy...</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for the right brand...</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and I am very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>When you first smell it, it&#x27;s like grape medicine, which is kind of gross.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I barely smell it on myself.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really describe the smell, but  it is sweet, almost a cherry sugar smell?  </li>
            <li>Go by the top, middle and last layer of the kind of stuff</li>
            <li>but this one stays true to how it smells and really does smell like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>This body spray has a rich, sweet and soft scent that provoke the sensation of eating the girl who is wearing it</li>
            <li>There was such a strong alcohol smell!</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and I love the pink.</li>
            <li>and I also use this as air freshener - a spray only lasts 5 minutes or so, but brings back great memories every time you smell it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice and lasts a super long time actually all day!</li>
            <li>I was pretty darn excited when I saw this particular brand/smell on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it and probably the only body spray I will ever buy.</li>
            <li>i wish i had looked there first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to see if it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I unscrewed the lid and smelled it.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li>I was so glad to finally find it here on amazon!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and it seems amazon is the only place I can get it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok scent but a little too strong smelling for me.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore Body Fantasies&#x27; Cotton Candy Perfume, I had compliments right away, and then it kinda made them crave for some real cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>Its not a heavy scent its light and really smells like cotton candy without the musky undertone.</li>
            <li>Also, my husband is fragrance sensitive and even he has never complained about the scent being too strong.</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews, I decide to try this.  </li>
            <li>It smells TOO TOO fruity and very obnoxious.. Can not return it due to hazardous package requirements</li>
            <li>I spray it in the trunk of my car and the scent slowly travels to the front of the car on its own making the experience more natural.</li>
            <li>and I never get tired of the beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a true cotton candy scent, so real it practically smells soft like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>i smelled the one in a Japanese store and the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one I got here.</li>
            <li>I have Been Using This Exact Spray Since High School.</li>
            <li>Really like this USA made fragrance.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>You really need to be dedicated to smelling like cotton candy if you wear this.  </li>
            <li>I remember my ex used to wear this, it was a real turn on.</li>
            <li>I really really don&#x27;t like flowery fragrances</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m also an addict of real cotton candy.</li>
            <li>Does it smell like the real thang?</li>
            <li>Smells like the real deal.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation is to go for the cupcake scented body spray by body fantasies (wished I would of) or Aqualinas pink sugar perfume (it smells WAY better then this, and i promise you</li>
            <li>The perfume Aquolina doesn&#x27;t even compare (kinda has a musky scent); Demeter&#x27;s Cotton Candy I do not like a all (doesn&#x27;t really smell like cotton candy); and Prince Matchabelli&#x27;s Cotton Candy Deoderant Can smells (well...just like deoderant.)  </li>
            <li>Both the men and ladies at work tell me how much they want meh after giving myself a spray or two.</li>
            <li>It REALLY woke my senses</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just like the \\&quot;real</li>
            <li>She uses it so much</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to keep putting it on, (even though you don&#x27;t need to because the scent lasts a while) it really lifts your spirits.  </li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price of every other fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few candy scented body sprays and perfumes in the past, but this one has to be the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells a little strong at first, but after a few minutes the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it for the bathroom but catch my 9 yr old  misting herself ;)</li>
            <li>I love this spray because it gives me a subtle sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol like most other Cotton Candy scents I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>Nice for young ladies and little girls.</li>
            <li>Decent longevity</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any age or for any lifestyle.</li>
            <li>After a little bit, it smells more like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just a perfume for little kids :)</li>
            <li>My little girls love it too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the extra money.)</li>
            <li>Very sweet long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how long-lasting it is!</li>
            <li>not sure if it is alcohol or something to that effect so for me it works better for room scenting.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>She has a small bottle of this cotton candy perfume and I love the way she smells when she puts it on...</li>
            <li>no one wants to smell like they spent to much time at the carnival.</li>
            <li>My order clearly states cotton candy .  </li>
            <li>Lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I used to work with this girl at my old job that always smelled like cotton candy</li>
            <li>People wonder why they smell cotton candy when they are standing near me.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on my whole entire curvy body and the guys can&#x27;t stop sniffing me at work</li>
            <li>new version is maybe a little watered down but still smells amazing and will immediately catch the attention of anyone smelling it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hate it, I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s pretty good after a little bit</li>
            <li>This does not smell the same as my older bottle.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>bottle was little loose at top, and it DOSENOT SMELL as it should</li>
            <li>new version is also a larger bottle - at around $3 per bottle</li>
            <li>and i have never ever had anyone make a negative comment to it being too strong.</li>
            <li>I was not very happy with the actual scent of this body body, it has a more synthetic smell than I was expecting</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant about it since body sprays and  body washes of the same scent and brand can vary significantly in the way they smell</li>
            <li>at such a great price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>I just found it in Dollar General Store today and used the tester.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real stickler for long lasting perfumes, so</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for some sweet scents.</li>
            <li>I usually put it on right after my shower at 6:30 am.</li>

            <li> This is a fine brand and a great smelling cotton candy spray.</li>
            <li> A KIND OF COLOGNE FOR WORK.</li>
            <li> the best cotton candy smell I have found yet,it really smells like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> If the scent was a bit lighter  my daughter might have liked it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance of all - just loved the cotton candy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Really, for a scent this great, you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> this and the vanilla kind.</li>
            <li> Came fast, smells great, lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> I would say it smells like some kind of raspberry candy.  </li>
            <li> Both scents mix well with my own chemistry.</li>
            <li> It is nice to wear a fragrance again that I like.</li>
            <li> It makes my own scent that I get a lot of compliments on at work</li>

            <li> I love the idea of a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower, body mists are great for that.</li>
            <li> Nice light cotton candy smell that doesn&#x27;t take over and overpower you like perfume does and reminds me of being at the carnival or the fair.</li>
            <li> Many friends of mine went out and bought it and love it too!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! :)</li>
            <li> It lasted about 6 hours so pretty good!</li>
            <li> but I found it kind of overwhelmingly powerful, like I had been involved in some kind of industrial accident involving a cotton candy booth at a state fair.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing my kids love this product</li>
            <li> IT IS A SOFT WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE...</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Also, be prepared for a lot of compliments, girls think this smell is pretty good, but guys LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light scent.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, the price is very cheap</li>
            <li> it smelled more like licorice to me than cotton candy.</li>
            <li> I love the sweetness of this one...</li>
            <li> how could you not just love this?</li>
            <li> so people love that I smell and look like yummy candy.</li>
            <li> I use it more as a room freshener rather than a body spray</li>

            <li> would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> SMELLS SWEET AND NICE LIKE</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product!</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews...i noticed one reviewer who said the scent was too strong.</li>
            <li> so it was my only body mist I owned at the time, and surprisingly it lasted me (the bottle did) for a good couple years until I threw it out.</li>
            <li> and I loved the scent so much that I wanted to get more.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and feels light and refreshing !</li>
            <li> I got curious about this stuff after doin&#x27; an online search for a delicious, dessert scented...scent.</li>
            <li> My nine year old daughter doesn&#x27;t quite agree but still thinks it smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells just like cotton candy and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> it has a strong cotton candy smell</li>
            <li> it smells like a strong alcohol smell</li>
            <li> or so it has a STRONG smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> This body spray smells really good, sweet, exactly like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> not so strong you can not stand it.</li>
            <li> It came very fast and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> but if you love sweet and suttle this is for you.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet and lovely.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it came in a nice size, but when I first sprayed it I gagged.</li>
            <li> This is my moms favorite scent of body spray, so she&#x27;ll be pretty glad that there is an 8 oz.</li>
            <li> It has quickly become my favorite body spray.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is one of my favorite senses.  </li>
            <li> It has a sort of chemical odor to me that is a huge turn-off.</li>
            <li> lol I get compliments almost daily.</li>
            <li> Simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, This body spray straight up smells like medicine.</li>
            <li> and i found a great link that allowed the product to be shipped to my home at the same price it would have cost if i were to purchase it in the store.</li>
            <li> The scent is cheap...</li>
            <li> and I find I like to take a bottle like that and mix that one with Midnight Rose by Tresor and Victoria Beckham&#x27;s Intimately Yours.</li>
            <li> I followed the reviews and most people said they loved it more than Pink Sugar, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews, I must have been sent old stock or diluted bottles.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like cotton candy!!</li>
            <li> This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  </li>
            <li> But it came pretty fast so thats one good thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, sweet and fruity, and I always receive compliments when wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this body spray...</li>
            <li> this is a great value - I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it</li>
            <li> But, I do highly recommend this brand because it isn&#x27;t to over powering and gives a nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li> the old version (maybe 10 years or more) was a better product with stronger scent and it lasted longer</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a nice soft scent!</li>
            <li> Right NOW!</li>
            <li> , Aurora is RIGHT ON!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> Was a gift to my daughter, in my opinion this is too sweet smelling, but, my daughter likes it alot</li>
            <li> Glad I did get this for a friend and was very please with this Body Spray.</li>
            <li> I prefer sweet candy and fruity scents</li>
            <li> But, a Sweet End for me.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was so cool.  </li>
            <li> I love this so much and its so sweet...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back up there, making a special trip, to get this!!!  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t super sweet smelling</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to smell softly sweet &amp; yummy...and as most of the reviewers have said...</li>
            <li> This particular brand and scent is my favorite.</li>
            <li> lucky them.  </li>
            <li> At first it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet and fun and reminds you of summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells sweet and fresh</li>
            <li> I may buy it again at some point but not right now, I own way to many perfumes and what not.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like cotton candy!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t at first!</li>
            <li> REALLY!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light scent and doesn&#x27;t last long, but I feel happy, light and fresh whenever I wear it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle came with a cute little protector for the pump top; since I travel alot, this will come in handy to avoid spillage -- an unexpected plus.</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like cotton candy but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> Smells just like cotton candy fresh off of the machine...</li>
            <li> I used this body spray years ago and remembered how much i liked it recently so decided to place an order.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the plastic cap has pretty fairies dancing on it, which is cool.</li>
            <li> I love natural scents instead of flowery perfumes and this one hits the spot.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no &#x27;artificial&#x27; undertone to it</li>
            <li> If your willing to wait just a short time for it to dry, it will smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this for a friends daughter, but ended up being my favorite scent to wear for several years.  </li>
            <li> Normally you have a strong alcohol scent but this one is out of the world</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy it around here anymore, or only rarely, so the price was higher than I liked but nothing to be done about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a scent/perfume that smells right on like cotton candy...</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for the right brand...</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and I am very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> When you first smell it, it&#x27;s like grape medicine, which is kind of gross.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I barely smell it on myself.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really describe the smell, but  it is sweet, almost a cherry sugar smell?  </li>
            <li> Go by the top, middle and last layer of the kind of stuff</li>
            <li> but this one stays true to how it smells and really does smell like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> This body spray has a rich, sweet and soft scent that provoke the sensation of eating the girl who is wearing it</li>
            <li> There was such a strong alcohol smell!</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and I love the pink.</li>
            <li> and I also use this as air freshener - a spray only lasts 5 minutes or so, but brings back great memories every time you smell it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice and lasts a super long time actually all day!</li>
            <li> I was pretty darn excited when I saw this particular brand/smell on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it and probably the only body spray I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> i wish i had looked there first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to see if it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I unscrewed the lid and smelled it.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I was so glad to finally find it here on amazon!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and it seems amazon is the only place I can get it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok scent but a little too strong smelling for me.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore Body Fantasies&#x27; Cotton Candy Perfume, I had compliments right away, and then it kinda made them crave for some real cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> Its not a heavy scent its light and really smells like cotton candy without the musky undertone.</li>
            <li> Also, my husband is fragrance sensitive and even he has never complained about the scent being too strong.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decide to try this.  </li>
            <li> It smells TOO TOO fruity and very obnoxious.. Can not return it due to hazardous package requirements</li>
            <li> I spray it in the trunk of my car and the scent slowly travels to the front of the car on its own making the experience more natural.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of the beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a true cotton candy scent, so real it practically smells soft like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> i smelled the one in a Japanese store and the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one I got here.</li>
            <li> I have Been Using This Exact Spray Since High School.</li>
            <li> Really like this USA made fragrance.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> You really need to be dedicated to smelling like cotton candy if you wear this.  </li>
            <li> I remember my ex used to wear this, it was a real turn on.</li>
            <li> I really really don&#x27;t like flowery fragrances</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m also an addict of real cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Does it smell like the real thang?</li>
            <li> Smells like the real deal.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation is to go for the cupcake scented body spray by body fantasies (wished I would of) or Aqualinas pink sugar perfume (it smells WAY better then this, and i promise you</li>
            <li> The perfume Aquolina doesn&#x27;t even compare (kinda has a musky scent); Demeter&#x27;s Cotton Candy I do not like a all (doesn&#x27;t really smell like cotton candy); and Prince Matchabelli&#x27;s Cotton Candy Deoderant Can smells (well...just like deoderant.)  </li>
            <li> Both the men and ladies at work tell me how much they want meh after giving myself a spray or two.</li>
            <li> It REALLY woke my senses</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just like the \\&quot;real</li>
            <li> She uses it so much</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to keep putting it on, (even though you don&#x27;t need to because the scent lasts a while) it really lifts your spirits.  </li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price of every other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few candy scented body sprays and perfumes in the past, but this one has to be the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells a little strong at first, but after a few minutes the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it for the bathroom but catch my 9 yr old  misting herself ;)</li>
            <li> I love this spray because it gives me a subtle sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol like most other Cotton Candy scents I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Nice for young ladies and little girls.</li>
            <li> Decent longevity</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any age or for any lifestyle.</li>
            <li> After a little bit, it smells more like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just a perfume for little kids :)</li>
            <li> My little girls love it too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the extra money.)</li>
            <li> Very sweet long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how long-lasting it is!</li>
            <li> not sure if it is alcohol or something to that effect so for me it works better for room scenting.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> She has a small bottle of this cotton candy perfume and I love the way she smells when she puts it on...</li>
            <li> no one wants to smell like they spent to much time at the carnival.</li>
            <li> My order clearly states cotton candy .  </li>
            <li> Lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I used to work with this girl at my old job that always smelled like cotton candy</li>
            <li> People wonder why they smell cotton candy when they are standing near me.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on my whole entire curvy body and the guys can&#x27;t stop sniffing me at work</li>
            <li> new version is maybe a little watered down but still smells amazing and will immediately catch the attention of anyone smelling it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s pretty good after a little bit</li>
            <li> This does not smell the same as my older bottle.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> bottle was little loose at top, and it DOSENOT SMELL as it should</li>
            <li> new version is also a larger bottle - at around $3 per bottle</li>
            <li> and i have never ever had anyone make a negative comment to it being too strong.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with the actual scent of this body body, it has a more synthetic smell than I was expecting</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about it since body sprays and  body washes of the same scent and brand can vary significantly in the way they smell</li>
            <li> at such a great price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I just found it in Dollar General Store today and used the tester.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real stickler for long lasting perfumes, so</li>
            <li> It smells sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for some sweet scents.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on right after my shower at 6:30 am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t long lasting (maybe 1 or 2 hour tops).</li>
            <li> The only problem is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  </li>
            <li> This was a small gift from my husband and was appreciated.</li>
            <li> the one drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long...</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t last long I won&#x27;t wear it.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, it smells nothing like the initial spray.</li>
            <li> long lasting all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a High End fragrance enough for some..</li>
            <li> As much as i do not like to be negative</li>
            <li> I can smell it on me all day long.</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell for long.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something similar to Pink Sugar by Aquolina.</li>
            <li> Another fact, is that the scent lasts a long time, practically all day.</li>
            <li> I use this one, all year long.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time either way</li>
            <li> This seems like a very faint version with a strong alcohol smell!</li>
            <li> The bottle is also sort of oddly shaped which can make it difficult to hold and compress the spray top with one hand.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> The only thing about this that is a downer is that you have you spray it on a a few times through out the day to make the scent last.  </li>
            <li> But spray it all over you, wait a few minutes (5 at the most) for the weird grape medicine smell to go away</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s up with that I can only assume it (feels watered down)</li>
            <li> first I asked my boyfriend what it smelled like, his first thought was grape :-(</li>
            <li> like you would find with other fragrances and it lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li> I had some like it when i was little, so i looked for something similar.</li>
            <li> I bought cotton candy and a cuba - while I LOVE Cuba for me - the cotton candy was a BAD purchase.</li>
            <li> But just because it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy and more like a fruity concoction, doesn&#x27;t make it a bad product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not musky, and lasts on your clothes for longer than i expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Apparently when I used to wear this scent everyday, my friends would tell me they knew when I arrived at school because they could smell me down the hall</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not certain of liking it, check out the discount stores for the sets of three sprays.  </li>
            <li> but remember a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed a little on my wrist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other cotton candy fragrances and decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> If you like synthetic cotton candy and pink sugar this is for you!</li>
            <li> The first time I sprayed it, they fake strawberry-ish scent threw me off.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than other brands</li>
            <li> I use this for an everyday scent, and save the Pink Sugar for evenings, weekends, and occasions.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted to kiss her up and down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watered down, and It lasts like 2 minutes on my skin.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it all the time when I go out, especially when I&#x27;m in a small space like the elevator!</li>
            <li> and this is then only thing I will ever use but its really heard to find in store now for some reason :(</li>
            <li> iv used it since I was little</li>
            <li> and yes a little goes</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect knock-off of Pink Sugar by Aqualina, but it&#x27;s close enough, and a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> it DOES drive guys crazy, but they can&#x27;t quite figure out where the yummy cotton candy scent is coming from, especially when there is no actual cotton candy anywhere to be seen.</li>
            <li> I sometimes spray it at my office, just a few squirts.</li>
            <li> One or two squirts lasts/sticks on your clothing or body for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Just received it in the mail, opened it, and gave it a few sprays...</li>
            <li> I didnt want to waste my money by throwing it away</li>
            <li> Give it a little time!</li>
            <li> This one has very little scent  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds juvenile for a 40</li>
            <li> I usually use body sprays over perfumes because I had the heaviness</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> Then of course as usual, they quit having it</li>
            <li> i have no more to tell.</li>
            <li> I tried a small sample of this when Walmart had it for 99 cents for a small bottle, and was hooked!</li>
            <li> I received this body spray and i can hardly smell the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday body spray!!</li>
            <li> But this was so ridiculously light...and unless you truly imagine cotton candy when you smell it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed has really no smell at all, I will not order from this seller again,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure what happened!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell was too over powering</li>
            <li> People, don&#x27;t purchase perfumes online, they are all fake.</li>
            <li> itt smells terrible and it doesn&#x27;t last!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why it smelled so unpleasant.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has to be a fake product!!</li>
            <li> REALLY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I was SOOO disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Smelt horrible..</li>
            <li> It was awful!  </li>
            <li> hate it!!!</li>
            <li> They smell awful, I so regret getting them.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at all- it smelled more like licorice to me than cotton candy.</li>
            <li> I love the sweetness of this one...it&#x27;s like strawberries and cotton candy...the one drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long...but at this price, I can just reapply it when I need a boost of sweetness.</li>
            <li> The name couldn&#x27;t be any truer to the scent. Smells exactly like cotton candy!! I get compliments on it all the time when I go out, especially when I&#x27;m in a small space like the elevator! Lol :) If you love sweet scents, this is perfect for you. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t long lasting (maybe 1 or 2 hour tops). I know it&#x27;s just a body spray though so what can you expect? If they make a perfume version, I would buy in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Really like this USA made fragrance.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray I use! It doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol like most other Cotton Candy scents I&#x27;ve tried! This is the ONLY scent I use, and I get constant compliments on it! One bottle lasts forever, and it&#x27;s so inexpensive...how could you not just love this? My hair is cotton candy colored...so people love that I smell and look like yummy candy. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This Cotton Candy body spray does indeed smell just as it sounds. Just like cotton candy. Its a very light refreshing scent and the comments you&#x27;ll get from it! Everyone will notice the yummy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THIS SPRAY! I had some like it when i was little, so i looked for something similar. It smells wonderful, and is very realistic (which i didnt expect for the price). It&#x27;s not musky, and lasts on your clothes for longer than i expected. Fantasic!</li>
            <li> Realmente esperaba mas de este producto por los buenos comentarios que lei! Este lo usare porque ya lo compre y no huele mal, solo pense que seria mas dulce y el olor duraria mas tiempo. Definitivamente el ¨Cotton candy¨ no lo compraria otra vez. Intentare con el ¨Sugar Vanilla¨ a ver si me gusta mas.</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like cotton candy but not too sweet. I sometimes spray it at my office, just a few squirts. Everyone loves the scent and wonders where it comes from! I use it more as a room freshener rather than a body spray but I do spray into my hair every once in a while. Lasts a pretty long time. I bought two of these sprays and when they run out will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds juvenile for a 40+ woman to be raving about a cotton candy scent. But I just love, love, love this scent&lt;br /&gt;and I love cotton candy. It smells sweet and fun and reminds you of summer. My teenage daughter loves this too. And the staying power is awesome I can smell it on me all day long. I&#x27;m stacking up on this lolz.</li>
            <li> I bought cotton candy and a cuba - while I LOVE Cuba for me - the cotton candy was a BAD purchase. It smells TOO TOO fruity and very obnoxious.. Can not return it due to hazardous package requirements so I am stuck with it. Looks like we will throw this away... If I could I would give a -5 review on this one...</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect knock-off of Pink Sugar by Aqualina, but it&#x27;s close enough, and a fraction of the cost.  I use this for an everyday scent, and save the Pink Sugar for evenings, weekends, and occasions.  It&#x27;s light, sweet and fruity, and I always receive compliments when wearing it.  If you don&#x27;t have cotton candy lotion, layering it with vanilla works well.  If you&#x27;re not certain of liking it, check out the discount stores for the sets of three sprays.  The bottle came with a cute little protector for the pump top; since I travel alot, this will come in handy to avoid spillage -- an unexpected plus.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find this product in our local stores any longer and decided to try to find it on-line.  My daughter has used it for quite some time now</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago. I&#x27;ve used other cotton candy fragrances and decided to try this one. Its not the best I&#x27;ve used, but definitely not the worst. It has a sort of chemical odor to me that is a huge turn-off. If it weren&#x27;t for that I would have given this 4 stars. The thing is, it does smell like cotton candy, but its a so-so resemblance. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you like synthetic cotton candy and pink sugar this is for you! You can use as body spray or room spray. The bottle is huge and I love the pink.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but constant compliments when I wear this.  Great fragrance.  Can&#x27;t buy it around here anymore, or only rarely, so the price was higher than I liked but nothing to be done about it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t super sweet smelling i smelled the one in a Japanese store and the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as the one I got here. But it came pretty fast so thats one good thing.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE COTTON CANDY BODY SPRAY. IT SMELLS GREAT, AND NOT OVERBEARING.  I USE IT AS A KIND OF COLOGNE FOR WORK. I PUT IT ON MY SKIN AND CLOTHING. THANKS</li>
            <li> This product was almost a one star item for me. The first time I sprayed it, they fake strawberry-ish scent threw me off. I didn&#x27;t understand why it smelled so unpleasant. I almost threw it away, but within a minute, I noticed a lovely cotton candy scent. If your willing to wait just a short time for it to dry, it will smell wonderful! Once it&#x27;s dry, it smells nothing like the initial spray. I get complements on the scent a lot, too. Especially for the price, I highly recommend this product. It has quickly become my favorite body spray.</li>
            <li> the best cotton candy smell I have found yet,it really smells like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> The Fantasy Cotton Candy scent is one of my favorites.  Every time I wear it I always get compliments, every time. It smells just like cotton candy - you can&#x27;t get enough of it.  Many friends of mine went out and bought it and love it too!</li>
            <li> The spray itself I give 2 stars.  If the scent was a bit lighter  my daughter might have liked it.  Unfortunately, the smell was too over powering and she couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell for long.  She actually got headaches.  This problem isn&#x27;t the fault of the spray.  I contacted the seller and they were very helpful.  Customer service was great, I would give them 5 stars on their customer service.</li>
            <li> This is as awesome as raved about. Smells beautiful, lasts all day, and is never over powering.</li>
            <li> You really need to be dedicated to smelling like cotton candy if you wear this.  I know a lot of people say it&#x27;s sexy or whatever, but I found it kind of overwhelmingly powerful, like I had been involved in some kind of industrial accident involving a cotton candy booth at a state fair.  Four stars though because it definitely does what it says on the tin!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing my kids love this product</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCENT! and so does my boyfriend! lol I get compliments almost daily. Its not a heavy scent its light and really smells like cotton candy without the musky undertone. I love it and probably the only body spray I will ever buy. Plus the price is awesome for those on a budget and cant afford 30 dollar bottles of spray ITS PERFECT!</li>
            <li> i remember once i was at walgreens and i saw this and sprayed it and said i loved it</li>
            <li> Very sweet long lasting scent. Smells just like cotton candy fresh off of the machine...Nice for young ladies and little girls.</li>
            <li> i found this same product at Walmart for $6.00. i wish i had looked there first and i would have saved some money but i am looking foward to this smell. several you tubers says its smells like candy and thats what i am looking for!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price of every other fragrance. It&#x27;s not overpowering either. One or two squirts lasts/sticks on your clothing or body for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Love but if you love sweet and suttle this is for you. Lingers all  day but wears off to a very pretty Snooki smell which smells awesome. I use it for the bathroom but catch my 9 yr old  misting herself ;)</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance of all - just loved the cotton candy fragrance. Bought the bath gel and body lotion as well and used every drop of all three.</li>
            <li> Awesome, delicious smelling product!  Smells wonderful just like I remembered from when i wore it 10 years ago!  Always get tons of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few candy scented body sprays and perfumes in the past, but this one has to be the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it DOES drive guys crazy, but they can&#x27;t quite figure out where the yummy cotton candy scent is coming from, especially when there is no actual cotton candy anywhere to be seen. Needless to say, it&#x27;s become my favorite body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at such a great price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this item in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to see that I could get it online.&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite scented body spray.&lt;br /&gt;I always get complimented on it when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I remember my ex used to wear this, it was a real turn on. I always wanted to kiss her up and down. I want to find something similar, but isn&#x27;t cotton candy so that I can make my girlfriend wear it without remembering my ex.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this for a friends daughter, but ended up being my favorite scent to wear for several years.  The guys at work love it, and I always get compliments from strangers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body spray!!  I get more compliments on this spray then I ever have on any perfume.  I really really don&#x27;t like flowery fragrances and I stumbled across this one accidentally and have now been wearing it for years.  Definately recommend this... Calgon makes a cotton candy body spray also, but it is WAY to musky smelling... this one smells like actual cotton candy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Everyone tells me all the time how great I smell and I just love this stuff alot. Deffo be buyin again. Mmmmmmmm. Get it or youll regret it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I think it&#x27;s a nice soft scent! I get lots of compliments! It&#x27;s an everyday body spray!!</li>
            <li> I got curious about this stuff after doin&#x27; an online search for a delicious, dessert scented...scent. The reviews for this stuff were so favorable, I had to find it and try it. Six months later, I have a stash of Body Fantasy Cotton Candy scented lotions, a couple of sprays and a body wash at home. I love this scent. By the way, I&#x27;m also an addict of real cotton candy. Brace yourselves, sisters! You WILL hear plenty of comments from men. You&#x27;ve been warned. The bottle of body spray itself will last for months; even with every day use. If you use the lotion AND the body spray, you&#x27;ll go through about three bottles of the lotion before a bottle of the spray is finished. I&#x27;ve just stumbled upon the gift set containing a body lotion, spray and shower gel. Got it from Kmart this weekend for $12. Really, for a scent this great, you can&#x27;t beat that! It&#x27;s a very light scent. To my delight, I might catch a whiff during the day as I&#x27;m moving around. For the most part, I barely smell it on myself. I was surprised at how long-lasting it is! I usually put it on right after my shower at 6:30 am. At and after 6 pm, I&#x27;m still gettin&#x27; compliments! And this is even BEFORE I started adding the body wash to the layering! Does it smell like the real thang? Yes! Would I recommend it? Not only WOULD I, I AM recommending it. To YOU! Right NOW! (You can thank me later.) :)</li>
            <li> Smells like the real deal.  You will love it and won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite body spray !</li>
            <li> This smells just like cotton candy.  I have migraines and this does not bother them at all.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Its just like a body spray I used to use when I was younger, but that was discontinued. This smells just like it, so I&#x27;m happy :-) and yummy smelling!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells JUST like cotton candy! It takes a minute to settle... but afterwards you will smell SOOO yummy! I&#x27;m in love with this! It&#x27;s very beautiful, if you like Cotton Candy, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> Smells like the intoxicating aroma of  cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Love this fragance. Cheaper than other brands and I love cotton candy!!</li>
            <li> Body fantasies is a very nice scented spray, It does smell like candy, yum.  The price is great  for the size (8 ounces)  I had no idea you could get this at a drugstore, CVS and Walgreens carries them also at a walking distance and no shipping worries hehe. I like this product preferably for room odors...or even the car. I spray it in the trunk of my car and the scent slowly travels to the front of the car on its own making the experience more natural. I do not like spraying it on myself, I do detect a bit of chemical smell..not sure if it is alcohol or something to that effect so for me it works better for room scenting. Delivery was fast and I am very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on the way i smell all the time; i seriously love this stuff! I just wish it was stronger, and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> this is the only body spray / perfume I use.. iv used it since I was little and this is then only thing I will ever use but its really heard to find in store now for some reason :(</li>
            <li> I spray my clothes and my daughter&#x27;s clothes with this every day and we ALWAYS get compliments. An excellent conversation starter!</li>
            <li> I receive more compliments  when I wear this than with my $75+ Eau De Parfums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s smells sweet and fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Decent longevity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Anyone youthful minded/spirited can wear this</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this body spray...and then my bubble was just burst. Just received it in the mail, opened it, and gave it a few sprays... I usually use body sprays over perfumes because I had the heaviness and I like to reapply. But this was so ridiculously light...and unless you truly imagine cotton candy when you smell it...it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy....first I asked my boyfriend what it smelled like, his first thought was grape :-( and I totally purchased this because cotton candy is his fav. smell. I felt like I needed a second opinion so I asked my mom...she said it smelled like sweetarts or pez candy.... My recommendation is to go for the cupcake scented body spray by body fantasies (wished I would of) or Aqualinas pink sugar perfume (it smells WAY better then this, and i promise you it&#x27;s worth the extra money.)</li>
            <li> Love this Cotton Candy fragrance.  Can&#x27;t really describe the smell, but  it is sweet, almost a cherry sugar smell?  anyway, I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not the only one that didn&#x27;t check out this product becuase of Swoozie from YT. I&#x27;m about to see if it&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> Smelt horrible.. This has to be a fake product!!</li>
            <li> With a touch of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love it. I sprayed it in my room this morning before I left for work and I could smell it when I got home 9 hours later.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decide to try this.  When it first arrived, I unscrewed the lid and smelled it.  It was awful!  Smelled like mostly alcohol.  However, when you spray it on yourself, it transforms into a wonderful, cotton candy fragrance!  It&#x27;s a light scent and doesn&#x27;t last long, but I feel happy, light and fresh whenever I wear it.  I ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> This particular brand and scent is my favorite. I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for years and will continue to purchase it from Amazon every time I run out of it. I hope Amazon continues to sell this product.</li>
            <li> Love this body spray.  Smells just like cotton candy and not too strong.  Whenever I&#x27;m out I always see people looking for the cotton candy machine.</li>
            <li> Was a gift to my daughter, in my opinion this is too sweet smelling, but, my daughter likes it alot</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> too me it smells appropriate for girls 10-13, but i don&#x27;t know any girls that age who wear perfume.  Maybe i just doesn&#x27;t smell inspiring to me.  :/</li>
            <li> When I was younger I bought this at one point and I loved it! I also got multiple compliments about it. This was when. I was way younger so it was my only body mist I owned at the time, and surprisingly it lasted me (the bottle did) for a good couple years until I threw it out. I may buy it again at some point but not right now, I own way to many perfumes and what not. But, I do highly recommend this brand because it isn&#x27;t to over powering and gives a nice sweet smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with the actual scent of this body body, it has a more synthetic smell than I was expecting but it was cheaper so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This product has a great smell but fades to nothing within an hour.  The bottle is also sort of oddly shaped which can make it difficult to hold and compress the spray top with one hand.</li>
            <li> So this scent brings back the girls bathroom in eight grade. Its a great scent but remember a little goes a long way and no one wants to smell like they spent to much time at the carnival.</li>
            <li> Simply fantastic. A little goes a long way, smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have Been Using This Exact Spray Since High School.I havent Changed My perfume Scent,and Not Planning too.This Is The Best Perfume Ever,Im Stacked With It...</li>
            <li> I love this so much and its so sweet...  When I saw it in stores it was great to have and use. This smells so nice like you want to eat your self up and can&#x27;t wait to get more, Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> It actually smells like grape candy. I was hoping for something similar to Pink Sugar by Aquolina. I followed the reviews and most people said they loved it more than Pink Sugar, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When you first smell it, it&#x27;s like grape medicine, which is kind of gross. After a little bit, it smells more like cotton candy. I don&#x27;t hate it, I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s pretty good after a little bit</li>
            <li> I used this body spray years ago and remembered how much i liked it recently so decided to place an order.  STILL AMAZING AS EVER!  One of my favorite scented body spray of all time</li>
            <li> This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  Really glad I got it, and the price is veerrrryyy affordable.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a scent/perfume that smells right on like cotton candy...and this was definitely it.  The perfume Aquolina doesn&#x27;t even compare (kinda has a musky scent); Demeter&#x27;s Cotton Candy I do not like a all (doesn&#x27;t really smell like cotton candy); and Prince Matchabelli&#x27;s Cotton Candy Deoderant Can smells (well...just like deoderant.)  The first day I wore Body Fantasies&#x27; Cotton Candy Perfume, I had compliments right away, and then it kinda made them crave for some real cotton candy.  Lol.  The only thing about this that is a downer is that you have you spray it on a a few times through out the day to make the scent last.  But anyway, it \\&quot;is\\&quot; is Body Mist/Spray and not a Perfume.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I RECOMMEND EVERYONR TO TRY IT... IT IS A SOFT WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE... ONCE YOU TRY IT LIKE IT DID YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> yummy fragrance.... cotton candy.... lovely!</li>
            <li> It makes me hungry just using this spray. The resemblance to bubblegum cotton candy is amazing AND it lasts all day! If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this then buy it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best body mist I&#x27;ve tried, of three. It smells as good as Prince Matchabelli, and the alcohol doesn&#x27;t choke me.  This is a fine brand and a great smelling cotton candy spray.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend and we loved it. This body spray has a rich, sweet and soft scent that provoke the sensation of eating the girl who is wearing it (LOL). Another fact, is that the scent lasts a long time, practically all day.</li>
            <li> Both the men and ladies at work tell me how much they want meh after giving myself a spray or two. I love it. Cotton Candy sent os on point.</li>
            <li> I once gotten cotton candy body wash for $1 at Target, in their $1 area. It REALLY woke my senses UP!&lt;br /&gt;So, Aurora is RIGHT ON! This stuff is something to have.&lt;br /&gt;I do not doubt the reviewers who speak of women getting compliments over this, because this is YUMMY!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and the vanilla kind. You&#x27;ll find your scents for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the vanilla, this deserves waaaaay more than five stars!</li>
            <li> This product is very, very strong! It&#x27;s an ok scent but a little too strong smelling for me. It takes 1 spray, anymore then that and people will be gagging!</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews...i noticed one reviewer who said the scent was too strong. I have been using this product for many years and i have never ever had anyone make a negative comment to it being too strong. Also, my husband is fragrance sensitive and even he has never complained about the scent being too strong. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to smell softly sweet &amp; yummy...and as most of the reviewers have said...it&#x27;s just like the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; cotton candy smell. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted. Love this stuff! :)</li>
            <li> Smells like the bubble gum laughing gas the dentist puts on your nose when your a child. EXACTLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I was pretty darn excited when I saw this particular brand/smell on amazon. This is my moms favorite scent of body spray, so she&#x27;ll be pretty glad that there is an 8 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> They have changed the packaging on this product but the original is the best one  it has a strong cotton candy smell</li>
            <li> Came fast, smells great, lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> People, don&#x27;t purchase perfumes online, they are all fake. I received this body spray and i can hardly smell the scent. It&#x27;s watered down, and It lasts like 2 minutes on my skin. REALLY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like cotton candy!  Take me to The State Fair!  Smells sweet and feels light and refreshing !</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter i thought it would smell good it does not.. It Doesn&#x27;t smell nothing like cotton candy it smells like a strong alcohol smell</li>
            <li> I have this spray and it smells sooooooooooooooooooooooo good and yes a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed a little on my wrist and i can still smell it 5 hours later</li>
            <li> purchase this as a gift and my friend love the Body Fantasies Body Spray for Women, Cotton Candy Fantasy Fragrance. Glad I did get this for a friend and was very please with this Body Spray.</li>
            <li> hate it!!! i worn this and when i spray it my friends cringe...itt smells terrible and it doesn&#x27;t last!! I didnt want to waste my money by throwing it away so i mix it with perfume or body spray!!!</li>
            <li> As much as i do not like to be negative I have to be honest, This body spray straight up smells like medicine. It doesn&#x27;t even get better. i would not purchase again. But hey, someone else might like it?</li>
            <li> Just got it and it&#x27;s almost done already! She uses it so much and I never get tired of the beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best Smell Ever. Big girls should smell like snacks I always say and this does just that. It&#x27;s not just a perfume for little kids :)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like cotton candy. I would say it smells like some kind of raspberry candy.  It&#x27;s till smells good, though. Just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I switch between the apple sugar and the cotton candy. Both scents mix well with my own chemistry. Neither are overpowering. A joy to wear!</li>
            <li> Smells just like cotton candy. Love it! My little girls love it too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell  of cotton candy and this spray does an excellent job of emulating it! I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;m a sucker for some sweet scents.This Body Fantasies Body Spray. .Cotton Candy has been a fav..flav...for many years on me. Go by the top, middle and last layer of the kind of stuff you  spray, dash, dot and rub on you always. Some fragrances are seasonal for a good reason. I use this one, all year long. I prefer sweet candy and fruity scents It&#x27;s not a High End fragrance enough for some..But, a Sweet End for me.</li>
            <li> It is a great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend loves this stuff and it is not sold locally.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this everywere for my Wife. She has a small bottle of this cotton candy perfume and I love the way she smells when she puts it on...</li>
            <li> This is a true cotton candy scent, so real it practically smells soft like cotton candy.  You&#x27;ll want to keep putting it on, (even though you don&#x27;t need to because the scent lasts a while) it really lifts your spirits.  Plus, the plastic cap has pretty fairies dancing on it, which is cool.</li>
            <li> I used to work with this girl at my old job that always smelled like cotton candy and I thought it was so cool.  I never got the chance to ask her what it was she was wearing, but it was obviously this!  I just found it in Dollar General Store today and used the tester.  This smells JUST LIKE COTTON CANDY!!!  I put one in my cart to buy and checked out, but then when I got home it wasn&#x27;t in the bag.  I was SOOO disappointed!  It wasn&#x27;t on the receipt either, which means it must have fallen out of my cart...it never made it to the checkout!  I&#x27;m going back up there, making a special trip, to get this!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to hear the comments from the people at work!</li>
            <li> I love this spray because it gives me a subtle sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume. It makes people think I have been baking or making candy. I love natural scents instead of flowery perfumes and this one hits the spot. I would highly recommend this to any age or for any lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents and i found a great link that allowed the product to be shipped to my home at the same price it would have cost if i were to purchase it in the store.I alse recieved my order in about a week.</li>
            <li> At first it was fabulous. I don&#x27;t know what happened. After a week or so it has a STRONG smell of alcohol. Not when you spray it in the air- but when you spray it on you. Normally you have a strong alcohol scent but this one is out of the world strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the scent reveals itself in about fifteen minutes and then it&#x27;s lovely again and everyone loves you.</li>
            <li> I think this scent is genius.  People wonder why they smell cotton candy when they are standing near me.  They love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from this vendor, but I just wanted to drop a bit of advice for those who don&#x27;t think it smells like cotton candy! It doesn&#x27;t at first! You&#x27;re right! But spray it all over you, wait a few minutes (5 at the most) for the weird grape medicine smell to go away and then you literally smell like spun sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so affordable and amazing, please never discontinue this!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites and my daughter loves it too, I bought it for her and she is always spraying it lol</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells just like Cotton Candy! My nine year old daughter doesn&#x27;t quite agree but still thinks it smells great. I love the idea of a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower, body mists are great for that. This was a small gift from my husband and was appreciated.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is one of my favorite senses.  It is nice to wear a fragrance again that I like.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my locker at school and I always put it on because my crush calls me cotton candy now!!!</li>
            <li> I love this body spray I think I bought four bottles of this stuff. My husband loves the smell. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells just like cotton candy. Also, be prepared for a lot of compliments, girls think this smell is pretty good, but guys LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Smells Delicious. She loves it. I love it on her and cuddle and snuggle and you know what lol. Good buy good price. Everyones happy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent! I tried a small sample of this when Walmart had it for 99 cents for a small bottle, and was hooked! Then of course as usual, they quit having it and I could not find it anywhere at any store! I was so glad to finally find it here on amazon! Bought plenty of them so I won&#x27;t run out again. Nice light cotton candy smell that doesn&#x27;t take over and overpower you like perfume does and reminds me of being at the carnival or the fair. Smells just like cotton candy. Love it, it&#x27;s my very favorite!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure what happened!!! I have ordered this before and loved it,,,my bottle was little loose at top, and it DOSENOT SMELL as it should, I ordered from another seller,and loved it. This one has very little scent  what&#x27;s up with that I can only assume it (feels watered down) REALLY!! I am disappointed has really no smell at all, I will not order from this seller again,</li>
            <li> I love it does smell great but the only problem is this does not have the scent of cotton candy i used to buy this body spray at Rite Aid was expecting this to smell like the one at Rite Aid before they stop selling this product.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I got the Body Fantasies cotton candy body wash and I loved the scent so much that I wanted to get more. However, as a gift, I had received the body spray instead. I was a little hesitant about it since body sprays and  body washes of the same scent and brand can vary significantly in the way they smell but the moment I caught the scent, I couldn&#x27;t get enough of it! It smells sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The scent is just as you would imagine cotton candy to smell. There&#x27;s no &#x27;artificial&#x27; undertone to it like you would find with other fragrances and it lasts a long time on the skin. As an added bonus, the price is very cheap so your wallet will be very happy, too. I will definitely be repurchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> SMELLS SWEET AND NICE LIKE A GIRL.... D D D D D D D D  D D D D D</li>
            <li> luv,luv the smell of this stuff it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The scent is cheap... Really. Not like it at all.</li>
            <li> But just because it doesn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy and more like a fruity concoction, doesn&#x27;t make it a bad product. Just should be called something else like passion fruit. It lasts a long time either way and I find I like to take a bottle like that and mix that one with Midnight Rose by Tresor and Victoria Beckham&#x27;s Intimately Yours. It makes my own scent that I get a lot of compliments on at work and they ask what I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;m like... &amp;#34;Stephanie... by Stephanie.&amp;#34; :-P</li>
            <li> It came very fast and was packaged nicely. Smells fantastic! The bottle is a good size and very cute. :)</li>
            <li> ALL my coworkers say I smell just like cotton candy . I absolutely love this product. I spray it on my whole entire curvy body and the guys can&#x27;t stop sniffing me at work lol</li>
            <li> the old version (maybe 10 years or more) was a better product with stronger scent and it lasted longer - walmart used to sell these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this new version is maybe a little watered down but still smells amazing and will immediately catch the attention of anyone smelling it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent as body spray and I also use this as air freshener - a spray only lasts 5 minutes or so, but brings back great memories every time you smell it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this new version is also a larger bottle - at around $3 per bottle this is a great value - I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and it seems amazon is the only place I can get it.  lucky them.  if you love cotton candy this Is the fragrance for you.</li>
            <li> Apparently when I used to wear this scent everyday, my friends would tell me they knew when I arrived at school because they could smell me down the hall haha. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this  product!!!!!  It smells great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot either. The scent lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> This does not smell the same as my older bottle. This seems like a very faint version with a strong alcohol smell!</li>
            <li> This body spray smells really good, sweet, exactly like cotton candy.  The only problem is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  I&#x27;m a real stickler for long lasting perfumes, so if it doesn&#x27;t last long I won&#x27;t wear it.  I gave it to my granddaughter and she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product because of all the good reviews. I even bought two, confident that I would love it. I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews, I must have been sent old stock or diluted bottles. They smell nothing like cotton candy. They smell awful, I so regret getting them. I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for the right brand...</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on it from people at work. I have never found a scent that truly smells good on me but this one stays true to how it smells and really does smell like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> The product is good and delivery was on time~ I have always loved this smell and very pleasant not so strong you can not stand it. Very nice and lasts a super long time actually all day!</li>
            <li> I love this body spray. It smells sweet and lovely. I always get asked what I am wearing when I put this on. It smells a little strong at first, but after a few minutes the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product! When it arrived it came in a nice size, but when I first sprayed it I gagged. There was such a strong alcohol smell! After about five minutes though it smelled FABULOUS! Sooo good. It lasted about 6 hours so pretty good! Give it a little time!</li>
            <li> smells just like it i have no more to tell. would buy again for sure. long lasting all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unpleased with this purchase because instead of receiving cotton candy I was shipped a raspberry scent.  My order clearly states cotton candy .  At this point I will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go people say, &amp;#34;I smell cotton candy!&amp;#34; They ask me if I just had some. I say that I can&#x27;y eat iy i am diabeyic, but I can wear it.</li>
