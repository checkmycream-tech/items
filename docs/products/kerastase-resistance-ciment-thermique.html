            <li>I love Kerastase products, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Every time I have taken a break from it, my hair gets damaged faster and has more split ends from heat styling.</li>
            <li>It has more moisture after styling and that is helping everything.</li>
            <li>, my stylist commented on how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li>This product was the biggest change to my hair routine, so it must get most of the credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for the price i was expecting way better results</li>
            <li>Her hair looks better and feels softer.</li>
            <li>and I love this after shower treatment.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it like a styling gel for his ever thinning top head curls...</li>
            <li>I love it for its healthy hair feel.</li>
            <li>Helps take away the frizz and leave it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Love this .make</li>
            <li>hair looks healthy and</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>formulas, or expired formulas that may not be safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>

            <li>love, love, love this leave in product that is applied to washed and conditioned hair.</li>

            <li>had much more split ends and damage to my hair before I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it whenever I wash my hair as a &amp;#34;leave</li>
            <li>but I wished it helped out with frizz issues more.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have had this product many years ago.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m going to order more of Kerastase Paris Resistance Climent Thermique.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product and will buy again when I run out of it</li>
            <li>Since using this product, my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in years.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist talked me into buying it, but, buying through Amazon, a much better price.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad item was not a gift.</li>
            <li>I am loving that the seller sent it to me right away!</li>
            <li>This stuff has a nice smell and makes you feel like you are doing something special for your hair.</li>
            <li>a pretty good product with a hefty price tag</li>
            <li>This is the best hair treatment for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>This smells great and makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and keeps my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and heard from them very quickly when I asked the question.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s to strong</li>
            <li>It does smell strongly like pine trees (?)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, I love how it makes my hair soft and smooth, and I love that it&#x27;s protecting my hair as I use the hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is... interesting, but not bad.</li>
            <li>It is very light &amp; creamy, need a small amount for a great result!</li>
            <li>The smell is of amazing fresh cucumbers..very clean.  </li>
            <li>I have curly and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is shoulder length and bleached.</li>
            <li>Mine is fine and it seems to give my hair some weight and thickness.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>quick delivery, even got some samples with my package !</li>
            <li>It adds body to my straight, fine hair and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I still have to use coconut oil to smooth my hair after I finish styling it.</li>
            <li>Great product, has immensely improved the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>so important in a hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually really light</li>
            <li>and that is when I really saw that the product was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or cause build up.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after using sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and silky and</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair looking smooth and smells</li>
            <li>As soon as my mom came home she asked what I did to my hair, that it looked so smooth and cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This line is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using this or because I&#x27;m using sulfate free shampoo (&amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I will admit, I&#x27;m a hair product junkie - always on the lookout for the newest &amp; best product for my superfine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>My hair so very, very soft, and nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I saw a significant difference in my hair when I didn&#x27;t use it for a while.  </li>
            <li>I go through it, but it is soooo worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price.</li>
            <li>Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price</li>
            <li>I got mine and was glad with the result the first days.</li>
            <li>I purchased many, many Keratase products, and my results were mediocre, at best.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, manageable &amp; provides great hold, all day long!</li>
            <li>The shampoo has helped my hair a great deal, but it does dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>Super light.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>, I washed my hair and dried it as best as I could with a towel and applied about  quarter worth.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this, my hair is super silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to spend this much money on a product I want to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>Ordered the bigger size realized how good the product was.</li>
            <li>Sure the price is kinda high but its sooo worth it!</li>
            <li>Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale.</li>
            <li>First let me say I would&#x27;ve never thought to buy a creamy milk product to use in my fine hair until my stylist used it on me.</li>
            <li>loyal to this product.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased and despite the price will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the manufacturer changed something in the formula, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well and the smell is more citrus rather than a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>For most of my life my hair has been very thick, with beautiful waves.  </li>
            <li>I know how great it is on keeping your hair safe when you dry it &amp; use your flat iron on it afterwards.</li>
            <li>With my fine hair and constant struggle to get the right look while having my hair healthy, Kerastase is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>Tried it a few times, and it worked great...</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner is amazing too.  </li>
            <li>Again it is prciey but worth the price</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment for the health of your hair.</li>
            <li>sooo worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>info that is embossed along the top crimped edge of the tube was burned/scratched off completely.  </li>
            <li>When I originally purchased this product (admittedly about 6 months ago), I used it as a heat protectant against blow drying and another brand&#x27;s serum for flat iron protection, and I was less than impressed, so I didn&#x27;t use again for awhile.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed a different and my hair is softer and more managable because of it!</li>
            <li>I also believe the thermall protecing capacity to be superior to other products and here&#x27;s why:  </li>
            <li>Then I use Keratase Ciment Thermique as a thermal guard when flat ironing and I love the results:  my hair has better texture, shine and style-control than ever and the smell is subtle yet pleasant.</li>
            <li>The shipper is SUPER FAST - my order was here within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it leave my hair soft, silky and shiny but it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of weird residue.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of using this product, it completely made my hair smooth, soft, and strong.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li>if your looking to get your product fast DONT shop here!</li>
            <li>This was the first Kerastase product I bought.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past purchased at a salon, and I cannot tell ANY difference in the packaging, consistency, smell, and most importantly, the results!  </li>
            <li>but overall is an ok product</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair light and soft.</li>
            <li>Product arrive amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s not wrong.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to straight iron every day... not any longer!  </li>
            <li>a walnut-sized amount of the product onto your finger tips, rub it a bit between your fingers, and then massage the product into the tips of your hair where damage is most likely to occur.</li>
            <li>so obviously I really like it!</li>
            <li>Maybe reminds me of Christmas?  ; )</li>
            <li>; shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;this was my first time using it</li>
            <li>(my hair is still pretty damaged from the relaxer).  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and will never hold a curl, or even stay straight when I use my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair with more texture, so I can curl it and use a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li>Turns out the magic doesn&#x27;t happen until the flat iron.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say this product eliminates all the frizz, but my hair stays healthy looking despite flat iron use on humid days.  </li>
            <li>My hair became very silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>100% worth the high price</li>
            <li>I love using it, and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>First purchase this product at my local salon,  very expensive!!!&lt;br /&gt;Had not intended to buy again because of the price, but was surprised to find that not only did it smell great but my hair ( after being hi-lighted) did not feel like straw after use instead silky soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair feeling soft and full of volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not greasy or heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li>this large quantity at first&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>I had to use a large hazelnut size, and it looked my hair</li>
            <li>, My hair stylist recommended me this product, have been using it for last one month and feel my hair does not get damaged using hair iron now after rubbing my hair with a little \\&quot;thermique\\&quot;,all in all I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase products and was not disappointed to buy Kerastase Thermique reconstructor milk, my hair has become real frizzy and dry with constant coloring</li>
            <li>There really is such a huge difference in the resulting look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>You apply it after showering while your hair is still wet, but make sure to not use too much.</li>
            <li>This leave-in really made a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>but after about 3 uses this product really turned it around.</li>
            <li>Apart from some shine, I really didn&#x27;t see anything.</li>
            <li>You really need to get the moisture out of you hair before applying this or it won&#x27;t penetrate the hair shaft as well.</li>
            <li>but that is just way too much</li>
            <li>I recently found out how important it is to put some sort of heat protection in my hair and have been using this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it completely.</li>
            <li>This seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve recently replaced with a masque and essential oils) but a great product overall.</li>
            <li>I had never used a treatment like this before, but I have really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I was noticing some breakage, but since I started using this I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>My hair blows out without frizz and so straight.</li>
            <li>we know will be used and appreciated.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Use the whole line (except the shampoo).  </li>
            <li>Absorbs fast, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with hair control.  </li>
            <li>I now use the whole line.</li>
            <li>This treatment did not do much for my hair in the way of repairing it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and looks like I left the salon.  </li>
            <li>I put this stuff on (dont need much) then put on paul mitchell serum.  </li>
            <li>the split ends have reduced so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned from experience that using too much of this product will make your hair greasy and necessitate washing it sooner than you would otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I really like it, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is almost as soft and smooth as after a professional blow out.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it surprised me and actually worked as promised!</li>
            <li>lasts a long time and the results are silky hair that is easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I inially thought this product was for making my hair smooth and straight but is supose to be used to help your hair before you use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>my hair is almost to my butt, long and strong.  </li>
            <li>Almost eliminates the damage,protects and smells great plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair shinier and more manageable than before, making it safer to use a hair dryer and/or other heat styling</li>
            <li>I need to use this, another anti-frizz product and a rich finishing cream for my hair to be only somewhat manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using the Ciment Thermique for a few years after damaging my hair from hot irons and color.</li>
            <li>I have to constantly blow dry my hair, and this kerastase product does an amazing job of protecting my hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of this conditioner and noticed a huge difference when I used this.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended it for fine dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Left my fine hair soft and protected from heat of dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li>Use a little extra the first few times if your hair is super damaged to help jump start the process - I can not say enough wonderful things about this product - I have purchased it for all the women in my family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a comment from my wife: It is great for hard worked hair.</li>
            <li>and there it was at half the price :)</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this product can improve your hair only after you&#x27;ve subjected your hair to a tremendous amount of heat...</li>
            <li>and I use only a quarter size mid hair to ends (mostly on my ends).</li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended it to protect my hair from heat styling (also, she said not to bother using it if you don&#x27;t plan to blow dry/heat style your hair that day, because that is its main purpose).  </li>
            <li>I can see why they use the word &amp;#34;resistance&amp;#34; in the name as it completely sat on top of my hair and resisted mixing into my hair like shampoos and conditioners are expected to.</li>
            <li>Is like using a regular conditioner, but doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fragile at this time.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When I wash it the first day, it&#x27;s beautiful, but the second day the curls are not very well defined and my hair gets messy.</li>
            <li>This product is ok when I use the flat iron, but the instructions mentioned that the anti-breakage protection effect last for one shampoo, and in my case that&#x27;s not true, maybe with the continuos use, this situation get better.</li>
            <li>I realize that not all products work for all hair types, but I would highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
            <li>I should also mention I also use Kerastase Specifique Bain Exfoliant Hydratant Shampoo, usually shampoo 2x then use Kerastase Lait Cristalliste conditioner which is perfect for long hair with oily/dandruff scalp and dry ends.</li>
            <li>I put a very generous amount in my freshly washed hair, blowdry and flat iron</li>
            <li>Then I applied a good amount of this, blow dried, and flat ironed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a thick consistency.</li>
            <li>found out that if I apply this after I have dried my hair 80% of the way it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thin and easily damaged by any heat.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve never spent much time on my hair, so this seemed a bit much to me.  </li>
            <li>I normally leave it on after I shower and</li>
            <li>it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper....</li>
            <li>Everything they make is super concentrated so it lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Box was in rough condition and plastic wrap was ripped and looked like it was re-wrapped (it may have been original wrap).</li>
            <li>While the photo on Amazon shows the old style tube, the new tube provides for a little more product.</li>
            <li>I had a good laugh the other day as I looked around my bathroom at all the shampoos, conditioners and hair products I&#x27;ve bought over the last few months while on the quest to find something comparable to (but cheaper than) Kerastase.</li>
            <li>The difference in my hair over the last few months since using it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>MY hair looks great just from a blow dry and a big round brush.</li>
            <li>As I get older and go grey, however, my hair is becoming much more frizzy, damaged and broken.</li>
            <li>This product is super for dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>In using this product on a regular basis (with each blow dry), for the first time in my adult life, my hair felt like the soft, smooth texture I always wanted it to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty damaged by daily wear and tear of washing, drying, and flat-ironing.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It never gets old!  </li>
            <li>so silky soft for days!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, highlighted blonde hair</li>
            <li>I have long very straight hair, but sometimes need to use a flat iron to get that extra smooth look.  </li>
            <li>What you see in other people reviews is exactly right!</li>
            <li>It significantly cuts down on breakage...</li>
            <li>A girlfriend suggested it to me because he normally blowdries and flat irons her hair everyday, but it was always healthy.</li>
            <li>t is hard to find in the store so I am glad I can buy it on line.</li>
            <li>I have long, bleach blonde, very fine hair (aka very dry, damaged hair).  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but it doesn&#x27;t take much product, and will last a while.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>, i didnt get that wow effect i was hoping for</li>
            <li>so I was really surprised when this didn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see th Keratase on here.</li>
            <li>I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am completely hooked and plan to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and like to fuzz when I&#x27;m in humidity or rain.  </li>
            <li>I started at the tips and worked up, especially the damaged and very brittle</li>
            <li>when using other thermal products, my hair would be very hot to the touch after one pass (iron set at 350-375), but with Keratase Ciment, my hair is noticably cooler to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, one bottle of Ciment Thermique is going to last you a long time and be well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended i&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like this product- not very heavy and smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is prone to split ends, especially as I do a balayage a few times a year to brighten the color.</li>
            <li>The consistency is fabulous and you only need a little to produce the desired effect.  </li>
            <li>wow!  I like to swim in salt water and have had several Keratin treatments diminished even with all the protection I use before a swim.  </li>
            <li>Have tried a lot of other products looking for the miracle that will make my hair sleek and straight, and I don&#x27;t think that exists!  </li>
            <li>I have a Brazilian Blowout in my hair from a few months ago and first use of this product made it look brand new.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, wavy hair that has a tendency to frizz in humidity.  </li>
            <li>could have used  even more, but I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li>You only need a little on the very ends, too much and your volume disappears.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the steep price and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t do as much for fly-a-ways as I had expected.</li>
            <li>It is actually shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the products are not cheap, but the quality you get is so worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality conditioner to apply to damp hair before blowing dry.  </li>
            <li>I love making soft, beachy waves with a diffuser, and I just apply a tiny bit (it says \\&quot;walnut-sized amount,\\&quot; ridiculous!)</li>
            <li>I use this product with Moroccan Oil when I blow dry my hair straight and it makes such a difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair actually feels significantly healthier after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated so a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about what I put in my hair and have done some product reviewing on Amazon with five stars being few and far between.</li>
            <li>So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Works really well with my hair, which is fine but also thick, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but is enough to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>When I was at the blow dry stage I was worried, since I was FEELING a lot of improvement (very soft), but not seeing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>I washed it, let it air dry, and laughed at all my friends who spent absurd amounts of money and time on their hair and the products they put in, on and around it.  </li>
            <li>Blow dry completely, then use a flat iron to activate or \\&quot;cement\\&quot; the Kerastase smoother into place.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Every time I have taken a break from it, my hair gets damaged faster and has more split ends from heat styling.</li>
            <li> It has more moisture after styling and that is helping everything.</li>
            <li> , my stylist commented on how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li> This product was the biggest change to my hair routine, so it must get most of the credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Her hair looks better and feels softer.</li>
            <li> and I love this after shower treatment.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it like a styling gel for his ever thinning top head curls...</li>
            <li> I love it for its healthy hair feel.</li>
            <li> Helps take away the frizz and leave it more manageable.  </li>

            <li> had much more split ends and damage to my hair before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it whenever I wash my hair as a &amp;#34;leave</li>
            <li> but I wished it helped out with frizz issues more.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have had this product many years ago.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m going to order more of Kerastase Paris Resistance Climent Thermique.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product and will buy again when I run out of it</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in years.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist talked me into buying it, but, buying through Amazon, a much better price.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad item was not a gift.</li>
            <li> I am loving that the seller sent it to me right away!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a nice smell and makes you feel like you are doing something special for your hair.</li>
            <li> a pretty good product with a hefty price tag</li>
            <li> This is the best hair treatment for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This smells great and makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and keeps my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and heard from them very quickly when I asked the question.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s to strong</li>
            <li> It does smell strongly like pine trees (?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, I love how it makes my hair soft and smooth, and I love that it&#x27;s protecting my hair as I use the hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is... interesting, but not bad.</li>
            <li> It is very light &amp; creamy, need a small amount for a great result!</li>
            <li> The smell is of amazing fresh cucumbers..very clean.  </li>
            <li> I have curly and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is shoulder length and bleached.</li>
            <li> Mine is fine and it seems to give my hair some weight and thickness.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> quick delivery, even got some samples with my package !</li>
            <li> It adds body to my straight, fine hair and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I still have to use coconut oil to smooth my hair after I finish styling it.</li>
            <li> Great product, has immensely improved the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> so important in a hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually really light</li>
            <li> and that is when I really saw that the product was amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or cause build up.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after using sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky and</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair looking smooth and smells</li>
            <li> As soon as my mom came home she asked what I did to my hair, that it looked so smooth and cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This line is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using this or because I&#x27;m using sulfate free shampoo (&amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I will admit, I&#x27;m a hair product junkie - always on the lookout for the newest &amp; best product for my superfine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> My hair so very, very soft, and nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I saw a significant difference in my hair when I didn&#x27;t use it for a while.  </li>
            <li> I go through it, but it is soooo worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price.</li>
            <li> Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price</li>
            <li> I got mine and was glad with the result the first days.</li>
            <li> I purchased many, many Keratase products, and my results were mediocre, at best.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, manageable &amp; provides great hold, all day long!</li>
            <li> The shampoo has helped my hair a great deal, but it does dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> Super light.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> , I washed my hair and dried it as best as I could with a towel and applied about  quarter worth.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, my hair is super silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to spend this much money on a product I want to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> Ordered the bigger size realized how good the product was.</li>
            <li> Sure the price is kinda high but its sooo worth it!</li>
            <li> Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale.</li>
            <li> First let me say I would&#x27;ve never thought to buy a creamy milk product to use in my fine hair until my stylist used it on me.</li>
            <li> loyal to this product.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased and despite the price will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the manufacturer changed something in the formula, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well and the smell is more citrus rather than a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> For most of my life my hair has been very thick, with beautiful waves.  </li>
            <li> I know how great it is on keeping your hair safe when you dry it &amp; use your flat iron on it afterwards.</li>
            <li> With my fine hair and constant struggle to get the right look while having my hair healthy, Kerastase is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times, and it worked great...</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner is amazing too.  </li>
            <li> Again it is prciey but worth the price</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment for the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> sooo worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> info that is embossed along the top crimped edge of the tube was burned/scratched off completely.  </li>
            <li> When I originally purchased this product (admittedly about 6 months ago), I used it as a heat protectant against blow drying and another brand&#x27;s serum for flat iron protection, and I was less than impressed, so I didn&#x27;t use again for awhile.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed a different and my hair is softer and more managable because of it!</li>
            <li> I also believe the thermall protecing capacity to be superior to other products and here&#x27;s why:  </li>
            <li> Then I use Keratase Ciment Thermique as a thermal guard when flat ironing and I love the results:  my hair has better texture, shine and style-control than ever and the smell is subtle yet pleasant.</li>
            <li> The shipper is SUPER FAST - my order was here within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it leave my hair soft, silky and shiny but it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of weird residue.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of using this product, it completely made my hair smooth, soft, and strong.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li> if your looking to get your product fast DONT shop here!</li>
            <li> This was the first Kerastase product I bought.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past purchased at a salon, and I cannot tell ANY difference in the packaging, consistency, smell, and most importantly, the results!  </li>
            <li> but overall is an ok product</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair light and soft.</li>
            <li> Product arrive amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s not wrong.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to straight iron every day... not any longer!  </li>
            <li> a walnut-sized amount of the product onto your finger tips, rub it a bit between your fingers, and then massage the product into the tips of your hair where damage is most likely to occur.</li>
            <li> so obviously I really like it!</li>
            <li> Maybe reminds me of Christmas?  ; )</li>
            <li> ; shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;this was my first time using it</li>
            <li> (my hair is still pretty damaged from the relaxer).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and will never hold a curl, or even stay straight when I use my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair with more texture, so I can curl it and use a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li> Turns out the magic doesn&#x27;t happen until the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say this product eliminates all the frizz, but my hair stays healthy looking despite flat iron use on humid days.  </li>
            <li> My hair became very silky, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> 100% worth the high price</li>
            <li> I love using it, and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> First purchase this product at my local salon,  very expensive!!!&lt;br /&gt;Had not intended to buy again because of the price, but was surprised to find that not only did it smell great but my hair ( after being hi-lighted) did not feel like straw after use instead silky soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair feeling soft and full of volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not greasy or heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li> this large quantity at first&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I had to use a large hazelnut size, and it looked my hair</li>
            <li> , My hair stylist recommended me this product, have been using it for last one month and feel my hair does not get damaged using hair iron now after rubbing my hair with a little \\&quot;thermique\\&quot;,all in all I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products and was not disappointed to buy Kerastase Thermique reconstructor milk, my hair has become real frizzy and dry with constant coloring</li>
            <li> There really is such a huge difference in the resulting look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> You apply it after showering while your hair is still wet, but make sure to not use too much.</li>
            <li> This leave-in really made a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> but after about 3 uses this product really turned it around.</li>
            <li> Apart from some shine, I really didn&#x27;t see anything.</li>
            <li> You really need to get the moisture out of you hair before applying this or it won&#x27;t penetrate the hair shaft as well.</li>
            <li> but that is just way too much</li>
            <li> I recently found out how important it is to put some sort of heat protection in my hair and have been using this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it completely.</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve recently replaced with a masque and essential oils) but a great product overall.</li>
            <li> I had never used a treatment like this before, but I have really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I was noticing some breakage, but since I started using this I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> My hair blows out without frizz and so straight.</li>
            <li> we know will be used and appreciated.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Use the whole line (except the shampoo).  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fast, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with hair control.  </li>
            <li> I now use the whole line.</li>
            <li> This treatment did not do much for my hair in the way of repairing it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and looks like I left the salon.  </li>
            <li> I put this stuff on (dont need much) then put on paul mitchell serum.  </li>
            <li> the split ends have reduced so much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned from experience that using too much of this product will make your hair greasy and necessitate washing it sooner than you would otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I really like it, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is almost as soft and smooth as after a professional blow out.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it surprised me and actually worked as promised!</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and the results are silky hair that is easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I inially thought this product was for making my hair smooth and straight but is supose to be used to help your hair before you use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> my hair is almost to my butt, long and strong.  </li>
            <li> Almost eliminates the damage,protects and smells great plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair shinier and more manageable than before, making it safer to use a hair dryer and/or other heat styling</li>
            <li> I need to use this, another anti-frizz product and a rich finishing cream for my hair to be only somewhat manageable.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using the Ciment Thermique for a few years after damaging my hair from hot irons and color.</li>
            <li> I have to constantly blow dry my hair, and this kerastase product does an amazing job of protecting my hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this conditioner and noticed a huge difference when I used this.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it for fine dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Left my fine hair soft and protected from heat of dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li> Use a little extra the first few times if your hair is super damaged to help jump start the process - I can not say enough wonderful things about this product - I have purchased it for all the women in my family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a comment from my wife: It is great for hard worked hair.</li>
            <li> and there it was at half the price :)</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this product can improve your hair only after you&#x27;ve subjected your hair to a tremendous amount of heat...</li>
            <li> and I use only a quarter size mid hair to ends (mostly on my ends).</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it to protect my hair from heat styling (also, she said not to bother using it if you don&#x27;t plan to blow dry/heat style your hair that day, because that is its main purpose).  </li>
            <li> I can see why they use the word &amp;#34;resistance&amp;#34; in the name as it completely sat on top of my hair and resisted mixing into my hair like shampoos and conditioners are expected to.</li>
            <li> Is like using a regular conditioner, but doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fragile at this time.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I wash it the first day, it&#x27;s beautiful, but the second day the curls are not very well defined and my hair gets messy.</li>
            <li> This product is ok when I use the flat iron, but the instructions mentioned that the anti-breakage protection effect last for one shampoo, and in my case that&#x27;s not true, maybe with the continuos use, this situation get better.</li>
            <li> I realize that not all products work for all hair types, but I would highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> I should also mention I also use Kerastase Specifique Bain Exfoliant Hydratant Shampoo, usually shampoo 2x then use Kerastase Lait Cristalliste conditioner which is perfect for long hair with oily/dandruff scalp and dry ends.</li>
            <li> I put a very generous amount in my freshly washed hair, blowdry and flat iron</li>
            <li> Then I applied a good amount of this, blow dried, and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> found out that if I apply this after I have dried my hair 80% of the way it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin and easily damaged by any heat.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve never spent much time on my hair, so this seemed a bit much to me.  </li>
            <li> I normally leave it on after I shower and</li>
            <li> it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper....</li>
            <li> Everything they make is super concentrated so it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Box was in rough condition and plastic wrap was ripped and looked like it was re-wrapped (it may have been original wrap).</li>
            <li> While the photo on Amazon shows the old style tube, the new tube provides for a little more product.</li>
            <li> I had a good laugh the other day as I looked around my bathroom at all the shampoos, conditioners and hair products I&#x27;ve bought over the last few months while on the quest to find something comparable to (but cheaper than) Kerastase.</li>
            <li> The difference in my hair over the last few months since using it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> MY hair looks great just from a blow dry and a big round brush.</li>
            <li> As I get older and go grey, however, my hair is becoming much more frizzy, damaged and broken.</li>
            <li> This product is super for dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> In using this product on a regular basis (with each blow dry), for the first time in my adult life, my hair felt like the soft, smooth texture I always wanted it to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty damaged by daily wear and tear of washing, drying, and flat-ironing.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It never gets old!  </li>
            <li> so silky soft for days!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, highlighted blonde hair</li>
            <li> I have long very straight hair, but sometimes need to use a flat iron to get that extra smooth look.  </li>
            <li> What you see in other people reviews is exactly right!</li>
            <li> It significantly cuts down on breakage...</li>
            <li> A girlfriend suggested it to me because he normally blowdries and flat irons her hair everyday, but it was always healthy.</li>
            <li> t is hard to find in the store so I am glad I can buy it on line.</li>
            <li> I have long, bleach blonde, very fine hair (aka very dry, damaged hair).  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but it doesn&#x27;t take much product, and will last a while.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> , i didnt get that wow effect i was hoping for</li>
            <li> so I was really surprised when this didn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see th Keratase on here.</li>
            <li> I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am completely hooked and plan to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and like to fuzz when I&#x27;m in humidity or rain.  </li>
            <li> I started at the tips and worked up, especially the damaged and very brittle</li>
            <li> when using other thermal products, my hair would be very hot to the touch after one pass (iron set at 350-375), but with Keratase Ciment, my hair is noticably cooler to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, one bottle of Ciment Thermique is going to last you a long time and be well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended i&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i like this product- not very heavy and smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is prone to split ends, especially as I do a balayage a few times a year to brighten the color.</li>
            <li> The consistency is fabulous and you only need a little to produce the desired effect.  </li>
            <li> wow!  I like to swim in salt water and have had several Keratin treatments diminished even with all the protection I use before a swim.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a lot of other products looking for the miracle that will make my hair sleek and straight, and I don&#x27;t think that exists!  </li>
            <li> I have a Brazilian Blowout in my hair from a few months ago and first use of this product made it look brand new.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, wavy hair that has a tendency to frizz in humidity.  </li>
            <li> could have used  even more, but I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> You only need a little on the very ends, too much and your volume disappears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the steep price and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t do as much for fly-a-ways as I had expected.</li>
            <li> It is actually shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the products are not cheap, but the quality you get is so worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality conditioner to apply to damp hair before blowing dry.  </li>
            <li> I love making soft, beachy waves with a diffuser, and I just apply a tiny bit (it says \\&quot;walnut-sized amount,\\&quot; ridiculous!)</li>
            <li> I use this product with Moroccan Oil when I blow dry my hair straight and it makes such a difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually feels significantly healthier after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated so a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about what I put in my hair and have done some product reviewing on Amazon with five stars being few and far between.</li>
            <li> So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my hair, which is fine but also thick, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but is enough to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> When I was at the blow dry stage I was worried, since I was FEELING a lot of improvement (very soft), but not seeing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I washed it, let it air dry, and laughed at all my friends who spent absurd amounts of money and time on their hair and the products they put in, on and around it.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry completely, then use a flat iron to activate or \\&quot;cement\\&quot; the Kerastase smoother into place.  </li>
            <li> It is unnecessary to put this product into other areas of the hair follicle other than the tip because the natural oils from your scalp reach those areas much more</li>
            <li> so far for me this is not what the other reviews made it seem....</li>
            <li> I would finally cut my hair short (above my shoulders) to get rid of all of the damaged hair and then re-grow my hair long.  </li>
            <li> It restores damaged ends and protects my hair, which I wash daily, as well as blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product, it may be somewhat expensive but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Since I found this product, I have had my hair long for a few years now and my hair is very healthy with no split or broken ends!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the masque did much.</li>
            <li> One bottle of this product, using it daily on long hair, has lasted me about 5 months.</li>
            <li> and I use a blow dryer and flat iron almost every day.</li>
            <li> After I received it, I realized the instructions were a bit long - put a walnut sized amount in palm, and starting at the ends thoroughly distribute in hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a wet-to-dry flat iron, and skipped the \\&quot;blow</li>
            <li> and I use this before blow drying and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> FHI flat irons and my hair looks so silky afterwards.  </li>
            <li> after flat ironing it looked like I walked out of my stylists</li>
            <li> I moved to Maryland and was not aware that the water is super hard -</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft and did not mat it down.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, subject to the rigors of coloring and fairly frequent heat styling, so damage and split ends are a big issue.</li>
            <li> My hair started to become coarse and dry from all of my flat iron use</li>
            <li> but it last a long time!</li>
            <li> Regardless, my hair has been dry for all the color I have recently put on.</li>
            <li> If you need some TLC for fragile hair that is heat styled, I highly recommend this product, and I highly recommend purchasing here to save a few $$ on a very expensive (but worth it) hair product</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the larger container (28.8oz) of Kerastase Ciment Anti-usure from this seller and was extremely disatisfied.  </li>
            <li> Just a little product leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I use it EVERY time before I blow dry and flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> It hydrates without weighing my fine, thin hair down.</li>
            <li> and I have long</li>
            <li> On vacation recently, I splurged and had a \\&quot;Kerastase treatment\\&quot; done to my hair, having absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and have not found a product remotely comparable.</li>
            <li> to my ends and work my way up the bottom portion of my long hair.</li>
            <li> but I have this strange attaction towards it.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to my mid back).  </li>
            <li> Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as my blow dry serum for over a year.</li>
            <li> and I air dry my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it in my wavy hair before I blow dry to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> my hair was dry, brittle, frizzy, and breaking off (I lost a bunch of hair).</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on dry and stressed hair.  </li>
            <li> After towel drying your hair, rub the product into your hair, then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I just use this after washing, then dry and curl.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this product on me before each blow dry</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to blow dry and straighten as well</li>
            <li> I use it every time I blow dry and flatiron my hair.</li>
            <li> and it was still dry and cracking off.</li>
            <li> As a result, I use the shampoo only a few times a week and the Ciment Thermique daily.  </li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably less crunchy than normal and I can tell the straightener doesn&#x27;t impact it as heavily as before.</li>
            <li> This product was my first introduction to thermal protectant hair products, and it was a game changer.</li>
            <li> I air dry (partially or fully) and use Biosilk at a Leave in</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try ONE LAST TIME before giving up and cutting off my long hair to start over, and I have to say that this is the ONLY product that I have used that gives me a glimmer of hope.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned and is very dry and brittle do to a medication and illness.</li>
            <li> I have long, colored hair and anything I feel like this helps as I flat iron it when I wash it every few days.  </li>
            <li> Your Highness, even Bumble and Bumble (which is only a little bit cheaper)</li>
            <li> I have only ever put it on wet hair before blow drying it, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine how it would work on dry hair before heat styling with a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> It had been a few years since I&#x27;d used this product, but after highlights I decided my hair needed some extra care.</li>
            <li> I have never really used a leave in conditioner because I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and tend to use products that add volume.</li>
            <li> For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been letting my relaxer grow out,and when I wash my hair (therasilk products)</li>
            <li> It clearly was a watered down version or something of the like as it did not untangle or provide the usual conditioning benefits.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I have to wash my on hair on a daily because products tend to build-up and make my hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s even the same formula!  </li>
            <li> I left it on overnight, and in the morning shampood and conditioned as usual.</li>
            <li> Do take care though, a little goes a long way, so if you have problems with products weighing your hair down use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> also sometimes use the Kerastase Volumactive Conditioning Mousse and I apply it to towel dried hair, then dry hair 80%, and then add this product and finish drying/styling</li>
            <li> 125 ml will last you for at least 6 or 7 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fun.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might make my hair feel like it has product in it or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> After I blowdry my hair is like silk, not weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> However, I found that there is a difference in the smell and the way this product works from the previous version of Kerastase.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey, but</li>
            <li> I was using the Keratase Resistance Fibre Architecte Serum before blowdrying and even using a little my hair felt greasy-</li>
            <li> little pricey</li>
            <li> bonus is the volume this has given my hair, not weighed down or sticky!</li>
            <li> I once was out of this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It definitely improved my hair at a time when it was in poor condition.</li>
            <li> also use the Bain Volumactive shampoo (every day) and Care Volumactive conditioner (a few times a week).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and have NEVER found anything that compares to the effect it has on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This was either used, old, and/or fake.  </li>
            <li> This product is helping me a lot with my damage hair, i use the dryer almost everyday and this product is just for that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh and doesn&#x27;t stay around to be annoying.</li>
            <li> but it curls and get be tough to comb without this product and my flat irons.</li>
            <li> Even when using my regular drug store brand shampoo/conditioner this made a dramatic difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair length is past my shoulders and leave in&#x27;s usually weigh hair down</li>
            <li> then i expected !!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works</li>
            <li> it killed my hair within 5 months!</li>
            <li> Within one week this product had repaired my hair - unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders-chest length-</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> My hair usually feels silky and isn&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not pleased with the amount I had to use for the price.</li>
            <li> After trying everything (cheap drug store brands to very expensive professional products) and spending hundreds of dollars, I had become very frustrated with trying to repair the damage I have done to my locks.  </li>
            <li> She has a hard work in constructions</li>
            <li> Not too thick or greasy for my hair</li>
            <li> This product seriously works miracles.</li>
            <li> Also, some may be confused between Nectar Thermique and this product.</li>
            <li> She has extremely thin hair, and this leave in conditioner has done wonders.</li>
            <li> This is my secret.  </li>
            <li> It leaves hair silky but keeps it from getting big in bad weather conditions!</li>
            <li> Before using this product, I would get split and broken ends which would drive me crazy to the point</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s expensive though,</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> This product is expensive</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel worse!</li>
            <li> For me this stuff its fake.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> made my hair break. :(</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product.</li>
            <li> My hair was in horrible condition.</li>
            <li> Terrible way of selling.</li>

            <li> I use this product with Moroccan Oil when I blow dry my hair straight and it makes such a difference.  My hair is almost as soft and smooth as after a professional blow out.</li>
            <li> if your looking to get your product fast DONT shop here! they take foreverrrrrrrr. otherwise the product works great!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using the Ciment Thermique for a few years after damaging my hair from hot irons and color. Almost eliminates the damage,protects and smells great plus a little goes a long way. I just had to replace it after a year and I have long hair.[[ASIN:B000U4WNC4 Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique 4.8 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as my blow dry serum for over a year. My hair is on the healthier side to begin with, but was not shiny. Once I started using this product, I have zero frizz and 100% improved shine! This product also has a heat activated conditioning treatment in it, so your hair quality will improve over time. I recommend this product to everyone and anyone.  Also, some may be confused between Nectar Thermique and this product. Go with this one, because it adds shine, strength, and conditioning treatment all in one. One bottle of this product, using it daily on long hair, has lasted me about 5 months. Great investment!</li>
            <li> This leave-in really made a difference in the texture of my hair. My hair started to become coarse and dry from all of my flat iron use but after about 3 uses this product really turned it around. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I use it EVERY time before I blow dry and flat iron my hair. It significantly cuts down on breakage...wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to my mid back).  Before using this product, I would get split and broken ends which would drive me crazy to the point I would finally cut my hair short (above my shoulders) to get rid of all of the damaged hair and then re-grow my hair long.  Since I found this product, I have had my hair long for a few years now and my hair is very healthy with no split or broken ends!  I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the product after reading the reviews. I have curly and fine hair. When I wash it the first day, it&#x27;s beautiful, but the second day the curls are not very well defined and my hair gets messy. I tried this product when I decided to straighten my hair. I thought it would make a difference. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change honestly. Apart from some shine, I really didn&#x27;t see anything.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the larger container (28.8oz) of Kerastase Ciment Anti-usure from this seller and was extremely disatisfied.  I&#x27;m a long time user of this conditioner and noticed a huge difference when I used this.  It clearly was a watered down version or something of the like as it did not untangle or provide the usual conditioning benefits.  I contacted this seller with my concern and never received any response.  Beware!</li>
            <li> This was the first Kerastase product I bought. It was recommended by my stylist. I have fine hair that is shoulder length and bleached. My hair was very dry and damaged. Even when using my regular drug store brand shampoo/conditioner this made a dramatic difference in the texture of my hair. It looked shiny/healthy and felt soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that if I apply this after I have dried my hair 80% of the way it works a lot better. You really need to get the moisture out of you hair before applying this or it won&#x27;t penetrate the hair shaft as well. If I&#x27;m going to spend this much money on a product I want to get the most out of it. Once I apply it, about a quarter size amount - the bottle says walnut size but that is just way too much, I finish drying and styling my hair as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sometimes use the Kerastase Volumactive Conditioning Mousse and I apply it to towel dried hair, then dry hair 80%, and then add this product and finish drying/styling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the steep price and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t do as much for fly-a-ways as I had expected. I still have to use coconut oil to smooth my hair after I finish styling it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I love that its heat activated! I will never use another leave in conditioner again. I was worried that it might make my hair feel like it has product in it or weigh it down. But it didnt it works amazing! Sure the price is kinda high but its sooo worth it! If you use any type of heat in ur hair BUY IT LADIES!!</li>
            <li> Great product, has immensely improved the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, does wonders for your hair when blow drying or using iron, a must have</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I started buying it at Gene Juarez, then moved onto buying it here on Amazon.  My hair is very fine, and will never hold a curl, or even stay straight when I use my flat iron.  This product keeps my hair with more texture, so I can curl it and use a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend suggested it to me because he normally blowdries and flat irons her hair everyday, but it was always healthy. This product seriously works miracles. The first time I used it I noticed a different and my hair is softer and more managable because of it! It doesn&#x27;t curl when it&#x27;s humid out, or does it create kinks when I have it up in a ponytail for an hour. It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I recently found out how important it is to put some sort of heat protection in my hair and have been using this. My hair is noticeably less crunchy than normal and I can tell the straightener doesn&#x27;t impact it as heavily as before. I&#x27;m a fan! Kerastase makes the best stuff!</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products and was not disappointed to buy Kerastase Thermique reconstructor milk, my hair has become real frizzy and dry with constant coloring and i needed something to protect my hair while using the hair iron at 420 degrees f, My hair stylist recommended me this product, have been using it for last one month and feel my hair does not get damaged using hair iron now after rubbing my hair with a little \\&quot;thermique\\&quot;,all in all I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, immediately when I used it it made my hair so smooth and shiny. Ever since I&#x27;ve used this product my hair has:&lt;br /&gt;1. Grown alot faster&lt;br /&gt;2. Grown alot thicker&lt;br /&gt;3. Got rid of  split ends&lt;br /&gt;4. got rid of dryness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s expensive though, but it&#x27;s worth it completely.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for split ends that I have ever tried.  It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way so it lasts almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell...Smells like grapefruit!  Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The item was great! Thank you very much! A five star!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff! If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this-just do it! My hair has never looked healthier! It&#x27;s magic:). It&#x27;s pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is ok when I use the flat iron, but the instructions mentioned that the anti-breakage protection effect last for one shampoo, and in my case that&#x27;s not true, maybe with the continuos use, this situation get better.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife after she was given samples from a salon in Tokyo. She has extremely thin hair, and this leave in conditioner has done wonders. Not sure how it works but her hair looks fuller and healthier now.</li>
            <li> This is my fav brand and such a great product for my hair!  I am loving that the seller sent it to me right away!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin and easily damaged by any heat. It is like night and day with this  product. My hair has never felt smoother. I use it even if I don&#x27;t curl my hair because it can still act as a stay-in conditioner without the heat. I cannot say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products, and this one is no exception.  My hair was pretty damaged by daily wear and tear of washing, drying, and flat-ironing.  Within a week of using this product, it completely made my hair smooth, soft, and strong.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or oily.  Usually, I have to wash my on hair on a daily because products tend to build-up and make my hair feel oily.  Not this product...it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions (inside the box) recommend that you use it with the Bain de Force Shampoo---which I also purchased.  The shampoo has helped my hair a great deal, but it does dry my hair out.  As a result, I use the shampoo only a few times a week and the Ciment Thermique daily.  This seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair treatment for dry and damaged hair. Just a little product leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> This smells great and makes hair very soft. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price (I&#x27;ve recently replaced with a masque and essential oils) but a great product overall.</li>
            <li> I alternate with the entire Thermique protection line. This is my favorite. I have long, fine, highlighted blonde hair and I use a blow dryer and flat iron almost every day. You may not &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; this product working, but believe me, it does. Every time I have taken a break from it, my hair gets damaged faster and has more split ends from heat styling. Using this protects my hair between cuts.</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels significantly healthier after only a few uses. It&#x27;s looks like it too. It has more moisture after styling and that is helping everything.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair smooth and shiny. You only need a little on the very ends, too much and your volume disappears.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner that keeps your hair protected from Heat styling.  Again it is prciey but worth the price</li>
            <li> What you see in other people reviews is exactly right! is an excellent  product and it arrived even early then i expected !!!! well done!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this product can improve your hair only after you&#x27;ve subjected your hair to a tremendous amount of heat... but it does!  This product is a miracle in my opinion.  For most of my life my hair has been very thick, with beautiful waves.  I washed it, let it air dry, and laughed at all my friends who spent absurd amounts of money and time on their hair and the products they put in, on and around it.  As I get older and go grey, however, my hair is becoming much more frizzy, damaged and broken. If it&#x27;s humid outside and I air dry my hair, I look like I stuck my finger in an electric socket. On vacation recently, I splurged and had a \\&quot;Kerastase treatment\\&quot; done to my hair, having absolutely no idea what that was - it just sounded relaxing to disappear from the family for awhile to have my hair styled.  Amazing!  Afterward, I researched all of the Kerastase products, and this one sounded perfect for me.  After I received it, I realized the instructions were a bit long - put a walnut sized amount in palm, and starting at the ends thoroughly distribute in hair.  Blow dry completely, then use a flat iron to activate or \\&quot;cement\\&quot; the Kerastase smoother into place.  Well, I&#x27;ve never spent much time on my hair, so this seemed a bit much to me.  Tried it a few times, and it worked great... but I was still looking for a short cut.  I purchased a wet-to-dry flat iron, and skipped the \\&quot;blow dry\\&quot; step entirely - and it worked like a charm!  My hair so very, very soft, and nice and smooth.  I no longer have that electrified look.  I will use this product until they stop making it, no matter the price.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a nice smell and makes you feel like you are doing something special for your hair. Mine is fine and it seems to give my hair some weight and thickness.</li>
            <li> I had never used a treatment like this before, but I have really noticed a difference. I have long very straight hair, but sometimes need to use a flat iron to get that extra smooth look.  I was noticing some breakage, but since I started using this I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> i like this product- not very heavy and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;i use it in my wavy hair before I blow dry to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;Im loyal to this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. It restores damaged ends and protects my hair, which I wash daily, as well as blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Had no affect on my hair at all.  Just like using water.  Sorry but I just wasn&#x27;t happy with results.</li>
            <li> This product was my first introduction to thermal protectant hair products, and it was a game changer. I have long hair, subject to the rigors of coloring and fairly frequent heat styling, so damage and split ends are a big issue. In using this product on a regular basis (with each blow dry), for the first time in my adult life, my hair felt like the soft, smooth texture I always wanted it to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it wasn&#x27;t just my imagination, either, because when I went for a haircut (18 months since my last one!), my stylist commented on how healthy my hair was. This product was the biggest change to my hair routine, so it must get most of the credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a creme. I have only ever put it on wet hair before blow drying it, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine how it would work on dry hair before heat styling with a flat iron or curling iron. (I use another product for that.) I know it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but it doesn&#x27;t take much product, and will last a while. Definitely worth the investment for the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, my hair stylist introduced it to me for the first time,  it activates with the heat of the hair dryer,  it leaves my hair feeling soft and full of volume.</li>
            <li> I have a Brazilian Blowout in my hair from a few months ago and first use of this product made it look brand new. Says should last five shampoos. My stylist says use every shampoo for best results. Wow. Amazed at how well it &amp;#34;mended&amp;#34; my ends!</li>
            <li> It had been a few years since I&#x27;d used this product, but after highlights I decided my hair needed some extra care. I have used this in the past purchased at a salon, and I cannot tell ANY difference in the packaging, consistency, smell, and most importantly, the results!  My hair is protected from heat styling, has a beautiful shine and although I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, I know it will only improve in time.  If you need some TLC for fragile hair that is heat styled, I highly recommend this product, and I highly recommend purchasing here to save a few $$ on a very expensive (but worth it) hair product</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, I love how it makes my hair soft and smooth, and I love that it&#x27;s protecting my hair as I use the hair dryer!  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  My hair blows out without frizz and so straight. It also stays for days.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I moved to Maryland and was not aware that the water is super hard - it killed my hair within 5 months! I looked like I had a rats nest on my head- my hair was dry, brittle, frizzy, and breaking off (I lost a bunch of hair). Within one week this product had repaired my hair - unbelievable. Use a little extra the first few times if your hair is super damaged to help jump start the process - I can not say enough wonderful things about this product - I have purchased it for all the women in my family. Even if your hair is not damaged, you will appreciate Ciment Thermique - it will make your hair even more amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on dry and stressed hair.  I love using it, and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter who had requested it on her wish list.  She says she is very happy with the product.  Using the wish list on Amazon lets us get gifts we know will be used and appreciated.</li>
            <li> Ordered the bigger size realized how good the product was. Had to buy a travel size so im never without it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...good thermal creme but for the price i was expecting way better results, i didnt get that wow effect i was hoping for but overall is an ok product</li>
            <li> my hair is almost to my butt, long and strong.  This is my secret.  Use the whole line (except the shampoo).  The deep conditioner is amazing too.  Smell is great.  Melon and cucumber. Super light.  Absorbs fast, not greasy.  The best and I&#x27;ve used all their serums…this is THE ONE!</li>
            <li> Used it for years!! It works!! Stops my hair at the front from breaking from using straighteners etc... Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product on damp ends, before blow drying.  This is the single-most effective end protector I&#x27;ve used in my 16 years of straightening my hair. Kept my ends nourished and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 months without a trim, I had nary a split end!  And it smells amazing..so important in a hair product.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey, but sooo worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use with Kerastase Oleo Relax for ultimate straightening/smoothing.</li>
            <li> First let me say I would&#x27;ve never thought to buy a creamy milk product to use in my fine hair until my stylist used it on me. I was using the Keratase Resistance Fibre Architecte Serum before blowdrying and even using a little my hair felt greasy- not at all with this Ciment Thermique- it&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s actually really light it&#x27;s not a thick consistency. My hair is past my shoulders-chest length- and I use only a quarter size mid hair to ends (mostly on my ends). After I blowdry my hair is like silk, not weighed down or greasy. I should also mention I also use Kerastase Specifique Bain Exfoliant Hydratant Shampoo, usually shampoo 2x then use Kerastase Lait Cristalliste conditioner which is perfect for long hair with oily/dandruff scalp and dry ends. Then with my hair semi-dry (damp), I use this Ciment Thermique and blow-dry. Works like a charm- so those are my 3 fav Keratase products. Definitely buy this hair milk!</li>
            <li> so far for me this is not what the other reviews made it seem....a pretty good product with a hefty price tag</li>
            <li> Kerastase has just wonderful, good quality hair products. With my fine hair and constant struggle to get the right look while having my hair healthy, Kerastase is a lifesaver. Yes, the products are not cheap, but the quality you get is so worth it. I use it daily together with shampoo. Will continue buying it. The delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love it on my hair, great product!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It works great, for her dyed hair. Her hair looks better and feels softer.</li>
            <li> Family Favorite!  Husband, son and I love this after shower treatment.  My husband uses it like a styling gel for his ever thinning top head curls... I love it for its healthy hair feel.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality conditioner to apply to damp hair before blowing dry.  It conditions hair, makes it easy to manage and style, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product is super for dry and damaged hair.  Helps take away the frizz and leave it more manageable.  The shipper is SUPER FAST - my order was here within a couple of days.  Wow!  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product from this seller.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The consistency is fabulous and you only need a little to produce the desired effect.  It really helps with hair control.  It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been using this for about a year and been buying from my salon until I realized it was way cheaper online!  This is a fantastic product and keeps my hair healthy.  My hair stylist recommended it to protect my hair from heat styling (also, she said not to bother using it if you don&#x27;t plan to blow dry/heat style your hair that day, because that is its main purpose).  I once was out of this for a few weeks and that is when I really saw that the product was amazing.  I saw a significant difference in my hair when I didn&#x27;t use it for a while.  Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of weird residue.  Very concentrated so a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product.  My hair stylist recommended it for fine dry hair.  t is hard to find in the store so I am glad I can buy it on line.</li>
            <li> Love this .make my hair very smooth and managble. Smells good .my hair looks healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist.  After towel drying your hair, rub the product into your hair, then blow dry.  It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or cause build up.  Also, it has a great, fresh smell, that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have to constantly blow dry my hair, and this kerastase product does an amazing job of protecting my hair from the heat. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and have not found a product remotely comparable.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Smells great and really makes my hair look and feel sensational!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and smooth. I just use this after washing, then dry and curl. Also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great to use after shampooing&lt;br /&gt;Use walnut sized amt - was nervous w this large quantity at first&lt;br /&gt;No residue&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;Just protection from the heat of dryers irons and curlers&lt;br /&gt;Smooth luscious hair&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want tto run your fingers through it yourself</li>
            <li> I have never really used a leave in conditioner because I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and tend to use products that add volume. My hair length is past my shoulders and leave in&#x27;s usually weigh hair down so I was really surprised when this didn&#x27;t do that.  It made my hair feel soft and did not mat it down.  I now use the whole line. It definitely improved my hair at a time when it was in poor condition.</li>
            <li> I had a good laugh the other day as I looked around my bathroom at all the shampoos, conditioners and hair products I&#x27;ve bought over the last few months while on the quest to find something comparable to (but cheaper than) Kerastase. What a waste! Everything they make is super concentrated so it lasts a long time and it&#x27;s so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciment Thermique is one of my favorites. I have fine hair that is prone to split ends, especially as I do a balayage a few times a year to brighten the color. I love making soft, beachy waves with a diffuser, and I just apply a tiny bit (it says \\&quot;walnut-sized amount,\\&quot; ridiculous!) to my ends and work my way up the bottom portion of my long hair. The heat diffuser activates the ingredients and my hair comes out looking (and smelling) amazing. I just finish it with one or two sprays of Shu Uemura Liquid Fabric for texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Bain Volumactive shampoo (every day) and Care Volumactive conditioner (a few times a week). There really is such a huge difference in the resulting look and feel of my hair. I tried to find a cheaper substitute--Aveda Volumizing, Tigi Catwalk Your Highness, even Bumble and Bumble (which is only a little bit cheaper) and it&#x27;s not the same. Don&#x27;t worry, one bottle of Ciment Thermique is going to last you a long time and be well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> As I am an outside US buyer i can not buy this products in the official website Kerastase, I asked to the Kerastese customer service if i can trust in products sold outside their offical page and they said  that these products are often counterfeit,&lt;br /&gt;diluted formulas, or expired formulas that may not be safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway i do not have options and i have to buy it in amazon. but i think after using it a couple of times this one did the job.</li>
            <li> The BEST!  this is my own Brazillian Blowout!!  I love this product!  I put a very generous amount in my freshly washed hair, blowdry and flat iron and wow!  I like to swim in salt water and have had several Keratin treatments diminished even with all the protection I use before a swim.  This product is expensive I go through it, but it is soooo worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I have fine hair, it&#x27;s to strong made my hair break. :(</li>
            <li> I am very particular about what I put in my hair and have done some product reviewing on Amazon with five stars being few and far between. I love this product because it surprised me and actually worked as promised! I am more than pleased and despite the price will definitely be repurchasing. Again... and again... and again!!!</li>
            <li> i ordered this hair product and container came with about 1 oz. inside  when it was to have 4.8 oz&lt;br /&gt;i email amazon and they did nothing, never even responded</li>
            <li> Excellent pruduct.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product. I can see why they use the word &amp;#34;resistance&amp;#34; in the name as it completely sat on top of my hair and resisted mixing into my hair like shampoos and conditioners are expected to. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> My hairdressor started using this product on my hair after I told her I straighten my hair every day. I love it! I use it every day before I start drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and have NEVER found anything that compares to the effect it has on my hair.  I would reccommend this eller and product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I used this product because someone recommended it to me. Its the perfect profit for whn I blowdry my hair. My hair usually feels silky and isn&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much! Product arrived on time and perfect! Very nice! Beautiful and useful. I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but felt I had to for this product.  My hairdresser uses this product on me before each blow dry so I decided to buy it.  I bought it here on Amazon from seller \\&quot;Beautogen\\&quot;.  I received the product by itself - no box (it&#x27;s supposed to come in a cellophane-wrapped box) and noticed the manufacturing date/info that is embossed along the top crimped edge of the tube was burned/scratched off completely.  This was either used, old, and/or fake.  Do NOT buy from \\&quot;Beautogen\\&quot;.  I gave a 3-star rating because the product itself is good.</li>
            <li> This treatment did not do much for my hair in the way of repairing it.  It may have helped maintain it, but not repair it.  Nothing can repair a split end except a scissors!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for years and haven&#x27;t found anything better. It adds body to my straight, fine hair and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Picky reviwer but the product does what it says. Hair is softer than ever and it lasts. 100% worth the high price</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see th Keratase on here.I know how great it is on keeping your hair safe when you dry it &amp; use your flat iron on it afterwards. My hair is shiny &amp; I feel good know it is protected by Keratase. I also love the price so much more at Salons.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and not greasy or heavy on fine hair. I find the smell of the product perhaps a bit sickly-sweet, but that&#x27;s just a personal issue. I can see a difference in my hair in that it is smoother and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I have long, colored hair and anything I feel like this helps as I flat iron it when I wash it every few days.  Has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  However, I found that there is a difference in the smell and the way this product works from the previous version of Kerastase.  I&#x27;m not sure if the manufacturer changed something in the formula, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well and the smell is more citrus rather than a pleasant fragrance.  For the price they charge, they shouldn&#x27;t be skimping on anything.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair light and soft. No product build up/residue.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it smells very nice and helps to brush my hair more easily.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair smelling nice and softer!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It never gets old!  I have wavy/curly hair and I use this before blow drying and flat iron.  Smells fantastic and looks like I left the salon.  Not too thick or greasy for my hair and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get a great affect.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and the results are silky hair that is easy to manage.  Highly recommended i&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a comment from my wife: It is great for hard worked hair. She has a hard work in constructions</li>
            <li> love this stuff! I bought it bc a friends hair looked really good and she told me about it.  I put it on after using sulfate free shampoo.  I put this stuff on (dont need much) then put on paul mitchell serum.  Everybody thinks I go to get it done at the shop.  I have FHI flat irons and my hair looks so silky afterwards.  I dont have &#x27;nappy&#x27; hair but it curls and get be tough to comb without this product and my flat irons.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Product arrive amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the ultimate!  The difference in my hair over the last few months since using it is amazing.  My hairdresser recommended it and she&#x27;s not wrong.  My hair is smooth and silky and the split ends have reduced so much.  I used to have to straight iron every day... not any longer!  MY hair looks great just from a blow dry and a big round brush.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel worse!</li>
            <li> Protects hair beautifully and makes it easy to work with when blow drying or using heating tools.  I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this leave in product that is applied to washed and conditioned hair.The smell is of amazing fresh cucumbers..very clean.  Left my fine hair soft and protected from heat of dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li> This product is helping me a lot with my damage hair, i use the dryer almost everyday and this product is just for that, In some months I will let you know if my hair feels better after using it.</li>
            <li> I started using Kerastase Ciment Thermique about two years ago to help combat the damage my hair straightener was doing to my hair. This product is AMAZING. You apply it after showering while your hair is still wet, but make sure to not use too much. I&#x27;ve learned from experience that using too much of this product will make your hair greasy and necessitate washing it sooner than you would otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had much more split ends and damage to my hair before I started using this product. It makes your hair shinier and more manageable than before, making it safer to use a hair dryer and/or other heat styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a walnut-sized amount of the product onto your finger tips, rub it a bit between your fingers, and then massage the product into the tips of your hair where damage is most likely to occur. It is unnecessary to put this product into other areas of the hair follicle other than the tip because the natural oils from your scalp reach those areas much more readily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product, it may be somewhat expensive but it is worth the price. 125 ml will last you for at least 6 or 7 months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It keeps my hair looking smooth and smells so nice!&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but it last a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it whenever I wash my hair as a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner.  Not only does it leave my hair soft, silky and shiny but it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft without weighing it down. Makes it easier to blow dry and straighten as well but I wished it helped out with frizz issues more.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees. Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price. Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale. So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff. Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper.... but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys. Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li> Loved it! The package was sealed and the product is great!&lt;br /&gt;Legit staff works wonders for my hair I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> Is like using a regular conditioner, but doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li> This product did feel or act like the same thing I bought in a salon.  Not sure it&#x27;s even the same formula!  Won&#x27;t buy on line again</li>
            <li> Works really well with my hair, which is fine but also thick, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but is enough to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I got mine and was glad with the result the first days. But as you use it, it seems that your hair gets used to it and it doesn&#x27;t work as good anymore.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today, and I&#x27;m really impressed. I have extremely thick, coarse, curly/frizzy hair. It&#x27;s not fun. I clarified my hair, and applied Kerastase&#x27;s oleo relax slim masque. I left it on overnight, and in the morning shampood and conditioned as usual. Then I applied a good amount of this, blow dried, and flat ironed. I&#x27;m not sure the masque did much. When I was at the blow dry stage I was worried, since I was FEELING a lot of improvement (very soft), but not seeing it. Turns out the magic doesn&#x27;t happen until the flat iron. My hair became very silky, soft, and smooth. YES!!! It is so much more controlled and just looks great if you ask me!! Like I just came out of the salon... and that&#x27;s saying something. As soon as my mom came home she asked what I did to my hair, that it looked so smooth and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is... interesting, but not bad. The best way I can describe it is candied celery haha. It&#x27;s very fresh and doesn&#x27;t stay around to be annoying. I really like it, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not pleased with the amount I had to use for the price. I had to use a large hazelnut size, and it looked my hair could have used  even more, but I have very thick hair. I do wish the stuff was cheaper for the amount you get, but this is very good salon quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out goes all my Chi silk infusion, biosilk, etc... I will never be without with again!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It makes my hair so soft, shiny and manageable. I am completely hooked and plan to continue to buy it. One of the best leave-in treatments I have ever used. It hydrates without weighing my fine, thin hair down. Love it!</li>
            <li> O produto veio na data indicada,de muito boa qualidade e com certeza no futuro irei usar esse vendedor novamente o</li>
            <li> Wish I would have had this product many years ago.  My hair is naturally curly and like to fuzz when I&#x27;m in humidity or rain.  In fact, I&#x27;m going to order more of Kerastase Paris Resistance Climent Thermique.  Can&#x27;t do without it.  It leaves hair silky but keeps it from getting big in bad weather conditions!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my stylist to protect my colored hair from heat styling--it is not working.  I need to use this, another anti-frizz product and a rich finishing cream for my hair to be only somewhat manageable.  Disappointing.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I inially thought this product was for making my hair smooth and straight but is supose to be used to help your hair before you use a flat iron. Regardless, my hair has been dry for all the color I have recently put on. I normally leave it on after I shower and my hair is curly. After an hour, my curls look amazing, more defined and my hair is smooth!! I really love this product and will buy again when I run out of it</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, even got some samples with my package ! (:</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used as a heat protectant for my hair.  I have thick, fine, wavy hair that has a tendency to frizz in humidity.  Can&#x27;t say this product eliminates all the frizz, but my hair stays healthy looking despite flat iron use on humid days.  Have tried a lot of other products looking for the miracle that will make my hair sleek and straight, and I don&#x27;t think that exists!  In the meantime, I am happy with my ciment thermique.</li>
            <li> I have used Kerastase for years - so obviously I really like it! While the photo on Amazon shows the old style tube, the new tube provides for a little more product. I contacted the seller and heard from them very quickly when I asked the question.</li>
            <li> I have long, bleach blonde, very fine hair (aka very dry, damaged hair).  After trying everything (cheap drug store brands to very expensive professional products) and spending hundreds of dollars, I had become very frustrated with trying to repair the damage I have done to my locks.  I purchased many, many Keratase products, and my results were mediocre, at best.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try ONE LAST TIME before giving up and cutting off my long hair to start over, and I have to say that this is the ONLY product that I have used that gives me a glimmer of hope.  Since using this product, my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in years.  It is actually shiny and soft.  I realize that not all products work for all hair types, but I would highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> Love it! Another product from Kerastase that works.  I use it every time I blow dry and flatiron my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was in horrible condition. My hair has thinned and is very dry and brittle do to a medication and illness. I had to have it cut short and it was still dry and cracking off. My hair is super fragile at this time. I was looking around the web for what to try on severely damaged hair and found a forum and a poster that recommended it for another person. I also read a stylist recommending this product for over processed and damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found it on Amazon and ordered it. The package came sealed. I had hope because of all the great reviews here, I washed my hair and dried it as best as I could with a towel and applied about  quarter worth. I started at the tips and worked up, especially the damaged and very brittle areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blow drying I noticed great improvement just after one time and after flat ironing it looked like I walked out of my stylists salon. I am very happy and will continue using this conditioner/protectant/reconstructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is the volume this has given my hair, not weighed down or sticky!</li>
            <li> This line is fantastic.  My hair has been so damaged from over bleach.  Almost like cotton candy.  Have been using this leave in conditioner and shampoo, excellent.  My hair looks really good.  I will always use this.  My hair stylist talked me into buying it, but, buying through Amazon, a much better price.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, my hair is super silky smooth.  It does smell strongly like pine trees (?) but I have this strange attaction towards it.  Maybe reminds me of Christmas?  ; )</li>
            <li> Item just as described.  Will shop here again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> Terrible way of selling. Item arrived a month later with the surprise of getting something else or different packaging who knows. For me this stuff its fake. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> First purchase this product at my local salon,  very expensive!!!&lt;br /&gt;Had not intended to buy again because of the price, but was surprised to find that not only did it smell great but my hair ( after being hi-lighted) did not feel like straw after use instead silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;Actually missed it once finished so looked on Amazon for a replacement and there it was at half the price :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. I mix it with another Karastase conditioner and it makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent split ends &amp; leaves hair shint</li>
            <li> Box was in rough condition and plastic wrap was ripped and looked like it was re-wrapped (it may have been original wrap). My hair is in better condition but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using this or because I&#x27;m using sulfate free shampoo (&amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;this was my first time using it so I do not know what the packaging looks like from the manufacturer,  I&#x27;m just glad item was not a gift.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I&#x27;m a hair product junkie - always on the lookout for the newest &amp; best product for my superfine, limp hair. Well, this product delivers! It is very light &amp; creamy, need a small amount for a great result! It makes my hair shiny, manageable &amp; provides great hold, all day long!</li>
            <li> When I originally purchased this product (admittedly about 6 months ago), I used it as a heat protectant against blow drying and another brand&#x27;s serum for flat iron protection, and I was less than impressed, so I didn&#x27;t use again for awhile.  Then after looking at all the various hair products I&#x27;d been accumulating I decided to give another try, but with a slightly different application.  For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been letting my relaxer grow out,and when I wash my hair (therasilk products) I air dry (partially or fully) and use Biosilk at a Leave in (my hair is still pretty damaged from the relaxer).  Then I use Keratase Ciment Thermique as a thermal guard when flat ironing and I love the results:  my hair has better texture, shine and style-control than ever and the smell is subtle yet pleasant. I also believe the thermall protecing capacity to be superior to other products and here&#x27;s why:  when using other thermal products, my hair would be very hot to the touch after one pass (iron set at 350-375), but with Keratase Ciment, my hair is noticably cooler to the touch.  Do take care though, a little goes a long way, so if you have problems with products weighing your hair down use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer and a 2 inch curling iron on my hair and this stuff just keeps my hair so silky soft for days! Love it and will always keep repurchasing it! worth every penny!</li>
