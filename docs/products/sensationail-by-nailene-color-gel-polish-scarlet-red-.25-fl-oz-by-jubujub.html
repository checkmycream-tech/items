    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Beautiful!</li>
            <li>It had grown out but was still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great wear with this color as well.</li>
            <li>If you love having your nails looking great without the spendy salon prices, this item is for you.</li>
            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and I will buy it again when I run out of the first one!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful red.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the color and product</li>
            <li>I love this color, and it lasts.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;Sensationail&amp;#34; Set itself, so I am not upset about that.</li>
            <li>The product comes off mostly around the sides and cuticle area but the rest doesn&#x27;t budge at all.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff - but can&#x27;t remove it without damage to the nails.</li>
            <li>I prefer reds that lean more towards blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li>and I was impressed that even I could make this color stay on for that long.</li>
            <li>I really love this true blue-red shade.</li>
            <li>Received this product so quickly and it came with original box!</li>
            <li>Provides a beautiful shine and also hardens the nail slightly (not as much as a salon gel does).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t stop me from ordering more polish colors in the future (just purchased 2 more today)!</li>
            <li>I think the color is pretty true to what is says-</li>
            <li>This red is a beautiful, true red and it lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply in thin, but full coat, layers and that gives great coverage while lasting the full two weeks.</li>
            <li>More of a fire engine red not a scarlet or garnet as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>it is scarlet, cherry, super duper red, and NOT the right color for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - stays on for the better part of 10 days with minimal chipping (even washing dishes everyday, showers, etc, you don&#x27;t have to avoid water).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it at all, but it covers fine if you do the two thin coats like they instruct</li>
            <li>They should look into making it a bigger size so it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My salon said that if your nails ever get dull looking with gel polish, you can just put rubbing alcohol onto a paper towel and give your nails a little rub and they&#x27;ll be gorgeous!</li>
            <li>color was just what I wanted, a week minimum between mani&#x27;s usually, only when the nail grows out so much that there is no polish at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Classic red.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a pin-up red.</li>
            <li>As much as it costs it should b the same size as regular polish!</li>
            <li>It is also a little more orange red than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to find something that is a really bold color without being to pink or orange but the balance on this is just right.</li>
            <li>very orange red not at all the blue red pictured, also must cure twice as long as Sally Hanson gel polish, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Pretty and hard to chip</li>
            <li> So, I have to use the polishes that practically chip before they are dry until the 3-4 months when my nails grow out and strengthen back up.</li>
            <li> Protects the nail, so they are growing so long I have to cut them back, and I wear them long.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional by any means</li>
            <li> It will still last at least 1 and a half weeks, so now I am stuck with orange nails for Christmas when I wanted red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what people are talking about when they say this is an orangey red.</li>
            <li> (maybe the other reviewer had a bum bottle?).</li>
            <li> This lasts about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I went about a month without redoing my nails and the red had not chipped.</li>
            <li> I prefer my gel polish to be thick but this required 3-4 coats of color to be opaque.</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> As much as it costs it should b the same size as regular polish! They should look into making it a bigger size so it will be well worth the money. Especially since u also have to buy additional things such as a lamp, foil, etc...for it to work correctly...</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful red. I really love this true blue-red shade. It&#x27;s tough to find something that is a really bold color without being to pink or orange but the balance on this is just right. I&#x27;ve had great wear with this color as well. It&#x27;s easy to apply in thin, but full coat, layers and that gives great coverage while lasting the full two weeks. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a pin-up red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what people are talking about when they say this is an orangey red. I don&#x27;t think red comes truer than this! I got this color with my sensationail gel starter kit and I love it. I will update with how well the polish stays without chipping. So far, it&#x27;s gorgeous! My salon said that if your nails ever get dull looking with gel polish, you can just put rubbing alcohol onto a paper towel and give your nails a little rub and they&#x27;ll be gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Love the color and product</li>
            <li> very orange red not at all the blue red pictured, also must cure twice as long as Sally Hanson gel polish, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I love this color, and it lasts. I wash my hands ALL THE TIME. I have an infant, so I&#x27;m constantly washing things and washing my hands. This lasts about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> color was just what I wanted, a week minimum between mani&#x27;s usually, only when the nail grows out so much that there is no polish at the bottom. Protects the nail, so they are growing so long I have to cut them back, and I wear them long. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and matched description</li>
            <li> I think the color is pretty true to what is says- it is scarlet, cherry, super duper red, and NOT the right color for me.  I don&#x27;t love it at all, but it covers fine if you do the two thin coats like they instruct (maybe the other reviewer had a bum bottle?).</li>
            <li> If you love having your nails looking great without the spendy salon prices, this item is for you.</li>
            <li> Pretty and hard to chip</li>
            <li> I love this color!  Classic red.  The polish lasts and if you use it correctly it will not be sticky.  Follow the directions and don&#x27;t touch your nails.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;Sensationail&amp;#34; Set itself, so I am not upset about that. But, this color is NOT red. It is a pinkish-orange. It will still last at least 1 and a half weeks, so now I am stuck with orange nails for Christmas when I wanted red.</li>
            <li> Not as deep a red as I thought. More of a fire engine red not a scarlet or garnet as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the picture looks.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Affordable price</li>
            <li> Love this product - stays on for the better part of 10 days with minimal chipping (even washing dishes everyday, showers, etc, you don&#x27;t have to avoid water).  Provides a beautiful shine and also hardens the nail slightly (not as much as a salon gel does).  However, there is no way to get the product off without damaging your nail and/or nail bed.  I scuff them up, and have soaked them until my nails curled up.  Wrapped my nails in cotton balls, placed them in the foil inserts EVERYTHING possible.  Purchased their scraping tool - even bought the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula in the white bottle.  The product comes off mostly around the sides and cuticle area but the rest doesn&#x27;t budge at all.  My nails were ruined.  No matter how I tried to get the stuff off, my nail always came off with it no matter what I did.  So, I have to use the polishes that practically chip before they are dry until the 3-4 months when my nails grow out and strengthen back up. Love this stuff - but can&#x27;t remove it without damage to the nails.</li>
            <li> Received  and packaged well. The polish itself bubbles &amp; chips after a day. not good</li>
            <li> Received this product so quickly and it came with original box!</li>
            <li> This red is a beautiful, true red and it lasts FOREVER. Seriously though, I went about a month without redoing my nails and the red had not chipped. It had grown out but was still in perfect condition. I am not a professional by any means and I was impressed that even I could make this color stay on for that long. I loved this product and I will buy it again when I run out of the first one!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Never dries, like, ever</li>
            <li> I prefer my gel polish to be thick but this required 3-4 coats of color to be opaque. It is also a little more orange red than I expected. I prefer reds that lean more towards blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t stop me from ordering more polish colors in the future (just purchased 2 more today)!</li>
