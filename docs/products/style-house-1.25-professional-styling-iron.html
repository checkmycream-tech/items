            <li>Patricia Alexander Love</li>
            <li>I have always love style house products.</li>
            <li>I have never been pleased with a styling iron until now.</li>
            <li>I will be a returning customer, for sure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>Glad I asked about the price after they straightened my hair</li>
            <li>Love using it with Chi hair products.</li>
            <li>all of these praises, I must ask.. am I able to replace it using the warranty?</li>
            <li>I bought one of these about 4it months ago and love it, however the plate cracked</li>
            <li>I just brought this styling iron and I am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>So glad I could find it on Amazin.</li>
            <li>But anyways, happy I baught a new one :)</li>
            <li>and it did a pretty good job straightening it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think it should be that easy to break.</li>
            <li>I bought a deluxe kit for my mom &amp; sister that included the mini-iron for curls, a travel bag, stand for the large iron and a styling</li>
            <li>liked this so much</li>
            <li>My hair is silky and smooth, with virtually no frizz.  </li>
            <li>Got it for $40 which is a great deal for a $200 flat iron.</li>
            <li>It not only straightens, it also curls quite nicely!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m super excited that amazon has it.</li>
            <li>Heated up quickly</li>
            <li>, my hair wasnt too hot to touch, and it didnt smell like burning hair!</li>
            <li>It gets the roots very nicely and lays my hair down as if I&#x27;d gotten a relaxer.</li>
            <li>As a black woman natural for over three years, I stepped up and was impressed at how silky my hair was.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth your money</li>
            <li>i have super curly hair and it straigtens it very fast, faster than any iron i ever worked with.</li>
            <li>I got the style house flat iron as a gift because I have one and liked it.</li>
            <li>So happy I didn&#x27;t waste $40 on this impulse buy!</li>
            <li>I just used this iron for the first time</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s funny though, is</li>
            <li>I too thought it SEEMED it wasnt getting hot because it didnt steam</li>
            <li>most definitely recommend this item!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and it got really hot</li>
            <li>I should also note that I&#x27;m an avid bargain shopper.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to see how it straightened first.</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I so love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron works better than the Chi</li>
            <li>These days, great Customer Service is few and far between.</li>
            <li>Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li>It may be that this unit is damaged, but I would love to try a different unit, because I loved the wet to dry version.</li>
            <li>and I do like how straight my hair is.</li>
            <li>i love the pink and zebra print on it.</li>
            <li>very soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whether I wear my hair straight or decide to curl it</li>
            <li>It straightens very well and my hair feels especially soft.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally frizzy, somewhat wavy until it curls quite a bit right at the ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted me 2 years and the only reason why it broke was because I let it fall hard on my crystal weight scale, lol the plate of iron started to break.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a few minutes of working the curls out the frizz was COMPLETELY gone and my hair was super silky and smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>It left my hair so silky, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>She said that Style House makes a good product but this one is either defective or poorly made.</li>
            <li>I was sent a new one but was charged shipping.  </li>
            <li>But I have no problem ordering a new one again if need be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just afraid of how much more damage (on top of the heat) it will do to my hair</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said that this styling iron does not get hot enough to flatten my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiney-doesnt look fried on the end or smell burned!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this iron gets hot enough even though it says that it goes up to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much because I go to the hair salon on a regular, but they seem to be professional!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to everyone especially if you&#x27;re looking for flat irons that really straighten your hair and keeps it straight.</li>
            <li>This works so well on my hair and it is soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no where near tender headed</li>
            <li>However,  I tried it out today and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>like I did not lose my old one.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this flat iron performs very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can get stick straight hair, straight with a little curl at the end, or</li>
            <li>It lasted well over a year and most likely would have lasted longer if I weren&#x27;t so clumsy.</li>
            <li>I turned it on and waited to heat it up while I notice that the on light kept turning red and green</li>
            <li>and I had to pass it over the same spot numerous time trying to get my hair strand straight</li>
            <li>I never expected it, but she did!</li>
            <li>I am a flat iron fanatic and I have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>Being that I have long hair myself and having never had my hair straightened before I thought I&#x27;d have a little fun and asked her to try it out on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I write my review I want to remind the few people who said they were going to throw it away because it didnt get hot enough or because a plate broke....</li>

            <li> Before I write my review I want to remind the few people who said they were going to throw it away because it didnt get hot enough or because a plate broke....</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length curly hair and this flat iron left me with soft, bouncy, and shiny straight hair.</li>
            <li> But long story short, it cracked when it hit the floor and now only one side will heat up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron at Sam&#x27;s club as a combo pack including a hair dryer, wet to dry flat iron, two accessories kit and this 1.25 professional flat iron.</li>
            <li> the flat irons get the job done.</li>
            <li> They were doing a demo and asking for volunteers to get their hair flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying the pink zebra</li>
            <li> one negative is that the blades of the iron don&#x27;t open up as wide as my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li> , the plastic feels cheaper than other flat irons</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really much of an issue anymore.  </li>
            <li> Both me and my mom bought one on th spot along with other bystanders.  </li>
            <li> it usually poofs back up with in 30 min of flattening it no matter what i use</li>
            <li> BLACK, so that is what I expected in the mail!  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but he let me try it out first</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be &amp;</li>
            <li> While this was disappointing, I have to report that dealing with Style House&#x27;s Customer Service was not disappointing at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Style House 1.25 Curling Iron from Amazon and would&#x27;ve trade it for any other curling iron!  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL with the description!!  </li>
            <li> I bought one previously at Sam&#x27;s club, my son dropped, which cracked the plate.</li>
            <li> My hair gets straighter in less time than before.  </li>
            <li> I was at Kroger today and the there was a sales lady going around selecting a few people to be apart of this &amp;#34;amazing deal.&amp;#34; So I stopped by being skeptical of the whole thing but by the end</li>
            <li> Previous to this one I had one in purple from a lady who was selling cosmetics as well.</li>
            <li> Because it was so small, and my hair is so thick, it does take a little while (about 2 hrs) to do my hair if that&#x27;s the only thing that I use.</li>
            <li> I can add a little bit of a curl at the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused as to why someone would only give this product one star...</li>

            <li> Product did not work when I received it, had to send it back for a refund as they don&#x27;t do replacements. I didn&#x27;t bother buying another and got another product elsewhere. I know we may have just received a bad unit, but its not a good impression.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE flat iron.  It not only straightens, it also curls quite nicely!  I can get stick straight hair, straight with a little curl at the end, or spirals of curls all over.  MY FAVORITE.  My only complaint would be &amp;#34;Why does the purple iron have to cost more??&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works so well on my hair and it is soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused as to why someone would only give this product one star...it&#x27;s amazing!! And I love how I can also curl my hair with it! The best straightener I have ever used! 👏👏</li>
            <li> The worst thing I ever got :((( pulls my hair . W very weak. Not smooth opening and closing</li>
            <li> I just used this iron for the first time and I do like how straight my hair is. I have extremely thick hair and it did a pretty good job straightening it. However, it pulled my hair very badly. I&#x27;m no where near tender headed and it hurt. I will not use this again. I&#x27;m going to send it back and ask for a refund. What&#x27;s funny though, is the sales lady specifically told me (without me asking) that it doesn&#x27;t pull hair at all. If it wasn&#x27;t for that one thing I would love it. I&#x27;m just afraid of how much more damage (on top of the heat) it will do to my hair</li>
            <li> Dumbest design ever for control placement - inside the iron!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Style House 1.25 Curling Iron from Amazon and would&#x27;ve trade it for any other curling iron!  I just wished they made a larger iron,. i.e., 2.0 for longer hair.  Patricia Alexander Love</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing wrong. Even though I followed the directions perfectly it didn&#x27;t seem to work correctly. Finally my hair dresser asked me to bring it into the salon on my next appointment. My hair dresser said that this styling iron does not get hot enough to flatten my hair. She said that Style House makes a good product but this one is either defective or poorly made. Of course I was unable to return this item because it was past the 30 day return policy. I go to the salon every thirty days, I only wish that I had returned it instead of waiting for my next appointment. I will not buy any products made by this manufacture again.</li>
            <li> Before I write my review I want to remind the few people who said they were going to throw it away because it didnt get hot enough or because a plate broke....IT HAS A LIFETIME REPLACEMENT WARRANTY!!!! DONT THROW IT AWAY!! I also bought mine from a demo at Kroger and was so worried I made a mistake! I used it this morning and I LOVE IT!!!! I too thought it SEEMED it wasnt getting hot because it didnt steam, my hair wasnt too hot to touch, and it didnt smell like burning hair! But it straightened perfectly! My hair is soft and shiney-doesnt look fried on the end or smell burned! Cant wait to try curls!</li>
            <li> The stylehouse irons are excellent makes for good styles</li>
            <li> Great product but had issues with the company. I bought one previously at Sam&#x27;s club, my son dropped, which cracked the plate. Purchased this and company sent me a leopard print.  BE CAREFUL with the description!!  Description does not allow you to choose a color, says COLOR: BLACK, so that is what I expected in the mail!  After contacting the company, they said I was at fault and that you can choose the color!  I don&#x27;t know if they are unaware of how their product is set up on amazon...they may need to look into editing the options. I was sent a new one but was charged shipping.  Again, they claimed b/c I was at fault.  I spoke, again, with a manager and demanded them to email a free return label, since it was their fault not mine!! I rate this product a 5 but a definite 1 for the set up and customer service!</li>
            <li> The irons work great, ive purchased Chi irons for over a 100 bucks and these work just as good for half the price,a good buy!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t by it in amazon, but i bought in Sams for 40 bucks and it works awesomely. i have super curly hair and it straigtens it very fast, faster than any iron i ever worked with. i love the pink and zebra print on it. its very stylish for a girly teenager like me. watashi wa daisuki: i love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Works great.</li>
            <li> Works nice. Gets hot fast. I don&#x27;t use it much because I go to the hair salon on a regular, but they seem to be professional!</li>
            <li> I was working at a road show in one of my local Sam&#x27;s club stores and ended up making friends with a girl who was selling the Style House products at another road show booth. Being that I have long hair myself and having never had my hair straightened before I thought I&#x27;d have a little fun and asked her to try it out on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally frizzy, somewhat wavy until it curls quite a bit right at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few minutes of working the curls out the frizz was COMPLETELY gone and my hair was super silky and smooth and straight. She even styled my hair so it angled inward (toward my neck) a bit on the inner layers and outward a bit on the outer layers. I wish I had a good pic; it looked amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this so much I bought a deluxe kit for my mom &amp; sister that included the mini-iron for curls, a travel bag, stand for the large iron and a styling comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that was a year ago, and I&#x27;m still dealing with the frizz. Expect me to finally be picking up one of these for myself very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those who are looking for warranty info, go here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I so love this flat iron.  I been having mine for about 5yrs now, I didn&#x27;t get mine from here but I&#x27;m super excited that amazon has it. I definitely will be buying the pink zebra print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most definitely recommend this item!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this iron from my mother as a gift,  and I was skeptical.  However,  I tried it out today and was pleasantly surprised.  My hair is silky and smooth, with virtually no frizz.  It lives up to the promise of heating up in just 10 seconds.  I am now a convert to this brand.</li>
            <li> I have always love style house products. I used to own one that lasted me for years but my mother broke it and I decided to go out and look for another one. So I bought this iron and its like I did not lose my old one.</li>
            <li> Very good results when using this flatiron.</li>
            <li> I have never been pleased with a styling iron until now. I purchased this item at Sam&#x27;s Club. 2 for the price of 1. Unfortunately, one of the irons did not heat up. While this was disappointing, I have to report that dealing with Style House&#x27;s Customer Service was not disappointing at all. In fact, it was a surprisingly great experience. These days, great Customer Service is few and far between. So, I must commend them. The Rep said she would call me back with additional information and follow up. I never expected it, but she did! Great job, Style House! I will be a returning customer, for sure.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t actually buy it on Amazon...I got it from a salesman that was going door to door to businesses offering them for $20.  I was a little skeptical, but he let me try it out first and it got really hot so I bought it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a couple days now and I can&#x27;t believe what a good deal I got.  This flat iron works better than the Chi I used to have. My hair gets straighter in less time than before.  And my hair feels a lot silkier than it did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is that the blades of the iron don&#x27;t open up as wide as my old flat iron.  After a couple days I got used to it and it&#x27;s not really much of an issue anymore.  It was definitely a little annoying at first.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the plastic feels cheaper than other flat irons I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this flat iron performs very well.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d pay $65 for it.  I&#x27;d probably pay $50. I should also note that I&#x27;m an avid bargain shopper.</li>
            <li> The best purchase I ever made!!!! Whether I wear my hair straight or decide to curl it the flat irons get the job done. I highly recommend these to everyone especially if you&#x27;re looking for flat irons that really straighten your hair and keeps it straight.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product in Sams last year. They were doing a demo and asking for volunteers to get their hair flat ironed. As a black woman natural for over three years, I stepped up and was impressed at how silky my hair was.  Both me and my mom bought one on th spot along with other bystanders.  Glad I asked about the price after they straightened my hair or I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  Love using it with Chi hair products.</li>
            <li> Aweful! Fries hair and doesn&#x27;t curl!</li>
            <li> I dropped it and the plate broke. :( I wouldn&#x27;t think it should be that easy to break.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this gem! It lasted well over a year and most likely would have lasted longer if I weren&#x27;t so clumsy. It left my hair so silky, smooth, and soft. Even a bit shiny! Because it was so small, and my hair is so thick, it does take a little while (about 2 hrs) to do my hair if that&#x27;s the only thing that I use. It gets the roots very nicely and lays my hair down as if I&#x27;d gotten a relaxer. PERFECT. I would buy this product over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of these praises, I must ask.. am I able to replace it using the warranty? I aboslutely love mine and about three months ago I dropped it while styling! It was horrible.. Lol. But long story short, it cracked when it hit the floor and now only one side will heat up. I&#x27;m looking to replace it with my warranty if I can because I still have the box and everything. But I have no problem ordering a new one again if need be.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 4it months ago and love it, however the plate cracked and I would like to get a replacement. Does anyone have any info how to contact manufacturer?</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the iron. It straightens very well and my hair feels especially soft. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I got the style house flat iron as a gift because I have one and liked it. It does what it say it dose.</li>
            <li> I just brought this styling iron and I am totally in love with it. I have problems straitening my hair it usually poofs back up with in 30 min of flattening it no matter what i use but when i used this styling iron it was almost as if I had gone to my beautician. It is definitely worth your money</li>
            <li> Loved it, best straightner I have ever tried. So glad I could find it on Amazin.</li>
            <li> I am a flat iron fanatic and I have tried many different brands. I purchased this flat iron at Sam&#x27;s club as a combo pack including a hair dryer, wet to dry flat iron, two accessories kit and this 1.25 professional flat iron. Lest Friday i finally opened the box and decided to try and as soon as I opened the box notice a crack on the plastic part by the heating plates. I turned it on and waited to heat it up while I notice that the on light kept turning red and green I tried on my hair and I had to pass it over the same spot numerous time trying to get my hair strand straight and it didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t think this iron gets hot enough even though it says that it goes up to 450 degrees. It may be that this unit is damaged, but I would love to try a different unit, because I loved the wet to dry version. I guess I will have to trow it away and look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> I was at Kroger today and the there was a sales lady going around selecting a few people to be apart of this &amp;#34;amazing deal.&amp;#34; So I stopped by being skeptical of the whole thing but by the end I thought &amp;#34;Well, it&#x27;s only $40 so why not.&amp;#34; I went home today to try it and Wow! I&#x27;m impressed. I have thick shoulder length curly hair and this flat iron left me with soft, bouncy, and shiny straight hair. Took me about 20-30 minutes to straighten it and I like that I can add a little bit of a curl at the end. She showed us how to use it as a curling iron as well but I wanted to see how it straightened first. I have a GVP digital straightener that I picked up from Sally&#x27;s for $60 on sale but it might have some competition after using Style House today. Heated up quickly and I did use it closer to the Max setting for my hair type. So happy I didn&#x27;t waste $40 on this impulse buy!</li>
            <li> Got it for $40 which is a great deal for a $200 flat iron. Received it before the shipping estimate, and I am happy that It was NOT a knock off version :) Previous to this one I had one in purple from a lady who was selling cosmetics as well. It lasted me 2 years and the only reason why it broke was because I let it fall hard on my crystal weight scale, lol the plate of iron started to break. But anyways, happy I baught a new one :)</li>
