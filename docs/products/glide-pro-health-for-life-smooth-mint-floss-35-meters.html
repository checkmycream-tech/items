    <ol>
            <li>Best floss I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>being said, this is the best doggone dental floss I&#x27;ve ever had &#x27;twixt my incisors.</li>
            <li>Glide Pro-Health is a perfect floss for me.  </li>
            <li>But still the best.</li>
            <li>Very good floss and works perfectly</li>
            <li>This mint smell very good.</li>
            <li>I thought, hey, this will be good floss then!</li>
            <li>it feels great and does not seem to hurt my gums..</li>
            <li>Works just great...</li>
            <li>This floss works great.</li>
            <li>But if string floss doesn&#x27;t work for you, tape floss is an excellent alternative, and loads better than not flossing.  </li>
            <li>I like tape floss much better, and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Multiple purpose products are always a joy for me and Glide has the best button material available.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant mint</li>
            <li>This floss may be the best available.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s for me a fair exchange for strangled fingers.</li>
            <li>get any better!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of troublesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does the job without breaking, catching on dental work, and causing undue irritation.</li>
            <li>The flavor is a nice side benefit.  </li>
            <li>Glide is like a ribbon, not s string, and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>But the floss itself is nice.</li>
            <li>It is kind of a chore</li>
            <li>This Glide is nice.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to test what kind of floss</li>
            <li>most people, I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but if you have tighter teeth like me, I&#x27;d go with something else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a very strong plastic.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well and glides easily between some of my closer together teeth, but the taste isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>It has a very light mint taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I understand the need for a very smooth floss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a strong and nicely minty taste.</li>
            <li>It is nice and smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t catch on your teeth like some cheaper brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>Pro-Health floss is much more slippery than the others.</li>
            <li>Again this makes flossing take more time and effort than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light minty taste is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way this floss works between my teeth, and i like the compact nature of the case</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easier to use and does a better job</li>
            <li>I wish it was more minty.</li>
            <li>Too many flosses tend to get stuck and/or break.  </li>
            <li>but this floss feels more substantial - it never frayed</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dental floss.</li>
            <li>Oral B makes one of the better tooth cleaning products on the market</li>
            <li>in some form or another for most of my life ... until I discovered Glide.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to use those floss needles on some of my teeth to be able to get the floss in/out of the spaces.</li>
            <li>That is, the gaps between my teeth are for the most part...not gaps.</li>
            <li>Does it contain a magic chemical along with that minty flavor, like some of the tartar control toothpastes?  </li>
            <li>to 90% more micro textured surface area than Glide Original\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>And no one seems able to copy them.  </li>
            <li>I love Glide dental floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to say I was overwhelmed by this product.  </li>
            <li>While I am not part of the over 50 crowd to which this product is targeted, I still found it an appropriate product for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many types of floss.</li>
            <li>It was smooth, strong and served it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
            <li>I believe string floss can clean better because it can act as a brush and grab at grit slightly more.  </li>
            <li>The most important comment I can make on this variety of Oral-B Glode floss is that it does not shred.</li>
            <li>How often you floss is much more important than what type of floss you use.</li>
            <li>but that also means that It slides from between ones fingers just as easily.</li>
            <li>I slips easily between even the closest of teeth, it doesn&#x27;t shred.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it is quite strong, and I had no problems with it shredding, one of my biggest pet</li>
            <li>Works  as good as any dental floss (I see no real difference in performance) but it does have a good taste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also strong -- it won&#x27;t snap like thinner, cheaper flosses.</li>
            <li>, It is smooth and goes through the teeth easily.</li>
            <li>This product is very strong and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this since we were out of floss and its availability was therefore a great opportunity to both review another product and obtain a necessary supply.</li>
            <li>- so I do know that experts exist in this important area</li>
            <li>and I would defer to them for detailed analysis.</li>
            <li>but if I am mistaken and there is some important reason this floss is indeed better for the over-50 set I am ready to be educated, please leave a comment!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time to unleash that pleasing smile of yours again!</li>
            <li>given the opportunity to try Glide Pro-Health for Life, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>The string floss cuts and doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>And if it is softer, can it clean as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>floss holds together, moves effortlessly and leaves my mouth feeling clean and</li>
            <li>always by Glide because I find the thickness to be ideal for removing food that is wedge in their tight without aggravating my gums.</li>
            <li>product description says that it is Glide&#x27;s \\&quot;softest\\&quot; floss, and to me this is what makes it special.</li>
            <li>I do recall a dental hygienist one time giving me a 5 minute lecture on special expanding types of floss</li>
            <li>FYI I&#x27;m not the true target audience for this product since I&#x27;m not over age 50.</li>
            <li>B001F51R7E Glide Comfort Plus Dental Floss]], full time.  </li>
            <li>This floss is worlds better than the cheaper string floss and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>so why not simply give it a good flavor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may be true.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a mild minty flavor.</li>
            <li>And I think that is its primary purpose, to be very gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>This floss is the heavy duty thick type that works great for my not so perfect teeth!</li>
            <li>It is strong, doesn&#x27;t shred and is gentle.</li>
            <li>and worth a try.</li>
            <li>So maybe if you have more sensitive gums, this product might make a difference.</li>
            <li>(no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried)</li>
            <li>This is just right.</li>
            <li>If the price is right for you, get it.</li>
            <li>When I need to attach a button, especially a large one on a jacket of other heavy garment, I found floss to be an excellent substitute for sewing thread.  </li>
            <li>quite* as thick, so I was still able to use it, but Reach brand tends to fit better with my tighter teeth.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this I thought, \\&quot;yeah, right.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed; this brand of Oral-B claims to be super soft, but it still hurt my gums in some places while other brands (namely Reach), flossing with the same pressure, do not bother</li>
            <li>also liked that it has a small window so that I can easily see when I&#x27;m running out of floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The added tape width feels as though it might clean better (make up for not having brushing action of string floss), but feels to glide slightly less as there is more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There most definitely IS a difference.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely put this product on my shopping list because it is a stand-out for quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made out of some kind of fibrous string that shreds or hangs on rough edges.</li>
            <li>I am used to causing the gums around those crowns to bleed and be irritated but that didn&#x27;t happen the first time I used the floss.</li>
            <li>Glide is a powerful holder and does not wear out nearly as fast as thread.  </li>
            <li>but necessary if you want healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, this floss is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t shred, and cleans my teeth and gums without major irritation.</li>
            <li>think i actually prefer it to their standard floss because it does a good job and feels pretty good on any slightly ginger spots on the gums between teeth.  </li>
            <li>To the Glide Floss Newbie - Glide offers a wonderful, easy flossing experience especially for those of us who have teeth with very small space between them.  </li>
            <li>Unlike narrow, single strand floss that can and has cut gums Glide is easy on them and makes flossing a joy.  </li>
            <li>It costs more than other brands, but it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li>, it is more comfortable to use than the thin string, as comfortable as relaxing into your bed pillow at night.  </li>
            <li>It offers an advantage to those who have not switched to floss tape before and who want a friendly transition to modern high-tech floss.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it really seems the same as any other Glide floss I&#x27;ve ever used, and I am equally happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m over 50, and it&#x27;s made by the same company that makes my normal floss, I figured it had to be even better.  </li>
            <li>(though if I had there is certainly some chance I would have passed it by...</li>
            <li>I really am not particular on floss, but I did like it and bought more of it.</li>
            <li>Package says its geared towards senior citizens, but seems to work just fine for younger people as well.  </li>
            <li>It slips in and out easily between teeth and rarely breaks on sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>It does not fray the way the string floss does but retains its shape very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s definitely worth the money as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>The Amazon page says it is for people over-50 because it is their softest floss -- really?  </li>
            <li>:)  The wide side of the floss gets (IMHO)</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like the feel of thinner and coarser textured flosses.</li>
            <li>But does that suffice when what you really want from your dental floss is cleansing?&lt;br</li>
            <li>dentist recommends floss that is thick, but for those who have sensitive gums or who are just starting to floss, then this should be perfect.</li>
            <li>(I have used Glide Deep Clean and also the Oral-B Satin Floss.)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It easily slipped between the tight molars and lifted the leftovers right out from around the crowns.</li>
            <li>although to me it feels the same as the Glide Deep Clean Cool Mint floss.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised when I used this floss for the first time.</li>
            <li>I asked the hygienist how that could have been possible since I&#x27;ve been flossing much more daily.</li>
            <li>This packaging, the \\&quot;Pro Health For Life\\&quot; is stated for people 50 years or older for what it says \\&quot;because it is Glide&#x27;s softest floss\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice smooth floss that is easy to get in between tightly packed teeth, due to being a thin strong ribbon rather than a waxy string.  </li>
            <li>Plus that I normally use</li>
            <li>For me it is a normal part of dental hygiene</li>
            <li>Its minty flavor is not quite as sharp as their \\&quot;Deep Clean - Cool Mint\\&quot; floss, which some people may prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is extremely strong, yet at the same time comfortably wide and smooth - it glides over my enamel like an Olympic skater &#x27;cross a frozen pond.</li>
            <li>The key to regular flossing is making it easy.  </li>
            <li>(40 m vs 35 m in the new one).  </li>
            <li>Your mouth will thank you and maybe the people near you as your breath improves!</li>
            <li>And GLIDE is quite smooth; sliding down between my teeth almost effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product offers something new in this catagory:</li>
            <li>But I personally really cannot tell any difference compared to Glide in the normal packaging that I have used for years, or compared to generic equivalents.  </li>
            <li>But perhaps if the tape is extremely bunched up, the very tightest teeth out there might feel it slightly more due to its width.</li>
            <li>Kind of like the aroma of a pill that&#x27;s coated with a pleasant taste to mask the awful taste of the medicine itself.</li>
            <li>I doubt most people floss as roughly as I do, though; unless you pull on it very hard, it should be just fine.</li>
            <li>Had braces years ago and things are still fairly well lined up... but stopped using the retainer a couple decades ago, and now there are a few really tight places that make flossing a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the critical thing is for the floss to break the biolayer of material between the teeth and clear it off the gums - and this product certainly does that well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet it feels soft on gums and fingers.</li>
            <li>So Glide might not be for everyone, but I do believe it can be used by nearly anyone.  </li>
            <li>At least most of the time.  </li>
            <li>MUCH smoother than the floss made of tiny fibers.</li>
            <li>Unless they have done studies, this seems like a wild marketing claim.  </li>
            <li>It does its job better than the traditional round, waxy stuff.</li>
            <li>I have noticed, though, that the price you pay for the little extra bit of softness is that this floss is more prone to break while you&#x27;re using it than regular Glide.</li>
            <li>It really seems like the same stuff with a minor taste tweak and an entirely new target market.</li>
            <li>Because this floss is more shaped like a shoe string (narrow and wide)</li>
            <li>but I strongly suspect there is very little difference between the different types.</li>
            <li>There was no bleeding, and since I almost always bleed when I floss, this was a major plus for me.  </li>
            <li>do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough</li>
            <li>it is very silky and thus somewhat slippery and harder to grab on to.  </li>
            <li>If you like regular \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; dental floss, you&#x27;ll like this product, as it&#x27;s not terribly different from the normal Glide Pro-Health floss.</li>
            <li>I have a supply of the standard Glide at home, and when the new, Pro-Health version arrived, I tested it side-by-side with the standard product.</li>
            <li>Still though - I figured floss is floss, right?&lt;br /&gt;Actually I would say this floss is pretty different from other tape flosses I have used.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t shred as easily as some other floss brands, it still is a little thicker than others.</li>
            <li>I mean, as far as dental floss goes, it&#x27;s certainly adequate.</li>
            <li>Neither of those factors made a difference in how I was able to use the floss; i.e. I had no trouble fitting it between my teeth, and it was no more difficult to handle than any other dental floss.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no better product than Glide for those of us with teeth very close together (high contact in dental parlance).  </li>
            <li>Glide is a little expensive, and the quality of the product isn&#x27;t as strong as it was originally.  </li>
            <li>those above 50 ought to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss glides smoothly, like other brands that are not specially made for over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have \\&quot;garbage collection spots\\&quot; between teeth and crowns that seem to collect half a meal and then laugh at the floss that tries to get it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different versions of Oral B&#x27;s Dental floss, while this floss may be aimed at people over 50, the primary difference I found was that the floss is a slightly less stiff material than their standard floss and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as likely to cut your gums regardless of</li>

            <li> Oral B makes one of the better tooth cleaning products on the market</li>
            <li> in some form or another for most of my life ... until I discovered Glide.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to use those floss needles on some of my teeth to be able to get the floss in/out of the spaces.</li>
            <li> That is, the gaps between my teeth are for the most part...not gaps.</li>
            <li> Does it contain a magic chemical along with that minty flavor, like some of the tartar control toothpastes?  </li>
            <li> to 90% more micro textured surface area than Glide Original\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> And no one seems able to copy them.  </li>
            <li> I love Glide dental floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to say I was overwhelmed by this product.  </li>
            <li> While I am not part of the over 50 crowd to which this product is targeted, I still found it an appropriate product for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many types of floss.</li>
            <li> It was smooth, strong and served it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
            <li> I believe string floss can clean better because it can act as a brush and grab at grit slightly more.  </li>
            <li> The most important comment I can make on this variety of Oral-B Glode floss is that it does not shred.</li>
            <li> How often you floss is much more important than what type of floss you use.</li>
            <li> but that also means that It slides from between ones fingers just as easily.</li>
            <li> I slips easily between even the closest of teeth, it doesn&#x27;t shred.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it is quite strong, and I had no problems with it shredding, one of my biggest pet</li>
            <li> Works  as good as any dental floss (I see no real difference in performance) but it does have a good taste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also strong -- it won&#x27;t snap like thinner, cheaper flosses.</li>
            <li> , It is smooth and goes through the teeth easily.</li>
            <li> This product is very strong and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since we were out of floss and its availability was therefore a great opportunity to both review another product and obtain a necessary supply.</li>
            <li> - so I do know that experts exist in this important area</li>
            <li> and I would defer to them for detailed analysis.</li>
            <li> but if I am mistaken and there is some important reason this floss is indeed better for the over-50 set I am ready to be educated, please leave a comment!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time to unleash that pleasing smile of yours again!</li>
            <li> given the opportunity to try Glide Pro-Health for Life, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> The string floss cuts and doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li> And if it is softer, can it clean as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> floss holds together, moves effortlessly and leaves my mouth feeling clean and</li>
            <li> always by Glide because I find the thickness to be ideal for removing food that is wedge in their tight without aggravating my gums.</li>
            <li> product description says that it is Glide&#x27;s \\&quot;softest\\&quot; floss, and to me this is what makes it special.</li>
            <li> I do recall a dental hygienist one time giving me a 5 minute lecture on special expanding types of floss</li>
            <li> FYI I&#x27;m not the true target audience for this product since I&#x27;m not over age 50.</li>
            <li> B001F51R7E Glide Comfort Plus Dental Floss]], full time.  </li>
            <li> This floss is worlds better than the cheaper string floss and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> so why not simply give it a good flavor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may be true.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a mild minty flavor.</li>
            <li> And I think that is its primary purpose, to be very gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> This floss is the heavy duty thick type that works great for my not so perfect teeth!</li>
            <li> It is strong, doesn&#x27;t shred and is gentle.</li>
            <li> and worth a try.</li>
            <li> So maybe if you have more sensitive gums, this product might make a difference.</li>
            <li> (no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried)</li>
            <li> This is just right.</li>
            <li> If the price is right for you, get it.</li>
            <li> When I need to attach a button, especially a large one on a jacket of other heavy garment, I found floss to be an excellent substitute for sewing thread.  </li>
            <li> quite* as thick, so I was still able to use it, but Reach brand tends to fit better with my tighter teeth.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this I thought, \\&quot;yeah, right.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed; this brand of Oral-B claims to be super soft, but it still hurt my gums in some places while other brands (namely Reach), flossing with the same pressure, do not bother</li>
            <li> also liked that it has a small window so that I can easily see when I&#x27;m running out of floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The added tape width feels as though it might clean better (make up for not having brushing action of string floss), but feels to glide slightly less as there is more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There most definitely IS a difference.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely put this product on my shopping list because it is a stand-out for quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made out of some kind of fibrous string that shreds or hangs on rough edges.</li>
            <li> I am used to causing the gums around those crowns to bleed and be irritated but that didn&#x27;t happen the first time I used the floss.</li>
            <li> Glide is a powerful holder and does not wear out nearly as fast as thread.  </li>
            <li> but necessary if you want healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, this floss is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t shred, and cleans my teeth and gums without major irritation.</li>
            <li> think i actually prefer it to their standard floss because it does a good job and feels pretty good on any slightly ginger spots on the gums between teeth.  </li>
            <li> To the Glide Floss Newbie - Glide offers a wonderful, easy flossing experience especially for those of us who have teeth with very small space between them.  </li>
            <li> Unlike narrow, single strand floss that can and has cut gums Glide is easy on them and makes flossing a joy.  </li>
            <li> It costs more than other brands, but it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li> , it is more comfortable to use than the thin string, as comfortable as relaxing into your bed pillow at night.  </li>
            <li> It offers an advantage to those who have not switched to floss tape before and who want a friendly transition to modern high-tech floss.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it really seems the same as any other Glide floss I&#x27;ve ever used, and I am equally happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m over 50, and it&#x27;s made by the same company that makes my normal floss, I figured it had to be even better.  </li>
            <li> (though if I had there is certainly some chance I would have passed it by...</li>
            <li> I really am not particular on floss, but I did like it and bought more of it.</li>
            <li> Package says its geared towards senior citizens, but seems to work just fine for younger people as well.  </li>
            <li> It slips in and out easily between teeth and rarely breaks on sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> It does not fray the way the string floss does but retains its shape very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s definitely worth the money as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> The Amazon page says it is for people over-50 because it is their softest floss -- really?  </li>
            <li> :)  The wide side of the floss gets (IMHO)</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like the feel of thinner and coarser textured flosses.</li>
            <li> But does that suffice when what you really want from your dental floss is cleansing?&lt;br</li>
            <li> dentist recommends floss that is thick, but for those who have sensitive gums or who are just starting to floss, then this should be perfect.</li>
            <li> (I have used Glide Deep Clean and also the Oral-B Satin Floss.)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It easily slipped between the tight molars and lifted the leftovers right out from around the crowns.</li>
            <li> although to me it feels the same as the Glide Deep Clean Cool Mint floss.  </li>
            <li> I was quite surprised when I used this floss for the first time.</li>
            <li> I asked the hygienist how that could have been possible since I&#x27;ve been flossing much more daily.</li>
            <li> This packaging, the \\&quot;Pro Health For Life\\&quot; is stated for people 50 years or older for what it says \\&quot;because it is Glide&#x27;s softest floss\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice smooth floss that is easy to get in between tightly packed teeth, due to being a thin strong ribbon rather than a waxy string.  </li>
            <li> Plus that I normally use</li>
            <li> For me it is a normal part of dental hygiene</li>
            <li> Its minty flavor is not quite as sharp as their \\&quot;Deep Clean - Cool Mint\\&quot; floss, which some people may prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely strong, yet at the same time comfortably wide and smooth - it glides over my enamel like an Olympic skater &#x27;cross a frozen pond.</li>
            <li> The key to regular flossing is making it easy.  </li>
            <li> (40 m vs 35 m in the new one).  </li>
            <li> Your mouth will thank you and maybe the people near you as your breath improves!</li>
            <li> And GLIDE is quite smooth; sliding down between my teeth almost effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product offers something new in this catagory:</li>
            <li> But I personally really cannot tell any difference compared to Glide in the normal packaging that I have used for years, or compared to generic equivalents.  </li>
            <li> But perhaps if the tape is extremely bunched up, the very tightest teeth out there might feel it slightly more due to its width.</li>
            <li> Kind of like the aroma of a pill that&#x27;s coated with a pleasant taste to mask the awful taste of the medicine itself.</li>
            <li> I doubt most people floss as roughly as I do, though; unless you pull on it very hard, it should be just fine.</li>
            <li> Had braces years ago and things are still fairly well lined up... but stopped using the retainer a couple decades ago, and now there are a few really tight places that make flossing a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the critical thing is for the floss to break the biolayer of material between the teeth and clear it off the gums - and this product certainly does that well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet it feels soft on gums and fingers.</li>
            <li> So Glide might not be for everyone, but I do believe it can be used by nearly anyone.  </li>
            <li> At least most of the time.  </li>
            <li> MUCH smoother than the floss made of tiny fibers.</li>
            <li> Unless they have done studies, this seems like a wild marketing claim.  </li>
            <li> It does its job better than the traditional round, waxy stuff.</li>
            <li> I have noticed, though, that the price you pay for the little extra bit of softness is that this floss is more prone to break while you&#x27;re using it than regular Glide.</li>
            <li> It really seems like the same stuff with a minor taste tweak and an entirely new target market.</li>
            <li> Because this floss is more shaped like a shoe string (narrow and wide)</li>
            <li> but I strongly suspect there is very little difference between the different types.</li>
            <li> There was no bleeding, and since I almost always bleed when I floss, this was a major plus for me.  </li>
            <li> do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough</li>
            <li> it is very silky and thus somewhat slippery and harder to grab on to.  </li>
            <li> If you like regular \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; dental floss, you&#x27;ll like this product, as it&#x27;s not terribly different from the normal Glide Pro-Health floss.</li>
            <li> I have a supply of the standard Glide at home, and when the new, Pro-Health version arrived, I tested it side-by-side with the standard product.</li>
            <li> Still though - I figured floss is floss, right?&lt;br /&gt;Actually I would say this floss is pretty different from other tape flosses I have used.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t shred as easily as some other floss brands, it still is a little thicker than others.</li>
            <li> I mean, as far as dental floss goes, it&#x27;s certainly adequate.</li>
            <li> Neither of those factors made a difference in how I was able to use the floss; i.e. I had no trouble fitting it between my teeth, and it was no more difficult to handle than any other dental floss.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better product than Glide for those of us with teeth very close together (high contact in dental parlance).  </li>
            <li> Glide is a little expensive, and the quality of the product isn&#x27;t as strong as it was originally.  </li>
            <li> those above 50 ought to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss glides smoothly, like other brands that are not specially made for over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;garbage collection spots\\&quot; between teeth and crowns that seem to collect half a meal and then laugh at the floss that tries to get it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different versions of Oral B&#x27;s Dental floss, while this floss may be aimed at people over 50, the primary difference I found was that the floss is a slightly less stiff material than their standard floss and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as likely to cut your gums regardless of</li>
            <li> but if I saw that the new stuff was priced significantly more expensive, I would knock my review down a star.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Glide dental floss is flat and slick; it easily slides between teeth even when there are tight contacts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light mint flavor, as do several other flosses I&#x27;ve encountered lately.</li>
            <li> First, because this floss is so smooth, it&#x27;s a little difficult to hang on to.</li>
            <li> In the past, it used to tout \\&quot;Teflon\\&quot; for creating a smooth experience between tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> Glide really does just glide past your plaque and does not work.</li>
            <li> not sure how much I believe the marketing pitch that this floss is for those 50</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little picky about my floss, always trying new kinds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to pick the wrong one up at the store.</li>
            <li> There are a few times per month, when my gums are extra sensitive, that flossing irritates my gums, even with the Comfort</li>
            <li> So apparently compared to other Glide variations, this is softer.  </li>
            <li> The material is wide enough to work between the teeth</li>
            <li> So, really, anyone with teeth that are a little tight can benefit from this floss, not just the over 50 set.</li>
            <li> The size of the floss is reasonable, not too thin, not too big.</li>
            <li> I usually use Oral-B Complete Satin Floss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really picky on floss, as long as it does the job.</li>
            <li> Sometimes its width simply felt it was pushing the stuff down, never again to be found.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have managed to get all of the above stuck between two tightly wedged teeth, shredding the floss and generating pain while its stuck.</li>
            <li> (Stuff is the new delimiter for a large number of ill or poorly defined things some of which we put in our mouths and others are not acceptable in general</li>
            <li> wanted to qualify a few things and speak to two different audiences here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Pro-Health came with the same mint taste as the Glide in the green package.</li>
            <li> This is not like the old fashioned string floss or the thick tape floss.</li>
            <li> We hate that we are at an age where we qualify for AARP membership, and to be honest</li>
            <li> But then again, I am certainly not a floss expert (though I do have teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wider than normal string feels gentle on the gums, and yet, I didn&#x27;t feel that it was ridding my teeth of the bits and particles so abhorrent to dental health.  </li>
            <li> It is a tape style floss, very thin, but the tape width is wider than the normal packaging that I recall from before, or compared to the generic brand equivalent that I have been using.  </li>
            <li> This hurts worse than my normal (Comfort Plus) ever did -- and it hurts every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Glide Pro Health works as well as other Glide floss.  </li>
            <li> and it slides back and forth with ease while cleaning out small particles of stuff</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t detect any variation from the other Glide products</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re not a dentist or anyone who extremely cares about flossing, just any floss will do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel motivated to buy all the other types of floss this company makes to compare</li>
            <li> It feels just a bit softer and a little thicker, which makes it harder to hurt your gums with it.</li>
            <li> It claims to be mint, but it&#x27;s certainly not a \\&quot;fresh, minty\\&quot; taste or smell.</li>
            <li> Personally, I will buy whichever version of the product costs the least.</li>
            <li> It is slightly wider than some other tape flosses I&#x27;ve used, and is slightly silky feeling.</li>
            <li> Not even if I haven&#x27;t flossed in days, when any other floss would make them bleed a little.</li>
            <li> found that the floss did indeed feel a little slicker in my mouth than other glide or tape style flosses</li>
            <li> In fact, I thought it felt slightly less \\&quot;soft\\</li>
            <li> I like this floss and the slight mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> One star for getting in tight places and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> If you identify with tight teeth and do not like string floss, I would recommend Glide to anyone.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ve been floss-resistant because of tightly packed teeth like mine...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got tight teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a floss tape that turns into floss thread when pulled tight in use.  </li>
            <li> The mint is a little powdery.  </li>
            <li> This dental floss smells a little bit like vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Because this floss is said to be a little thinner and softer, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little things in life can make a difference...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2RMJHG361QEYP]]Glide is specifically for people with tight teeth, who shred floss, and have trouble getting it in and out.  </li>
            <li> The floss itself is tough enough so that it doesn&#x27;t get torn when flossing.</li>
            <li> Some waxed, some flavored, some round or flat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Clinically, dentists recommend thin floss so that you can reach to areas that big fat ones can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and since I floss everyday this has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensative gums, and some other tape flosses feel as if they have sharp edges and are cutting at my gums.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m told I have a pleasing smile, my teeth are as cattywampus as a poorly tended picket fence - overlapping and/or jammed together in a way that makes it very difficult to floss.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular floss often (usually) frays and breaks in those tight areas, and some of the floss tapes are so slick that they slip out of my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight, and I often get floss stuck in my teeth, or it breaks off.  </li>
            <li> but it also didn&#x27;t feel thick (or too thin like some generic floss).</li>
            <li> But Glide has strength unlike that of ordinary flosses and does the job for me.</li>
            <li> , so I assumed that it would be even less irritating to my gums than the Comfort Plus floss usually is.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, it is much less irritating to your gums.</li>
            <li> So slippery it&#x27;s actually hard to hold on to -</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a negative b/c</li>
            <li> Every time I floss with the Pro-Health for Life floss, my gums swell and hurt for at least a day.  </li>
            <li> Flossing sucks, this makes it bearable.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have a container of REACH waxed floss in my office that I don&#x27;t like because it literally feels as if my teeth are being forced apart when I use</li>

            <li> One star for getting in tight places and that&#x27;s it. Glide really does just glide past your plaque and does not work. Unfortunately I went to the dentist after flossing with Glide for six months in between my cleanings. My gum numbers had gotten deeper. I asked the hygienist how that could have been possible since I&#x27;ve been flossing much more daily. She asked me what floss I had been using and I told her Glide. She replied, \\&quot;Yep that&#x27;s why. The Glide floss does not remove all of the plaque. I&#x27;ve even gone and talked to a Glide representative *who was handing out samples, at the grocery store about it. His response was, I know it doesn&#x27;t work.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve even tossed the rest of my glide floss in the garbage and bought reach instead.</li>
            <li> scented, shreds, breaks and everything else you hate about floss. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any one at any time. Move along</li>
            <li> It is nice and smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t catch on your teeth like some cheaper brands I have tried. The one I got has a lid that will not close, but that doesn&#x27;t impact the functionality enough for me to take a star off it.</li>
            <li> it feels great and does not seem to hurt my gums.. though i do bleed but probably because i have been using a waterpick instead of floss</li>
            <li> Works just great...I&#x27;m a little picky about my floss, always trying new kinds. Think I&#x27;ll just stick with this one!</li>
            <li> FYI I&#x27;m not the true target audience for this product since I&#x27;m not over age 50. Still though - I figured floss is floss, right?&lt;br /&gt;Actually I would say this floss is pretty different from other tape flosses I have used. (I have used Glide Deep Clean and also the Oral-B Satin Floss.)&lt;br /&gt;This Pro-Health floss is much more slippery than the others. So slippery it&#x27;s actually hard to hold on to - I have to wrap it around my fingers a couple times or I&#x27;ll lose my grip on it. So that&#x27;s a negative b/c it&#x27;s kind of troublesome.&lt;br /&gt;The floss also seems thicker than the others - I have to wiggle it to get it between my teeth. Again this makes flossing take more time and effort than usual.&lt;br /&gt;However, this floss has NEVER made my gums bleed. Not once. Not even if I haven&#x27;t flossed in days, when any other floss would make them bleed a little. And I think that is its primary purpose, to be very gentle on the gums. So in this way, the floss is great.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a strong and nicely minty taste.</li>
            <li> If you like regular \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; dental floss, you&#x27;ll like this product, as it&#x27;s not terribly different from the normal Glide Pro-Health floss. It feels just a bit softer and a little thicker, which makes it harder to hurt your gums with it. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything especially \\&quot;senior-specific\\&quot; about it; I think everyone could benefit from softer, gentler dental floss. I have noticed, though, that the price you pay for the little extra bit of softness is that this floss is more prone to break while you&#x27;re using it than regular Glide. I doubt most people floss as roughly as I do, though; unless you pull on it very hard, it should be just fine.</li>
            <li> Had braces years ago and things are still fairly well lined up... but stopped using the retainer a couple decades ago, and now there are a few really tight places that make flossing a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular floss often (usually) frays and breaks in those tight areas, and some of the floss tapes are so slick that they slip out of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough (no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried) yet it feels soft on gums and fingers. The light minty taste is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a similar need, we definitely recommend that you give this floss a try.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE SHOULD USE FLOSS. I really am not particular on floss, but I did like it and bought more of it. So, I give it 5 stars. It was smooth, strong and served it&#x27;s purpose! For that I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love the way this floss works between my teeth, and i like the compact nature of the case</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2RMJHG361QEYP]]Glide is specifically for people with tight teeth, who shred floss, and have trouble getting it in and out.  Floss, like a tooth bush, is somewhat up to your liking and personal characteristics.  So Glide might not be for everyone, but I do believe it can be used by nearly anyone.  This packaging, the \\&quot;Pro Health For Life\\&quot; is stated for people 50 years or older for what it says \\&quot;because it is Glide&#x27;s softest floss\\&quot;.  So apparently compared to other Glide variations, this is softer.  But I personally really cannot tell any difference compared to Glide in the normal packaging that I have used for years, or compared to generic equivalents.  In fact, I thought it felt slightly less \\&quot;soft\\&quot; if I had to compare.  It is a tape style floss, very thin, but the tape width is wider than the normal packaging that I recall from before, or compared to the generic brand equivalent that I have been using.  The added tape width feels as though it might clean better (make up for not having brushing action of string floss), but feels to glide slightly less as there is more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tape style, silky floss, that will feel and work differently than string floss (waxed or unwaxed).  I believe string floss can clean better because it can act as a brush and grab at grit slightly more.  But possibly thin tape floss might get deeper around your gums and teeth?  But if string floss doesn&#x27;t work for you, tape floss is an excellent alternative, and loads better than not flossing.  You could always switch between them too if you can stand string floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it really seems the same as any other Glide floss I&#x27;ve ever used, and I am equally happy with it.  The \\&quot;50+\\&quot; shouldn&#x27;t matter.  I have used Glide floss for years now.  I am not a dentist and can only share my personal experience.  If you identify with tight teeth and do not like string floss, I would recommend Glide to anyone.  But perhaps if the tape is extremely bunched up, the very tightest teeth out there might feel it slightly more due to its width.</li>
            <li> The most important comment I can make on this variety of Oral-B Glode floss is that it does not shred. I buy different brands of floss all the time, including store brands. There most definitely IS a difference. I would most definitely put this product on my shopping list because it is a stand-out for quality. It does the job without breaking, catching on dental work, and causing undue irritation. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m told I have a pleasing smile, my teeth are as cattywampus as a poorly tended picket fence - overlapping and/or jammed together in a way that makes it very difficult to floss. Standard brands either won&#x27;t go between my teeth, or will fray and snap during flossing, leaving an annoying and hard to reach knot between my teeth. But Glide has strength unlike that of ordinary flosses and does the job for me. It costs more than other brands, but it&#x27;s worth it - I&#x27;ve found no substitute. So if you&#x27;ve been floss-resistant because of tightly packed teeth like mine...it&#x27;s time to unleash that pleasing smile of yours again!</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001F51R7E Glide Comfort Plus Dental Floss]].  It was the floss that got rid of the gunk between my teeth, without hurting my gums.  At least most of the time.  There are a few times per month, when my gums are extra sensitive, that flossing irritates my gums, even with the Comfort Plus floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When given the opportunity to try Glide Pro-Health for Life, I was excited.  Since I&#x27;m over 50, and it&#x27;s made by the same company that makes my normal floss, I figured it had to be even better.  I was disappointed.  This floss looks even thinner than the Comfort Plus that I normally use, so I assumed that it would be even less irritating to my gums than the Comfort Plus floss usually is.  Boy was I wrong!!!  Every time I floss with the Pro-Health for Life floss, my gums swell and hurt for at least a day.  This hurts worse than my normal (Comfort Plus) ever did -- and it hurts every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to using [[ASIN:B001F51R7E Glide Comfort Plus Dental Floss]], full time.  Your mileage may vary, but for my oral health, this Oral-B Glide Pro-Health for Life floss is not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dental floss.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.  The Glide Pro Health works as well as other Glide floss.  The mint is a little powdery.  I prefer the flavor of the standard Oral-B Glide mint but both work equally well.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Glide dental floss is flat and slick; it easily slides between teeth even when there are tight contacts. This floss is worlds better than the cheaper string floss and lasts much longer. It does not fray the way the string floss does but retains its shape very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easier to use and does a better job and that&#x27;s definitely worth the money as far as I&#x27;m concerned and it does have a minty taste. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this I thought, \\&quot;yeah, right. Floss is floss. Some waxed, some flavored, some round or flat.\\&quot; I have managed to get all of the above stuck between two tightly wedged teeth, shredding the floss and generating pain while its stuck. I have \\&quot;garbage collection spots\\&quot; between teeth and crowns that seem to collect half a meal and then laugh at the floss that tries to get it out. I was quite surprised when I used this floss for the first time. It&#x27;s not made out of some kind of fibrous string that shreds or hangs on rough edges. It&#x27;s more like a very strong plastic. It easily slipped between the tight molars and lifted the leftovers right out from around the crowns. I am used to causing the gums around those crowns to bleed and be irritated but that didn&#x27;t happen the first time I used the floss. If you hate to floss for any of the reasons I described above, regardless of your age, give this one a try. It is strong, doesn&#x27;t shred and is gentle. Plus it has a mild minty flavor.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and glides easily between some of my closer together teeth, but the taste isn&#x27;t very good. I wish it was more minty.</li>
            <li> This floss may be the best available.  It slips in and out easily between teeth and rarely breaks on sharp edges.  The flavor is a nice side benefit.  Too many flosses tend to get stuck and/or break.  The key to regular flossing is making it easy.  The Glide floss is a pleasure to use (if flossing can ever be called a pleasure!) and worth a try.</li>
            <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve tried. MUCH smoother than the floss made of tiny fibers. This stuff literally GLIDES between your teeth. Because of this, it is much less irritating to your gums.</li>
            <li> This dental floss smells a little bit like vanilla.  Package says its geared towards senior citizens, but seems to work just fine for younger people as well.  No issues with tearing or shredding.</li>
            <li> This floss works great. My teeth are very close together and I had no problem using this floss. I didn&#x27;t find it to be slippery and had no problem keeping it wrapped around my fingers. I usually use Oral-B Complete Satin Floss but this floss feels more substantial - it never frayed but it also didn&#x27;t feel thick (or too thin like some generic floss). It has a very light mint taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that it has a small window so that I can easily see when I&#x27;m running out of floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe the marketing pitch that this floss is for those 50+ (because it is their softest floss) but I will definitely switch to this floss.</li>
            <li> Personal preference, and possibly your dentist&#x27;s recommendation, will determine whether your prefer string or tape floss. I like tape floss much better, and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light mint flavor, as do several other flosses I&#x27;ve encountered lately. The flavor is no stronger or particularly different than the others. It is slightly wider than some other tape flosses I&#x27;ve used, and is slightly silky feeling. Neither of those factors made a difference in how I was able to use the floss; i.e. I had no trouble fitting it between my teeth, and it was no more difficult to handle than any other dental floss. In addition, it is quite strong, and I had no problems with it shredding, one of my biggest pet peeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says that it is Glide&#x27;s \\&quot;softest\\&quot; floss, and to me this is what makes it special. I have relatively sensative gums, and some other tape flosses feel as if they have sharp edges and are cutting at my gums.  Whether that is because of their \\&quot;hardness\\&quot;, their thinness, or simply the way they are designed, I don&#x27;t know. This floss, however, doesn&#x27;t cause that problem. Where the floss touches your gums it feels almost as if there are rounded edges, and although my gums are cleaned, they aren&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this floss is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t shred, and cleans my teeth and gums without major irritation. Definitely a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> Works  as good as any dental floss (I see no real difference in performance) but it does have a good taste</li>
            <li> We hate that we are at an age where we qualify for AARP membership, and to be honest I don&#x27;t know why this dental floss is aimed specifically at the \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is the best doggone dental floss I&#x27;ve ever had &#x27;twixt my incisors. It is extremely strong, yet at the same time comfortably wide and smooth - it glides over my enamel like an Olympic skater &#x27;cross a frozen pond. It also has a pleasant mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - I&#x27;d recommend it for \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; but also \\&quot;for anyone with teeth.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss. It&#x27;s so easy to pick the wrong one up at the store. This is not like the old fashioned string floss or the thick tape floss. It is sort of in between. The string floss cuts and doesn&#x27;t clean well. The tape is horrible in every way. This is just right.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes one of the better tooth cleaning products on the market and I am a devoted fan of their products.  Glide Pro-Health is a perfect floss for me.  The material is wide enough to work between the teeth and it slides back and forth with ease while cleaning out small particles of stuff (Stuff is the new delimiter for a large number of ill or poorly defined things some of which we put in our mouths and others are not acceptable in general discussions.)that we do not wish to leave in our mouths.  Unlike narrow, single strand floss that can and has cut gums Glide is easy on them and makes flossing a joy.  For me it is a normal part of dental hygiene and I use it often.  Shucks, we country folks have to do what we can to maintain that last tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple purpose products are always a joy for me and Glide has the best button material available.  When I need to attach a button, especially a large one on a jacket of other heavy garment, I found floss to be an excellent substitute for sewing thread.  Glide is a powerful holder and does not wear out nearly as fast as thread.  If color matching creates a problem I use permanent colored markers for a close match.  And the buttons do not fall off.</li>
            <li> I like Glide floss and have been using it for years in it&#x27;s various iterations.  The one I am currently comparing this Pro-Health For Life version to is the [[ASIN:B003DXK6QY Glide-Crest Dental Floss - 43.7 yd, 6 pack]].  The packaging is different, and the taste is different ... but those are all of the differences that I could discover between the two Glide products.  Sometimes a product ventures into a different market - in this case, the 50+ (I&#x27;m 47 and I thought I qualified for this sub-group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to qualify a few things and speak to two different audiences here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) To the Glide Floss Newbie - Glide offers a wonderful, easy flossing experience especially for those of us who have teeth with very small space between them.  The Glide products will put your regular floss to shame ... I used the standard [[ASIN:B004XEDMAE Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach Mint Waxed Dental Floss 55 yards (Pack of 6)]] in some form or another for most of my life ... until I discovered Glide.  Glide is like a ribbon, not s string, and does a nice job.  In the past, it used to tout \\&quot;Teflon\\&quot; for creating a smooth experience between tight teeth.  I am unsure of this anymore as it isn&#x27;t labeled as such as it was in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) To those who use Glide Already - there is no big difference besides a longer, stronger mint taste and a shorter amount of floss in the packaging.  (40 m vs 35 m in the new one).  Both products acted the same for me.  Same size, feel ... just a stronger, aftertaste with Pro-Health for Life version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any comparative pricing listed ... but if I saw that the new stuff was priced significantly more expensive, I would knock my review down a star.  It really seems like the same stuff with a minor taste tweak and an entirely new target market.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with thicker flosses because some of my teeth are packed together tightly, thanks to years of braces. I used to have to use those floss needles on some of my teeth to be able to get the floss in/out of the spaces. This floss is meant for people 50+, but that didn&#x27;t bother me...I thought, hey, this will be good floss then! While it doesn&#x27;t shred as easily as some other floss brands, it still is a little thicker than others. It&#x27;s not *quite* as thick, so I was still able to use it, but Reach brand tends to fit better with my tighter teeth. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed; this brand of Oral-B claims to be super soft, but it still hurt my gums in some places while other brands (namely Reach), flossing with the same pressure, do not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most people, I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but if you have tighter teeth like me, I&#x27;d go with something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got tight teeth. That is, the gaps between my teeth are for the most part...not gaps. Even my dental hygienists have commented on it. In fact, I have a container of REACH waxed floss in my office that I don&#x27;t like because it literally feels as if my teeth are being forced apart when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I understand the need for a very smooth floss. And GLIDE is quite smooth; sliding down between my teeth almost effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT. Two things stand out as negatives. First, because this floss is so smooth, it&#x27;s a little difficult to hang on to. Yes, it slides between the tightest teeth with no effort but that also means that It slides from between ones fingers just as easily. Looping a bit of extra floss around my fingertips helped, but it&#x27;s still slides a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is the flavor/fragrance. It claims to be mint, but it&#x27;s certainly not a \\&quot;fresh, minty\\&quot; taste or smell. The closest I can describe it would be \\&quot;medicinal.\\&quot; Kind of like the aroma of a pill that&#x27;s coated with a pleasant taste to mask the awful taste of the medicine itself. What I don&#x27;t understand though, is why? There shouldn&#x27;t be any bad taste to mask...so why not simply give it a good flavor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of these are deal-killers...I&#x27;ll just rate this as \\&quot;good\\&quot; but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathan Sabin</li>
            <li> This is a nice smooth floss that is easy to get in between tightly packed teeth, due to being a thin strong ribbon rather than a waxy string.  Its minty flavor is not quite as sharp as their \\&quot;Deep Clean - Cool Mint\\&quot; floss, which some people may prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that there is no information on the package about in what sense it is \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot;.  Does it contain a magic chemical along with that minty flavor, like some of the tartar control toothpastes?  All the Oral-B website says is that it has \\&quot;Up to 90% more micro textured surface area than Glide Original\\&quot;, although to me it feels the same as the Glide Deep Clean Cool Mint floss.  The Amazon page says it is for people over-50 because it is their softest floss -- really?  Why does being over 50 mean that one needs a softer floss?  And if it is softer, can it clean as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being softer and micro-textured doesn&#x27;t equate to being \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot;.  Unless they have done studies, this seems like a wild marketing claim.  But the floss itself is nice.</li>
            <li> I use floss every night.  It is kind of a chore but necessary if you want healthy teeth.  One of my pet peeves is strangling my fingers in an attempt to grip the floss and use it.  Because this floss is more shaped like a shoe string (narrow and wide) it doesn&#x27;t cut the blood flow from my fingers.  HOWEVER it is very silky and thus somewhat slippery and harder to grab on to.  That&#x27;s for me a fair exchange for strangled fingers. :)  The wide side of the floss gets (IMHO) the sides of each tooth cleaner easier.  I like this floss and the slight mint flavor.  Would definitely buy in the future!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better product than Glide for those of us with teeth very close together (high contact in dental parlance).  And no one seems able to copy them.  The Rite-Aid knock off doesn&#x27;t quite cut it.&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?  Glide is a little expensive, and the quality of the product isn&#x27;t as strong as it was originally.  But still the best.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always by Glide because I find the thickness to be ideal for removing food that is wedge in their tight without aggravating my gums. It&#x27;s also strong -- it won&#x27;t snap like thinner, cheaper flosses. Finally, I also like the texture --  really don&#x27;t like the feel of thinner and coarser textured flosses.</li>
            <li> I love Glide dental floss. I have been using it for years. It does its job better than the traditional round, waxy stuff. Having said that, I have to say that this idea of Pro-Health for the over-50&#x27;s crowd is truly dumb. I have a supply of the standard Glide at home, and when the new, Pro-Health version arrived, I tested it side-by-side with the standard product. If there are any differences, they are tiny. I couldn&#x27;t detect any variation from the other Glide products (it comes in unflavored and mint). The Pro-Health came with the same mint taste as the Glide in the green package. The manufacturer claims that the Pro-Health product has softer floss than their regular version. This may be true. I did detect that the Pro Health felt a bit \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; than the regular version. So maybe if you have more sensitive gums, this product might make a difference. From my perspective, I can&#x27;t see any reason to seek this out. If you like Glide, you will like this. Personally, I will buy whichever version of the product costs the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to say I was overwhelmed by this product.  I mean, as far as dental floss goes, it&#x27;s certainly adequate. It&#x27;s wider than normal string feels gentle on the gums, and yet, I didn&#x27;t feel that it was ridding my teeth of the bits and particles so abhorrent to dental health.  Sometimes its width simply felt it was pushing the stuff down, never again to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is more comfortable to use than the thin string, as comfortable as relaxing into your bed pillow at night.  But does that suffice when what you really want from your dental floss is cleansing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t not buy this but I won&#x27;t go out of my way, either.  Hence, the middle of the road review.</li>
            <li> Very good floss and works perfectly, It is smooth and goes through the teeth easily. This mint smell very good.</li>
            <li> The Glide line is the only floss I use.  I slips easily between even the closest of teeth, it doesn&#x27;t shred.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and don&#x27;t expect to make a change anytime soon.  Flossing sucks, this makes it bearable.</li>
            <li> Works well; does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> While I am not part of the over 50 crowd to which this product is targeted, I still found it an appropriate product for me.  My teeth are very tight, and I often get floss stuck in my teeth, or it breaks off.  Because this floss is said to be a little thinner and softer, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the floss did indeed feel a little slicker in my mouth than other glide or tape style flosses I have tried.  There was no bleeding, and since I almost always bleed when I floss, this was a major plus for me.  I had no difficulty getting the floss through my teeth.  It never stuck or broke.  So, really, anyone with teeth that are a little tight can benefit from this floss, not just the over 50 set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior dental assistant and I&#x27;ve used many types of floss. I&#x27;m not really picky on floss, as long as it does the job. Clinically, dentists recommend thin floss so that you can reach to areas that big fat ones can&#x27;t. However, if you&#x27;re not a dentist or anyone who extremely cares about flossing, just any floss will do. This Glide is nice. I like the smell. The size of the floss is reasonable, not too thin, not too big. The floss itself is tough enough so that it doesn&#x27;t get torn when flossing. If the price is right for you, get it. If you think that it&#x27;s a little too expensive, get something cheaper. How often you floss is much more important than what type of floss you use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2XAMHK2AQ4UKG]]ALthough I&#x27;m in my 40s, I wanted to test what kind of floss those above 50 ought to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss glides smoothly, like other brands that are not specially made for over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommends floss that is thick, but for those who have sensitive gums or who are just starting to floss, then this should be perfect.</li>
            <li> This product offers something new in this catagory: This is a floss tape that turns into floss thread when pulled tight in use.  It offers an advantage to those who have not switched to floss tape before and who want a friendly transition to modern high-tech floss.  This product is very strong and very gentle.</li>
            <li> The little things in life can make a difference...and since I floss everyday this has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss holds together, moves effortlessly and leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
            <li> This floss is the heavy duty thick type that works great for my not so perfect teeth! Your mouth will thank you and maybe the people near you as your breath improves!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different versions of Oral B&#x27;s Dental floss, while this floss may be aimed at people over 50, the primary difference I found was that the floss is a slightly less stiff material than their standard floss and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as likely to cut your gums regardless of your age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think i actually prefer it to their standard floss because it does a good job and feels pretty good on any slightly ginger spots on the gums between teeth.  i&#x27;d buy the product.</li>
            <li> Just kidding. I ordered this since we were out of floss and its availability was therefore a great opportunity to both review another product and obtain a necessary supply. I am 45 and did not even notice the silly \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; thing on the package (though if I had there is certainly some chance I would have passed it by...no reason to rush father time!) I don&#x27;t feel motivated to buy all the other types of floss this company makes to compare but I strongly suspect there is very little difference between the different types. But then again, I am certainly not a floss expert (though I do have teeth so I&#x27;ve got that covered). I do recall a dental hygienist one time giving me a 5 minute lecture on special expanding types of floss - so I do know that experts exist in this important area and I would defer to them for detailed analysis. I think the critical thing is for the floss to break the biolayer of material between the teeth and clear it off the gums - and this product certainly does that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have no complaints and docked a star for what I suspect is a silly gimmick of \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; marketing - but if I am mistaken and there is some important reason this floss is indeed better for the over-50 set I am ready to be educated, please leave a comment!</li>
