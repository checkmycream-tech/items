    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is great!</li>
            <li>The thing I like best about Create Cosmetics is the purity of the ingredients - as someone with acne I have always resisted OTC and RX skin care products which contain a myriad of dubious chemicals.</li>
            <li>a month my skin is perfect.</li>
            <li>excellent customer service!</li>
            <li>Great AHA lotion!  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job</li>
            <li>it had great ingredients</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>and I wake up with very nice skin.</li>
            <li>Once I started using it my aesthetician even commented on how good my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>really good-</li>
            <li>I understand the ingredients in this product and feel good about using it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already looking better!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not it helps with acne because the Benzoyl Peroxide/Tea Tree lotion takes care of that, but I&#x27;m happy that additional Create products are available now.</li>
            <li>All opinions and reviews are my own.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if I put away the magnifying mirror probably nobody would notice them.</li>
            <li>i had to add my own tea tree oil to it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use your sunscreen every day when using this product.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks significantly more</li>
            <li>has a nice consistency and smooth feel</li>
            <li>like most skin treatments, you&#x27;ve gotta wear sunscreen and hats to avoid burning your skin while using this product</li>
            <li>Mostly, I love the way it makes my skin feel, softer than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>Stops the blemish from becoming out of control.</li>
            <li>Great Product , helped with my old acne scars a lot .</li>
            <li>but you will notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the results, especially at the price.</li>
            <li>I have also tried it and it is not like pure tea tree oil that is very strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- smells sweet like</li>
            <li>It definitely promotes turnover, and a couple of friends have remarked on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best acne cream find EVER!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this my skin is brighter and my complexion is more even in tone, especially some age spots at the top of my cheeks but under my eye area.</li>
            <li>we can live with it :)</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>but of course, my own addition of actual tea tree oil could skew the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular user of Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean beta-hydroxy acid scrub, but I had never used a leave-on product until I tried this stuff, which I received as a sample when I ordered Create Cosmetic&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide/Tea Tree lotion (which I love!!).</li>
            <li>all - so be aware, your skin may be more sensitive than mine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see major difference, I really love how my skin feels after I use the lotion.</li>
            <li>It work pretty well on my acne marks.</li>
            <li>I have used many exfoliating products over the years with mixed results.</li>
            <li>they got back to me right away and sent me a new bottle with better consistency of the product.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion for several reasons: it makes my skin feel soft and amazing, it absorbs very well and can be worn under mineral makeup, and it does not make my skin too &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; as some AHA products have.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product goes on smoothly, I haven&#x27;t had a reaction to it, although I recommend doing a patch test first before diving right in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- worked as a gentle peel</li>
            <li>which is really wasteful</li>
            <li>there was no tea tree oil listed in the ingredients as well, so the label is very misleading.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t used it up much yet, so i haven&#x27;t seen results from it.</li>
            <li>I am a 47 year old woman who still experiences mild breakouts, oily T-zone, and clogged pores while at the same time experiencing some signs of aging around my eyes (not crows feet in the corners but crinkling under my eyes when I smile and wake up in the morning).</li>
            <li>benzoyl peroxide products clear up my acne tremendously, and now this lactic acid product has my skin soft</li>
            <li>My dark spots are fading, and my skin is more even.</li>
            <li>The pimples on her forehead have diminished by more than half.</li>
            <li>I still have some mild breakouts but there is no inflammation and the tiny pimples I have</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has normal skin and it is not drying on her face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a heavy cream.</li>
            <li>more even, clear and tight</li>
            <li>Update on 02/19: wow!</li>
            <li>and my skin wasn&#x27;t this soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>Seems to be clearing up acne so far.</li>
            <li>Moisturized and gave me soft, even-toned skin.</li>
            <li>This product hydrated my skin and even though gave me pimple it was a minimal amount, so it was worth the trade.</li>
            <li>are not the kind that leave behind pigment scars.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, and pimples prone skin.</li>

            <li> i still dock them a star for the continued label misprint on the new bottle and not bothering to update their information on amazon (at least putting on a note/disclaimer that the label is a misprint and that there is tea tree oil in it).     </li>
            <li> Also it smells a little weird, but it is easy to get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> I found the Tea Tree oil/10% Lactic Acid lotion much less irritating than my normal Neutrogena product because I didn&#x27;t have to mechanically exfoliate at the same time.</li>
            <li> i dont know if it was because of the current climate during shipping, but it&#x27;s really thick that you couldn&#x27;t even use the pump.</li>

            <li> so I am not thrilled with that aspect.</li>
            <li> and I never wake up with bags under my eyes even after a late night.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I received my bottle</li>
            <li> Although it has a faint tea tree oil smell to it.</li>
            <li> BTW, I have very tough skin - even salon peels never make me peel or flake at</li>

            <li> I am a fan of products that have lactic acid and Teatree cause I have oily/combination skin however this brand made me break out it had great ingredients but this brand was not for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Once I started using it my aesthetician even commented on how good my skin looked.  I really feel like it has evened out my skin tone and in combination with my other products no more acne!  I&#x27;m hooked! Just be sure to use your sunscreen every day when using this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best acne cream find EVER! If you feel a blemish coming on or see one dab a little on before bed. May take a few nights to completely go away but you will notice a huge difference. Stops the blemish from becoming out of control. Life saver!</li>
            <li> It work pretty well on my acne marks.</li>
            <li> This is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month instead of Differin and my skin looks significantly more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- made my skin look really good- more even, clear and tight&lt;br /&gt;- worked as a gentle peel&lt;br /&gt;- non-prescription&lt;br /&gt;- has a nice consistency and smooth feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- smells sweet like syrup&lt;br /&gt;- makes my skin burn when I apply it (it lasts for a few minutes and goes away)&lt;br /&gt;- like most skin treatments, you&#x27;ve gotta wear sunscreen and hats to avoid burning your skin while using this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the results, especially at the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean beta-hydroxy acid scrub, but I had never used a leave-on product until I tried this stuff, which I received as a sample when I ordered Create Cosmetic&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide/Tea Tree lotion (which I love!!).

            <li> I have dry, sensitive, and pimples prone skin. Every product I used before to moisturize and alleviate dryness wold make me break out. This product hydrated my skin and even though gave me pimple it was a minimal amount, so it was worth the trade. Also it smells a little weird, but it is easy to get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> I am a 47 year old woman who still experiences mild breakouts, oily T-zone, and clogged pores while at the same time experiencing some signs of aging around my eyes (not crows feet in the corners but crinkling under my eyes when I smile and wake up in the morning). I have used many exfoliating products over the years with mixed results. I like this lotion for several reasons: it makes my skin feel soft and amazing, it absorbs very well and can be worn under mineral makeup, and it does not make my skin too &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; as some AHA products have. Since I&#x27;ve been using this my skin is brighter and my complexion is more even in tone, especially some age spots at the top of my cheeks but under my eye area. I do not experience any peeling or irritation with this lotion. I have been using it in conjunction with the BPT3 lotion, which contains Benzoyl Peroxide and I try to use that one during the day (because any BP product can bleach pillowcases), this at night. I still have some mild breakouts but there is no inflammation and the tiny pimples I have are not the kind that leave behind pigment scars. Honestly, if I put away the magnifying mirror probably nobody would notice them. The thing I like best about Create Cosmetics is the purity of the ingredients - as someone with acne I have always resisted OTC and RX skin care products which contain a myriad of dubious chemicals. I understand the ingredients in this product and feel good about using it. Mostly, I love the way it makes my skin feel, softer than it&#x27;s ever been. I used to get regular facials and my skin wasn&#x27;t this soft and dewy. BTW, I have very tough skin - even salon peels never make me peel or flake at all - so be aware, your skin may be more sensitive than mine.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I received my bottle so I have to use a QTip which is really wasteful so I am not thrilled with that aspect. Otherwise product is working well and helping my skin purge and it&#x27;s already looking better!</li>
            <li> Good product. Seems to be clearing up acne so far.</li>
            <li> Great Product , helped with my old acne scars a lot . Would definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared my hormonal acne in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;After a month my skin is perfect. Helps close up pores and brighten skin and I never wake up with bags under my eyes even after a late night.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying again</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because of it&#x27;s ingredients listed as advertised.  I have oily skin and i needed a serum to help with my breakouts (benzo peroxide is not an option, i have reactions to it) I received my bottle but I reviewed the ingredients and there&#x27;s no tea tree oil in it. Although it has a faint tea tree oil smell to it. Other than that the product goes on smoothly, I haven&#x27;t had a reaction to it, although I recommend doing a patch test first before diving right in.  My product arrived as promised. I will continue to use the product and update my review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> This brand seems to be the only brand that actually helps with my acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;The benzoyl peroxide products clear up my acne tremendously, and now this lactic acid product has my skin soft and I see a difference in my skin tone. My dark spots are fading, and my skin is more even.</li>
            <li> Update on 02/19: wow! excellent customer service! they got back to me right away and sent me a new bottle with better consistency of the product. i still dock them a star for the continued label misprint on the new bottle and not bothering to update their information on amazon (at least putting on a note/disclaimer that the label is a misprint and that there is tea tree oil in it).     i don&#x27;t know...but when i got it, the lotion looked like it curdled. i dont know if it was because of the current climate during shipping, but it&#x27;s really thick that you couldn&#x27;t even use the pump. it&#x27;s more like a heavy cream. there was no tea tree oil listed in the ingredients as well, so the label is very misleading. i had to add my own tea tree oil to it. i haven&#x27;t used it up much yet, so i haven&#x27;t seen results from it. i&#x27;m just reviewing it based on how it looked like upon receiving it and the misleading label. might update later, but of course, my own addition of actual tea tree oil could skew the results.</li>
            <li> Great AHA lotion!  Moisturized and gave me soft, even-toned skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My son has KP and lactic acid was recommended for the issue....It does a very good job and I definitely recommend this product. I also have used  it for my (aging) face....and I wake up with very nice skin. The only negative is that I do not care for the smell (tea tree smell) but, that is just a small problem....we can live with it :)</li>
