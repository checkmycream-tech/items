            <li>A FRAGRANCE EXQUISITE MIXED FEELINGS, LOVE THE SWEET FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>I was excited thinking its a better version of my favorite..</li>
            <li>I bought the  1MILLION INTENSE and i must say that it doesn&#x27; t smell good...........</li>
            <li>Great buying experience, I would most definitely reorder from seller.</li>
            <li>Not what I wanted it&#x27;s tooooo strong.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my choice (intense).</li>
            <li>Fast devilry and original perfume  and good price too</li>
            <li>Fantastic fragrance</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I ordered the right one.</li>
            <li>Oh yea and its original which is a huge plus,1 million</li>
            <li>This smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price enjoy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, he has girls following him all over the place wanting his number or wanting to be his girlfriend &amp; people telling him how darn good he smells.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sweet fragrance, but with a fruity twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, like the perfume, I m</li>
            <li>COULDN&#x27;T THINK STRAIGHT!!</li>
            <li>It smells good, but jut be careful when your ordering your ordering what you want.</li>
            <li>Elegant classy</li>
            <li>I buy this for my father, he like very much.</li>
            <li>Very manly smell!</li>
            <li>Much better than the benign fragrance of the standard Paco 1 Million</li>
            <li>THE first TIME I PUT IT ON AND DISTRACTED THE CASHIER</li>
            <li>so try it first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for activities where you would sweat a little (arcade, bowling, ice skating, dancing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not recommend wearing this work, if you work in a professional environment, going to a job interview, or having dinner with the in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>Too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>came as described and delivered fast</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it says intense.</li>
            <li>Please spend another $20-30 and get the real eau de toilette.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s intense &amp; you just need one spray.</li>
            <li>fragrance has a very fruity, think banana/grapefruit candy smell in the beginning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Longevity, I get about 6-8 hours with this, depending on how much moisture I have on my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this cologne in the mall and the smell lasted a whole day.</li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one here is 100% real.</li>
            <li>I really like when people ask me about the name of the parfume i had</li>
            <li>The only downfall is not being able to see the amount left.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this is a real eau de toilette or maybe very old.  </li>
            <li>but online I was able to buy twice as much for less than 1/2 the Sephora price!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>an hour in, you get this sweet, slightly floral scent that is light with the fruitiness in the background.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of hours it dies down to this nice mellow musky scent which is dark and sensual and stays close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loves it so much he barely ever wants to use it.</li>
            <li>this intense is not a better version of the original 1 million.</li>
            <li>As you may know or may not know, there is the regular scent and the intense scent.</li>
            <li>Totally epic, the fragrance is the bomb,best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned,truly a head Turner and attention grabber.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a young fragrance 17 to early 30s.</li>
            <li>Pay the extra bucks somewhere else and get the real one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new, I had the girl at JC penny open one up for me.</li>
            <li>This smells like a cross between old socks and the bottom of a birdcage.</li>
            <li>Gold bar bottle is cheesy but cologne is nice.</li>
            <li>dry down is slightly sweet with a wood tone.  </li>
            <li>and this item is the real thing and last a long, long</li>
            <li>That does not mean that one is stronger than the other.</li>

            <li> That does not mean that one is stronger than the other.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the intense version is a version that smells like the original Paco (green bottle)</li>
            <li> If my skin is dry, it does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very strong and long-lasting, but unpleasant.</li>
            <li> At the end of a long business day, I could not smell the scent  but others still could.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting scent, bottle is well made, and this 3.4 ounces will last me a few years.  </li>
            <li> is was half way gone, Finally had to tell my husband</li>
            <li> To strong and to artificial.</li>
            <li> I carefully researched the box, bottle,&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Sorry, just to strong, and smells like the late 80&#x27;s with a hint of 1 million.</li>
            <li> Not worth $60.</li>
            <li> A little fruity and little spicy.</li>
            <li> spray a little on your shirt or undershirt.  </li>
            <li> Bought this cologne a few days ago ..</li>
            <li> Sorry I did.</li>
            <li> This is fake.</li>
            <li> But it was bad, and immediately drew grossness to itself.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I lost the $60 I paid for it and the worst you cannot return it.&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One word...Irresistible.....couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the tester paper. Got one for myself and  my wife at Edgars at Eastgate shopping mall in Joburg.  Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for in a cologne</li>
            <li> Good lotion. Recommend 100%. Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes in the world!! This stuff is excellent. I get compliments every time i wear it. A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the scent, as does the wife</li>
            <li> Went by reviews...ALL LIES!! Not worth $60. Smells like bug spray. Too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. This smells like a cross between old socks and the bottom of a birdcage. It is very strong and long-lasting, but unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I ordered the right one. As you may know or may not know, there is the regular scent and the intense scent. That does not mean that one is stronger than the other. They are two completely different colognes. I was very pleased with my choice (intense). It has a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing! Very potent! Very manly smell! A little fruity and little spicy. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells horrid. To strong and to artificial. I threw the bottle out before is was half way gone, Finally had to tell my husband I could not stand the smell.  I bought it for him so what could he say.Sorry I did.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I ordered, but my husband still liked the fragrance. It smells good, but jut be careful when your ordering your ordering what you want.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my father, he like very much. Permanent for hours in skin, beautiful bottle, excellent for gift.</li>
            <li> Bought for my college age son who really liked this cologne.  He wanted me to go to Sephora locally to buy it but online I was able to buy twice as much for less than 1/2 the Sephora price!  Came quickly and well packed.  Gold bar bottle is cheesy but cologne is nice.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, like the perfume, I m so happy about it</li>
            <li> came as described and delivered fast</li>
            <li> 5 STAR&#x27;S GOOD PACO RABANNE INTENSE DEFERENCE FROM THE IRIGINAL.SMELL GOOD</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 shots of this will last you all day.  Much better than the benign fragrance of the standard Paco 1 Million</li>
            <li> Totally epic, the fragrance is the bomb,best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned,truly a head Turner and attention grabber. Oh yea and its original which is a huge plus,1 million it&#x27;s intense!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I wanted it&#x27;s tooooo strong. I didn&#x27;t notice it says intense.</li>
            <li> Best COLOGNE IVE EVER SMELLED,GOT A COMPLIMENT THE first TIME I PUT IT ON AND DISTRACTED THE CASHIER AS I WAS BUYING A DRINK!! SHE COULDN&#x27;T THINK STRAIGHT!! SHE TOLD ME I SMELL SO SO GOOD AND SHE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS RINGING ME UP BECAUSE I SMELLED SO GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> nice product. I got many compliments. it will last all day. At the end of a long business day, I could not smell the scent  but others still could.  Hint. spray a little on your shirt or undershirt.  don&#x27;t saturate the garment, spray about 7 inches away.  it will keep the scent longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the dry down is slightly sweet with a wood tone.  good for office and night life.  a great buy.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like what you get in a descent store.  Please spend another $20-30 and get the real eau de toilette.  I do not believe this is a real eau de toilette or maybe very old.  I lost the $60 I paid for it and the worst you cannot return it.&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson</li>
            <li> I just love the scent.  My husband tells me he gets compliments all the time.  It&#x27;s worth the price enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> This was a present and the person already had a 1 Million I thought I was getting the same one but he was very happy with the 1 Million Intense both are a must. Fantastic fragrance</li>
            <li> excellent seller the item is quality 100% recommend responsible is excellent brand</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne a few days ago .. Arrived on time, smells amazing ... Got lots of complements at work</li>
            <li> I bought the  1MILLION INTENSE and i must say that it doesn&#x27; t smell good...........it  smells greatttt!!....and the scent lasts throughout the day. i&#x27;ve been getting compliments all the timeabout it from bout males and females.. definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, arrived quickly and is worth its cost</li>
            <li> This smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it. I would recommend it. Has a very distinct kind of smell and doesn&#x27;t smell like powder as sent fades. Stays on my clothes for DAYS after I spray it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, he has girls following him all over the place wanting his number or wanting to be his girlfriend &amp; people telling him how darn good he smells.  It&#x27;s intense &amp; you just need one spray. He loves it so much he barely ever wants to use it. It also came 4 days earlier than estimated delivery date. Great buying experience, I would most definitely reorder from seller.</li>
            <li> I think they put cocaine in this stuff because the girl I went out with kept complimenting me on how good I smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance has a very fruity, think banana/grapefruit candy smell in the beginning. Which is good, not bad.&lt;br /&gt;About an hour in, you get this sweet, slightly floral scent that is light with the fruitiness in the background.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of hours it dies down to this nice mellow musky scent which is dark and sensual and stays close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sweet fragrance, but with a fruity twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a young fragrance 17 to early 30s. Something for an afternoon or evening date. It&#x27;s great for activities where you would sweat a little (arcade, bowling, ice skating, dancing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not recommend wearing this work, if you work in a professional environment, going to a job interview, or having dinner with the in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity, I get about 6-8 hours with this, depending on how much moisture I have on my skin. If my skin is dry, it does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sillage, if you are in the car with somebody, sitting next to somebody, or passing by somebody they would probably get a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this scent performs depends from person to person so try it first. I would go to Sephora, Macy&#x27;s, or Nordstrom and try it on yourself before buying.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> Oh the benefits this invokes!!!!</li>
            <li> Obviously scent is subjective, but the product quality is not.  Long lasting scent, bottle is well made, and this 3.4 ounces will last me a few years.  Can&#x27;t ask for much more at this price point.</li>
            <li> This is fake. I tried this cologne in the mall and the smell lasted a whole day. I ordered this one, but this cologne didn&#x27;t even last all morning. I went and tried the same cologne again at the mall and I can see and smell the difference..&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t buy this one. Pay the extra bucks somewhere else and get the real one.</li>
            <li> A FRAGRANCE EXQUISITE MIXED FEELINGS, LOVE THE SWEET FRAGRANCE AND THIS IS EXQUISITE; REALLY LOVE ME AND JUST LIKE FOR MY VA; WE RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting cologne&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.  is great. smells like a man. Elegant classy very nice.&lt;br /&gt;this one here is 100% real. I carefully researched the box, bottle,&lt;br /&gt; and this item is the real thing and last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;you can wear this everywhere&lt;br /&gt;One of the best colognes I have owned, lasts more than 8 hours on my skin. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cologne&#x27;s I have ever used. It is manly but not over powering. It is very unique. not like anything else I have found.  Women just love it. I know because I am told this almost every day by Women I don&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> I have to let people know... this intense is not a better version of the original 1 million. The original 1 million is, for me the holy grail of a new wonderful smelling scent. Unfortunately, the intense version is a version that smells like the original Paco (green bottle) Rabanne You know the...um too strong/can&#x27;t breath/headache stuff. Sorry, just to strong, and smells like the late 80&#x27;s with a hint of 1 million. It&#x27;s new, I had the girl at JC penny open one up for me. I was excited thinking its a better version of my favorite.. But it was bad, and immediately drew grossness to itself. In my honest opinion the original 1 million was so surprising, and probably the best fragrance to ever come from Paco. Good luck,</li>
            <li> i love it get good comploments</li>
            <li> This is one of the best  parfume i had been used. I really like when people ask me about the name of the parfume i had</li>
            <li> The only downfall is not being able to see the amount left.</li>
            <li> Fast devilry and original perfume  and good price too</li>
            <li> Good quality. Great service</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Very great price for this size of bottle.</li>
