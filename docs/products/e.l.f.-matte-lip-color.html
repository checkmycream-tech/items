            <li>i love your color.</li>
            <li>:) I am</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board to find the perfect light pink/nude lip liner.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and has a ton of pigment.</li>
            <li>I liked this, it looks awesome with my complex.</li>
            <li>Love how it gives me full coverage, nude lip , and super-hydration.</li>

            <li>Went on smooth and rich.</li>
            <li>Also, I was looking for the perfect light pink shade which I thought to be Nearly Nude from looking at the packaging</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more colors!</li>
            <li>Therefore, even if this lip can be used at any time and piles up favorite lips, such as a gross, from a top, it is lovely.</li>
            <li>Was a lot bigger than I expected which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Many people were like, wow....</li>
            <li>I got it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>This color is perfect and complements all my dramatic eye looks</li>
            <li>Its a peachy nude pink kind of color</li>
            <li>Also, comes off pretty easily, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last for this price.</li>
            <li>It uses, when erasing color clever of a lip!</li>
            <li>very drying.</li>
            <li>it really brings the look together.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is really nude and matte as I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to purchase another one .</li>
            <li>This product is too smooth and creamy to be long wearing.</li>
            <li>but i actually like this a lot more works very well if you put on a little balm before applying</li>
            <li>It completely just slides around on my lips.</li>
            <li>It is still a very pretty nude color and a good base color under gloss.</li>
            <li>The only upset that I have found so far is that it does dry my lips.</li>

            <li> I ordered this item looking for a cheap matte nude lip stick. I got it pretty quick. I used it that day. Its a peachy nude pink kind of color it has a fruity citrus type of smell to it. The only con to it is because its matte is shows the lines in your lips but as long as you exfoliate and use a lip balm before you use it. I looks really good.</li>
            <li> very drying. flaky. beautiful color though. just don&#x27;t like application.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect and complements all my dramatic eye looks it really brings the look together. It glids on smooth and wears good through out the day.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a lip liner when I ordered it but it&#x27;s actually a lip color. It is still a very pretty nude color and a good base color under gloss. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this matte color! I blend it with a darker lip liner and it looks awesome</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s probably more my problem, but it wasn&#x27;t a good color for me.  Goes on well and stays an okay amount of time.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect. It is really nude and matte as I was looking for. Wish it could last longer.</li>
            <li> I tried this lipstick for the price and the reviews. i was using revlons nude lipstick but i actually like this a lot more works very well if you put on a little balm before applying, otherwise it will emphasize dry and cracked lips. lasts throughout the day</li>
            <li> I like this pencil type of lipstick! It uses, when erasing color clever of a lip! Therefore, even if this lip can be used at any time and piles up favorite lips, such as a gross, from a top, it is lovely.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and has a ton of pigment. Great for the price. Recommended for sure! Has kind of a sweet taste, so if that kind of thing bothers you, don&#x27;t buy this. Also, comes off pretty easily, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last for this price.</li>
            <li> I love the color . The texture . It&#x27;s become one I my everyday lipsticks to wear . Getting ready to purchase another one .</li>
            <li> The perfect nude color!</li>
