            <li>[[ASIN:B002EX7WWU EZ Magic Comb Stretchy Beaded Hair Comb</li>
            <li>These are light weight and stay in my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>OMG...I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>They really stay in with very fine hair, and even when you fall asleep with them in!</li>
            <li>although one or two of the prongs can be easily bent.</li>
            <li>I have never found combs that will hold my fine hair</li>
            <li>Supposed to be for fine hair, but they keep sliding out.</li>
            <li>These combs are labeled for &#x27;fine hair&#x27;, however, it doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair as well as the cheap combs I&#x27;ve purchased in the drug chain stores.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and stays put.</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser commented how much she liked them.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give this 4 stars, because the price is higher than I would have liked, but it holds fine hair so well, it really is worth it.</li>
            <li>Good comb, only downside is it doesn&#x27;t have a handle.  </li>
            <li>Discovered that this was true.</li>
            <li>quick response too.</li>
            <li>These are the first ones I have ever found that do the job!</li>
            <li>Was excited to recieve these as i have long very fine hair and according to the description these combs are supposed to stay in place...</li>
            <li>I wear them almost everyday with successful results.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because they claim to be great for fine thin hair but that is not the case.</li>
            <li>These combs work great for fine, as well as thin, hair.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t hold my fine hair very well.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and though not perfect, these work better than most combs I have found.</li>
            <li>If yo have thick hair they would be great</li>
            <li>While slightly better than regular combs they still fell out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The squigglies between the teeth really work!  </li>
            <li>Love these combs so much, I bought a second pair.  </li>
            <li>if you have fine hair definitely grab a pair of these</li>
            <li>They really do stay in, and keep the hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Well made - Fast delivery-Great Service</li>
            <li>works great in my grandmothers thin hair</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t seem to find a small barrette to hold your hair back because it slides out all the time - this will work great for you.</li>
            <li>Amazon was the only place I could find new ones and as usual, service was great and delivery was  done in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty combs but a bit heavy and will slide out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li>Still hard to get the combs to hold--but that&#x27;s the disadvantage of red-headedness--not the disadvantage of the combs themselves, which are really nice,</li>
            <li>They fall out because they are too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>After a few hours I do have to adjust them back into place but they give more hold than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>But I have very fine and thin hair now that I&#x27;M 72 years old.</li>
            <li>I just bought these combs yesterday from a local store where I live.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very rural area and have health problems which prohibit me  from shopping as I used to do, so I depend on Amazon and their vendors almost on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I thought with the extra combs in these they would stay in thin hair better, but not the case.  </li>
            <li>When I finally took them out they were barely holding the hair up.  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores - very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I just bought these combs yesterday from a local store where I live.  They are going back immediately.  If you have thick hair like I do these combs are not for you.  When you get them in they feel like they&#x27;re going to fall out.  They release any small hairs so you have to plaster them with hair spray.  When I finally took them out they were barely holding the hair up.  Very bad design.</li>

As someone else mentioned, these are not meant to hold up thick swatches of hair.  Although my hair is fairly thick, they work just fine when I use them to hold surface hair rather than digging down deep.

            <li> These do help. I have thick, wavy/curly,fine hair. I think that combination is why it works for me.
