            <li>so I&#x27;m always happy to find a good product with that ingredient.</li>
            <li>Real easy and great results.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and my skin does feel smoother after each treatment.  </li>
            <li>I take good care of my skin though,  </li>
            <li>Everyone can benefit from a good peel a couple of time a week</li>
            <li>It tingles which is a good sign.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used acid peels and thought this product would be a good introduction - and perhaps it is -</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mask to start with to get use to glycolic treatments.</li>
            <li>I loved this product...</li>
            <li>A good peel with no damaging consequences.</li>
            <li>The size of the container and the quantity used per application, for me, is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I apply a good moisturizer and go to bed.</li>
            <li>However it does do a good job with regulating my oil production.</li>
            <li>Very good leaves face smooth</li>
            <li>I love this product fells great after .</li>
            <li>the pumpkin mask is refreshing and felt great on my skin.</li>

            <li>Very light mask!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>On top of the pumpkin puree, they included cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice!</li>
            <li>Will update my review as I have a chance to use it more!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this peel/mask!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love how my face looks after using!</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy this !</li>
            <li>I love anything that makes my face sting!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love the smell of this!</li>
            <li>Discoloration has greatly improved and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>Glycolic acid is amazing for scars and evening skin texture and tone</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>a really nice product.</li>
            <li>it leaves skin nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, and the idea.</li>
            <li>This one is good, although I do prefer another brand a bit better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any one that wants to do their own facials, and once you have cleaned off your face for this mask, I tell you, it feels great!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel a burn, but I do experience a nice glow to my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>&quot; but honestly, you can definately tell (and smell) that this mask is made from pumpkin.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice mask I use once a week.  </li>
            <li>That was a NICE gesture.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this one a shot, and I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li>It have nice smell.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li>am looking for a healthy peel that wont add more toxins to my skin, I&#x27;m trying to undo the damage done by toxins!</li>
            <li>Skin is glowing  and soft and is perfect for weekly maintenance.</li>
            <li>I use Jan Marini products and the cleanser is more effective than this peel.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing if you love pumpkin.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work at all, burned my face and it doesn&#x27;t make any significant good difference.</li>
            <li>Not for everyone, especially not for oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s smell good and came with a very good brush..</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves your skin soft and bright.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I chose this because it is a effective peel, without being to strong for my friends who have not had peels before.</li>
            <li>Smells good and easy to remove plus can fit into your morning or evening routine.  </li>
            <li>could use more of a Pumpkin smell.</li>
            <li>some described it as more of a cooling burn</li>
            <li>I will try it again and make sure I use it more than I did before.</li>
            <li>For a more spa like treatment, buy Head to Toe.  </li>
            <li>I love how it works.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask and use it once a week.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT THANKS</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF AND WILL BUY MORE..</li>
            <li>just ok.  </li>
            <li>Works magic for acne..</li>
            <li>I like the way my skin feel after the use and my clients love the smell of Pumpkin, ginger-ish scent.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve noticed a better quality to my skin tone and texture already.</li>
            <li>Its better than nothing</li>
            <li>Lovely smell.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Love it ..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, but I love the feeling after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t too intense, so it was a great addition to my weekly skincare routine.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, it definitely makes a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>I wanted a light, refreshing peel that I could use on my sensitive skin and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF 30 after using a peel for the week afterwards and limit prolonged sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I need more time to experiment with it.</li>
            <li>awesome facial.</li>
            <li>My make-up also looks better since I have been using it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second jar, but at this point, my skin is in BEAUTIFUL condition!  </li>
            <li>Great product, will smoothe out your skin, make it soft, leave it amazingly clean!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great to use once a week before bed time</li>
            <li>The results after an hour of two rehyrations (adding water to activate the enzymes and re spreading) are better than a doctor&#x27;s peel.</li>
            <li>It does the job very well in my opinion and at a great price</li>
            <li>and I couldnt be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this pumpkin peel it makes your skin feel refreshed after you use it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed with this product,I&#x27;ve used many chemical peels and creams and no one did such a good job like this one.!!</li>
            <li>Also, refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth my skin feels after!</li>
            <li>It seems ok.</li>
            <li>&quot; so I thought it was safe to buy.</li>
            <li>Many companies trying to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; will use Tetrasodium EDTA instead of parabens to preserve their products but Tetrasodium EDTA is just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love love love this mask.</li>
            <li>And be sure had &amp;#34;baking soda&amp;#34;  or skin neutralizer to wash your face or you can burn your face and get scars.</li>
            <li>I love this mask, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this before.</li>
            <li>after that I am able to put it on for 15-20 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li>I love that it tingles just a bit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Used the mask work ok</li>
            <li>It never made me peel or sting or anything more than you would get from a 12% AHA cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking even more radiant since I added</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>The first day I got this I loved it.</li>
            <li>this mask is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I got this product as a contest win from IQ Natural</li>
            <li>I now have an arsenal of great products that are naturally fending off age.</li>
            <li>Used it 2 times so far and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>COULD VERY WELL BE A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; , but it did tighten my pores and felt good.</li>
            <li>but after I took it off I could noticed a difference right away!!</li>
            <li>I would say this is a very mild peel.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel like you had a very mild sunburn afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product, especially for someone who hasn&#x27;t done many peels before.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong to use often.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if its as good as high end balanced glycolic peels at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>it really works its magic!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a level 1 peel at best which is superficial dead cell removal.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell very much...reminded me of pumpkins and Halloween.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>face feeling smooth and moisturized and&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller included detailed instructions for use and included helpful information and tips.  </li>
            <li>I have found it to be a great part of my facial care regimen since I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon for amazing products that really work.</li>
            <li>it make my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for getting rid of dead skin layers.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and refreshed afterwards without redness.</li>
            <li>After I washed it off my face was SO smooth.</li>
            <li>and it takes work to get it to feel smooth, so</li>
            <li>So I bought this but returned it right after reading the label more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I was quite excited about receiving this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll reorder (maybe the higher %age too) when the time comes.</li>
            <li>but it really does a great job at making skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My acne has gotten better, my skin is clear, there is a healthy glow to my face.  </li>
            <li>Has a clean feeling after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the addition of an AHA acid that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use and layer every day and could keep everything in my life more simple.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re like me, shop at wholefds and love when you can discern the smell of each natural ingredient in a product, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I would say this is nothing special,</li>
            <li>but it really does the job - works MUCH better and to its maximum potential with a derma needle roller or a good scrub</li>
            <li>So overall I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin, but looking forward to adding more minutes on to see if I get some results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more like the real thing.</li>
            <li>But I have no idea if that is true or not.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin nice and soft, and it helps heal my breakouts faster.  </li>
            <li>Glycolic is one of the important acids for fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a better outcome.</li>
            <li>Its true that the mask goes on liquidy with spots of what looks like pumpkin pulp.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so smooth , rosy ,  fresh and glowy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this to build up to using a true glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li>It was just like mashed pumpkin for a pie and smelled good enough to eat - of course don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s i mild chemical peel without peeling .</li>
            <li>If the product hurts you, you can quickly neutralize the acid by mixing baking soda and water into a paste and applying it to your face.</li>
            <li>texture of my skin has changed since I have gotten older, this mask seems to have made my skin smoother and more refined.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s relatively mild.</li>
            <li>Swithching to 2-3 nights a week has yielded better results and I am enjoying a little more clarity in my complexion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So pure and natural, I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this product for sure!</li>
            <li>I probably should have left mine in the fridge and used it more often to keep that from happening!  </li>
            <li>This mask leaves my skin with a soft scent of pumpkin pie, but it is very light.</li>
            <li>I have very oily acne prone skin and some fine lines.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing mini peel mask, without the actual peeling.</li>
            <li>but it is gentle and light....</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to get a night/day difference in your skin, but if you get professional facials or do a &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; peel occasionally, this would be a great weekly touch-up.</li>
            <li>The important thing is that the more translucent substance covers your entire face, it does not matter if your face is all orange or not.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin tingle and turn pink which is good</li>
            <li>Not even worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also keeping it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer.</li>
            <li>It smells just like pumpkin, no artificial scent here.</li>
            <li>price of the product is very reasonable and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>You see results right after you wash the product of your face</li>
            <li>stains towels and have to rinse them off right away.</li>
            <li>I bought this after trying a professional series pumpkin mask, and honestly this one is okayish for home users or those new to giving them self \\&quot;peels\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Considering I&#x27;m very new to the whole peel thing and have struggled with acne and ingrown facial hairs most of my adult life, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>But when I washed it off, my skin was very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>right before - make sure those pores are open !!!</li>
            <li>Plus it is a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunatelly with so many fake reviews on these products, I wanted to let you know that i am a 100% geniune reviewer, that I am a frequent consumer of face masks from diverse high end brands and this one is the best I ever used.</li>
            <li>This product really felt like it was burning my skin!</li>
            <li>It stings a bit but your skin is so pretty when you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>First off this does not look like the pictured product.</li>
            <li>definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Obviously most that comment such things have never used a peel like this one before.</li>
            <li>I am also stepping up to a higher glycolic acid strength.</li>
            <li>it will stink a bit for the first couple of times...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never given yourself a peel I&#x27;d try this first.</li>
            <li>Just like real pumpkin!</li>
            <li>then what I am used to but works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Be-careful how long you leave it on and make sure you use it all in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>but after the first time my skin felt so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>This will be a permanent part of my regimen for as long as its available!  </li>
            <li>but this one is just as good if not better because of the price.</li>
            <li>my face feel super soft</li>
            <li>Although this is not as strong as the peels I have gotten at the spa, after two uses I see a difference in some discoloration and the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting anything</li>
            <li>I am sure you will love it, and won&#x27;t feel ripped by paying hundreds on a product that does just the same or less for you.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Looking for, however with continued use I am certain it will be very beneficial.</li>
            <li>but you can absolutely take it</li>
            <li>think it is not priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>This really does smell like pumpkin pie.</li>
            <li>After washing it off, I do not see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>it left my skin smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really feel like a peel, but I did like it</li>
            <li>Gentle but makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li>but, I really didn&#x27;t expect those to go away...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>delivery was really fast.  </li>
            <li>but this really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li>It did tingle at first, but it went away after a minute or two and felt like a normal mask.</li>
            <li>so I can feel that it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really feel the glycolic when on face but seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>and it really helped up the ante on the power of the A</li>
            <li>and it really is an effortless, painless way to include AHA acids in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it is more of an exfoliate ...and not really much in the way of a peel.</li>
            <li>The few times I did use it, my skin felt nice and I didn&#x27;t notice any breaking out.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin, very fair complexion, and my nose usually gets red by monitor light when working several hours on the computer.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Decent buy</li>
            <li>Strong enough to work but gentle enough you&#x27;re going to have to really try to burn your skin.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product since it boasts having glycolic.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ll be sure to make an updated review after using this a little longer.</li>
            <li>I left it on for the recommended time the first time and did not feel much tingle or result after using for just 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>skin is normal to oily, combination, with mild acne; yet not very sensitive to things.</li>
            <li>The missing star is because the product is a little slimmy and has an odor that isn&#x27;t offensive but isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other creams and its smooth</li>
            <li>So I wasted most of it and won&#x27;t use the old stuff on my skin.</li>
            <li>It did not worsen or burn my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a good pumpkin smell other than that it is not like spa pumpkin peel, little tingling effect on me,</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I definitely see results, even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews first and saw that it smelled like pumpkin pie, but I didn&#x27;t think I would have such an issue with the smell.  </li>
            <li>My skin was exactly the same after I took it off.</li>
            <li>I saw no improvement nor did it even feel like it was working like most glycolic masks that i have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Now I just use this mask every other week or so, and it keeps my skin soft and breakout free.</li>
            <li>I first tried it last summer when I had an unexpected breakout.</li>
            <li>I sometimes will follow up with a gentle mask for a complete facial.</li>
            <li>I would say beginner level and gentle enough to use nightly if you are used to peels.</li>
            <li>It will get old and turn brown.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It looks and smells natural.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just mashed pumpkin as far as am concerned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional pumpkin peels, so I thought it would be a bit like that, but it was like using nothing.</li>
            <li>IQ Natural...</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling taut and extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>is that its all natural ingredients and doesnt irritate at all.</li>
            <li>and it is not harsh on your skin</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Not heavy on face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it makes your skin look younger!</li>
            <li>I will gently pop the pimple and the next day it is gone.</li>
            <li>Would recommed it as a try for folks with oily, sensitive, breakout prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a professional peel</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and started with 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I think that some people do have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>leaves the face soft and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Feels good, and I don&#x27;t have a difficult time rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>how to use it- still a little unsure as to whether I&#x27;m doing it right!</li>
            <li>I like pumpkin masks especially with high glycolic acid concentration.</li>
            <li>Not really what expected, smells great not strong  used daily</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t slather on too much nor leave on too long.</li>
            <li>Very nice mask, similar to other (more expensive) pumpkin AHA masks I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li>Basic sparkle peel for client facial who wants a pick me up and nothing aggressive.</li>
            <li>It is also a penetration enhancer, meaning it breaks down the skin&#x27;s protective barrier, going right into your bloodstream</li>
            <li>It tingles a little but the final result is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Though this item does not do miracle for your skin, knowing that it has a positive effect to your skin little by little is enough for me to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think it is 12%, probably less, more like 5% or less.</li>
            <li>It does burn when applied, but all of these chemical peels generally do..</li>
            <li>I started off leaving the product on for only a couple of minutes as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and it seems to have helped lighten old acne scars.</li>
            <li>Very similar to a pumpkin mask I have had done professionally.</li>
            <li>but I can barely feel a tingle when I put this on let alone burning as some reviewers noted.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the mask once.</li>
            <li>The product is ok, its not too irritating</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a little bit of grit to the texture and has a slight cooling sensation that is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>do think this is far better than the typical masks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>this is a peel with a little tingle to it.. not for sensative skin but for sure not strong.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I had wasted my money because I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling.</li>
            <li>I have been using this peel for a few weeks now, and its my goto peel that I reach for first.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase it again, but wouldn&#x27;t mind a little higher glycolic percentage in my next purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very slimy and has little gritty pieces in it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I&#x27;m always happy to find a good product with that ingredient.</li>
            <li> Real easy and great results.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and my skin does feel smoother after each treatment.  </li>
            <li> I take good care of my skin though,  </li>
            <li> Everyone can benefit from a good peel a couple of time a week</li>
            <li> It tingles which is a good sign.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used acid peels and thought this product would be a good introduction - and perhaps it is -</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mask to start with to get use to glycolic treatments.</li>
            <li> I loved this product...</li>
            <li> A good peel with no damaging consequences.</li>
            <li> The size of the container and the quantity used per application, for me, is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I apply a good moisturizer and go to bed.</li>

            <li> Will update my review as I have a chance to use it more!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this peel/mask!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love how my face looks after using!</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy this !</li>
            <li> I love anything that makes my face sting!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Personally, I love the smell of this!</li>
            <li> Discoloration has greatly improved and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid is amazing for scars and evening skin texture and tone</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> a really nice product.</li>
            <li> it leaves skin nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, and the idea.</li>
            <li> This one is good, although I do prefer another brand a bit better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one that wants to do their own facials, and once you have cleaned off your face for this mask, I tell you, it feels great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a burn, but I do experience a nice glow to my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> &quot; but honestly, you can definately tell (and smell) that this mask is made from pumpkin.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice mask I use once a week.  </li>
            <li> That was a NICE gesture.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this one a shot, and I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> It have nice smell.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li> am looking for a healthy peel that wont add more toxins to my skin, I&#x27;m trying to undo the damage done by toxins!</li>
            <li> Skin is glowing  and soft and is perfect for weekly maintenance.</li>
            <li> I use Jan Marini products and the cleanser is more effective than this peel.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing if you love pumpkin.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all, burned my face and it doesn&#x27;t make any significant good difference.</li>
            <li> Not for everyone, especially not for oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s smell good and came with a very good brush..</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves your skin soft and bright.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I chose this because it is a effective peel, without being to strong for my friends who have not had peels before.</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to remove plus can fit into your morning or evening routine.  </li>
            <li> could use more of a Pumpkin smell.</li>
            <li> some described it as more of a cooling burn</li>
            <li> I will try it again and make sure I use it more than I did before.</li>
            <li> For a more spa like treatment, buy Head to Toe.  </li>
            <li> I love how it works.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask and use it once a week.  </li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT THANKS</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF AND WILL BUY MORE..</li>
            <li> just ok.  </li>
            <li> Works magic for acne..</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feel after the use and my clients love the smell of Pumpkin, ginger-ish scent.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve noticed a better quality to my skin tone and texture already.</li>
            <li> Its better than nothing</li>
            <li> Lovely smell.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Love it ..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, but I love the feeling after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t too intense, so it was a great addition to my weekly skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it definitely makes a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> I wanted a light, refreshing peel that I could use on my sensitive skin and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF 30 after using a peel for the week afterwards and limit prolonged sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I need more time to experiment with it.</li>
            <li> awesome facial.</li>
            <li> My make-up also looks better since I have been using it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second jar, but at this point, my skin is in BEAUTIFUL condition!  </li>
            <li> Great product, will smoothe out your skin, make it soft, leave it amazingly clean!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great to use once a week before bed time</li>
            <li> The results after an hour of two rehyrations (adding water to activate the enzymes and re spreading) are better than a doctor&#x27;s peel.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well in my opinion and at a great price</li>
            <li> and I couldnt be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this pumpkin peel it makes your skin feel refreshed after you use it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed with this product,I&#x27;ve used many chemical peels and creams and no one did such a good job like this one.!!</li>
            <li> Also, refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth my skin feels after!</li>
            <li> It seems ok.</li>
            <li> &quot; so I thought it was safe to buy.</li>
            <li> Many companies trying to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; will use Tetrasodium EDTA instead of parabens to preserve their products but Tetrasodium EDTA is just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love love love this mask.</li>
            <li> And be sure had &amp;#34;baking soda&amp;#34;  or skin neutralizer to wash your face or you can burn your face and get scars.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this before.</li>
            <li> after that I am able to put it on for 15-20 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> I love that it tingles just a bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Used the mask work ok</li>
            <li> It never made me peel or sting or anything more than you would get from a 12% AHA cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking even more radiant since I added</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> The first day I got this I loved it.</li>
            <li> this mask is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a contest win from IQ Natural</li>
            <li> I now have an arsenal of great products that are naturally fending off age.</li>
            <li> Used it 2 times so far and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> COULD VERY WELL BE A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; , but it did tighten my pores and felt good.</li>
            <li> but after I took it off I could noticed a difference right away!!</li>
            <li> I would say this is a very mild peel.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel like you had a very mild sunburn afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product, especially for someone who hasn&#x27;t done many peels before.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong to use often.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if its as good as high end balanced glycolic peels at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> it really works its magic!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a level 1 peel at best which is superficial dead cell removal.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell very much...reminded me of pumpkins and Halloween.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> face feeling smooth and moisturized and&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller included detailed instructions for use and included helpful information and tips.  </li>
            <li> I have found it to be a great part of my facial care regimen since I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon for amazing products that really work.</li>
            <li> it make my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for getting rid of dead skin layers.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and refreshed afterwards without redness.</li>
            <li> After I washed it off my face was SO smooth.</li>
            <li> and it takes work to get it to feel smooth, so</li>
            <li> So I bought this but returned it right after reading the label more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was quite excited about receiving this product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll reorder (maybe the higher %age too) when the time comes.</li>
            <li> but it really does a great job at making skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My acne has gotten better, my skin is clear, there is a healthy glow to my face.  </li>
            <li> Has a clean feeling after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the addition of an AHA acid that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use and layer every day and could keep everything in my life more simple.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me, shop at wholefds and love when you can discern the smell of each natural ingredient in a product, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I would say this is nothing special,</li>
            <li> but it really does the job - works MUCH better and to its maximum potential with a derma needle roller or a good scrub</li>
            <li> So overall I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin, but looking forward to adding more minutes on to see if I get some results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more like the real thing.</li>
            <li> But I have no idea if that is true or not.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nice and soft, and it helps heal my breakouts faster.  </li>
            <li> Glycolic is one of the important acids for fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a better outcome.</li>
            <li> Its true that the mask goes on liquidy with spots of what looks like pumpkin pulp.</li>
            <li> my skin looks so smooth , rosy ,  fresh and glowy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this to build up to using a true glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li> It was just like mashed pumpkin for a pie and smelled good enough to eat - of course don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s i mild chemical peel without peeling .</li>
            <li> If the product hurts you, you can quickly neutralize the acid by mixing baking soda and water into a paste and applying it to your face.</li>
            <li> texture of my skin has changed since I have gotten older, this mask seems to have made my skin smoother and more refined.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s relatively mild.</li>
            <li> Swithching to 2-3 nights a week has yielded better results and I am enjoying a little more clarity in my complexion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So pure and natural, I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this product for sure!</li>
            <li> I probably should have left mine in the fridge and used it more often to keep that from happening!  </li>
            <li> This mask leaves my skin with a soft scent of pumpkin pie, but it is very light.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone skin and some fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mini peel mask, without the actual peeling.</li>
            <li> but it is gentle and light....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to get a night/day difference in your skin, but if you get professional facials or do a &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; peel occasionally, this would be a great weekly touch-up.</li>
            <li> The important thing is that the more translucent substance covers your entire face, it does not matter if your face is all orange or not.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin tingle and turn pink which is good</li>
            <li> Not even worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also keeping it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer.</li>
            <li> It smells just like pumpkin, no artificial scent here.</li>
            <li> price of the product is very reasonable and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> You see results right after you wash the product of your face</li>
            <li> stains towels and have to rinse them off right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a professional series pumpkin mask, and honestly this one is okayish for home users or those new to giving them self \\&quot;peels\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;m very new to the whole peel thing and have struggled with acne and ingrown facial hairs most of my adult life, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li> But when I washed it off, my skin was very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> right before - make sure those pores are open !!!</li>
            <li> Plus it is a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunatelly with so many fake reviews on these products, I wanted to let you know that i am a 100% geniune reviewer, that I am a frequent consumer of face masks from diverse high end brands and this one is the best I ever used.</li>
            <li> This product really felt like it was burning my skin!</li>
            <li> It stings a bit but your skin is so pretty when you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> First off this does not look like the pictured product.</li>
            <li> definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Obviously most that comment such things have never used a peel like this one before.</li>
            <li> I am also stepping up to a higher glycolic acid strength.</li>
            <li> it will stink a bit for the first couple of times...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never given yourself a peel I&#x27;d try this first.</li>
            <li> Just like real pumpkin!</li>
            <li> then what I am used to but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Be-careful how long you leave it on and make sure you use it all in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> but after the first time my skin felt so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> This will be a permanent part of my regimen for as long as its available!  </li>
            <li> but this one is just as good if not better because of the price.</li>
            <li> my face feel super soft</li>
            <li> Although this is not as strong as the peels I have gotten at the spa, after two uses I see a difference in some discoloration and the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting anything</li>
            <li> I am sure you will love it, and won&#x27;t feel ripped by paying hundreds on a product that does just the same or less for you.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Looking for, however with continued use I am certain it will be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> but you can absolutely take it</li>
            <li> think it is not priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> This really does smell like pumpkin pie.</li>
            <li> After washing it off, I do not see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> it left my skin smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really feel like a peel, but I did like it</li>
            <li> Gentle but makes your skin glow.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li> but, I really didn&#x27;t expect those to go away...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> delivery was really fast.  </li>
            <li> but this really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li> It did tingle at first, but it went away after a minute or two and felt like a normal mask.</li>
            <li> so I can feel that it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really feel the glycolic when on face but seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> and it really helped up the ante on the power of the A</li>
            <li> and it really is an effortless, painless way to include AHA acids in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it is more of an exfoliate ...and not really much in the way of a peel.</li>
            <li> The few times I did use it, my skin felt nice and I didn&#x27;t notice any breaking out.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin, very fair complexion, and my nose usually gets red by monitor light when working several hours on the computer.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Decent buy</li>
            <li> Strong enough to work but gentle enough you&#x27;re going to have to really try to burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since it boasts having glycolic.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ll be sure to make an updated review after using this a little longer.</li>
            <li> I left it on for the recommended time the first time and did not feel much tingle or result after using for just 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> skin is normal to oily, combination, with mild acne; yet not very sensitive to things.</li>
            <li> The missing star is because the product is a little slimmy and has an odor that isn&#x27;t offensive but isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other creams and its smooth</li>
            <li> So I wasted most of it and won&#x27;t use the old stuff on my skin.</li>
            <li> It did not worsen or burn my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a good pumpkin smell other than that it is not like spa pumpkin peel, little tingling effect on me,</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I definitely see results, even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews first and saw that it smelled like pumpkin pie, but I didn&#x27;t think I would have such an issue with the smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin was exactly the same after I took it off.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement nor did it even feel like it was working like most glycolic masks that i have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Now I just use this mask every other week or so, and it keeps my skin soft and breakout free.</li>
            <li> I first tried it last summer when I had an unexpected breakout.</li>
            <li> I sometimes will follow up with a gentle mask for a complete facial.</li>
            <li> I would say beginner level and gentle enough to use nightly if you are used to peels.</li>
            <li> It will get old and turn brown.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It looks and smells natural.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just mashed pumpkin as far as am concerned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional pumpkin peels, so I thought it would be a bit like that, but it was like using nothing.</li>
            <li> IQ Natural...</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling taut and extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> is that its all natural ingredients and doesnt irritate at all.</li>
            <li> and it is not harsh on your skin</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Not heavy on face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it makes your skin look younger!</li>
            <li> I will gently pop the pimple and the next day it is gone.</li>
            <li> Would recommed it as a try for folks with oily, sensitive, breakout prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a professional peel</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and started with 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I think that some people do have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> leaves the face soft and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Feels good, and I don&#x27;t have a difficult time rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> how to use it- still a little unsure as to whether I&#x27;m doing it right!</li>
            <li> I like pumpkin masks especially with high glycolic acid concentration.</li>
            <li> Not really what expected, smells great not strong  used daily</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t slather on too much nor leave on too long.</li>
            <li> Very nice mask, similar to other (more expensive) pumpkin AHA masks I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> Basic sparkle peel for client facial who wants a pick me up and nothing aggressive.</li>
            <li> It is also a penetration enhancer, meaning it breaks down the skin&#x27;s protective barrier, going right into your bloodstream</li>
            <li> It tingles a little but the final result is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Though this item does not do miracle for your skin, knowing that it has a positive effect to your skin little by little is enough for me to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it is 12%, probably less, more like 5% or less.</li>
            <li> It does burn when applied, but all of these chemical peels generally do..</li>
            <li> I started off leaving the product on for only a couple of minutes as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and it seems to have helped lighten old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Very similar to a pumpkin mask I have had done professionally.</li>
            <li> but I can barely feel a tingle when I put this on let alone burning as some reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the mask once.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, its not too irritating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a little bit of grit to the texture and has a slight cooling sensation that is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> do think this is far better than the typical masks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> this is a peel with a little tingle to it.. not for sensative skin but for sure not strong.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I had wasted my money because I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for a few weeks now, and its my goto peel that I reach for first.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase it again, but wouldn&#x27;t mind a little higher glycolic percentage in my next purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very slimy and has little gritty pieces in it.</li>
            <li> The price point on this one makes it my other go-to when I cant afford to spend as much on the other brand.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes I then gently wipe it off with a cold wash cloth and rinse thoroughly with cool water...</li>
            <li> I may not have used it long enough to notice any skin differences.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I have not been using it long enough to see the results that I am</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t leave it on for very long because I didn&#x27;t want my face to be red as a result.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I noticed it did burn right when I put it on and the smell was unpleasant,</li>
            <li> and I have used several other 10-12 glycolic acid treatments where you can definitely feel the product working</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find the smell (plain old pumpkin puree) offensive</li>
            <li> My dark spots so far however do not seem to be evening out like with other pumpkin peels.</li>
            <li> the packaging doesn&#x27;t state that, although it was recommended by other reviewers that have purchased similar products.</li>
            <li> BUT I NEVER TRIED IT DUE TO THE ABOVE.</li>
            <li> I had this dry bumpy skin happening around my nose.</li>
            <li> My skin was just so dry there.</li>
            <li> CAME IN PLAIN WHITE CONTAINER SMALLER AMOUNT THAN ADVERTISED  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little cheaper though, the size looks way bigger in the picture!</li>
            <li> It is a little slimy, won&#x27;t spread too evenly, and has some little gritty pieces in there to remind one that they are using a product that actually grew somewhere.</li>
            <li> Kind of stupid of me.</li>
            <li> dried my skin and left a wierd texture i had to use an exfoliater to get it off</li>
            <li> Works - be careful.</li>
            <li> so you have to coat carefully.</li>
            <li> Ive been using 3x a week, with no real results for over a month.</li>
            <li> Not a real performance product</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> I expected the texture to feel a little less like actual food.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I looked up other glycolic pumpkin mask directions and they seem to say that 15-20 minutes is the recommended time to leave it on, doing so once a week.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand other users complaining about &amp;#34;not spreading even&amp;#34; or smelling &amp;#34;like pumpkin pie filling&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But it does seem to aid my other skin remedies in fading, smoothing and evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I leave it on a little longer so it can actually dry up.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer with a fan brush and left it on for the recommended 5 minutes (but I will probably leave it on longer next time).</li>
            <li> I left it on at least 3 minutes longer than recommended</li>
            <li> I use it at least several times a week for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li> It is nice but stings very badly after 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong mask which is what I expected at 12%.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic jar with a black lid.</li>
            <li> Skin seems a little brighter and softer/smoother.  </li>
            <li> The 12% AHA gives my skin a little tingle, but nothing too stingy.</li>
            <li> I will leave it on a little longer this time though.  </li>
            <li> Sometime I can feel and see little blemishes that need to come up to the surface.</li>
            <li> Try not to use it after you exfoliate your face as it can make your skin burn a little</li>
            <li> Makes your skin smoother but no significant changes here</li>
            <li> The smell might remind one of some little poor baby pumpkin that was left in the field, off the vine, to suffer degradation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too wet, it is hard to keep any of it on your skin without piling it on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh and my skin does look a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> It was just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The product was messy because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product out a few times before leaving a review.  </li>
            <li> It is so annoying I could not use it long enough to see if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> Had alot of redness and broke out pretty badly.</li>
            <li> you can not use small amounts..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is should be refrigerated after use...</li>
            <li> Have been a salon pumpkin facial fan for years, but that &amp;#34;habit&amp;#34; becomes really expensive.</li>
            <li> No more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> No more botox for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why</li>
            <li> However I have no positive effects to report after weekly use for approximately a month.</li>
            <li> The product goes on very unevenly and goopy</li>
            <li> It seems to be lightening my dark spots, just don&#x27;t expect immediate, dramatic results.</li>
            <li> at least that.</li>
            <li> at least not in one month.</li>
            <li> You do need to work up to at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not like the creamy thick orange mask they have in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I must have thick skin or something.</li>
            <li> Only negative feedback is impossible to evenly spread on face.</li>
            <li> I started using this after my chemo treatment when my skin was dull, gray, and broken out.  </li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but I&#x27;ve used it several times and not noticed any effect on my skin, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The viscosity of the newer formula is very hard to get even</li>
            <li> I have tough skin</li>
            <li> have seen other people mention getting burned or having a bad experience..</li>
            <li> The structure of this mask is terrible, its impossible to cover the whole face, it keeps falling into small pieces and falling apart....</li>
            <li> I purchased the mask few months ago and each time I apply it, I am tempted to leave a bad review.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to give my wallet a break from expensive facials.  </li>
            <li> it has weird texture, it will not lay on skin in a sense of sticking to it like any mask should .</li>
            <li> But unfortunately after rinsing, it leaves a yellow/orange hue on my face for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> It goes on very thin and chunky.  </li>
            <li> but I did not use this product due to the horrible wording or font on the product label.  </li>
            <li> if you are used to artificially fragranced products,</li>
            <li> My acne hasn&#x27;t been as bad, and my acne scars are fading a bit here and there.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a  bad batch .</li>
            <li> the skin it does sting a bit, but not too bad at all.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that there were no instructions although there are some on this site under product information.</li>
            <li> It is so annoying to try spread it while it keeps falling off in pieces on your sink.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible...</li>
            <li> Both were awful by day three.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever tried; watery does not exfoliate at all terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is nice but stings very badly after 3 minutes. but works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a professional series pumpkin mask, and honestly this one is okayish for home users or those new to giving them self \\&quot;peels\\&quot;. No, this does not make your skin actually peel, it&#x27;s a level 1 peel at best which is superficial dead cell removal. could use more of a Pumpkin smell.</li>
            <li> smells great , feels like a burn but you can absolutely take it some described it as more of a cooling burn - i say it burns but it really does the job - works MUCH better and to its maximum potential with a derma needle roller or a good scrub right before - make sure those pores are open !!!</li>
            <li> this is a peel with a little tingle to it.. not for sensative skin but for sure not strong. I would say beginner level and gentle enough to use nightly if you are used to peels. my skin feels great afterwards as well as it smells divine!</li>
            <li> I purchased the mask few months ago and each time I apply it, I am tempted to leave a bad review. There is no way you can apply it evenly on your face the way they show in picture. It is so annoying to try spread it while it keeps falling off in pieces on your sink. Also, I have not notice dany remarkable results</li>
            <li> Smells good and my skin does feel smoother after each treatment.  My dark spots so far however do not seem to be evening out like with other pumpkin peels.</li>
            <li> This product really felt like it was burning my skin! I know it is supposed to do that but I didn&#x27;t leave it on for very long because I didn&#x27;t want my face to be red as a result. Be-careful how long you leave it on and make sure you use it all in a timely manner. It will get old and turn brown. I probably should have left mine in the fridge and used it more often to keep that from happening!  So I wasted most of it and won&#x27;t use the old stuff on my skin. I read that the color change means it oxidized and will no longer benefit the skin. I liked the smell very much...reminded me of pumpkins and Halloween. I may not have used it long enough to notice any skin differences. The few times I did use it, my skin felt nice and I didn&#x27;t notice any breaking out. So overall I think it is a good product. I will try it again and make sure I use it more than I did before.</li>
            <li> a really nice product.</li>
            <li> Very good leaves face smooth</li>
            <li> Love it! My friends noticed a difference in my skin after one use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to give my wallet a break from expensive facials.  It&#x27;s tingly and smells just like pumpkin.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin, but looking forward to adding more minutes on to see if I get some results.</li>
            <li> it has weird texture, it will not lay on skin in a sense of sticking to it like any mask should . it stays in clumps like mashed potato.&lt;br /&gt;so you can not use small amounts..&lt;br /&gt;but if you manage somehow to spread it out and if you labor to make it to stay spread... it leaves skin nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is not priced reasonably. I think that it is  overpriced.</li>
            <li> Although this is not as strong as the peels I have gotten at the spa, after two uses I see a difference in some discoloration and the overall look of my skin. For the price, I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wow!  This really works.  Don&#x27;t slather on too much nor leave on too long.</li>
            <li> This really does smell like pumpkin pie. On top of the pumpkin puree, they included cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice! I applied a thin layer with a fan brush and left it on for the recommended 5 minutes (but I will probably leave it on longer next time). I did not experience any burning sensation, and no redness after. I would say this is a very mild peel. You&#x27;re not going to get a night/day difference in your skin, but if you get professional facials or do a &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; peel occasionally, this would be a great weekly touch-up.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once, buuut I had this dry bumpy skin happening around my nose. I had tried a lot. My skin was just so dry there. I used this and it went away. I had tried a lot of different things and I have a ton of skin care. Anyway, I&#x27;ll be sure to make an updated review after using this a little longer. Oh and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> As a Esthetican I am always looking for great products. I chose this because it is a effective peel, without being to strong for my friends who have not had peels before. I bought one for myself to try out before I hand these out as x-mas presents. Great results!! Skin is glowing  and soft and is perfect for weekly maintenance.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since it boasts having glycolic.  I use Jan Marini products and the cleanser is more effective than this peel. Don&#x27;t waste your money. For a more spa like treatment, buy Head to Toe.  It&#x27;s way more like the real thing.</li>
            <li> I like this mask. For my skin its probably once a week bc it is a peel altho it is on the gentler side from some of the pumpkin glycolic masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great service excellent product</li>
            <li> I have used this mask 4 times now.  I love how it works.  I definitely see results, even after the first use.  Skin seems a little brighter and softer/smoother.  There is a bit of stinging, for me in sensetive areas such as my upper lip, but nothing that wouldn&#x27;t make me use the product again and again.  The missing star is because the product is a little slimmy and has an odor that isn&#x27;t offensive but isn&#x27;t great.  I would still definitely recommend this product though, because it works!</li>
            <li> Great quality and gives wonderful results:)</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but after the first time my skin felt so much smoother.  Will update my review as I have a chance to use it more!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I was quite excited about receiving this product.  The product goes on very unevenly and goopy and I have used several other 10-12 glycolic acid treatments where you can definitely feel the product working, however I do not feel any tingling with this product.  After washing it off, I do not see much of a difference in my skin. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Had a break out a day or two after applying it. Not for everyone, especially not for oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s smell good and came with a very good brush.. at least that.</li>
            <li> I love this mask and use it once a week.  It stings a bit but your skin is so pretty when you rinse it off.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT THANKS I LOVE THIS STUFF AND WILL BUY MORE.. THE RESULTS ARE AWESOME</li>
            <li> I would say this is nothing special, just ok.  I take good care of my skin though,  so that may be why.  Would probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> Works magic for acne..</li>
            <li> Very nice mask, similar to other (more expensive) pumpkin AHA masks I have owned in the past. The 12% AHA gives my skin a little tingle, but nothing too stingy. Plus you get a generous amount of product in the jar. Unless I find something I am happier with, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> First off this does not look like the pictured product. It came in a plastic jar with a black lid. It is 3oz and not 4oz. There are no directions on the package or in the packaging. The jar states it is &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34;. But I have no idea if that is true or not. All ingredients are listed on the bottom. I&#x27;m not sure if it is should be refrigerated after use...the packaging doesn&#x27;t state that, although it was recommended by other reviewers that have purchased similar products. I was a bit disappointed that there were no instructions although there are some on this site under product information. I looked up other glycolic pumpkin mask directions and they seem to say that 15-20 minutes is the recommended time to leave it on, doing so once a week. I didn&#x27;t notice tingling or burning at all. My skin was a bit red after I rinsed off the mask.</li>
            <li> I love this product fells great after . It&#x27;s i mild chemical peel without peeling . Makes you skin look refreshed .</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time in great condition. the pumpkin mask is refreshing and felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li> The structure of this mask is terrible, its impossible to cover the whole face, it keeps falling into small pieces and falling apart.... and i don&#x27;t feel any effect even though i use another pumpkin peel with aha and it gives me great peel! Regret i bought this.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feel after the use and my clients love the smell of Pumpkin, ginger-ish scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this peel/mask! I&#x27;ve only been using it for maybe about a month now, probably a total of 6 times! But I&#x27;ve noticed a better quality to my skin tone and texture already. My acne hasn&#x27;t been as bad, and my acne scars are fading a bit here and there. This is only a month! Wow. I&#x27;m impressed. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll reorder (maybe the higher %age too) when the time comes.</li>
            <li> WATERY , SOUPY ..... TRIED ONCE , SMELLS GREAT .... MAYBE I NEED TO TRY ANOTHER JAR !</li>
            <li> It did not worsen or burn my very sensitive skin. However I have no positive effects to report after weekly use for approximately a month. It does smell great though, you can smell the pumpkin.</li>
            <li> Advertisement of this product is not correct.  It goes on very thin and chunky.  Not like the creamy thick orange mask they have in the picture.  Also the packaging is unprofessional. The product is ok, its not too irritating but I don&#x27;t know if its as good as high end balanced glycolic peels at the dermatologist. Its better than nothing</li>
            <li> Lovely smell. Left the skin feeling softer and looking brighter!</li>
            <li> It works well enough, once you can actually get the product applied evenly enough, or so it doesn&#x27;t fall of. I liked the smell, and the idea. It does burn when applied, but all of these chemical peels generally do..however, it was such a pain trying to get the stuff to stay on my face I tossed it.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it did great on my skin. Wish it was a little cheaper though, the size looks way bigger in the picture!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first and saw that it smelled like pumpkin pie, but I didn&#x27;t think I would have such an issue with the smell.  It&#x27;s gross.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of food on my face.  Mine looks nothing like the picture and no instructions were included.  I didn&#x27;t feel much a chemical peel after a few minutes either.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Have been a salon pumpkin facial fan for years, but that &amp;#34;habit&amp;#34; becomes really expensive. This product gives me the same result in minutes. Because it is a fraction of the cost of a salon facial I can treat myself often!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. Unfortunatelly with so many fake reviews on these products, I wanted to let you know that i am a 100% geniune reviewer, that I am a frequent consumer of face masks from diverse high end brands and this one is the best I ever used. It was recommended to me along with a serum. Both worked great. This mask leaves my skin with a soft scent of pumpkin pie, but it is very light. The mask won&#x27;t be in your face like a cream, it is not homogeneous. The important thing is that the more translucent substance covers your entire face, it does not matter if your face is all orange or not. Also, I have very sensitive skin, very fair complexion, and my nose usually gets red by monitor light when working several hours on the computer. This mask did not cause hipersensitivity on my skin. Very good product, get it for yourself I am sure you will love it, and won&#x27;t feel ripped by paying hundreds on a product that does just the same or less for you.</li>
            <li> I will only use this twice a week and my skin looks fabulous! I stopped using scrubs and brushes on my face 3 months ago and my skin has never looked better. No breakouts!</li>
            <li> Love it .. Your skin feels great after the peel ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask once a week for several weeks now. I started off leaving the product on for only a couple of minutes as I have sensitive skin. I am now up to 12 minutes with no issues. My pores are smaller and it seems to have helped lighten old acne scars. I will defiantly be reordering!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mini peel mask, without the actual peeling. Doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, but I love the feeling after you rinse it off. It leaves your skin nice and soft, and it helps heal my breakouts faster.  I leave it on a little longer so it can actually dry up.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE. CAME IN PLAIN WHITE CONTAINER SMALLER AMOUNT THAN ADVERTISED  AND WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS. COULD VERY WELL BE A GOOD PRODUCT BUT I NEVER TRIED IT DUE TO THE ABOVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive pumpkin facials but this one is just as good if not better because of the price. Everyone can benefit from a good peel a couple of time a week and I especially need one as my skin is not getting any younger. Glycolic is one of the important acids for fresh looking skin. There are no instructions so after a steam and my pores were open I used it.  It tingles which is a good sign.</li>
            <li> I like pumpkin masks especially with high glycolic acid concentration. This one is good, although I do prefer another brand a bit better. The price point on this one makes it my other go-to when I cant afford to spend as much on the other brand.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Not really what expected, smells great not strong  used daily</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t too intense, so it was a great addition to my weekly skincare routine. I did not have the problem others experienced with a rotten pumpkin smell. I keep it in the bathroom and have had it about 3 weeks. I would definitely purchase it again, but wouldn&#x27;t mind a little higher glycolic percentage in my next purchase.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. It smells amazing if you love pumpkin.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my face feel super soft</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it definitely makes a difference on my skin. Thank you</li>
            <li> After using the complete jar, I saw no change in my skin that I expected. I was really hoping for a better outcome.</li>
            <li> It looks and smells natural. It looks home-made as a matter of fact.  It feels like it&#x27;s working. But unfortunately after rinsing, it leaves a yellow/orange hue on my face for a day or two. And I damaged my skin, trying to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one that wants to do their own facials, and once you have cleaned off your face for this mask, I tell you, it feels great!</li>
            <li> dried my skin and left a wierd texture i had to use an exfoliater to get it off</li>
            <li> The pumpkin mask works wonders on your skin. It tingles a little but the final result is well worth it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible...no tingling,no nothing. it doesnt spread on, instead clumps of crappy orange junk that does nothing. Look elsewhere if your looking for any peeling effects.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product! I wanted a light, refreshing peel that I could use on my sensitive skin and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Awesome peel! It works great and leaves your skin soft and bright. It does make your skin tingle and turn pink which is good - it means the product is working. I left it on for about 8 minutes to get the results I wanted. If your skin is sensitive don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 2-3 minutes. Make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF 30 after using a peel for the week afterwards and limit prolonged sun exposure. Your skin will feel like you had a very mild sunburn afterwards. If the product hurts you, you can quickly neutralize the acid by mixing baking soda and water into a paste and applying it to your face. I would recommend using aloe vera on the skin after the peel to sooth any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, especially for someone who hasn&#x27;t done many peels before.</li>
            <li> Did not work as the pumkin facials I&#x27;ve had before</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Get some canned pumpkin and you have the same thing. The ingredient that is supposed to get the job done is scant to nonexistent. I felt like I was on the receiving end of a joke.</li>
            <li> Loved it. No complaints from me. At first, I thought I had wasted my money because I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling. But when I washed it off, my skin was very soft and smooth. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> The first day I got this I loved it. However, by day three it began to smell rancid. I kept one in the fridge and one out. Both were awful by day three.</li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;m very new to the whole peel thing and have struggled with acne and ingrown facial hairs most of my adult life, this stuff is pretty good. Not too harsh and my skin does look a lot nicer. Decent buy</li>
            <li> I am a licensed medical esthetician and anyone wanting to do a anti aging treatment this is the product, loaded with vitimen A.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever tried; watery does not exfoliate at all terrible DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This product stains everything it comes in contact with orange. And it will not wash out without bleaching. It is so annoying I could not use it long enough to see if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a couple of times,  doesn&#x27;t do anything! It&#x27;s just mashed pumpkin as far as am concerned</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for a few weeks now, and its my goto peel that I reach for first.  I like the smell and consistency of the mask, and the added glycolic acid has a great, noticeable affect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pure and natural, I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this product for sure!</li>
            <li> loved it! it left my skin smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li> It has a good pumpkin smell other than that it is not like spa pumpkin peel, little tingling effect on me,</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this and people seemed to be raving about it. I don&#x27;t get it. It had no effect what so ever. I&#x27;ve had professional pumpkin peels, so I thought it would be a bit like that, but it was like using nothing. There was no sensation at all. I left it on for ages waiting to feel some effect, but nothing happened. My skin was exactly the same after I took it off. It was just a waste of time and money. Maybe I got a batch that didn&#x27;t have any glycolic acid in it, because whenever I have used a product with glycolic acid I have felt and seen some effect. Not even worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter peel. The consistency is a bit like canned pumpkin. I didn&#x27;t feel a burn, but I do experience a nice glow to my skin afterwards. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Very similar to a pumpkin mask I have had done professionally. I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it is 12%, probably less, more like 5% or less.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really feel like a peel, but I did like it and my skin felt smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li> I need more time to experiment with it.</li>
            <li> It seems to help exfoliate skin</li>
            <li> awesome facial. Gentle but makes your skin glow. I leave it on 30 minutes every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know the product description says, \\&quot;PUMPKIN Face Mask,\\&quot; but honestly, you can definately tell (and smell) that this mask is made from pumpkin.  This mask leaves my \\&quot;mature\\&quot;  face feeling smooth and moisturized and&lt;br /&gt;although texture of my skin has changed since I have gotten older, this mask seems to have made my skin smoother and more refined.  My make-up also looks better since I have been using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the product is very reasonable and arrived quickly.  The seller included detailed instructions for use and included helpful information and tips.  I will be ordering this mask from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mask I use once a week.  It helps brighten and evens out the skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and the seller included a fan brush.  That was a NICE gesture.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I started out with the gradual instructions, worked my way up to weekly, 10 min sessions.  I just ordered my second jar, but at this point, my skin is in BEAUTIFUL condition!  OMG!  This will be a permanent part of my regimen for as long as its available!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tough skin and I exfoliate on a regular basis. I left it on for the recommended time the first time and did not feel much tingle or result after using for just 5 minutes.  I will try again in a week, since I don&#x27;t want to over do it.  I will leave it on a little longer this time though.  I&#x27;m also keeping it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading some reviews and I must have gotten a different product. The product was messy because of the consistency. I&#x27;ve used other creams and its smooth but this was like putting mashed potatoes on your face. It crumbled and didn&#x27;t stay on and did nothing for me. I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, will smoothe out your skin, make it soft, leave it amazingly clean!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great to use once a week before bed time</li>
            <li> Works - be careful. No more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best peel I have ever used for home usage. The viscosity of the newer formula is very hard to get even so you have to coat carefully. The results after an hour of two rehyrations (adding water to activate the enzymes and re spreading) are better than a doctor&#x27;s peel. FINALLY something to replace Zia&#x27;s papaya peel which was reformulated and no longer works.</li>
            <li> This smells like pumpkin pie. Makes you want to eat it. Please don&#x27;t!!!! lol. A little goes a long way. It does brighten your face.</li>
            <li> I must have thick skin or something. I&#x27;ve never used acid peels and thought this product would be a good introduction - and perhaps it is - but I can barely feel a tingle when I put this on let alone burning as some reviewers noted. Which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but I&#x27;ve used it several times and not noticed any effect on my skin, either.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting anything and I don&#x27;t find the smell (plain old pumpkin puree) offensive so I&#x27;ll continue use and update this review if I start to see results! For the record, I have combination skin; enlarged pores and irregular skin tone are my intended targets.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised...even ahead of schedule</li>
            <li> I like the product, I have not been using it long enough to see the results that I am&lt;br /&gt;Looking for, however with continued use I am certain it will be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the mask once. I had another brand I used regularly..but it was twice the price and only a 5% Vs this one at a 12% . So I decided to give this one a shot, and I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand other users complaining about &amp;#34;not spreading even&amp;#34; or smelling &amp;#34;like pumpkin pie filling&amp;#34; LOL, It&#x27;s a PUMPKIN mask people!!!! What do you expect? Obviously most that comment such things have never used a peel like this one before. It does the job very well in my opinion and at a great price</li>
            <li> Great product. Love how my face looks after using!</li>
            <li> You see results right after you wash the product of your face&lt;br /&gt;It will be part of my regimen now</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  Its true that the mask goes on liquidy with spots of what looks like pumpkin pulp. Not at all like advertised...but that&#x27;s not what matters to me. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month I guess, once or twice a week. Discoloration has greatly improved and my skin is so smooth. Makeup goes on much smoother.  Also I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using this stuff.  Acne scars are still there but, I really didn&#x27;t expect those to go away...at least not in one month. Wish I had found this stuff years ago.  IQ Natural...please do not change a thing.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good mask. I haven&#x27;t noticed any visual benefits yet. It is not a strong mask which is what I expected at 12%. It&#x27;s a good mask to start with to get use to glycolic treatments. I use glycolic masks to decongest my skin. Sometime I can feel and see little blemishes that need to come up to the surface.</li>
            <li> It didnt do anything to my skin . I have tried it several times. I saw no improvement nor did it even feel like it was working like most glycolic masks that i have tried in the past. Maybe I just got a  bad batch .</li>
            <li> Doesnt burn at all, tingles thats it. Ive been using 3x a week, with no real results for over a month.</li>
            <li> Love it, great results.  Would order again!</li>
            <li> I loved this product...I have been using  it 2 to 3 times a week after I get out off the shower.I leave it on for up to 10 minutes( the 1st time I left it on for just a couple of minutes to see how my skin would react) .. everyone;s  skin is different so test some of it on part of your face to see how it works with your skin. After 10 minutes I then gently wipe it off with a cold wash cloth and rinse thoroughly with cool water...my skin looks so smooth , rosy ,  fresh and glowy...you will see a noticeable difference after one use.I sometimes will follow up with a gentle mask for a complete facial.I love it and will continue to buy this !</li>
            <li> made my skin feel great and it did have a tingly feeling but i notice a different in about a week</li>
            <li> I love anything that makes my face sting!  Feels good, and I don&#x27;t have a difficult time rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> I really like what this mask does for my skin!!!!!!  It leaves my face feeling taut and extremely soft.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Was very good thank you. Application time is b/w 12-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference, my skin is smoother now.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a contest win from IQ Natural and I couldnt be more pleased with the results. It may look and smell like pumpkin pie but it really does a great job at making skin soft and supple. It&#x27;s got a little bit of grit to the texture and has a slight cooling sensation that is quite refreshing. I have found it to be a great part of my facial care regimen since I&#x27;ve had it. It&#x27;s a treat and pleasure to use and best part is that its all natural ingredients and doesnt irritate at all.</li>
            <li> I love this pumpkin peel it makes your skin feel refreshed after you use it and it is not harsh on your skin I have ordered this several time and I love it.</li>
            <li> My teenage son likes this.  Helping his acne. Uses once each week.</li>
            <li> Call me paranoid but I did not use this product due to the horrible wording or font on the product label.  I figured anyone that could not use proper font on their products did not care about it. Maybe this product was manufactured by a person that does not know how to properly spell or type.. I wish I could of returned this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed with this product,I&#x27;ve used many chemical peels and creams and no one did such a good job like this one.!!</li>
            <li> This mask smells just like pumpkin pie and works great as well. Glycolic acid is amazing for scars and evening skin texture and tone so I&#x27;m always happy to find a good product with that ingredient. Try not to use it after you exfoliate your face as it can make your skin burn a little (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I have had this facial at salons and now I can do it myself.  Real easy and great results.  Also, refreshing.</li>
            <li> Though this item does not do miracle for your skin, knowing that it has a positive effect to your skin little by little is enough for me to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to do &#x27;at home&#x27; and not have to go to a local spa. The first time I used it, I noticed it did burn right when I put it on and the smell was unpleasant, but after I took it off I could noticed a difference right away!! Great stuff. I would only use it once a week. Will be doing it for the second time today. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth my skin feels after!</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday,  I used it last night.  It seems ok. It have nice smell. Very smooth.  Not heavy on face.</li>
            <li> Their label says \\&quot;Paraben Free!\\&quot; so I thought it was safe to buy. So I bought this but returned it right after reading the label more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA is a preservative that&#x27;s made from the known carcinogen, formaldehyde and sodium cyanide. It is also a penetration enhancer, meaning it breaks down the skin&#x27;s protective barrier, going right into your bloodstream (probably why it was added to this peel.) Many companies trying to be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; will use Tetrasodium EDTA instead of parabens to preserve their products but Tetrasodium EDTA is just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a healthy peel that wont add more toxins to my skin, I&#x27;m trying to undo the damage done by toxins!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and it brings a glow to my skin.  It also controls acne on my face.  I started off using the&lt;br /&gt;product once per month for 5 minutes and now I use it every 3 weeks for 10 minutes.  I really like this product because it makes your skin look younger!</li>
            <li> I love love love this mask. I have very oily acne prone skin and some fine lines. This peel smells yummy. I noticed that it brings up all the yucky stuff stuck in my poors. I will gently pop the pimple and the next day it is gone. I will be ordering this again. I am also stepping up to a higher glycolic acid strength. I will use this for weekly maintenance. My skin just glows. I am trying to stay out of the plastic surgeons office. I was getting botox every 6 months. I now have an arsenal of great products that are naturally fending off age. No more botox for me. Thank you amazon for amazing products that really work. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Too wet, it is hard to keep any of it on your skin without piling it on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> A good peel with no damaging consequences. Smells good and easy to remove plus can fit into your morning or evening routine.  I would buy it again. Use it in the evening to make you nighttime products work for you.</li>
            <li> Does not peel your skin.  I left it on at least 3 minutes longer than recommended and it was fine.  Makes your skin smoother but no significant changes here</li>
            <li> Very light mask! Not a real performance product but it is gentle and light....</li>
            <li> delivery was really fast.  the mask its a great product to have at home! it really works its magic!</li>
            <li> Basic sparkle peel for client facial who wants a pick me up and nothing aggressive.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why but I always break out after using this mask. I tried it ~ 10 times and had to switch to using it as foot scrub.&lt;br /&gt;On the skin it does sting a bit, but not too bad at all. And the tingling goes away soon after you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is normal to oily, combination, with mild acne; yet not very sensitive to things.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It is like finding gold in the form of a face peel. I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product out a few times before leaving a review.  I love this stuff!  My face is brighter and smoother after using it.  I have even had people comment on how &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; I look.  Plus it is a very reasonable price.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all, burned my face and it doesn&#x27;t make any significant good difference. And be sure had &amp;#34;baking soda&amp;#34;  or skin neutralizer to wash your face or you can burn your face and get scars.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this before. I use this once a week...it make my skin so smooth.  My acne has gotten better, my skin is clear, there is a healthy glow to my face.  I started using this after my chemo treatment when my skin was dull, gray, and broken out.  Word of advice...it will stink a bit for the first couple of times...after that I am able to put it on for 15-20 minutes at a time.  I would start with 5 minutes depending on your skin type, mine is olive and it could tolerate a lot.  Just be careful.</li>
            <li> This product does work providing one does not go gangbusters and start using it nightly in a desparate attempt to freshen one&#x27;s complexion. Kind of stupid of me. Had alot of redness and broke out pretty badly. Swithching to 2-3 nights a week has yielded better results and I am enjoying a little more clarity in my complexion. Skin is rather used to it now, and with using Alpha Hydrox wash, lotion, body wrap and a 5% benzoyl peroxide wash on face and body.&lt;br /&gt;Chose 4 stars as I saw results with this product alone. The size of the container and the quantity used per application, for me, is a good deal. That said, one has to get by the color, texture, and smell.&lt;br /&gt;The color has a ghastly &#x27;baby poo&#x27; hue. It is a little slimy, won&#x27;t spread too evenly, and has some little gritty pieces in there to remind one that they are using a product that actually grew somewhere. Don&#x27;t mind at all.  The smell might remind one of some little poor baby pumpkin that was left in the field, off the vine, to suffer degradation.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that I dislike this product at all. Would recommed it as a try for folks with oily, sensitive, breakout prone skin. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting rid of dead skin layers. Skin feels smooth and refreshed afterwards without redness.</li>
            <li> This is great for at home mini-peels. If you&#x27;ve never given yourself a peel I&#x27;d try this first. Strong enough to work but gentle enough you&#x27;re going to have to really try to burn your skin. You do need to work up to at least 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve never had a professional peel but this really makes a difference for me. Also use on my hands to lighten age spots.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Great smell. Leaves skin feeling nice. Only negative feedback is impossible to evenly spread on face.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the smell of this! It smells just like pumpkin, no artificial scent here. It is very slimy and has little gritty pieces in it. I use a foundation brush to apply it and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and started with 10 minutes. It did tingle at first, but it went away after a minute or two and felt like a normal mask. After I washed it off my face was SO smooth. I have clogged pores and some acne and it takes work to get it to feel smooth, so this was automatically a win for me. Afterwards I apply a good moisturizer and go to bed. It seems to be lightening my dark spots, just don&#x27;t expect immediate, dramatic results. I&#x27;ll be using this to build up to using a true glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to facial for months now. I first tried it last summer when I had an unexpected breakout. I hadn&#x27;t had acne before then, and I tried almost every product I could get my hands on. Now I just use this mask every other week or so, and it keeps my skin soft and breakout free.</li>
            <li> Great package! Has a clean feeling after rinsing.  My face has a glow after 1 week of using product. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I like this product- it smells soooo good! Just like real pumpkin! I use it about once a week- I love that it tingles just a bit so I can feel that it&#x27;s really working. My only reason for giving it four stars instead of five is that it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions for use. I&#x27;d never used a chemical peel before, so I had to research online how to use it- still a little unsure as to whether I&#x27;m doing it right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...I like it stronger.</li>
            <li> Works just like it should.  It is not too strong to use often.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Used the mask work ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of pumpkin but this works well for me and is not too smelly</li>
            <li> Used it 2 times so far and my skin looks and feels great.Gives u s bit of a tingle but doesn&#x27;t hurt. I will definitely be buying ahain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot clumpier then what I am used to but works pretty well. can&#x27;t really feel the glycolic when on face but seems to be doing it&#x27;s job. stains towels and have to rinse them off right away.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this in conjunction with my nightly Retin-A and daily Vitamin C serum. I liked the idea of the addition of an AHA acid that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use and layer every day and could keep everything in my life more simple. I think this works great as a maintenance exfoliate and it really helped up the ante on the power of the A and C I was using.&lt;br /&gt;As a peel it&#x27;s relatively mild. It never made me peel or sting or anything more than you would get from a 12% AHA cream. But it does seem to aid my other skin remedies in fading, smoothing and evening out my skin tone. My skin is looking even more radiant since I added it.&lt;br /&gt; I use it at least several times a week for about 20 minutes and it really is an effortless, painless way to include AHA acids in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen other people mention getting burned or having a bad experience..etc..... I think that some people do have extremely sensitive skin but they should already know this and always proceed with caution with anything that has the world &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in it.  If you are someone that has regularly used Alpha Hydroxy and Glycolic acids than you know the score.&lt;br /&gt;I do think this is far better than the typical masks I have used in the past. But it is more of an exfoliate ...and not really much in the way of a peel. So consider that part when buying. It&#x27;s only 12%.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I expected the texture to feel a little less like actual food. However it does do a good job with regulating my oil production.</li>
            <li> I lake the way i see my skin face after use this peeling.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product. I could see a difference in my skin after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> very nice mask. smells like pumpkin. read the review of some folks who were put off by the smell.  if you are used to artificially fragranced products, then yeah... it&#x27;s like: ew, pumpkin!&lt;br /&gt;but if you&#x27;re like me, shop at wholefds and love when you can discern the smell of each natural ingredient in a product, then you&#x27;ll love this. this mask is pretty good. leaves the face soft and it&#x27;s all natural. can&#x27;t lose.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; , but it did tighten my pores and felt good. It is pumpkin basically , with the acid added. It was just like mashed pumpkin for a pie and smelled good enough to eat - of course don&#x27;t.</li>
