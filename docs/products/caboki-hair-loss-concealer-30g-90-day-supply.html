            <li>My hair looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My hair looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li>And Anyone that has figured out how to add a pump to Caboki would be awesome :)</li>
            <li>I love this product if you follow the insturctions to the letter it is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it would be great if it stuck to your hair,or stays in place in the rain.</li>
            <li>Surgery is best but they want 10K easy for just a level 4 .</li>
            <li>After applying it very easily, i am amazed at the results!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li>It looks so good</li>
            <li>Proscar is good to stop the hairloss ,(I did it before and should have never stopped)  </li>
            <li>but it was a good product to use</li>
            <li>I like how well this stuff sticks to your head and is basically undetectable - does smear on pillows but use a good spray</li>
            <li>Good but l</li>
            <li>Fairly does good coverage .</li>
            <li>The five stars you are seeing by others has to be someone being paid for good reviews...</li>
            <li>I felt so energized because it made my hair look so good.</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I am totally happy and feel confident standing under tall people :</li>
            <li>If done right, this is awesome.</li>
            <li>Make it better!</li>
            <li>It looks so easy and looks great on them.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly easy to use, looks great, my self esteem is off the charts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of like fibers almost up close.</li>
            <li>If you are really fully bald, this probably won&#x27;t give you the best results.</li>
            <li>i guess it kind of takes the curse off of a balding spot</li>
            <li>I am totally happy and feel confident standing under tall people :-)</li>
            <li>Nobody knows if it looks good on your head better than you.</li>
            <li>To be honest this is not something I would use every day.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend my day avoiding water and loving fingers.</li>
            <li>it work good with fine hair</li>
            <li>The old caboki worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, if you&#x27;re self conscious about your thinning hair, this is the greatest money you will ever spend!  </li>
            <li>it is great being able to have a full set of hair.</li>
            <li>I got the free sample to try and am extremely pleased with my results!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 3 more.  </li>
            <li>Goofy for my mom</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think that there should be more colour choices, when many women like myself colour their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the mist spray to lock in the fibers</li>
            <li>I am glad I can get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but Caboki is the greatest, matches better and last longer.</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>It went on so much better today.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone that does not want scalp to show and it does make you feel better, younger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought many and it has never happened before.</li>
            <li>Surely, I have this on hand all the time .</li>
            <li>Magic.</li>
            <li>I got the free sample and love how my pictures come out , It need&#x27;s to be used with hair spray of any kind just as Toppik or it will not hold anything .</li>
            <li>but it will stop more thinning</li>
            <li>I STOPPED PROSCAR, WAY TOO MANY SIDE EFFECTS .</li>
            <li>I use to love this product but they raised the price 50% for my hair color (DarkBrown)</li>
            <li>But I have :-)</li>
            <li>now I love it.</li>
            <li>and you are all set :)</li>
            <li>IT WILL COVER BETTER.</li>
            <li>AND IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC.     </li>
            <li>I thought this product might be better</li>
            <li>About 2 hours after applying it I put my glasses on top of my head to read something</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the fiber concealers - Caboki, Toppik, Megathik and Nanogen...</li>
            <li>But, don&#x27;t take my word for it.. :)</li>
            <li>I just love it and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It took some time to perfect, so you have to be patient and practice with different products and techniques.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>guys were experiencing problems like the fiber particles falling off when someone touching your hair , or changing a shirt etc.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Xfusion, its cheaper and its a better quality product for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and you need a mirror to make sure you evenly put the fibers on your head.</li>
            <li>I used to love Caboki.</li>
            <li>I think that I will now be able to get a more relaxed look by not having to do that.</li>
            <li>The scalp must be able to breathe as well.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>I pay more for my Proactive skin stuff than I did for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>MOST PEOPLE</li>
            <li>I know that it&#x27;s something most of us can&#x27;t stop stressing over(which</li>
            <li>It gives me more confidence in my appearance.</li>
            <li>It gives me more confidence in my appearance.</li>
            <li>Through existing hair this product is virtually  undetectable, but I can&#x27;t speak for those who are more bald than not.  </li>
            <li>sure why a man would use this</li>
            <li>Junk....May be OK for Halloween....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t brush it in - just sprinkle and pat the top of my head</li>
            <li>If you have most of your hair, and want something quick that effectively cleans up your hairline, order this product.</li>
            <li>but it worked out pretty good.</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;m using this for a reunion for a couple days to see people I haven&#x27;t seen in years and will probably not see again in many more years it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magically watching a full head of hair appear!  </li>
            <li>But it comes off easily though I find when I try to blend it in better along my hair part to get rid of the brown &#x27;spots&#x27; it</li>
            <li>Thanks Caboki for an awesome product and thanks to Amazon for offering it thru your business.</li>
            <li>Cant say enough about how incredible it works for me.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of staying on my scalp and hiding my balding spots making me look like I have twice as much hair.</li>
            <li>Oh, and my hair is a true 1B (us weave wearers know what this means!)</li>
            <li>Easy to wear, does not irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and travel with.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s not that easy</li>
            <li>A nice thickening gel helps a lot , the best which is not made anymore (Chemistry Salon Labs Thick) Trying to find a alternative now  .....</li>
            <li>And a good shampoo that has Wheat Protein without harsh chemicals (Fat hair Shampoo is great)  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, stays on all day, washes out in water.  </li>
            <li>Making it easy to hide.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and washes out just as easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and washes out just as easily.</li>
            <li>Probably the best use is for night if you&#x27;re going out in a dark place indoors.</li>
            <li>it came out great , Just as good as Caboki if not better .</li>
            <li>This is a fine powder so just as using baby powder leaves a coating, this will too</li>
            <li>I ordered the free sample..</li>
            <li>Try the free sample.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product (it&#x27;s a free sample I ordered off the Caboki website)</li>
            <li>My son had it sprinkled lightly on and it was that noticeable.</li>
            <li>This Company is a genius for giving me a free sample (visit the website).  </li>
            <li>After that it all falls apart and makes you look like you have some sort of bizarre disease.</li>
            <li>Try the free sample and judge for yourself.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle it on then take a brush or comb and go over the area LIGHTLY - don&#x27;t scrape the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how it would work on actual bald spots but for my purposes, it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a free sample of this about 5 or 6 months ago and did not try it out till yesterday.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, feel free to comment on my review and will try to respond when I get some free time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the free trial and paid $2.99 s/h.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence, you can get a free sample from Caboki.com ($2.99 shipping.)</li>
            <li>In my opinion Nanogen is BY FAR a superior product out of the four I&#x27;ve tested..</li>
            <li>It is good just to show that you have hair of course from a far distance and for some minutes.</li>
            <li>So good, she won&#x27;t let me use it around her family because they would notice immediately that suddenly from no where, I now have a full head of hair!</li>
            <li>The price is so worth the results!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it !</li>
            <li>As for losing or wasting their \\&quot;30 dollars\\&quot;, Caboki will give you a full refund, plus you can get a free sample and just pay for shipping.</li>
            <li>You will always have to clean up your forehead by the hairline or it will look like you used shoe polish on you</li>
            <li>I slept on it last night and it did leave a light smudge on the pillow, but it was still looking good.</li>
            <li>This helps the fibers to disburse more evenly and look more natural and the hair in that area look thicker.  </li>
            <li>my best advice is try it with the understanding it is NOT perfect but it might give you a temporary fix with amazing results.</li>
            <li>my best advice is try it with the understanding it is NOT perfect but it might give you a temporary fix with amazing results.</li>
            <li>The more you practice using the more developed you get at the technic</li>
            <li>have to admit, my mother was right!</li>
            <li>It washes out very easily in the shower with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is better for particular spots which need to be filled in.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say it will work for someone who is completely bald but the info video did show that it had amazing results.</li>
            <li>I use the dark brown and it matches my real hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>do as the instructions say, gently tapping the product onto the top of my head.</li>
            <li>If it does not work as good as these 2 products here is what they say  30 DAY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li>I will stick to my tried and true product.</li>
            <li>Caboki gives you more fibers for your dollar, however, keep in mind you&#x27;ll burn through these fibers MUCH quicker because they&#x27;re noticeably finer in granularity than Nanogen</li>
            <li>As I stated earlierever this product does work as described, however I would think twice or use sparingly and be sure wash very well to remove.</li>
            <li>Love it never believed this could really do what it said</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion, I think this product is great for certain people.</li>
            <li>They both are great because they don&#x27;t use wool or other products that can itch...</li>
            <li>Look younger and feel more confident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fashion photographer and use it for quick fixes with unruly hair, or just to spot fill.</li>
            <li>and i recommend it to people that are thinning bold</li>
            <li>You must have some hair for this to work if you are totally bold this ain&#x27;t gona</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE TOTALLY BOLD</li>
            <li>like , They sound pretty bogus to me .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, I purchased this product and felt foolish using it at first, but this stuff works!</li>
            <li>It allows me to feel way more confident about putting my hair up, parting it to the side, and generally just exposing the top and back of my head.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have enough of your own hair for it to &#x27;work with&#x27;</li>
            <li>Best kept secret.</li>
            <li>It is so worth the confidence that it gives.</li>
            <li>but for your hair, but its totally safe and seals the fibers and afterwards washes off completely when</li>
            <li>Worth the risk?</li>
            <li>wish you success</li>
            <li>This stuff works miracles if your hair is right for it.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT OFF YOUR HEAD .</li>
            <li>But, even when some of this rubs off onto clothes or sheets, it basically brushes right off.</li>
            <li>But if it did, it wipes right off no staining.</li>
            <li>(Without any locking mist Caboki came RIGHT off in the rain)..  </li>
            <li>yes it take practice to get it right</li>
            <li>So now I just blow my nose right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So now I just blow my nose right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>A real pain in the ass to clean up after .</li>
            <li>Also Nanogen seems to bond to hairs in less dense areas better rather than landing and clumping on your scalp like Caboki and Nanogen is formulated to work seamlessly with a customized locking mist that is surprisingly water resistant</li>
            <li>Nice product,it takes me 1 min to put it on,just one thing,when you buy it it comes with a plastic film that covers the holes,if you are an avid traveler keep that film and stick it back whenever you travel</li>
            <li>Especially as you age and get slight thinning, it&#x27;s the perfect cover-up, like a scalp concealer.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for special occasions like family portraits, formal occasions, some social outings etc.  </li>
            <li>Interesting but the too good to be true reviews look fake.</li>
            <li>However, I do not use this every day, but you do not need very much per application.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great and it is not messy like other products of its type.</li>
            <li>I only use it for special occasions or when I know pictures will be taken of me during the day or under light lamps .</li>
            <li>I paid 8 bucks for shipping and the only side affect i see is a boost in confidence :)</li>
            <li>It does not actually send out strands of hair but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Will not cover all spots if you have used any type of mousse, gel, or volumizer first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched many videos by regular people using this product.  </li>
            <li>I received compliments the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, mine stays on my head pretty well.</li>
            <li>I waited 4 weeks before coloring my hair because I was able to not only hide all of the cowlicks, but also to disguise the gray.</li>
            <li>and since I can do it with one hand, I can use a mirror to see the top back of my head and apply it there too!  </li>
            <li>The results you see in ads etc are based on the first couple minutes of application.</li>
            <li>Had the wife apply it for the first time until I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on this item and if you get a free sample except for the 6 dollar shipping they charge, I am sure it will do the same for you.</li>
            <li>Hmmm this product looks good at first, but it comes off easly, and can be quite messy.</li>
            <li>I have no problem sharing pictures for anyone interested in exchanging emails.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting a miracle, I did not expect that I could jump in the pool with it, I knew my sweating and hot flashes could be a problem.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting a miracle, I did not expect that I could jump in the pool with it, I knew my sweating and hot flashes could be a problem.</li>
            <li>I have lost so much hair at the top that the bare spot is noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have also used samson hair fibers, and toppik but xfusion and toppik are my favorite since they are the same exact thing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for a few days .</li>
            <li>Good stuff and way less money than a rug or transplant!</li>
            <li>This is especially true if you normally have dark hair that is contrasted by a light/white, skin-tone scalp.  </li>
            <li>She used similar kind of concealer, but it didn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li>it looks more realistic (they use more realistic color dyes and slightly denser electrostatic charged fibers).</li>
            <li>Good enough that I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply it the second day.</li>
            <li>For best results, I have found:  wash, blow dry then apply and style hair as usual.</li>
            <li>First I will say that this product does work as described, very well in fact.</li>
            <li>At first it just looks like you threw dirt on your head, but gently tap it into place with your fingers</li>
            <li>I love the results when one can use the product but having to shake the bottle feverishly for a few fibers to come out is not my idea of a good product.</li>
            <li>Caboki Hair loss concealer is the perfect boost of self confidence for anyone who is down about a little hair loss.</li>
            <li>Takes just a few minutes and like magic you have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>However due to my active lifestyle this product is not the &#x27;end all&#x27; solution to my hair-loss, just a very cool and very convincing cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This powder really does fill out your hairline.</li>
            <li>But then it really does.</li>
            <li>Hair Tek web sight does not even work , how do we know that&#x27;s for real .</li>
            <li>emails are very on business</li>
            <li>All theses work very well and 1/2  the cost.</li>
            <li>but if you look real close.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, at times my hair feels/looks thin, this is a great thickener.</li>
            <li>very itchy and hair line never looks real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very Unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>PUR TO MUCH THINKING</li>
            <li>The reason is that in the real world the coverage doesn&#x27;t really look like it does in the convention floor demos.</li>
            <li>The real story is this:</li>
            <li>It takes the shine off the skin if it&#x27;s very visible under the hair</li>
            <li>Well it shouldn&#x27;t really be a surprise.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>Caboki was the only one that fit my requirements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have tried this much sooner.</li>
            <li>Much to my annoyance my hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says.</li>
            <li>and Im very self concious about it.</li>
            <li>The result looks absolutely</li>
            <li>but it is still very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wonder if some of the people who complain about clumping is using too much.</li>
            <li>Yes, it really does work.</li>
            <li>It looks real.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident not having the thin hair spots showing.  </li>
            <li>If you have a bald spot all just completely bald use this item it works!!!</li>
            <li>and they also have men&#x27;s and  Women&#x27;s Regrowth Treatment along with &#x27;Hair Building Fibers&#x27; similar to Caboki along with many other products available</li>
            <li>They need to go back to what it originally was.</li>
            <li>Better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>This looks so much better than other stuff I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li>I completely freaked out the first time I used it as I was getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li>In retrospect, I really didn&#x27;t have that much hair loss, just some slight thinning on top, but in my eyes, I looked like one of those Monks.</li>
            <li>I have shorter hair and extremely thin on top and I am happy with this little &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is easy to use, looks natural, last until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>I am a36 yr old female who honestly can&#x27;t stand my cowlick on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I will wait to see if the Dark Brown is even better at coverage than the Medium Brown was as my gray hair grows in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You could have a coating on your counter top but just wipe it down.</li>
            <li>While it will wear off throughout the day, I have worked out in the gym and been out in the rain, and it more or less stays on.  </li>
            <li>When I put my hair back, I simply shake this over particular spots which I feel need more coverage.</li>
            <li>I have a receding hairline, less dense but still a decent amount of hair on the top of my head</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>after a little more practice I am getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>and it &#x27;dusts up&#x27; the hair a bit to give it A LITTLE more volume and coverage.</li>
            <li>Some days I add a little more as reinforcement, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Some days I add a little more as reinforcement, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>and after a little more research bought it through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use some kind of spray though after patting it down to make sure the product stays in place but other than that, the boost in confidence even if it is false is night and day...</li>
            <li>again prices are so much cheaper on Amazon and the pump which Toppik wrote has been fixed .</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it would look on really short hair.</li>
            <li>It is completly safe to use everyday and i look forward to buying it again</li>
            <li>and  it wont look right and dont go out in public like that</li>
            <li>Currently taking this right now with Rogaine and biotin shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, NOT thick hair, and where I part it is where it looks a little thinner, particularly close to my forehead.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>JUST LIVE WITH IT</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>These Caboki fibers are just like the cheap samson hair fibers but waaaaay more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It does ok in the wind and rain, as long as you don&#x27;t try to restyle your hair, just let it dry.</li>
            <li>Finally, I was interested in trying something different for this problem because I always think the tall people can see right down on top of my head and everyone else can see the back, while I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It looks 100 percent natural!</li>
            <li>Interested in the \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample but definitely, not giving them my cc #.</li>
            <li>you can see there are some pretty big Pros and Cons here!</li>
            <li>This works better than the other products similar to this.  </li>
            <li>I have a small bald spot on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>For Men wearing collared shirts, particularly white collared shirts, be prepared for numerous trips to the mens room to clean your collar from residue.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>that they&#x27;re made of a plant based fiber, but since when is your hair made of a substance other than keratin which could possibly look more natural than 100% keratin?  </li>
            <li>got the free sample of Caboki when I started realizing this was happening and was in slight anger/denial mode.</li>
            <li>I watched my bald thin areas and white scalp disappear in front of my own eyes in minutes!</li>
            <li>This will NOT work for you if you are completely bald; the fibers have to have some hair to stick to (my hair loss is moderate, but this product covers some pretty noticeable bald spots/thinning</li>
            <li>I am a 51 year old female with dark brown course hair that is thinning on top.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the black filaments left on my hand after touching my hair but it achieves the purpose</li>
            <li>That said, there are a few cautions: First, if you use this you&#x27;ll need to try a few shades possibly, to get the exact right match, and check those under full sun, florescent lights, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am a 42 yr old female with thinning hair thanks to genetics and thyroid issues.</li>
            <li>Ordered the free sample to try, i have a balding crown area, like a halo round thinning area.</li>
            <li>Propecia is a rip off (way too much money), Not covered and Proscar does the same thing .</li>
            <li>I would stay far away from this</li>
            <li>This product just looks SO REAL, that even I am convinced that I never lost any hair back there.  </li>
            <li>This product is completely exceeded all of my expectations, my hair looks fuller thicker and you can&#x27;t tell that done anything to it.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THEN IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK NATURAL</li>
            <li>The hair closest to my scalp, besides growing in totally gray, is thinning and has turned into a whole lot of cowlicks.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman).</li>
            <li>From inches away, my wife says it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, if you are completely bald it won&#x27;t look natural</li>
            <li>It covers the balding seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the thinning had taken its toll on my entire look.</li>
            <li>I have been styling by going straight back from the front to cover the thinning.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to completely hide your thinning hair</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to completely hide your thinning hair</li>
            <li>that has a bulb syringe like attachment allowing me to direct the powdery fibers to my problematic areas.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll set and look perfectly natural.    </li>
            <li>Little expensive but a very good product compared to other cheap imitators ....</li>
            <li>The Dark Brown is closer to black but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>Caboki, Megathik, and Toppik fibers are seem to be smaller and less quality than Nanogens and Caboki fibers are made of a plant based substance which doesn&#x27;t match your natural hair color as realistically to me, easily falls onto your scalp and blots up like mascara much easier, ESPECIALLY since they claim you don&#x27;t need an additional locking mist..</li>
            <li>This is how he uses it: he washes his hair first and puts rogaine foam on and lets it dry completely</li>
            <li>but I am not the average sweater (in early menopause with hot flashes!)</li>
            <li>Your hair will be a little sticky even after it dries put this on after and pat it down with you hand then comb your hair and its amazing.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I have been so pre-occupied with my hair loss that it took me 20 minutes or more per day to try to cover it up with styling - that always made me feel ridiculous.</li>
            <li>One particular day, it started sprinkling, and the actual drops showed on his head like polka dots.</li>
            <li>I have a decent head of hair but thinning has left the scalp to show.</li>
            <li>They changed the bottle now to a slimmer and taller version which seems to have a little less than the previous one but the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>I just got the new bottle in the new packaging and it is DEFINITELY NOT the same formula.</li>
            <li>Not pleased at all with how long the product covers bald spot at top of my head.</li>
            <li>Believe me, natural concealers are quietly exploding within the industry, so look for a shift from skepticism to endorsement (professional and celebrity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>^ As such, it comes off relatively easily-it doesn&#x27;t just flake off in the wind, but if a girl wants to play with your hair her hands will look like a chimney sweep.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>I love it, this producr completely covers my thin areas</li>
            <li>in regards to the \\&quot;what if a girl runs her fingers through your hair\\&quot; embarrassment; I find that no more significant than swiping your finger across your date&#x27;s face and coming away with mascara.</li>
            <li>If you read a negative review, they might have had too much balding or didn&#x27;t apply the right color or amount?</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and a LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li>It can be used for a variety of general hair issues.</li>
            <li>I believe if you are trying to cover complete bald spots, that do not have any tiny hairs still there</li>
            <li>I also got the Dark Brown for after coloring and today was my first day using it.</li>
            <li>only things that are common like most topical hair fibers</li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old female and I&#x27;ve been suffering from alopecia on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>Spraying the Cabooki hair concealer helps hide the bare spot.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, the results start to pan out in a few months where I won&#x27;t have to use as much of this product as I normally do...</li>
            <li>but while my natural hair colour is mousy brown, I colour it strawberry blonde although I have an inch of re-growth, and I feel mixed about whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li>So that means that my part is really thin and tying my hair back often leaves bald-looking or sparse patches of hair around the top and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it every now and then and it was decent at filling in some of those patches, but I wasn&#x27;t mentally prepared to use it every day (and therefore accept the fact that my hair is thinning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, if not more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on getting hot and heavy with someone they might get some on their fingers.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even tell one bit that it&#x27;s not just thick full hair there.  </li>
            <li>LAST ..eventually your hair will thin naturally where it will become harder to conceal the baldness with fibers etc, so better build your self esteem and be prepaired to shave your head one day or just put a ball cap on.</li>
            <li>Probably half of the effect goes away in the first few hours, particularly if you&#x27;re outside walking around.</li>
            <li>Third, If you swim or shower, this will wash out easily...which is good and bad.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use too much, by the end of the day it will have mostly settled and it won&#x27;t be as bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair looks AMAZING!</li>
            <li> And Anyone that has figured out how to add a pump to Caboki would be awesome :)</li>
            <li> I love this product if you follow the insturctions to the letter it is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it would be great if it stuck to your hair,or stays in place in the rain.</li>
            <li> Surgery is best but they want 10K easy for just a level 4 .</li>
            <li> After applying it very easily, i am amazed at the results!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> AND SHE LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li> It looks so good</li>
            <li> Proscar is good to stop the hairloss ,(I did it before and should have never stopped)  </li>
            <li> but it was a good product to use</li>
            <li> I like how well this stuff sticks to your head and is basically undetectable - does smear on pillows but use a good spray</li>
            <li> Good but l</li>
            <li> Fairly does good coverage .</li>
            <li> The five stars you are seeing by others has to be someone being paid for good reviews...</li>
            <li> I felt so energized because it made my hair look so good.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am totally happy and feel confident standing under tall people :</li>
            <li> If done right, this is awesome.</li>
            <li> Make it better!</li>
            <li> It looks so easy and looks great on them.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly easy to use, looks great, my self esteem is off the charts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It looks kind of like fibers almost up close.</li>
            <li> If you are really fully bald, this probably won&#x27;t give you the best results.</li>
            <li> i guess it kind of takes the curse off of a balding spot</li>
            <li> I am totally happy and feel confident standing under tall people :-)</li>
            <li> Nobody knows if it looks good on your head better than you.</li>
            <li> To be honest this is not something I would use every day.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend my day avoiding water and loving fingers.</li>
            <li> it work good with fine hair</li>
            <li> The old caboki worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, if you&#x27;re self conscious about your thinning hair, this is the greatest money you will ever spend!  </li>
            <li> it is great being able to have a full set of hair.</li>
            <li> I got the free sample to try and am extremely pleased with my results!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered 3 more.  </li>
            <li> Goofy for my mom</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think that there should be more colour choices, when many women like myself colour their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the mist spray to lock in the fibers</li>
            <li> I am glad I can get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but Caboki is the greatest, matches better and last longer.</li>
            <li> OK...</li>
            <li> It went on so much better today.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone that does not want scalp to show and it does make you feel better, younger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought many and it has never happened before.</li>
            <li> Surely, I have this on hand all the time .</li>
            <li> Magic.</li>
            <li> I got the free sample and love how my pictures come out , It need&#x27;s to be used with hair spray of any kind just as Toppik or it will not hold anything .</li>
            <li> but it will stop more thinning</li>
            <li> I STOPPED PROSCAR, WAY TOO MANY SIDE EFFECTS .</li>
            <li> I use to love this product but they raised the price 50% for my hair color (DarkBrown)</li>
            <li> But I have :-)</li>
            <li> now I love it.</li>
            <li> and you are all set :)</li>
            <li> IT WILL COVER BETTER.</li>
            <li> AND IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC.     </li>
            <li> I thought this product might be better</li>
            <li> About 2 hours after applying it I put my glasses on top of my head to read something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the fiber concealers - Caboki, Toppik, Megathik and Nanogen...</li>
            <li> But, don&#x27;t take my word for it.. :)</li>
            <li> I just love it and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It took some time to perfect, so you have to be patient and practice with different products and techniques.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> guys were experiencing problems like the fiber particles falling off when someone touching your hair , or changing a shirt etc.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Xfusion, its cheaper and its a better quality product for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and you need a mirror to make sure you evenly put the fibers on your head.</li>
            <li> I used to love Caboki.</li>
            <li> I think that I will now be able to get a more relaxed look by not having to do that.</li>
            <li> The scalp must be able to breathe as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I pay more for my Proactive skin stuff than I did for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> MOST PEOPLE</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s something most of us can&#x27;t stop stressing over(which</li>
            <li> It gives me more confidence in my appearance.</li>
            <li> It gives me more confidence in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Through existing hair this product is virtually  undetectable, but I can&#x27;t speak for those who are more bald than not.  </li>
            <li> sure why a man would use this</li>
            <li> Junk....May be OK for Halloween....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t brush it in - just sprinkle and pat the top of my head</li>
            <li> If you have most of your hair, and want something quick that effectively cleans up your hairline, order this product.</li>
            <li> but it worked out pretty good.</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m using this for a reunion for a couple days to see people I haven&#x27;t seen in years and will probably not see again in many more years it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magically watching a full head of hair appear!  </li>
            <li> But it comes off easily though I find when I try to blend it in better along my hair part to get rid of the brown &#x27;spots&#x27; it</li>
            <li> Thanks Caboki for an awesome product and thanks to Amazon for offering it thru your business.</li>
            <li> Cant say enough about how incredible it works for me.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of staying on my scalp and hiding my balding spots making me look like I have twice as much hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my hair is a true 1B (us weave wearers know what this means!)</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, does not irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and travel with.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s not that easy</li>
            <li> A nice thickening gel helps a lot , the best which is not made anymore (Chemistry Salon Labs Thick) Trying to find a alternative now  .....</li>
            <li> And a good shampoo that has Wheat Protein without harsh chemicals (Fat hair Shampoo is great)  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy, stays on all day, washes out in water.  </li>
            <li> Making it easy to hide.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and washes out just as easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and washes out just as easily.</li>
            <li> Probably the best use is for night if you&#x27;re going out in a dark place indoors.</li>
            <li> it came out great , Just as good as Caboki if not better .</li>
            <li> This is a fine powder so just as using baby powder leaves a coating, this will too</li>
            <li> I ordered the free sample..</li>
            <li> Try the free sample.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (it&#x27;s a free sample I ordered off the Caboki website)</li>
            <li> My son had it sprinkled lightly on and it was that noticeable.</li>
            <li> This Company is a genius for giving me a free sample (visit the website).  </li>
            <li> After that it all falls apart and makes you look like you have some sort of bizarre disease.</li>
            <li> Try the free sample and judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle it on then take a brush or comb and go over the area LIGHTLY - don&#x27;t scrape the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it would work on actual bald spots but for my purposes, it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a free sample of this about 5 or 6 months ago and did not try it out till yesterday.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, feel free to comment on my review and will try to respond when I get some free time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the free trial and paid $2.99 s/h.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, you can get a free sample from Caboki.com ($2.99 shipping.)</li>
            <li> In my opinion Nanogen is BY FAR a superior product out of the four I&#x27;ve tested..</li>
            <li> It is good just to show that you have hair of course from a far distance and for some minutes.</li>
            <li> So good, she won&#x27;t let me use it around her family because they would notice immediately that suddenly from no where, I now have a full head of hair!</li>
            <li> The price is so worth the results!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it !</li>
            <li> As for losing or wasting their \\&quot;30 dollars\\&quot;, Caboki will give you a full refund, plus you can get a free sample and just pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> You will always have to clean up your forehead by the hairline or it will look like you used shoe polish on you</li>
            <li> I slept on it last night and it did leave a light smudge on the pillow, but it was still looking good.</li>
            <li> This helps the fibers to disburse more evenly and look more natural and the hair in that area look thicker.  </li>
            <li> my best advice is try it with the understanding it is NOT perfect but it might give you a temporary fix with amazing results.</li>
            <li> my best advice is try it with the understanding it is NOT perfect but it might give you a temporary fix with amazing results.</li>
            <li> The more you practice using the more developed you get at the technic</li>
            <li> have to admit, my mother was right!</li>
            <li> It washes out very easily in the shower with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is better for particular spots which need to be filled in.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t say it will work for someone who is completely bald but the info video did show that it had amazing results.</li>
            <li> I use the dark brown and it matches my real hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> do as the instructions say, gently tapping the product onto the top of my head.</li>
            <li> If it does not work as good as these 2 products here is what they say  30 DAY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> I will stick to my tried and true product.</li>
            <li> Caboki gives you more fibers for your dollar, however, keep in mind you&#x27;ll burn through these fibers MUCH quicker because they&#x27;re noticeably finer in granularity than Nanogen</li>
            <li> As I stated earlierever this product does work as described, however I would think twice or use sparingly and be sure wash very well to remove.</li>
            <li> Love it never believed this could really do what it said</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion, I think this product is great for certain people.</li>
            <li> They both are great because they don&#x27;t use wool or other products that can itch...</li>
            <li> Look younger and feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fashion photographer and use it for quick fixes with unruly hair, or just to spot fill.</li>
            <li> and i recommend it to people that are thinning bold</li>
            <li> You must have some hair for this to work if you are totally bold this ain&#x27;t gona</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE TOTALLY BOLD</li>
            <li> like , They sound pretty bogus to me .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I purchased this product and felt foolish using it at first, but this stuff works!</li>
            <li> It allows me to feel way more confident about putting my hair up, parting it to the side, and generally just exposing the top and back of my head.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have enough of your own hair for it to &#x27;work with&#x27;</li>
            <li> Best kept secret.</li>
            <li> It is so worth the confidence that it gives.</li>
            <li> but for your hair, but its totally safe and seals the fibers and afterwards washes off completely when</li>
            <li> Worth the risk?</li>
            <li> wish you success</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles if your hair is right for it.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT OFF YOUR HEAD .</li>
            <li> But, even when some of this rubs off onto clothes or sheets, it basically brushes right off.</li>
            <li> But if it did, it wipes right off no staining.</li>
            <li> (Without any locking mist Caboki came RIGHT off in the rain)..  </li>
            <li> yes it take practice to get it right</li>
            <li> So now I just blow my nose right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now I just blow my nose right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> A real pain in the ass to clean up after .</li>
            <li> Also Nanogen seems to bond to hairs in less dense areas better rather than landing and clumping on your scalp like Caboki and Nanogen is formulated to work seamlessly with a customized locking mist that is surprisingly water resistant</li>
            <li> Nice product,it takes me 1 min to put it on,just one thing,when you buy it it comes with a plastic film that covers the holes,if you are an avid traveler keep that film and stick it back whenever you travel</li>
            <li> Especially as you age and get slight thinning, it&#x27;s the perfect cover-up, like a scalp concealer.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for special occasions like family portraits, formal occasions, some social outings etc.  </li>
            <li> Interesting but the too good to be true reviews look fake.</li>
            <li> However, I do not use this every day, but you do not need very much per application.</li>
            <li> The coverage is great and it is not messy like other products of its type.</li>
            <li> I only use it for special occasions or when I know pictures will be taken of me during the day or under light lamps .</li>
            <li> I paid 8 bucks for shipping and the only side affect i see is a boost in confidence :)</li>
            <li> It does not actually send out strands of hair but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Will not cover all spots if you have used any type of mousse, gel, or volumizer first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched many videos by regular people using this product.  </li>
            <li> I received compliments the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, mine stays on my head pretty well.</li>
            <li> I waited 4 weeks before coloring my hair because I was able to not only hide all of the cowlicks, but also to disguise the gray.</li>
            <li> and since I can do it with one hand, I can use a mirror to see the top back of my head and apply it there too!  </li>
            <li> The results you see in ads etc are based on the first couple minutes of application.</li>
            <li> Had the wife apply it for the first time until I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this item and if you get a free sample except for the 6 dollar shipping they charge, I am sure it will do the same for you.</li>
            <li> Hmmm this product looks good at first, but it comes off easly, and can be quite messy.</li>
            <li> I have no problem sharing pictures for anyone interested in exchanging emails.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a miracle, I did not expect that I could jump in the pool with it, I knew my sweating and hot flashes could be a problem.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a miracle, I did not expect that I could jump in the pool with it, I knew my sweating and hot flashes could be a problem.</li>
            <li> I have lost so much hair at the top that the bare spot is noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have also used samson hair fibers, and toppik but xfusion and toppik are my favorite since they are the same exact thing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for a few days .</li>
            <li> Good stuff and way less money than a rug or transplant!</li>
            <li> This is especially true if you normally have dark hair that is contrasted by a light/white, skin-tone scalp.  </li>
            <li> She used similar kind of concealer, but it didn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li> it looks more realistic (they use more realistic color dyes and slightly denser electrostatic charged fibers).</li>
            <li> Good enough that I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply it the second day.</li>
            <li> For best results, I have found:  wash, blow dry then apply and style hair as usual.</li>
            <li> First I will say that this product does work as described, very well in fact.</li>
            <li> At first it just looks like you threw dirt on your head, but gently tap it into place with your fingers</li>
            <li> I love the results when one can use the product but having to shake the bottle feverishly for a few fibers to come out is not my idea of a good product.</li>
            <li> Caboki Hair loss concealer is the perfect boost of self confidence for anyone who is down about a little hair loss.</li>
            <li> Takes just a few minutes and like magic you have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> However due to my active lifestyle this product is not the &#x27;end all&#x27; solution to my hair-loss, just a very cool and very convincing cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This powder really does fill out your hairline.</li>
            <li> But then it really does.</li>
            <li> Hair Tek web sight does not even work , how do we know that&#x27;s for real .</li>
            <li> emails are very on business</li>
            <li> All theses work very well and 1/2  the cost.</li>
            <li> but if you look real close.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, at times my hair feels/looks thin, this is a great thickener.</li>
            <li> very itchy and hair line never looks real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very Unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> PUR TO MUCH THINKING</li>
            <li> The reason is that in the real world the coverage doesn&#x27;t really look like it does in the convention floor demos.</li>
            <li> The real story is this:</li>
            <li> It takes the shine off the skin if it&#x27;s very visible under the hair</li>
            <li> Well it shouldn&#x27;t really be a surprise.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> Caboki was the only one that fit my requirements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have tried this much sooner.</li>
            <li> Much to my annoyance my hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says.</li>
            <li> and Im very self concious about it.</li>
            <li> The result looks absolutely</li>
            <li> but it is still very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder if some of the people who complain about clumping is using too much.</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does work.</li>
            <li> It looks real.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident not having the thin hair spots showing.  </li>
            <li> If you have a bald spot all just completely bald use this item it works!!!</li>
            <li> and they also have men&#x27;s and  Women&#x27;s Regrowth Treatment along with &#x27;Hair Building Fibers&#x27; similar to Caboki along with many other products available</li>
            <li> They need to go back to what it originally was.</li>
            <li> Better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> This looks so much better than other stuff I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li> I completely freaked out the first time I used it as I was getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li> In retrospect, I really didn&#x27;t have that much hair loss, just some slight thinning on top, but in my eyes, I looked like one of those Monks.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and extremely thin on top and I am happy with this little &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is easy to use, looks natural, last until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I am a36 yr old female who honestly can&#x27;t stand my cowlick on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I will wait to see if the Dark Brown is even better at coverage than the Medium Brown was as my gray hair grows in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You could have a coating on your counter top but just wipe it down.</li>
            <li> While it will wear off throughout the day, I have worked out in the gym and been out in the rain, and it more or less stays on.  </li>
            <li> When I put my hair back, I simply shake this over particular spots which I feel need more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have a receding hairline, less dense but still a decent amount of hair on the top of my head</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> after a little more practice I am getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> and it &#x27;dusts up&#x27; the hair a bit to give it A LITTLE more volume and coverage.</li>
            <li> Some days I add a little more as reinforcement, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Some days I add a little more as reinforcement, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and after a little more research bought it through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use some kind of spray though after patting it down to make sure the product stays in place but other than that, the boost in confidence even if it is false is night and day...</li>
            <li> again prices are so much cheaper on Amazon and the pump which Toppik wrote has been fixed .</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it would look on really short hair.</li>
            <li> It is completly safe to use everyday and i look forward to buying it again</li>
            <li> and  it wont look right and dont go out in public like that</li>
            <li> Currently taking this right now with Rogaine and biotin shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, NOT thick hair, and where I part it is where it looks a little thinner, particularly close to my forehead.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> JUST LIVE WITH IT</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> These Caboki fibers are just like the cheap samson hair fibers but waaaaay more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It does ok in the wind and rain, as long as you don&#x27;t try to restyle your hair, just let it dry.</li>
            <li> Finally, I was interested in trying something different for this problem because I always think the tall people can see right down on top of my head and everyone else can see the back, while I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It looks 100 percent natural!</li>
            <li> Interested in the \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample but definitely, not giving them my cc #.</li>
            <li> you can see there are some pretty big Pros and Cons here!</li>
            <li> This works better than the other products similar to this.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bald spot on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> For Men wearing collared shirts, particularly white collared shirts, be prepared for numerous trips to the mens room to clean your collar from residue.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> that they&#x27;re made of a plant based fiber, but since when is your hair made of a substance other than keratin which could possibly look more natural than 100% keratin?  </li>
            <li> got the free sample of Caboki when I started realizing this was happening and was in slight anger/denial mode.</li>
            <li> I watched my bald thin areas and white scalp disappear in front of my own eyes in minutes!</li>
            <li> This will NOT work for you if you are completely bald; the fibers have to have some hair to stick to (my hair loss is moderate, but this product covers some pretty noticeable bald spots/thinning</li>
            <li> I am a 51 year old female with dark brown course hair that is thinning on top.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the black filaments left on my hand after touching my hair but it achieves the purpose</li>
            <li> That said, there are a few cautions: First, if you use this you&#x27;ll need to try a few shades possibly, to get the exact right match, and check those under full sun, florescent lights, etc.  </li>
            <li> I am a 42 yr old female with thinning hair thanks to genetics and thyroid issues.</li>
            <li> Ordered the free sample to try, i have a balding crown area, like a halo round thinning area.</li>
            <li> Propecia is a rip off (way too much money), Not covered and Proscar does the same thing .</li>
            <li> I would stay far away from this</li>
            <li> This product just looks SO REAL, that even I am convinced that I never lost any hair back there.  </li>
            <li> This product is completely exceeded all of my expectations, my hair looks fuller thicker and you can&#x27;t tell that done anything to it.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEN IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK NATURAL</li>
            <li> The hair closest to my scalp, besides growing in totally gray, is thinning and has turned into a whole lot of cowlicks.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman).</li>
            <li> From inches away, my wife says it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, if you are completely bald it won&#x27;t look natural</li>
            <li> It covers the balding seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the thinning had taken its toll on my entire look.</li>
            <li> I have been styling by going straight back from the front to cover the thinning.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to completely hide your thinning hair</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to completely hide your thinning hair</li>
            <li> that has a bulb syringe like attachment allowing me to direct the powdery fibers to my problematic areas.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll set and look perfectly natural.    </li>
            <li> Little expensive but a very good product compared to other cheap imitators ....</li>
            <li> The Dark Brown is closer to black but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> Caboki, Megathik, and Toppik fibers are seem to be smaller and less quality than Nanogens and Caboki fibers are made of a plant based substance which doesn&#x27;t match your natural hair color as realistically to me, easily falls onto your scalp and blots up like mascara much easier, ESPECIALLY since they claim you don&#x27;t need an additional locking mist..</li>
            <li> This is how he uses it: he washes his hair first and puts rogaine foam on and lets it dry completely</li>
            <li> but I am not the average sweater (in early menopause with hot flashes!)</li>
            <li> Your hair will be a little sticky even after it dries put this on after and pat it down with you hand then comb your hair and its amazing.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I have been so pre-occupied with my hair loss that it took me 20 minutes or more per day to try to cover it up with styling - that always made me feel ridiculous.</li>
            <li> One particular day, it started sprinkling, and the actual drops showed on his head like polka dots.</li>
            <li> I have a decent head of hair but thinning has left the scalp to show.</li>
            <li> They changed the bottle now to a slimmer and taller version which seems to have a little less than the previous one but the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> I just got the new bottle in the new packaging and it is DEFINITELY NOT the same formula.</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all with how long the product covers bald spot at top of my head.</li>
            <li> Believe me, natural concealers are quietly exploding within the industry, so look for a shift from skepticism to endorsement (professional and celebrity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ^ As such, it comes off relatively easily-it doesn&#x27;t just flake off in the wind, but if a girl wants to play with your hair her hands will look like a chimney sweep.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> I love it, this producr completely covers my thin areas</li>
            <li> in regards to the \\&quot;what if a girl runs her fingers through your hair\\&quot; embarrassment; I find that no more significant than swiping your finger across your date&#x27;s face and coming away with mascara.</li>
            <li> If you read a negative review, they might have had too much balding or didn&#x27;t apply the right color or amount?</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and a LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> It can be used for a variety of general hair issues.</li>
            <li> I believe if you are trying to cover complete bald spots, that do not have any tiny hairs still there</li>
            <li> I also got the Dark Brown for after coloring and today was my first day using it.</li>
            <li> only things that are common like most topical hair fibers</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old female and I&#x27;ve been suffering from alopecia on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Spraying the Cabooki hair concealer helps hide the bare spot.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, the results start to pan out in a few months where I won&#x27;t have to use as much of this product as I normally do...</li>
            <li> but while my natural hair colour is mousy brown, I colour it strawberry blonde although I have an inch of re-growth, and I feel mixed about whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li> So that means that my part is really thin and tying my hair back often leaves bald-looking or sparse patches of hair around the top and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it every now and then and it was decent at filling in some of those patches, but I wasn&#x27;t mentally prepared to use it every day (and therefore accept the fact that my hair is thinning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, if not more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on getting hot and heavy with someone they might get some on their fingers.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even tell one bit that it&#x27;s not just thick full hair there.  </li>
            <li> LAST ..eventually your hair will thin naturally where it will become harder to conceal the baldness with fibers etc, so better build your self esteem and be prepaired to shave your head one day or just put a ball cap on.</li>
            <li> Probably half of the effect goes away in the first few hours, particularly if you&#x27;re outside walking around.</li>
            <li> Third, If you swim or shower, this will wash out easily...which is good and bad.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use too much, by the end of the day it will have mostly settled and it won&#x27;t be as bad.</li>
            <li> I had to hold my part flat, and move very close (within a foot of her) and scratch a little off before she could &amp;#34;see&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> On the crown where I use this product there the scalp is covered with red itchy bumps and the hair that is there is notably thinner and very unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Either way as long as you purchase from Amazon only and not a 3rd party you have nothing to lose .</li>
            <li> and then it takes you a long time to try to get back in whatever is left....</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, it so etimes looks a little clumpy, not ac from a normal distance</li>
            <li> -However I work out pretty hard and</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it looks like I have huge thinning/sparse spots around my head - especially if it&#x27;s time to color (which has been every 2 weeks for the last 20 years or so</li>
            <li> The only thing is not to place it too close to the front of your hairline in risk of it looking strange.</li>
            <li> If you leave the residue on a collar too long, and combine that with sweating or moisture, the stain will set into the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried substitutes and only SAMSON comes close.</li>
            <li> Long story short...</li>
            <li> is 5 seconds flat.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product because i was experiencing some minor hair loss..</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I was very skeptical to put it nicely.</li>
            <li> The product works well to conceal thinning areas, however if you so much as sneeze to hard it will wisp away or simply drop out.</li>
            <li> Plus BTW it doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> Using this product daily requires that you wash and blow dry daily.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It leaves a complete mess on the sink when applying.</li>
            <li> Not everyone has the proper texture, but my wife and I both use it and love it for covering small thin spots in our hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to apply without getting too much in one spot that looks like I put shoe polish in my head .</li>
            <li> Very embarrassing to say the least.</li>
            <li> For minimal to moderate hair loss this stuff works.</li>
            <li> that I have just wet my hair the next day without washing and still stayed in .</li>
            <li> This keeps your pillows and shirts cleaner in the long run.</li>
            <li> At 34 years old I am way too old to have such thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t sat or stood in the front row of anything for so long, because I imagine people commenting on my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the grey coverage in between colorings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Curly hair for example can&#x27;t hold this product for long time and it will scatter all over your shirt or dress</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried it long ago.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;8) I am a chronic sweater.</li>
            <li> its too messy and does not stay on your hair and does not look as natural as xfusion.</li>
            <li> It looks like you have hair and it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Also some advice if you use Rogaine Foam allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> I should also add that I sleep on a satin pillowcase and have never seen a single mark or stain</li>
            <li> -)eep on a satin pillowcase and have never seen a single mark or stain and I wash my hair once a week and the product stays put.</li>
            <li> You can use it to fill in small gaps and it looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dark gray product for four months covering a bald spot on the back of my head and want to share my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the product has been changed the dark brown is now a reddish brown and doesn&#x27;t appear to work as well as it used to when it was in the former packaging.</li>
            <li> Now I can bend over to pick something up for a pretty girl without an immediate thought to my thin hair</li>
            <li> but I expect that would make it last even less.</li>
            <li> I have no less hair than the people in the videos, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it tends to make a mess, so plan on cleaning up</li>
            <li> and I can &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the thin spots by styling my hair certain ways</li>
            <li> Takes only a little practice.  </li>
            <li> Our problem with it was that you can&#x27;t sweat, wipe anything , or get it wet.</li>
            <li> If you get it wet or something.</li>
            <li> And for now it&#x27;s relatively unknown so no ones looking for it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to use than on commercials.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product does everything that I PERSONALLY expected it to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product does everything that I PERSONALLY expected it to do.</li>
            <li> The 75 day supply lasted one year for me, so I got my monies worth, needless to say.</li>
            <li> But you must  rinse VERY well or wash your hair as it is very difficult to completely remove.  </li>
            <li> long thick curly/wavy hair has definitely changed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look fake as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost black (very dark brown) and this is a little lighter than my hair color, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> He said when he put it on his head it felt extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since used it 4 other times.  </li>
            <li> I tried the other leading brand, but could not tolerate the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> One caution though, don&#x27;t get caught in the rain - it will run and not a pretty sight.</li>
            <li> but they should consider other types also.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try different styling now that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my thinning.</li>
            <li> other purchases</li>
            <li> , it held up extremely well (and as previously noted, did not leave residue on my pillows)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the last two jars I bought are hard to apply and I can&#x27;t figure out why.  </li>
            <li> Looks like just dark brown powder on bald spot.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> When I use it it looks like I&#x27;ve poured dark brown powder on my head.  </li>
            <li> AND I DID NOT NOTICE ANY BENIFIT , NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I use to order this all the time but not worth it, never again.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and this works well.</li>
            <li> Caboki Hair Loss Concealer - Dark Brown (75-day Supply)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Even when she wore hair piece, her natural hair is so thin, everyone can see she is wearing hair piece.</li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get it down.  </li>
            <li> Anyone out there that has a gel that does not weigh your hair down suggestions,  please let me know .</li>
            <li> This was after spraying the product down (which it says you can do as an option).</li>
            <li> In the end your just giving your money away and washing dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> which means that it is an extremely dark brown/off black.</li>
            <li> If takes me less than an minute to sprinkle on, finger comb and the spray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4)dont jump in the pool (embarrassing moment the black stuff will float in the pool)&lt;br /&gt;5)ok to wear hats with it</li>
            <li> and it turns black?</li>
            <li> It looks thicker, fuller and makes me feel less self conscience about it.</li>
            <li> It looks thicker, fuller and makes me feel less self conscience about it.</li>
            <li> A little darker shade for dark hair works well however.</li>
            <li> Use a little hairspray, not waterproof, cap immediately after use, face down without agitating container or it will accumulate on surfaces.</li>
            <li> A MESS</li>
            <li> If you mess with it it will clump or fall out.</li>
            <li> let anyone mess up your hair (since the fibers may uneven)&lt;br</li>
            <li> , a mess in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Colors the scalp a little too much...but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Caboki helps A LITTLE BIT to cover a balding spot.  </li>
            <li> I tried a hair piece, which I affectionately called my \\&quot;lady rug\\&quot;, to add thickness and cover my gray in between colorings, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the feel of that thing on my head with its little clippy combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BELIEVE I DID FOR ONE LITTLE AREA..</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes</li>
            <li> A little sweat would be no issue</li>
            <li> Just a little shake, shake or a tap</li>
            <li> Here is where things get a little tricky.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice to get it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little messy) and</li>
            <li> It is quite embarrassing for a young man when something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> If you have baldspots or thinning hair , It will work with but messy .</li>
            <li> TOPPIK IS SO HARSH SMELLING AND GETS INTO YOUR NOSE</li>
            <li> BUT CABOKLI DOES NOT HAVE A HARSH SMELL</li>
            <li> AND THEN BUY CABOKI , THE VEGAN FORMULA IS NOT AS HARSH AS THE TOPPIK CHEMICALS.</li>
            <li> IT ISN&#x27;T MESSY PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> please dont buy this product waste of money</li>
            <li> but I have never had a residue left behind in the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;10)</li>
            <li> I started using Rogaine a few months ago, and while that seems to be working, I&#x27;ll take all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> You know what mascara looks like when someone is crying?</li>
            <li> I starting getting a few thin spots but Caboki covers the problem.</li>
            <li> I just keep a small towel/cloth with me to wipe my forehead down and pat my hair where I applied the product.</li>
            <li> Leaves small black particles/dots all over your head and to me that puts this product at the bootm of product-like list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> (no luck so far), or wigs (still no luck, they either fit badly or look unrealistic or both), or things to fill in the thin spots.  </li>
            <li> She was pretty shocked.</li>
            <li> Covers grey between colorings as well as thin spots.wish</li>
            <li> this is totally cheating; i felt so embarrassed and disappointed buying this product; not even little close to what do they show on commercial;</li>
            <li> However, I do have very little balding.</li>
            <li> You can usually just comb it out and reapply, esecially if you&#x27;re one of those people who doesn&#x27;t shower every morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using another product for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joan Rivers&#x27;s product (which works well, but is difficult to apply by myself in the back</li>
            <li> However the results were unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> so humidity is always an issue with my hair which is medium length past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> If I blow my nose, I can see small amount of evidence of the powder.</li>
            <li> If I blow my nose, I can see small amount of evidence of the powder.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> My bald spot is somewhat small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money !  </li>
            <li> it is no good and a waste of money it does not stick to your hair and dont sweat with this stuff in your hair it will get soogy</li>
            <li> you sweat excessively be preparred for a weird color dripping usually green if you use black</li>
            <li> Her hairs thin out a lot past few years</li>
            <li> I feel the packaging with this one is subtle, so it&#x27;s the one I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> I do have little thin hairs in the balding area which i think you need in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> Took 5 seconds, and I effectively am no longer thinning.  </li>
            <li> It has to cling to some hair at least.</li>
            <li> It sucks to have this happen, but accepting it has made it easier to &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> common we figured it was a dud&lt;br /&gt;yup</li>
            <li> All in all, it did as they advertise, but it is a little inconvenient when it comes to being active or whatever.</li>
            <li> I get a very small amount of residue</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only for people with thin or really thin hair, you have to have some hair, even if it is very thin...</li>
            <li> It causes serious migranes and vomiting.</li>
            <li> I did order the wrong color since my hair is black</li>
            <li> I was seriously contemplating shaving off my hair, before I stumbled across this product on the internet.</li>
            <li> , I have very thin black hair on my scalp</li>
            <li> This stuff is complete crap....</li>
            <li> It was a little awkward because I wasn&#x27;t used to working with it.</li>
            <li> OR as another reviewer I saw on here said, as if you dunked your head into a dustbin as your head looks dusty from the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a makeup brush to help with this, eliminate the dusty look.</li>
            <li> and I was not happy.  </li>
            <li> Clumps up, washes out, makes you look even worse than just with a bald spot or thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Takes away the shiny scalp thingie that goes on when your hair is too thin.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced product falling on my clothing or pillow case.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hardly a reason to give a bad review.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Bottle continuously clogs making it difficult to disburse fibers evenly or sometimes at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this product but it seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> This stuff is aweful and fake looking</li>
            <li> gets everywhere in the bathroom lease weird residue in bathroom but can be cleaned</li>
            <li> makes it worse!)</li>
            <li> but thankfully I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: save your money and avoid expensive hair restoration by using this product.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and have struggled to conceal my very thin hair for years.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, it is useless!</li>
            <li> and since that&#x27;s basically impossible....</li>
            <li> I am just thinning a bit at the crown...not too bad.</li>
            <li> This shows bad customer service.  </li>
            <li> bad thing about Caboki is that, yes, it&#x27;s a powder, so running your fingers (or someone else&#x27;s fingers)</li>
            <li> my scalp has broken out in a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As described but this product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered the free sample..It worked great with no side affects.I then ordered a standard size from the caboki website.&lt;br /&gt;  It isn&#x27;t the same product it contains ammonium chloride which is not meant for contact with your skin.It causes serious migranes and vomiting.</li>
            <li> Amaizing!! It&#x27;s work like the video!!</li>
            <li> Incredible Product. Love it. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.  Took 5 seconds, and I effectively am no longer thinning.  I just ordered 3 more.  While it will wear off throughout the day, I have worked out in the gym and been out in the rain, and it more or less stays on.  If you have most of your hair, and want something quick that effectively cleans up your hairline, order this product.</li>
            <li> This powder really does fill out your hairline. I am a repeated wearer of extensions, and I noticed a bit of thinning around my hairline. When I put my hair back, I simply shake this over particular spots which I feel need more coverage. It looks 100 percent natural! The only thing is not to place it too close to the front of your hairline in risk of it looking strange. It is better for particular spots which need to be filled in. Oh, and my hair is a true 1B (us weave wearers know what this means!) which means that it is an extremely dark brown/off black. I use this color, and it matches perfectly. Also, the 75-day supply does last. However, I do not use this every day, but you do not need very much per application.</li>
            <li> Goofy for my mom she loves this stuff. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> The stuff does the job!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  What a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. The coverage is great and it is not messy like other products of its type. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles if your hair is right for it.  Not everyone has the proper texture, but my wife and I both use it and love it for covering small thin spots in our hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered the free sample to try, i have a balding crown area, like a halo round thinning area. I do have little thin hairs in the balding area which i think you need in order for it to work. After applying it very easily, i am amazed at the results! I watched my bald thin areas and white scalp disappear in front of my own eyes in minutes! I just ran around outside with the dog and created a sweaty head to see what would happen, and it stayed on, is not running or flaking off. I am very satisfied and will always use this product! I believe if you are trying to cover complete bald spots, that do not have any tiny hairs still there, it might not work as well, you do need some hair for it to attach to, it also is supposed to stick to scalp to hide the baldness and does everything it says it does! If you read a negative review, they might have had too much balding or didn&#x27;t apply the right color or amount? I will see how it stays overnight sleeping, i do toss and turn quite a bit, i will post results in the morning. I would expect some to rub off but i myself shower every morning so i will have to apply every day. The price is so worth the results! Try the free sample. I paid 8 bucks for shipping and the only side affect i see is a boost in confidence :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (it&#x27;s a free sample I ordered off the Caboki website) but while my natural hair colour is mousy brown, I colour it strawberry blonde although I have an inch of re-growth, and I feel mixed about whether I like it or not. I think that there should be more colour choices, when many women like myself colour their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do as the instructions say, gently tapping the product onto the top of my head. I have baby fine hair, NOT thick hair, and where I part it is where it looks a little thinner, particularly close to my forehead. I like that where in regular indoor lighting there would be a bit of a glare by my part before that now doesn&#x27;t have it by using this stuff, but: if you don&#x27;t have enough of your own hair for it to &#x27;work with&#x27;, the effect is that it looks like there&#x27;s these brown spots of dirt on your scalp! OR as another reviewer I saw on here said, as if you dunked your head into a dustbin as your head looks dusty from the product. I&#x27;ve been using a makeup brush to help with this, eliminate the dusty look. But it comes off easily though I find when I try to blend it in better along my hair part to get rid of the brown &#x27;spots&#x27; it leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another similar product on the market I found through a Google search called Toppik and they also have men&#x27;s and  Women&#x27;s Regrowth Treatment along with &#x27;Hair Building Fibers&#x27; similar to Caboki along with many other products available I think I&#x27;m going to try.</li>
            <li> Tried and cannot seem to get the effects of the product. Looks like just dark brown powder on bald spot.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue practicing!</li>
            <li> This product is Great. The Dark Brown is closer to black but the product itself is amazing. You can use it to fill in small gaps and it looks completely natural. Even though it is only a temp fix it is great being able to have a full set of hair.</li>
            <li> All in all, it did as they advertise, but it is a little inconvenient when it comes to being active or whatever. My son had it sprinkled lightly on and it was that noticeable. At one point I remember we wish we might have gone darker. It looks kind of like fibers almost up close. Our problem with it was that you can&#x27;t sweat, wipe anything , or get it wet. It is quite embarrassing for a young man when something goes wrong. It does not stay on. If you get it wet or something. it is noticeable. One particular day, it started sprinkling, and the actual drops showed on his head like polka dots.</li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get it down.  Biggest part is to avoid rain.  I&#x27;ve worn a hat after applying  Caboki with volume spray and everything was still covered.  The product worked as advertised for me.  Make sure you use the mist spray to lock in the fibers and you&#x27;re good to go.  Very happy with this Caboki product.</li>
            <li> Something has changed with this product. The old caboki worked flawlessly. When they changed the bottle, something was different with the product and it is definitely not the same and the brown color is off. They need to go back to what it originally was.</li>
            <li> Caboki meets my needs as to filling in where hair is sparse.  It does not actually send out strands of hair but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Will not cover all spots if you have used any type of mousse, gel, or volumizer first.  This is especially true if you normally have dark hair that is contrasted by a light/white, skin-tone scalp.  Better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my mom. Her hairs thin out a lot past few years and it is now starting to bother her. Even when she wore hair piece, her natural hair is so thin, everyone can see she is wearing hair piece. She used similar kind of concealer, but it didn&#x27;t look natural.  One day, I received sample of this product, so I gave it to her to try it. AND SHE LOVED IT.  I am glad I can get it from Amazon. It&#x27;s is easy to use, looks natural, last until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried xfusion and toppik and like both a lot but Caboki is the greatest, matches better and last longer. It is quicker to put on and stays put unlike the others. bought again and again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who saw it online. He said when he put it on his head it felt extremely itchy. Can I return it for a refund if it has been opened?</li>
            <li> Caboki has given me back my dignity. I starting getting a few thin spots but Caboki covers the problem. It isn&#x27;t for everybody. You must have some hair for Caboki to work. But then it really does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched many videos by regular people using this product.  It looks so easy and looks great on them.  When I use it it looks like I&#x27;ve poured dark brown powder on my head.  I completely freaked out the first time I used it as I was getting ready for work.  Then I went to comb it, and it just slid the product across my head leaving a bald streak.  I&#x27;ve since used it 4 other times.  I have no less hair than the people in the videos, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.  I&#x27;m super disappointed in it. (UPDATE: OK...after a little more practice I am getting the hang of it.  It went on so much better today.  So, I am changing my initial rating of 1 to 4.  This looks so much better than other stuff I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li> this thing has saved my life.</li>
            <li> I tried the other leading brand, but could not tolerate the chemicals. This one works the same but without the irritation. Very pleased with the product. Covers grey between colorings as well as thin spots.wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone that does not want scalp to show and it does make you feel better, younger.&lt;br /&gt;I have been losing hair for over a year and I was not happy.  This does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Bottle continuously clogs making it difficult to disburse fibers evenly or sometimes at all. Disappointed for sure. I love the results when one can use the product but having to shake the bottle feverishly for a few fibers to come out is not my idea of a good product.</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all with how long the product covers bald spot at top of my head. It starts to blotch after an hour.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, does not irritate the scalp. Conceal well but the last two jars I bought are hard to apply and I can&#x27;t figure out why.  I bought many and it has never happened before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this product but it seems to do the trick. I did order the wrong color since my hair is black but it worked out pretty good. I was wondering though if this product could cause hair loss with the chemicals it is made from?</li>
            <li> Good stuff!!! Works!!  It makes such a difference in my appearance!! Surely, I have this on hand all the time .</li>
            <li> Great product. Magic. Look younger and feel more confident. Easy to apply and travel with. Best kept secret. Try it!</li>
            <li> For minimal to moderate hair loss this stuff works. One caution though, don&#x27;t get caught in the rain - it will run and not a pretty sight. Don&#x27;t ask me how I know this.</li>
            <li> I got the free sample and love how my pictures come out , It need&#x27;s to be used with hair spray of any kind just as Toppik or it will not hold anything . It leaves a complete mess on the sink when applying. when you wipe it off the sink it&#x27;s like mud . A real pain in the ass to clean up after . It&#x27;s really hard to apply without getting too much in one spot that looks like I put shoe polish in my head . I had Toppik done for me at a hair stylist and with the pump it came out great , Just as good as Caboki if not better . You will always have to clean up your forehead by the hairline or it will look like you used shoe polish on you head .With the hairspray it&#x27;s good for a few days . It looks so good that I have just wet my hair the next day without washing and still stayed in . I only use it for special occasions or when I know pictures will be taken of me during the day or under light lamps . I am going to try Toppik again prices are so much cheaper on Amazon and the pump which Toppik wrote has been fixed . If not Amazon will take a anything back no questions asked if it does not work  ! Either way as long as you purchase from Amazon only and not a 3rd party you have nothing to lose . If Caboki made a pump to make it easier to apply and not get all over the place I would buy Caboki again which is a vegan concealer then Toppik which is (who knows what). The Videos are joke on there website , It&#x27;s not that easy and it does not come out that way ! Someone mentioned HAIR-TEK on Ebay .... If it does not work as good as these 2 products here is what they say  30 DAY MONEY BACK GAURANTEE , yet WE ARE AN AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR FOR HAIR TEK PRODUCTS ...Hair Tek web sight does not even work , how do we know that&#x27;s for real . They claim that the fibers do not land on your scalp (this would be great) Any further input on this company would be great.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are all bald in the front this is not for you . It will look like your head was painted . If you have baldspots or thinning hair , It will work with but messy . Surgery is best but they want 10K easy for just a level 4 . Not unless I win the lottery. Proscar is good to stop the hairloss ,(I did it before and should have never stopped)  It won&#x27;t grow anything but it will stop more thinning and it is covered under insurance ,30 pills will last 3 months , You cut them into 4&#x27;s . Propecia is a rip off (way too much money), Not covered and Proscar does the same thing . It&#x27;s the same medicine . A nice thickening gel helps a lot , the best which is not made anymore (Chemistry Salon Labs Thick) Trying to find a alternative now  ..... And a good shampoo that has Wheat Protein without harsh chemicals (Fat hair Shampoo is great)  This is just my experience using all this stuff . I&#x27;m also going to try 2% Ketoconzole Topical shampoo every 3 days (leave in for only 3 min) and see if anything happens. The doctor wrote me out a prescription for it along with Proscar  . Anyone out there that has a gel that does not weigh your hair down suggestions,  please let me know . And Anyone that has figured out how to add a pump to Caboki would be awesome :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update on Har-Tek , the company will not pay for return shipping if you don&#x27;t like it . I would stay far away from this .There emails are very on business like , They sound pretty bogus to me .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when I get Toppik and see how it works with the pump .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; UPDATE . TOPPIK IS SO HARSH SMELLING AND GETS INTO YOUR NOSE AS DOES CABOKI , BUT CABOKLI DOES NOT HAVE A HARSH SMELL , I FELT NAUSES AFTER USING TOPPIK , THE PUMP IS WRTHLESS IS BLOWS THE FIBERS RIGHT OFF YOUR HEAD . WHAT A MESS BOTH OF THESE PRODUCTS MAKE . I STOPPED PROSCAR, WAY TOO MANY SIDE EFFECTS . WISH I COULD RETURN THE TOPPIK BUT IT&#x27;S WAY AFTER THE 30 DAYS RETURN . I&#x27;LL JUST LIVE WITH IT TILL I RUN OUT AND THEN BUY CABOKI , THE VEGAN FORMULA IS NOT AS HARSH AS THE TOPPIK CHEMICALS. ALSO THE Ketoconzole Topical shampooMAKES YOUR HAIR FLY AWAY AND I DID NOT NOTICE ANY BENIFIT , NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I am just thinning a bit at the crown...not too bad. If you are really fully bald, this probably won&#x27;t give you the best results. This product just looks SO REAL, that even I am convinced that I never lost any hair back there.  That said, there are a few cautions: First, if you use this you&#x27;ll need to try a few shades possibly, to get the exact right match, and check those under full sun, florescent lights, etc.  A little darker shade for dark hair works well however. Secondly, I suggest using the mist spray after you put this on, to decrease the staining of your collars. This keeps your pillows and shirts cleaner in the long run. Third, If you swim or shower, this will wash out easily...which is good and bad. I would suggest that you will need or want to rinse your hair before bed, to allow the scalp to breath and keep your bedding cleaner. But, even when some of this rubs off onto clothes or sheets, it basically brushes right off. If you leave the residue on a collar too long, and combine that with sweating or moisture, the stain will set into the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried substitutes and only SAMSON comes close. They both are great because they don&#x27;t use wool or other products that can itch...I&#x27;ve never had an itching problem with Caboki or Samson. Good stuff and way less money than a rug or transplant!</li>
            <li> Save your money by Toppik</li>
            <li> I use to love this product but they raised the price 50% for my hair color (DarkBrown) This shows bad customer service.  I use to order this all the time but not worth it, never again. So I tried CUVVA, Hair Illusion (witch is real human hair) and Toppik. All theses work very well and 1/2  the cost.</li>
            <li> At 34 years old I am way too old to have such thin hair.  For 10 years Ive been trying to covering up the thinness and widening part. I haven&#x27;t sat or stood in the front row of anything for so long, because I imagine people commenting on my hair. This stuff is a godsend. If takes me less than an minute to sprinkle on, finger comb and the spray. Done! I received compliments the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address a couple problems listed here. By the end of the day, it so etimes looks a little clumpy, not ac from a normal distance but if you look real close. You can usually just comb it out and reapply, esecially if you&#x27;re one of those people who doesn&#x27;t shower every morning. Also, mine stays on my head pretty well. I wear white scrubs for work and have never had any show up on my collar. But if it did, it wipes right off no staining. It does ok in the wind and rain, as long as you don&#x27;t try to restyle your hair, just let it dry. If you mess with it it will clump or fall out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the grey coverage in between colorings. I have dark hair and this works well. Colors the scalp a little too much...but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> works well.  not something I would use everday or in the rain.  I will probably order this  product again. thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magically watching a full head of hair appear!  I&#x27;m telling you, if you&#x27;re self conscious about your thinning hair, this is the greatest money you will ever spend!  It goes on easy, stays on all day, washes out in water.  No one can tell!</li>
            <li> Been using this for several months now.  Cant say enough about how incredible it works for me.  Totally worth it !</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I was very skeptical to put it nicely. This product is completely exceeded all of my expectations, my hair looks fuller thicker and you can&#x27;t tell that done anything to it. This Company is a genius for giving me a free sample (visit the website).  If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would never tried this. But I have :-) now I love it.</li>
            <li> Caboki is a great concealer. Does a good job of staying on my scalp and hiding my balding spots making me look like I have twice as much hair. Not sure how good it would look on really short hair. This is my 3rd bottle. I took this one in to let my hair girl try it out. She was pretty shocked. And for now it&#x27;s relatively unknown so no ones looking for it. Making it easy to hide.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Don&#x27;t like the black filaments left on my hand after touching my hair but it achieves the purpose</li>
            <li> Its just a paint.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> I should point out that this is NOT just for hair loss. It can be used for a variety of general hair issues. I&#x27;m a fashion photographer and use it for quick fixes with unruly hair, or just to spot fill. / Believe me, natural concealers are quietly exploding within the industry, so look for a shift from skepticism to endorsement (professional and celebrity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in regards to the \\&quot;what if a girl runs her fingers through your hair\\&quot; embarrassment; I find that no more significant than swiping your finger across your date&#x27;s face and coming away with mascara.</li>
            <li> it was only temporary use cause i had hair fallen but now since my hair grew back i don&#x27;t longer use it but it was a good product to use and i recommend it to people that are thinning bold</li>
            <li> I am a36 yr old female who honestly can&#x27;t stand my cowlick on the back of my head. I try to tease it but can&#x27;t stand the parted shine through of my white scalp. I shake this on and in 2 seconds it is disguised and my hair looks &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. Also, at times my hair feels/looks thin, this is a great thickener. I believe this is one of those products everyone would use if they knew it existed. Male, female whatever. Who doesn&#x27;t want their hair to look thicker? Especially as you age and get slight thinning, it&#x27;s the perfect cover-up, like a scalp concealer. Finding this product was such a relief for me! Definitely worth the price, if not more.</li>
            <li> I like it. It makes my hair look thicker.  I wish the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I like how well this stuff sticks to your head and is basically undetectable - does smear on pillows but use a good spray and you are all set :)</li>
            <li> oh my god ! this is totally cheating; i felt so embarrassed and disappointed buying this product; not even little close to what do they show on commercial;</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the hair powders and I feel they&#x27;re all about the same.  I feel the packaging with this one is subtle, so it&#x27;s the one I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to use than on commercials. I can&#x27;t put it on my hair without looking like I have a wig. very itchy and hair line never looks real. I&#x27;m very Unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL FIX IT ISN&#x27;T MESSY PRODUCTS IT STAYS ON ALL DAY . DON&#x27;T PUR TO MUCH THINKING IT WILL COVER BETTER. BECAUSE THEN IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK NATURAL</li>
            <li> This thing is the best please don&#x27;t ever stop selling it. NOW FOR THE TWO PEOPLE WHO GAVE ONE STAR REVIEWS. THIS PRODUCT WORKS. You must have some hair for this to work if you are totally bold this ain&#x27;t gona stick its made to stick to hair. THIS PRODUCT IS FOR PEOPLE WITH MODERATE HAIR LOSS YOU MUST HAVE SOME HAIR FOR THIS TO WORK AND IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC.     Also some advice if you use Rogaine Foam allow it to dry. Your hair will be a little sticky even after it dries put this on after and pat it down with you hand then comb your hair and its amazing. You can go through your hair with you hand and it wont come off. You can sleep with it. It only comes off in the shower.      BEST THING EVER BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOME HAIR IF YOU ARE TOTALLY BOLD THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> Good but l o see fibers get in my eyes and affect my allergies. Does the job for coverage</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Exceeded all my expectations</li>
            <li> If you have a bald spot all just completely bald use this item it works!!! It looks like you have hair and it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have been using another product for the past 10 years. I thought this product might be better so I gave it a try. About 2 hours after applying it I put my glasses on top of my head to read something and when I put them back on my face, I had an outline of Caboki on my face where my glasses had been. This was after spraying the product down (which it says you can do as an option). Very embarrassing to say the least. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to fill in but I did want that fuller look. I will never use this product again. As a matter of fact, I used it once and tossed the rest in the garbage. I will stick to my tried and true product.</li>
            <li> I have a receding hairline, less dense but still a decent amount of hair on the top of my head.. I&#x27;ve tried most of the fiber concealers - Caboki, Toppik, Megathik and Nanogen... In my opinion Nanogen is BY FAR a superior product out of the four I&#x27;ve tested.. it looks more realistic (they use more realistic color dyes and slightly denser electrostatic charged fibers). Also Nanogen seems to bond to hairs in less dense areas better rather than landing and clumping on your scalp like Caboki and Nanogen is formulated to work seamlessly with a customized locking mist that is surprisingly water resistant (Without any locking mist Caboki came RIGHT off in the rain)..  Caboki, Megathik, and Toppik fibers are seem to be smaller and less quality than Nanogens and Caboki fibers are made of a plant based substance which doesn&#x27;t match your natural hair color as realistically to me, easily falls onto your scalp and blots up like mascara much easier, ESPECIALLY since they claim you don&#x27;t need an additional locking mist.. Don&#x27;t believe their claims which you don&#x27;t need a separate locking \\&quot;glue\\&quot; , there are ZERO fibers on the market *yet* which perform well without a locking mist.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve tested them THOROUGHLY because I&#x27;d rather not spend the xtra money on a separate locking mist if I don&#x27;t need to..  The only possible pluses I can think of for Caboki is 1. that they&#x27;re made of a plant based fiber, but since when is your hair made of a substance other than keratin which could possibly look more natural than 100% keratin?  and  2.  Caboki gives you more fibers for your dollar, however, keep in mind you&#x27;ll burn through these fibers MUCH quicker because they&#x27;re noticeably finer in granularity than Nanogen..  Believe it or not, 15 grams of Nanogen fibers went almost the same distance as a standard size bottle of Caboki @ 25 grams. But, don&#x27;t take my word for it.. :)</li>
            <li> This product is not working well with all type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Curly hair for example can&#x27;t hold this product for long time and it will scatter all over your shirt or dress fast.&lt;br /&gt;I am saying that after my friend try it on his curly hair and he looked like he had a dust in his head and his hear looked messy.&lt;br /&gt;Yest it work good with fine hair but they should consider other types also.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason that the promo footage is shot STANDARD DEF not HD... The reason is that in the real world the coverage doesn&#x27;t really look like it does in the convention floor demos. There&#x27;s also a reason why you don&#x27;t see any of the people being caboki-ed MOVE or TOUCH THEIR HAIR, that&#x27;s because the caboki would fall off.  The real story is this: Caboki helps A LITTLE BIT to cover a balding spot.  It takes the shine off the skin if it&#x27;s very visible under the hair and it &#x27;dusts up&#x27; the hair a bit to give it A LITTLE more volume and coverage. i guess it kind of takes the curse off of a balding spot but IT DOESN&#x27;T COVER IT UP. At all. and since that&#x27;s basically impossible.... Well it shouldn&#x27;t really be a surprise. Plus BTW it doesn&#x27;t last very long either. Probably half of the effect goes away in the first few hours, particularly if you&#x27;re outside walking around. I don&#x27;t know about wind but I expect that would make it last even less. Probably the best use is for night if you&#x27;re going out in a dark place indoors. I got a 75 day supply and I&#x27;ll probably use it. But don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dark gray product for four months covering a bald spot on the back of my head and want to share my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Using this product daily requires that you wash and blow dry daily.&lt;br /&gt;2) For Men wearing collared shirts, particularly white collared shirts, be prepared for numerous trips to the mens room to clean your collar from residue.&lt;br /&gt;3) Be prepared for a 10 minute process every morning including cleaning the surrounding areas along with your ears and neck.&lt;br /&gt;4) A 25 gram bottle lasts approx 15 applications.....not 75 days.&lt;br /&gt;5) Be prepared to use a hair spray in order to minimize fibers falling off.&lt;br /&gt;6) Be prepared to carry a mirror in order to view the back of your head.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0053UJSFK Caboki Hair Loss Concealer - Dark Brown (75-day Supply)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years my long thick curly/wavy hair has definitely changed. The hair closest to my scalp, besides growing in totally gray, is thinning and has turned into a whole lot of cowlicks. Needless to say, it looks like I have huge thinning/sparse spots around my head - especially if it&#x27;s time to color (which has been every 2 weeks for the last 20 years or so - I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman). I tried a hair piece, which I affectionately called my \\&quot;lady rug\\&quot;, to add thickness and cover my gray in between colorings, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the feel of that thing on my head with its little clippy combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother suggested a different concealer she saw advertised on TV, but I poopoo-ed her (like I do every time she suggests something to help one of my shortcomings). Finally, I was interested in trying something different for this problem because I always think the tall people can see right down on top of my head and everyone else can see the back, while I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s made me a bit self-conscious. I researched different concealers online and was looking for one that didn&#x27;t say it had to be washed out every day or that it would get all over your pillow if you slept after using it. Caboki was the only one that fit my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a sample of the Medium Brown about a month ago and I was blown away by the results. I waited 4 weeks before coloring my hair because I was able to not only hide all of the cowlicks, but also to disguise the gray. I also got the Dark Brown for after coloring and today was my first day using it. Again, I am blown away. All of my cowlicks seem to have disappeared and there are no thinning  spaces on my head. I will wait to see if the Dark Brown is even better at coverage than the Medium Brown was as my gray hair grows in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, my mother was right! I should have tried this much sooner. I should also add that I sleep on a satin pillowcase and have never seen a single mark or stain and I wash my hair once a week and the product stays put. Some days I add a little more as reinforcement, but that&#x27;s it. I am totally happy and feel confident standing under tall people :-)eep on a satin pillowcase and have never seen a single mark or stain and I wash my hair once a week and the product stays put. Some days I add a little more as reinforcement, but that&#x27;s it. I am totally happy and feel confident standing under tall people :-)</li>
            <li> Amazingly easy to use, looks great, my self esteem is off the charts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Prime Member!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&gt; Don&#x27;t sleep with it-stains pillows!!</li>
            <li> Much to my annoyance my hair is thinning. I&#x27;ve been looking for things to help it grow back (no luck so far), or wigs (still no luck, they either fit badly or look unrealistic or both), or things to fill in the thin spots.  I&#x27;ve been using Joan Rivers&#x27;s product (which works well, but is difficult to apply by myself in the back and it&#x27;s a little messy) and while looking at another product came accross this one &amp;quot;caboki&amp;quot;.  I watched them apply it on their site, and was impressed and after a little more research bought it through Amazon.com.  It works wonderfully and is very easy to apply.  Just tilt and tap and since I can do it with one hand, I can use a mirror to see the top back of my head and apply it there too!  It comes in a variety of colors.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough for those who have bald patches or thinning hair.  Men or women, works just as well for both.  It stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Fairly does good coverage . The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it sort of clumps sometime later in the day such that it appears like patches.</li>
            <li> My husband found this product for me, and ordered a trial size for me.  I just love it and have been using it ever since.  It really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Clumps up, washes out, makes you look even worse than just with a bald spot or thinning hair. The results you see in ads etc are based on the first couple minutes of application. After that it all falls apart and makes you look like you have some sort of bizarre disease.</li>
            <li> please dont buy this product it is no good and a waste of money it does not stick to your hair and dont sweat with this stuff in your hair it will get soogy and  it wont look right and dont go out in public like that please dont buy this product waste of money</li>
            <li> Tried it yesterday and it does work wonders! Had the wife apply it for the first time until I get the hang of it. The results are amazing! Every part of my scalp that used to show through now looks as though there is hair there. From inches away, my wife says it looks totally natural. So good, she won&#x27;t let me use it around her family because they would notice immediately that suddenly from no where, I now have a full head of hair! I slept on it last night and it did leave a light smudge on the pillow, but it was still looking good. Good enough that I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply it the second day. Don&#x27;t pay attention to the bozo&#x27;s with the one star reviews. If you&#x27;re totally bald, they explain that it won&#x27;t work. It has to cling to some hair at least. As for losing or wasting their \\&quot;30 dollars\\&quot;, Caboki will give you a full refund, plus you can get a free sample and just pay for shipping. That&#x27;s what I did. Now I&#x27;m going to purchase it. I tried it \\&quot;for free\\&quot;. How could anybody lose? Don&#x27;t listen to mine or anybody else&#x27;s reviews. Try the free sample and judge for yourself. Nobody knows if it looks good on your head better than you. I&#x27;m betting you&#x27;ll agree with me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is complete crap....The five stars you are seeing by others has to be someone being paid for good reviews...This stuff is aweful and fake looking</li>
            <li> Interesting but the too good to be true reviews look fake. Interested in the \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample but definitely, not giving them my cc #.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I feel more confident not having the thin hair spots showing.  My hair looks thicker.  I am happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Gives my husband incredible confidence when he doesn&#x27;t want to wear a hat. It took some time to perfect, so you have to be patient and practice with different products and techniques. This is how he uses it: he washes his hair first and puts rogaine foam on and lets it dry completely then he puts the caboki on, then uses got2be hair gel to style it then finishes it off with garnier hairspray and it lasts all day, literally all day, from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. I definitely recommend giving this a try. It is so worth the confidence that it gives. Keep in mind, if you are completely bald it won&#x27;t look natural, it&#x27;s only for people with thin or really thin hair, you have to have some hair, even if it is very thin... Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to cover up my side part and make my hair in that area look fuller.  This stuff is great for that.  Takes only a little practice.  Sprinkle it on then take a brush or comb and go over the area LIGHTLY - don&#x27;t scrape the scalp.  This helps the fibers to disburse more evenly and look more natural and the hair in that area look thicker.  I can&#x27;t say how it would work on actual bald spots but for my purposes, it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just as described!! Doesn&#x27;t look fake as long as you don&#x27;t use too much. Every one noticed a big difference</li>
            <li> I noticed alot of you guys were experiencing problems like the fiber particles falling off when someone touching your hair , or changing a shirt etc. I would recommend Xfusion, its cheaper and its a better quality product for what you pay for. Ive been using it for about a year already, I have very thin black hair on my scalp and Im very self concious about it. So I tried xfusion, yes it take practice to get it right and you need a mirror to make sure you evenly put the fibers on your head. once its on you add xfusion fiber spray hold that works like a glue but for your hair, but its totally safe and seals the fibers and afterwards washes off completely when you shower.&lt;br /&gt;the only things that are common like most topical hair fibers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)when you sweat excessively be preparred for a weird color dripping usually green if you use black&lt;br /&gt;2)dont go to sleep with it, or it will be all over your pillow LOL&lt;br /&gt;3)dont let anyone mess up your hair (since the fibers may uneven)&lt;br /&gt;4)dont jump in the pool (embarrassing moment the black stuff will float in the pool)&lt;br /&gt;5)ok to wear hats with it just dont wear white caps)&lt;br /&gt;6)stuff gets everywhere in the bathroom lease weird residue in bathroom but can be cleaned&lt;br /&gt;7) LAST ..eventually your hair will thin naturally where it will become harder to conceal the baldness with fibers etc, so better build your self esteem and be prepaired to shave your head one day or just put a ball cap on. In the end your just giving your money away and washing dollars down the drain. People are beautiful either with hair or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for reading</li>
            <li> The product does not come off unless I wash it off. Brushing my hair does not get it off. It covers the balding seamlessly. However, I do have very little balding. My hair is almost black (very dark brown) and this is a little lighter than my hair color, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old female and I&#x27;ve been suffering from alopecia on the crown of my head. So that means that my part is really thin and tying my hair back often leaves bald-looking or sparse patches of hair around the top and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the free sample of Caboki when I started realizing this was happening and was in slight anger/denial mode. I used it every now and then and it was decent at filling in some of those patches, but I wasn&#x27;t mentally prepared to use it every day (and therefore accept the fact that my hair is thinning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a year or so later, I finally purchased the 25 mg and use it almost every day. It allows me to feel way more confident about putting my hair up, parting it to the side, and generally just exposing the top and back of my head. It sucks to have this happen, but accepting it has made it easier to &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; it and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about Caboki is that, yes, it&#x27;s a powder, so running your fingers (or someone else&#x27;s fingers) through your hair will leave you with some residue. If you don&#x27;t use too much, by the end of the day it will have mostly settled and it won&#x27;t be as bad.</li>
            <li> They changed the bottle now to a slimmer and taller version which seems to have a little less than the previous one but the product itself is great. Make sure to use some kind of spray though after patting it down to make sure the product stays in place but other than that, the boost in confidence even if it is false is night and day... Currently taking this right now with Rogaine and biotin shampoo and conditioner... Hopefully, the results start to pan out in a few months where I won&#x27;t have to use as much of this product as I normally do... Great product and it came 2 days after I ordered as it said.</li>
            <li> I used to love Caboki. I just got the new bottle in the new packaging and it is DEFINITELY NOT the same formula. They changed it. It sticks to your scalp and not Hair. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as before! Will not buy this again! Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> If done right, this is awesome. Use a little hairspray, not waterproof, cap immediately after use, face down without agitating container or it will accumulate on surfaces. Keep hair trimmed periodically for best effect. Wash out at night.</li>
            <li> Nice product,it takes me 1 min to put it on,just one thing,when you buy it it comes with a plastic film that covers the holes,if you are an avid traveler keep that film and stick it back whenever you travel,otherwise it spills out where the cap goes,so when you open it a lot falls out and then it takes you a long time to try to get back in whatever is left....</li>
            <li> I had gotten a free sample of this about 5 or 6 months ago and did not try it out till yesterday. I kept looking at the box but just thought it looked like pepper in a pepper bottle.  For some reason - probably out of desperation i decided to give it a try. It was a little awkward because I wasn&#x27;t used to working with it. However the results were unbelievable. I felt so energized because it made my hair look so good. I hadn&#x27;t realized how much the thinning had taken its toll on my entire look. I am anxious to try different styling now that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my thinning. I have been styling by going straight back from the front to cover the thinning. I think that I will now be able to get a more relaxed look by not having to do that. I am completely sold on this item and if you get a free sample except for the 6 dollar shipping they charge, I am sure it will do the same for you. I have a decent head of hair but thinning has left the scalp to show. So I can&#x27;t say it will work for someone who is completely bald but the info video did show that it had amazing results. All I can say is that I have been so pre-occupied with my hair loss that it took me 20 minutes or more per day to try to cover it up with styling - that always made me feel ridiculous. I could go on and on, but do yourself a favor and give it a try. The only thing I plan on doing now since I saw a review by a doctor on here -  is to shampoo it out each night so my follicles get some air. I dont want to cause any additional thinning. So I will have to do additional shampoo each day. Unbelievable product. I wish I had tried it long ago. I hope this review helps and you get the same results and relief that I did.</li>
            <li> Beware of side effects. First I will say that this product does work as described, very well in fact. However I could only give it 2 stars because after prolonged use ( 3 months) my scalp has broken out in a terrible rash. On the crown where I use this product there the scalp is covered with red itchy bumps and the hair that is there is notably thinner and very unhealthy. I used the product daily and would rinse my head every evening when I get home from work. But you must  rinse VERY well or wash your hair as it is very difficult to completely remove.  Another thing I noticed is when applying I sometimes breath in the fibers that are in the air which causes additional irritation. You will start to notice the fibers all over your bathroom counter as well. As I stated earlierever this product does work as described, however I would think twice or use sparingly and be sure wash very well to remove. The scalp must be able to breathe as well.</li>
            <li> Regained my confidence. I use the dark brown and it matches my real hair perfectly. Easy to apply. Takes just a few minutes and like magic you have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I use it when I out my hair in a ponytail, at the receding hairline parts.  You can&#x27;t even tell one bit that it&#x27;s not just thick full hair there.  Takes away the shiny scalp thingie that goes on when your hair is too thin.</li>
            <li> This is all it is cracked up to be. You see things on TV and wonder if it does what it looks like it does. This product is off the chain as they say. Would recommend it to everybody men and women who are dealing with hair loss. Even though it is not regrowth of your hair it gives you a confidence you use to have and a younger look. Thanks Caboki for an awesome product and thanks to Amazon for offering it thru your business.</li>
            <li> Hmmm this product looks good at first, but it comes off easly, and can be quite messy. Imagine being in a public meeting and you lean foward and touch your head to something and it turns black? yup</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Caboki and it&#x27;s as simple as this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The result looks absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;2.  It takes 2 seconds to apply (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s cheap! I pay more for my Proactive skin stuff than I did for this.&lt;br /&gt;  -However-&lt;br /&gt;3.  This is a concealer/i.e makeup for your dome&lt;br /&gt;4.  ^ As such, it comes off relatively easily-it doesn&#x27;t just flake off in the wind, but if a girl wants to play with your hair her hands will look like a chimney sweep.&lt;br /&gt;5.  You can not swim or shower and expect this stuff to stay in-However I work out pretty hard and even a sweaty day at the gym doesn&#x27;t cause any problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;6.  This will NOT work for you if you are completely bald; the fibers have to have some hair to stick to (my hair loss is moderate, but this product covers some pretty noticeable bald spots/thinning areas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see there are some pretty big Pros and Cons here! In my personal opinion, I think this product is great for certain people. I use it primarily for special occasions like family portraits, formal occasions, some social outings etc.  However due to my active lifestyle this product is not the &#x27;end all&#x27; solution to my hair-loss, just a very cool and very convincing cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you have any questions, feel free to comment on my review and will try to respond when I get some free time.  I have no problem sharing pictures for anyone interested in exchanging emails.</li>
            <li> best product of its type! EZ coverage you cannot see even close up!</li>
            <li> This works better than the other products similar to this.  I won&#x27;t try anything else.</li>
            <li> COVERING THINNING HAIR THEN I WOULD TELL THEM ABOUT THIS PRODUCT MOST PEOPLE I KNOW WOULD NOT WANT TO SPEND 45.00 I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I DID FOR ONE LITTLE AREA..</li>
            <li> Caboki Hair loss concealer is the perfect boost of self confidence for anyone who is down about a little hair loss. I&#x27;m 28, and I have been losing hair since I was 16. I know that it&#x27;s something most of us can&#x27;t stop stressing over(which makes it worse!) and I have been looking for something to help.I even once tried using charcoal as a concealer!  Now I can bend over to pick something up for a pretty girl without an immediate thought to my thin hair that I just showed her.Wear it with confidence and use it sparingly. Make it better! Don&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> The product works well to conceal thinning areas, however if you so much as sneeze to hard it will wisp away or simply drop out. I tried using extra hold hairspray to help still NO GO. I have used Toppik for a day and it&#x27;s a night and day difference.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 yr old female with thinning hair thanks to genetics and thyroid issues. I live in Florida so humidity is always an issue with my hair which is medium length past my shoulders. I am not bald and I can &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the thin spots by styling my hair certain ways but it is still very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I ordered the free trial and paid $2.99 s/h.&lt;br /&gt;2) It goes on easy and a LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! I wonder if some of the people who complain about clumping is using too much. I almost just use a &amp;#34;dusting&amp;#34; amount and brush through with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;3) It WILL rub off on your fingers if you touch/itch your head. Just use something to itch it (pencil, pen, q-tip, etc)&lt;br /&gt;4) You will need to wipe some dusting off your face/nose. This is a fine powder so just as using baby powder leaves a coating, this will too but it&#x27;s hardly a reason to give a bad review.&lt;br /&gt;5) I have not experienced product falling on my clothing or pillow case. And I do not use a setting spray.&lt;br /&gt;6) You could have a coating on your counter top but just wipe it down. I keep Clorox wipes in my bathroom anyway, takes 2 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;7) It held up well with the Florida humidity. But maybe because I am not using a lot. Remember a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;8) I am a chronic sweater. This is the biggest issue I have but I cant fault the product. A little sweat would be no issue but I am not the average sweater (in early menopause with hot flashes!) I just keep a small towel/cloth with me to wipe my forehead down and pat my hair where I applied the product. I only have a problem if I itch or scratch my head. Then it could appear clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;9) It washes out very easily in the shower with normal shampoo. Yes, I will see the color in the water but I have never had a residue left behind in the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;10) On times I have left it in overnight, it held up extremely well (and as previously noted, did not leave residue on my pillows)&lt;br /&gt;11) One last thought.. you will breath these fibers/powder in. If I blow my nose, I can see small amount of evidence of the powder. So now I just blow my nose right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product does everything that I PERSONALLY expected it to do. It gives me more confidence in my appearance. My hair looks AMAZING! It looks thicker, fuller and makes me feel less self conscience about it. It goes on easily and washes out just as easily. I was not expecting a miracle, I did not expect that I could jump in the pool with it, I knew my sweating and hot flashes could be a problem. I was expecting it to be messier than it actually was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my best advice is try it with the understanding it is NOT perfect but it might give you a temporary fix with amazing results. If you are looking for something to completely hide your thinning hair 24/7, this is not it. But it works perfect for work and/or going for a night out if you take into consideration everything I mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope someone finds my experience helpful.ill breath these fibers/powder in.

            <li> I love this product if you follow the insturctions to the letter it is perfect. The more you practice using the more developed you get at the technic</li>
            <li> Love it never believed this could really do what it said but thankfully I was wrong. Lives up to all claimes.</li>
            <li> I think the product has been changed the dark brown is now a reddish brown and doesn&#x27;t appear to work as well as it used to when it was in the former packaging.</li>
            <li> This is just a powder! Waste of money! It is good just to show that you have hair of course from a far distance and for some minutes. Afterwards, it is useless!</li>
            <li> just what I wanted, conceals bald spots</li>
            <li> The product is very good (I use it every day).  The delivery system (sprinkle on salt shaker style) is not for those that need to apply it through existing hair.  If I shook it on, the majority would stick to my existing hair rather than my white scalp.  To deal with this issue  I pour the Caboki into another brand&#x27;s container (Toppik) that has a bulb syringe like attachment allowing me to direct the powdery fibers to my problematic areas.  I would give it 4 to 5 stars if they provided a way to get the product through my existing hair to my lilly white scalp.  I am a 51 year old female with dark brown course hair that is thinning on top. Through existing hair this product is virtually  undetectable, but I can&#x27;t speak for those who are more bald than not.  When a friend was thinking of purchasing the Joan Rivers product I recommended this instead.  I had to hold my part flat, and move very close (within a foot of her) and scratch a little off before she could &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does work. If you have a bald spot you can somewhat cover with hair, this product is great! It looks real. Its great!</li>
            <li> Little expensive but a very good product compared to other cheap imitators ....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, you can get a free sample from Caboki.com ($2.99 shipping.) If you are in doubt about the color to choose, they suggest going for the darker shade.    I have a small bald spot on the top of my head. I started using Rogaine a few months ago, and while that seems to be working, I&#x27;ll take all the help I can get. I bought this because I am going to a reunion and I was hoping this would help cover the bald spot up. Long story short...it works! My bald spot is somewhat small so I can apply this is 5 seconds flat. Just a little shake, shake or a tap and it&#x27;s on. At first it just looks like you threw dirt on your head, but gently tap it into place with your fingers and it&#x27;ll set and look perfectly natural.    When I run my fingers over it I get a very small amount of residue but it&#x27;s no biggie. I do not use any product (hair spray, gel etc.) on my hair and it seems to last. If you&#x27;re planning on getting hot and heavy with someone they might get some on their fingers. Worth the risk? That&#x27;s up to you. Here is where things get a little tricky. The second water hits it, it just washes away and you&#x27;re left with a streak on your head. You know what mascara looks like when someone is crying? Imagine that on your head. If you&#x27;re going to be out in the rain or at a swim meet perhaps you might try something else.    To be honest this is not something I would use every day. I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend my day avoiding water and loving fingers. But since I&#x27;m using this for a reunion for a couple days to see people I haven&#x27;t seen in years and will probably not see again in many more years it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li> common we figured it was a dud&lt;br /&gt;yup, a mess in the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;not sure why a man would use this</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product because i was experiencing some minor hair loss.. After looking at the video i had to try it.. I love it, this producr completely covers my thin areas and i dont have to worry about it coming off on my clothes.. It is completly safe to use everyday and i look forward to buying it again</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well...</li>
            <li> Husband no longer has to wear a hat</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it would be great if it stuck to your hair,or stays in place in the rain.</li>
            <li> I have lost so much hair at the top that the bare spot is noticeable.  Spraying the Cabooki hair concealer helps hide the bare spot.  Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Excellent goods And the speed of sending&lt;br /&gt;We will be with you other purchases&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I wish you success</li>
            <li> Junk....May be OK for Halloween....</li>
            <li> Leaves small black particles/dots all over your head and to me that puts this product at the bootm of product-like list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using xfusion for about a year now.....decided to give caboki a try to see what all the hype was about.  I should&#x27;ve never bought it.  It&#x27;s a waste of money !  I have also used samson hair fibers, and toppik but xfusion and toppik are my favorite since they are the same exact thing.  These Caboki fibers are just like the cheap samson hair fibers but waaaaay more expensive.  I do not recommend this item. its too messy and does not stay on your hair and does not look as natural as xfusion.</li>
            <li> I was seriously contemplating shaving off my hair, before I stumbled across this product on the internet. In retrospect, I really didn&#x27;t have that much hair loss, just some slight thinning on top, but in my eyes, I looked like one of those Monks. Anyway, I purchased this product and felt foolish using it at first, but this stuff works! I don&#x27;t require much of it to cover my thinning area, just a few sprinkles and I&#x27;m good to go. It does take a little practice to get it just right. I don&#x27;t brush it in - just sprinkle and pat the top of my head and that&#x27;s it. The 75 day supply lasted one year for me, so I got my monies worth, needless to say. The only downside is that it tends to make a mess, so plan on cleaning up or you will hear about it from your wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: save your money and avoid expensive hair restoration by using this product.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and have struggled to conceal my very thin hair for years.  I got the free sample to try and am extremely pleased with my results! It does take practice applying but it is possible.  I have shorter hair and extremely thin on top and I am happy with this little &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.  For best results, I have found:  wash, blow dry then apply and style hair as usual.</li>
