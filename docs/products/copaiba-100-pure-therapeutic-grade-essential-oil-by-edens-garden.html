            <li>Thank you for getting my order out quickly and packaging it well.</li>

            <li>really well too!</li>
            <li>Copaiba is such an amazing essential oil</li>
            <li>The copaiba smell I do not like as much as vanilla, ylang-ylang or cedarwood, but that it is because it is another plant.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>very comforting.  </li>
            <li>and you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Works really well for what I use it for.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how fast the pain was gone.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pure and for any condition, it&#x27;s suitable to use internal or external for a healthier body, etc.</li>
            <li>the price from a competitor).&lt;br /&gt;Besides the wonky droppers, I can only say good things about Edens Garden and their high quality oils!!</li>
            <li>The products are high quality.</li>
            <li>Seems like a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>I love the little booklets they send with each order.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden proves you don&#x27;t have to take a second mortgage out on your house to use quality oils.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it topically so it might be worth the money.</li>
            <li>This oil is new to me and the jury is still out on if it is working or not.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used  it for anything in particular so far  but looking up the purpose of it, saw it on line and thought I would get it.</li>
            <li>But in no way did it actually &#x27;curl my toes&#x27; like some other strong scents from this product line when opening the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>I used this on my shoulder that was hurting from an old injury.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re my new go-to for essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils</li>
            <li>I can only get a very tiny amount out at a time and it requires a considerable amount of messing with the opening.</li>
            <li>The oils are packaged well and a very informative little brochure comes with each order.</li>

            <li> I can only get a very tiny amount out at a time and it requires a considerable amount of messing with the opening.</li>
            <li> The oils are packaged well and a very informative little brochure comes with each order.</li>
            <li> Not near the price.</li>
            <li> had wanted it as I heard it increased shelf life if mixed with other oils and,</li>
            <li> I agree, the initial smell is sort of like opening a sweet pickle jar and getting a casual whiff!</li>
            <li> I did not really know what to expect from this oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> few days ago, my knee became extremely swollen, for two days, morning and night, I massaged it mixed with jojoba oil and the swelling is gone!  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Copaiba....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> Inconsistently smells nice then it will smell bad, weak.</li>
            <li> Thought I would give edens garden a try since price was so much less.  </li>
            <li> , it smells a little odd.  </li>
            <li> However there is very little smell to it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is extremely thick and very hard to get it to drip out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I can deal with that on a small scale.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the smell</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE dropper bottles that waste the product and no way to precisely dispense the correct drops needed.</li>
            <li> At this time, will not buy again unless the dropper orifice is changed and slowly drops one drop at a time.</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that it works as a fixitive to make other scents last longer when combined, and is a base note (which means it can combine with almost anything).</li>
            <li> I mean by this that, if you´re gonna smell it (aromatherapy) which is something you´re breathing, why not for consumption?</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is very difficult to dispense.</li>
            <li> and I was still a little skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The MLM essential oil companies are giving the industry a bad name.  </li>
            <li> It smells terrible and it does not have the same miraculous effects of other brands.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, but there were no instructions as to how to use it.</li>
            <li> It helps with painful neck tension and resulting tension headaches.</li>
            <li> You will  never be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Good value, good product.</li>
            <li> I love Edens Garden. They&#x27;re my new go-to for essential oils. The prices are very reasonable, and the service is awesome. I love the little booklets they send with each order.</li>
            <li> Great products.mas good as TL. Not near the price. Will shop again.</li>
            <li> I use this with a carrier oil and rub on my hips and legs for balance.</li>
            <li> using this in pain blends and it works well</li>
            <li> Favorite  seller, I have tons and love them all! You will  never be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use this with cloves and a carrier oil for muscular pain relief. It works great and smells good too!</li>
            <li> The product is very good and natural. The copaiba smell I do not like as much as vanilla, ylang-ylang or cedarwood, but that it is because it is another plant. The product itsself is very good made, completely natural and fresh! - Who likes Copaiba, will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I trust anything from Eden&#x27;s Garden.  The MLM essential oil companies are giving the industry a bad name.  Eden&#x27;s Garden proves you don&#x27;t have to take a second mortgage out on your house to use quality oils.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fair price.</li>
            <li> Not so thrilled with the smell.  Inconsistently smells nice then it will smell bad, weak. Haven&#x27;t tried it topically so it might be worth the money.</li>
            <li> I did not really know what to expect from this oil. I only knew what I read in the description and I have ended up loving it!</li>
            <li> Great product !! As described. fast shipping</li>
            <li> I just got my copaiba oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden.  It smells great and the best part is that it really helps with any inflammation I&#x27;m having.  I have used copaiba from another company that charges much more.  I personally, can&#x27;t tell a difference.  Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oil works just as effectively and is so much easier on the pocketbook!  You can expect excellent customer service with this company, also.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this and was really happy with how fast it came. However there is very little smell to it and I feel zero effects of it being rubbed on.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read that copaiba was the best all natural anti-inflammatory. It smelled &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; like sandlewood and leather. I can deal with that on a small scale. I rubbed it on my neck and shoulders before and after showers and even a drop in my bathwater. No rash( that&#x27;s good) but no pain relief either. It also cause me to break out with acne in the areas on my back/shoulder area that I used it on. It cleared up once I stopped using it</li>
            <li> What can I say  I love these oilsThanks</li>
            <li> Thank you for getting my order out quickly and packaging it well. It is an amazing oil. Great product line</li>
            <li> A true oil has to be TRUE. I mean by this that, if you´re gonna smell it (aromatherapy) which is something you´re breathing, why not for consumption? Am I smelling just chemicals to enlarge quantities of the product? I don´t know. But don´t do it.</li>
            <li> Great product, superb price, fast shipping.....TERRIBLE dropper bottles that waste the product and no way to precisely dispense the correct drops needed. At this time, will not buy again unless the dropper orifice is changed and slowly drops one drop at a time.</li>
            <li> A refreshing aroma. Not heavy. Used in a muscle ache blend. Also heard that Copaiba can aid in healing melanoma.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell if it works</li>
            <li> it has a nice cedar-like aroma..very comforting.  I like to massage it on sore joints and recommend it for that.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pure and for any condition, it&#x27;s suitable to use internal or external for a healthier body, etc.</li>
            <li> Good product. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!!!  I&#x27;m new to essential oils and I was still a little skeptical.  But this stuff is awesome!!  We have used it for my husbands basketball knee, my granny back and my grandson&#x27;s teething pain.  It works!!! I will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden oils.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil - I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Another great oil at a great price. This is a really nice line. and you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Works really well for what I use it for. Its great</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Copaiba.... The way it worked was miraculous.  Thought I would give edens garden a try since price was so much less.  Truth is, you get what you pay for.... It smells terrible and it does not have the same miraculous effects of other brands.  Very disappointed.  Should have read ALL of the reviews.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is extremely thick and very hard to get it to drip out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great quality  for the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> I give this product a rating of excellent for quality. The bottle sealed when I received. The oil really smells great. It smells pure and powerful.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used  it for anything in particular so far  but looking up the purpose of it, saw it on line and thought I would get it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil for any skin irritation.  It is a must for your collection!  LOVE EDEN&#x27;S Garden-their packaging is great!  Have already ordered again and will do so when I add more oils.  Great pricing and quality!!</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil. Need to order more. It is very good!!</li>
            <li> I agree, the initial smell is sort of like opening a sweet pickle jar and getting a casual whiff! It almost felt like it had bits of that &#x27;vinegar&#x27; warmth that you get when you smell it (without the actual strength of vinegar, don&#x27;t worry) mixed with sugar. I would almost dare to say sort of like a light honey-balsalmic dressing (YUM) or something. But in no way did it actually &#x27;curl my toes&#x27; like some other strong scents from this product line when opening the bottle.  It says on the bottle that it works as a fixitive to make other scents last longer when combined, and is a base note (which means it can combine with almost anything). I plan on using this in making my soaps!</li>
            <li> Love, great shipping~!</li>
            <li> This oil is new to me and the jury is still out on if it is working or not.  I am hoping it helps my inflammation.</li>
            <li> Have used this for nerve pain and us great</li>
            <li> I received this after I bought the Ultimate Set from Edens Garden - Thank you Edens Garden ;)&lt;br /&gt;I had wanted it as I heard it increased shelf life if mixed with other oils and, most importantly, it helped with inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells a little odd.  Sweet pickles would be the closest, but there&#x27;s a sweet undertone that makes it quite pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago, my knee became extremely swollen, for two days, morning and night, I massaged it mixed with jojoba oil and the swelling is gone!  I took nothing except the copaiba.  My chiropractor was able to adjust it much easier without the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I also put it on my face in the mornings (mixed with Geranium) and since I&#x27;ve been using it, ZERO breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great oil and Edens Garden is a super price (it&#x27;s 13x the price from a competitor).&lt;br /&gt;Besides the wonky droppers, I can only say good things about Edens Garden and their high quality oils!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered several oils from edens garden and I have been pleased each time. The products are high quality. The oils are packaged well and a very informative little brochure comes with each order.</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil to use for my mother-in-law to help with her cancer. It is wonderful and a great price from Eden&#x27;s Garden. Copaiba is such an amazing essential oil and it is not sold very many places. I love Edens Garden. They have great products for great prices. I would recommend ordering from them again and again.</li>
            <li> Item was a great find at a great price.  This item is usually hard to find and was so excited to find it at a great price.  Arrived early and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Compared to another brand this one was a bit runny and more diluted in feel and look.  I did not throw this out when I found one of better quality, but I am using it in other ways then the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!! highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Seems like a high quality oil. It helps with painful neck tension and resulting tension headaches. Fantastic price, too. It arrived right on time. My only complaint is that it is very difficult to dispense. I can only get a very tiny amount out at a time and it requires a considerable amount of messing with the opening. Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, but there were no instructions as to how to use it. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other brands.</li>
            <li> Good quality , very light aroma good blend with other oils.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> I used this on my shoulder that was hurting from an old injury. It did the trick. I was amazed how fast the pain was gone. I used it when needed for a couple weeks. Now I am not using it at all. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> this oil is quite lovely and goes with almost all the oils i have, and really well too! it does have a honey aroma like it says but to me it almost smells just a bit tea-ish... i put it in any/all homemade skin care products!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the smell</li>
