    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>wont leave your skin sticky or greasy.its just perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>I did not get one stretch mark and absolutely loved this cream!</li>
            <li>, it makes a very good work and smells so good.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>These parabens can be very hazardous especially to pregnant women.</li>
            <li>Oh and the scent is light, and the cream absorbs perfectly into skin.</li>
            <li>This product has not been a good solution</li>
            <li>so far,so good. :)</li>
            <li>because I had used it before and really liked it</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I delivered to write a review because i wanted to be able to give good feedback for those who do research just like me.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I also wanted to be able to be a reliable review and we&#x27;ll ladies this product did not work.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs better, doesn&#x27;t smell, and I&#x27;m at 36 weeks with no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for most of my pregnancy</li>
            <li>Just thought y&#x27;all would like to know. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant and love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Many of the people gave high reviews based on the smell of the cream, but I did not buy it for the good smell</li>
            <li>now they are fading to a light tan/pinkish color.</li>
            <li>I only purchased one jar and used Palmers throughout my pregnancy which was just great.</li>
            <li>So far, I have loved this cream.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>My skin is soo soft and nice and the smell is fabulous ;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with tan skin, my stretch marks are usually a bright reddish/purple color</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it really works for stretch marks yet, but I&#x27;m sure if you use it twice a day you have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really believe that any product can prevent stretch marks; it&#x27;s more genetics and the rate at which you gain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good genes or this product, but I haven&#x27;t gotten even one stretch mark on my belly, boobs, hips or lower back!</li>
            <li>am now about 6 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am now 7months pregnant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super luxurious-feeling, leaving your belly feeling moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 21 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant with my son and daughter</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li>I used this cream daily and so far so good!</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also fast and well packaged !</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing she likes it really well.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even go in detail about smell or texture because all that really matters is stretchmark prevention.</li>
            <li>Not by much</li>
            <li>Trilastin worked just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>If you look at the other stretch mark cream out on the market, many make it a point to say they are Paraben-free.</li>
            <li>While the tub doesn&#x27;t last long, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this stretch mark cream based on high reviews at around 5 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream for my wife right before she entered her second trimester.</li>
            <li>I love this product , I used it my whole 9 months of pregnancy and only got 2 small stretch marks , my skin would stay moisturized all day and night</li>
            <li>My baby is now a year old.</li>
            <li>Purchased this cream on the high reviews it got, but when I received it, the ingredients listed 5 various parabens, including Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, and Isobutylparaben.</li>
            <li>This maternity cream has done wonders I am 7 months pregnant and have a few stretch marks on both sides of my hip.</li>
            <li>I wish I had not spent on this product.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product long enough to see if it prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I  have been using it everyday twice or more a day depending on how tight or hard my stomach gets.</li>
            <li> and I have no new stretch marks</li>
            <li> When I bought this cream I thought it was going to erase or at least stop the appearances of new strech marks on my 7 months pregnancy belly.</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend anyone else to spend so much for little results!!!</li>
            <li> I have never really gained or lost a drastic amount of weight.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> (I think I&#x27;ve gone through half a dozen).</li>
            <li> And this cream I haven&#x27;t got any at all and the little ones I do have from my previous pregnancies are fading.</li>
            <li> They were lightening up and smoothing down!</li>
            <li> -)&lt;br /&gt;I was using it everyday twice.in the morning</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what they will look like a few months from now.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and sticky like other creams, almost no smell, stopped the itchy belly, and ended up with hardly any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 7 1/2 months and just started to notice 3 small growing stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> but this product is cheaper at Trilastin.com, at least today it is.</li>
            <li> I guess there is not much you can do when your belly is expanding:(</li>
            <li> bucks is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive yet did not serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on purchasing it because every stretch mark cream/oil I&#x27;ve tried has failed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Silly me!!</li>

            <li> I just received it today and it smells sooooo good.it&#x27;s something between lotion and cream so it absorbs into your skin easily.it wont leave your skin sticky or greasy.its just perfect consistency. I can&#x27;t tell if it really works for stretch marks yet, but I&#x27;m sure if you use it twice a day you have nothing to worry about.I recommend it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sept.2012&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for entire pregnancy and 1month after and I love it.no stretch marks at all!!! My skin is soo soft and nice and the smell is fabulous ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I was using it everyday twice.in the morning and in the evening.just.</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost 2 weeks ago. I was hesitant on purchasing it because every stretch mark cream/oil I&#x27;ve tried has failed! Thank goodness I came across it! I wanted to purchase trilastin-sr but 80+ bucks is way too expensive. This maternity cream has done wonders I am 7 months pregnant and have a few stretch marks on both sides of my hip. After using it for 3 days, twice daily I noticed some improvement! They were lightening up and smoothing down! And they still are! They are no longer an eye sore to look at. I know this is a prevention cream but I feel as though it is getting rid of my current stretch marks. I&#x27;m Asian with tan skin, my stretch marks are usually a bright reddish/purple color now they are fading to a light tan/pinkish color. I can&#x27;t wait to see what they will look like a few months from now. I definitely recommend this product! Oh and the scent is light, and the cream absorbs perfectly into skin.</li>
            <li> [Pre-Pregnancy] I am a petite person, size 0-2. I have never really gained or lost a drastic amount of weight.&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and me are terrified of stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I am now about 6 months pregnant. I used this cream daily and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Just started using Trilastin Prevention cream a month ago. I am now 7months pregnant and i still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. so far,so good. :)</li>
            <li> My daughter is actually the one who uses it and I believe she is on her third jar .... so I&#x27;m guessing she likes it really well.  I let you know AFTER the baby gets here to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to post a review and I am finally doing it. I used this cream my entire pregnancy. My baby is now a year old. I did not get one stretch mark and absolutely loved this cream! I was debating between this and creme de la mer because I had used it before and really liked it but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money . Trilastin worked just as good if not better! I would highly recommend! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my wife right before she entered her second trimester. Kept using this product twice a day until we identified stretch marks on her belly in the third trimester. The product is expensive yet did not serve its purpose. I wish I had not spent on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this stretch mark cream based on high reviews at around 5 months. I  have been using it everyday twice or more a day depending on how tight or hard my stomach gets. I&#x27;m now 7 1/2 months and just started to notice 3 small growing stretchmarks. I wanted to wait until I delivered to write a review because i wanted to be able to give good feedback for those who do research just like me. I also wanted to be able to be a reliable review and we&#x27;ll ladies this product did not work. I won&#x27;t even go in detail about smell or texture because all that really matters is stretchmark prevention. This product has not been a good solution and I would not recommend anyone else to spend so much for little results!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product long enough to see if it prevent stretch marks. I didn&#x27;t like the smell. I ended up switching to an oil made by Nivea. The oil absorbs better, doesn&#x27;t smell, and I&#x27;m at 36 weeks with no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So far, I have loved this cream. It&#x27;s super luxurious-feeling, leaving your belly feeling moisturized all day. I&#x27;m 26 weeks and no stretch marks yet, but I guess there&#x27;s still time. I also don&#x27;t really believe that any product can prevent stretch marks; it&#x27;s more genetics and the rate at which you gain. But this reduces the itchiness!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and sticky like other creams, almost no smell, stopped the itchy belly, and ended up with hardly any stretch marks.  WORTH THE PRICE.  I used 2 containers</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I have no new stretch marks and I&#x27;m 21 weeks pregnant. When I was pregnant with my son and daughter I used cocoa butter cream and that stuff did not work for me. I got some stretch marks with it. And this cream I haven&#x27;t got any at all and the little ones I do have from my previous pregnancies are fading. I&#x27;m going on my 2nd TriLASTIN cream! I highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li> I love this product , I used it my whole 9 months of pregnancy and only got 2 small stretch marks , my skin would stay moisturized all day and night, I would apply it in the morning and before bed , My skin would never itch , I would recommend this product to any expecting mother !! Shipping was also fast and well packaged !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for most of my pregnancy (I think I&#x27;ve gone through half a dozen). While the tub doesn&#x27;t last long, the results are amazing. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good genes or this product, but I haven&#x27;t gotten even one stretch mark on my belly, boobs, hips or lower back! I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant and love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Purchased this cream on the high reviews it got, but when I received it, the ingredients listed 5 various parabens, including Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, and Isobutylparaben. These parabens can be very hazardous especially to pregnant women. If you look at the other stretch mark cream out on the market, many make it a point to say they are Paraben-free. It&#x27;s too bad I didn&#x27;t look for that in this product. I assumed it was since it was so pricey! Silly me!!</li>
            <li> Not by much but this product is cheaper at Trilastin.com, at least today it is. Just thought y&#x27;all would like to know. :)</li>
            <li> When I bought this cream I thought it was going to erase or at least stop the appearances of new strech marks on my 7 months pregnancy belly. It did neither. Many of the people gave high reviews based on the smell of the cream, but I did not buy it for the good smell, I bought it because I wanted to see results which I didn´t get. I guess there is not much you can do when your belly is expanding:(</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the price.  I only purchased one jar and used Palmers throughout my pregnancy which was just great.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife pregnancy and we try a lot of cream for the stretch mark and after we try a lot of them she say this is the one, it makes a very good work and smells so good.</li>
