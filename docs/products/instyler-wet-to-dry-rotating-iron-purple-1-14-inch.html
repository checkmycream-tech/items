            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has some nice features, great instructions and works well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that it worked that good</li>
            <li>Gives a good deal of waves and creates volume.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, however, I can leave it a bit damp and get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>

            <li>My girlfriend loved it.</li>

            <li>Good straightener.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used the original instyler which belongs to a friend, it worked great!</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this, but wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Still love the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li>My damaged hair looks healthy!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this tool!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This is amazing  </li>
            <li>I think that is really makes her hair look great!  </li>
            <li>I liked how the rotating iron made my hair look.</li>
            <li>I liked how the barrel smoothed my hair and curled the ends.</li>
            <li>InStyler site has video tips that show how to use this tool best, and they are very helpful.</li>
            <li>the videos for the unit aren&#x27;t exactly enthusiastic about you using the InStyler as a dryer, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kit includes a nice carry bag, a sectioning comb, and a protective, snap on shield.</li>
            <li>was wonderful and I highly prefer that to this, but, they stopped manufacturing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came early and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Better use liquid ones like TRESemmé Heat Tamer Spray.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased the irons, I told the lady on the phone that this was a Christmas gift and would not be used until after Christmas which was more than 30 days out.</li>
            <li>The lady told me she could not refund me because it was more than 30 days out.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but maybe I need to read the directions more closely.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love my in styler....</li>
            <li>love how its does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li>This is when the iron started redeeming itself a bit, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>And with practice, I got better at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the owners manual and follow the tips, our you could end up with tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I haven’t yet mastered the ability to make ringlet curls with this tool, but I have really liked the way it produces smooth body for my hair (see uploaded</li>
            <li>It worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>It does everything it claims and more.</li>
            <li>The instyler is so much better</li>
            <li>I can see better results in my hair by using it.</li>
            <li>I was just ok.  </li>
            <li>Blow dryer works better and faster for my type hair.</li>
            <li>I love the shine it gave my hair and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li>Will buy again unless I find a better product.</li>
            <li>I love my InStyler.</li>
            <li>the swiveling cord that I love - no tangling or kinking where the cord meets the unit</li>
            <li>the InStyler Max has on top of that is:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Single-purpose appliances do a better job</li>
            <li>I love this tool.  </li>
            <li>(Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to shave off sometime</li>
            <li>after I use it more, who knows).  </li>
            <li>I am sure working with the Instyler more</li>
            <li>It did straighten and was able to get the wave at the bottom as part of the style</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>she love it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even perfect for my short hair that I have now (around my shoulder length).</li>
            <li>ne more.</li>
            <li>i love this iron.</li>
            <li>it even works better then</li>
            <li>i love the shine my hair has when i am done using it although i also use heat protector products when i do anything with irons of any sort or blow dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pretty good system.  </li>
            <li>BUT it works best on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>1.25\\&quot; barrel seems to be at its best creating loose, flowing curls.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair easily and leaves a natural and beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>It heats up to your setting in under a minute and is easy to use without tugging or pulling on hair.</li>
            <li>Easily reversible direction of rotation on the barrel -</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, followed the directions</li>
            <li>it’s easy to accidentally hit the off button.  </li>
            <li>If you accidentally hit it again, (which is so easy to do)</li>
            <li>/&gt;InStyler provides a removable cool tip that screws into the end of the barrel, which is nice to get a better hold of the hot appliance while you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides that works fine.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Both probably helped my hair look shinier than without, but the Ionic Hot Brush was easier to use and, thus, made me feel like I had more control, allowing me to shape my hair better.</li>
            <li>but it was doing fine then yesterday</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- 3 heat settings (fine, medium, coarse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally fine straight/ a lil wavy hair)</li>
            <li>i do my hair section by section and it has worked perfectly fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure that over time I will get more advanced in how I use this but for the time being having my hair look smooth when I dry it is a very good start.</li>
            <li>The handle is cool to the touch, the cord has a generous length, and the comb section is just the right length to be effective without snagging or tangling.</li>
            <li>wish it did work because to be able to curl slightly wet hair would be a great convenience.</li>
            <li>now i have the perfect hair day everyday, no frizzy baby hairs flying arround for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>The curling iron is well built and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting to have the smooth, silky look which I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>My hair is very wavy and not the nice wavy hair you see on tv</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don’t feel that the spinning brush does much except make sounds.  </li>
            <li>The curling function is just so-so (for my hair), but since I really like the all-in-one capabilities of this product, I am still, overall, impressed with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SUPER DOPER COOL love it</li>
            <li>brush at the end is a nice feature, and the quality of construction is high.  </li>
            <li>instructions are easy to read and come with pictures which do a good job explaining how to properly use this.</li>
            <li>InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush gave my hair better results.  </li>
            <li>I have used the original for years</li>
            <li>If I could do it all over again, I would order the original instyler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used InStyler before, and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I also love that you can curl or flip the ends for a really pretty look.</li>
            <li>a styling tool, it works as well as most of the ones that I have, but at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Anything tighter will require a bit more technique and effort but even for those first getting accustomed to the styler you&#x27;ll have no problems producing decent/acceptable results and can gradually work your way up to expanded styling options as your familiarity with the product increases.</li>
            <li>and I think it infuses my hair with the oil and WEN because my curly/kinky/frizzy fine hair (I am white with &amp;#34;Ethnic&amp;#34; hair) comes out GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves how easy it is to use!  </li>
            <li>electric cord is nice and long which is a great feature for being able to move around and use this and accommodate being in the bathroom and not be immediately next to the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However it does work great on my damp to dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>The swivel cord helps a lot specially when you switch sides.</li>
            <li>I paid in full  ($154.00) instead of taking the payment option.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but I was still able to put a bit of body in there.</li>
            <li>out that that&#x27;s not quite true.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re patient, you have a good amount of arm strength, and your hair is on the longish side, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall a really good investment.</li>
            <li>and it actually feels like it&#x27;s good for my hair.</li>
            <li>It seems more gentle.</li>
            <li>No issues I observed with catching hair, either on my above-shoulder length or a family member&#x27;s near waist-length</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, and with practice I will be able to use it for curls as well (</li>
            <li>and I had to let it cool.</li>
            <li>I still have to put this down to separate the piece hair I want to use it on and then pick it up again, but my hair looks surprisingly good -- and definitely better than with</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, heats up quickly, and makes my hair feel bouncy and pretty.</li>
            <li>The other great thing about this InStyler is that you can use it on damp towel-dried hair to help finish the drying and styling all at once.</li>
            <li>the price on this styler is a bit steep, so make sure you can use as many of these features as possible.</li>
            <li>just how quick it was to style my hair with this.</li>
            <li>I love it, recommend it, and will purchase more as gifts in the future.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair that takes forever to straighten.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth and straight or even smooth and curly.</li>
            <li>hair has to be barely damp for this to work effectively.</li>
            <li>I have never used heat protectant with this instyler and my hair still looks very healthy and I have almost no split ends at all (same as before).</li>
            <li>So fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>it works good to dry and straighten, but I feel like it made my hair frizzy (i used leave in conditioner and heat protectant spray) and couldn&#x27;t reach my roots.</li>
            <li>Now on not-in-the-least-damp hair, dry hair, it does fairly well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a cool concept, and it actually did get my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will be trying her&#x27;s out, to see if it does my old hair as good as it does young hair!  </li>
            <li>However, I feel the hold of the product on my hair from top to the ends was slightly loose even when I used more hair.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair very shiny and smooth, and I have gotten quite a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair and used my straightener to smooth my hair and add volume.</li>
            <li>Is good but not to try it in wet</li>
            <li>I have a very curly (frizzy and troublesome...) section of hair on the very top of my head, and that section was a bit more difficult to straighten, but it still did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>It lacks the power to properly pull and curl hair and it takes forever to warm</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall, this styler does a good job drying out your hair and a proper run through of your strands will always produce a healthy looking sheen with noticeable volume lift.</li>
            <li>it worked best if I used it on slightly damp hair, not wet hair.</li>
            <li>and delivery was also super fast!</li>
            <li>In other words, if you are just looking for a straightener, you can find something else that&#x27;s cheaper and just as good.</li>
            <li>The barrel turns outward when held in the right hand, so it causes the curls to want to flip out instead of under.</li>
            <li>A good iron to dry your hair and straighten it at the same, also love the fact that you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level.</li>
            <li>i got the waves all over the place hot mess kind of waves!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, worth the money!</li>
            <li>Once you have your own system down, everything is cool.  </li>
            <li>comes with a Thermal Guard  training aid which is recommended for use when you are first getting used to this iron.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush over this tool.  </li>
            <li>As a curling iron, it’s pretty meh.</li>
            <li>It does get pretty hot, so you&#x27;ll want to watch where you are placing your fingers.</li>
            <li>This is my fourth one and love them.</li>
            <li>Love the In-Styler, but I see no difference in this one and the regular one.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Just an overall better look and \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Wait for a sale, or go ahead and buy the Wet-to-Dry&#x27;s more robust big brother, with the reversible barrel.to \\&quot;four</li>
            <li>Wait for a sale, or go ahead and buy the Wet-to-Dry&#x27;s more robust big brother, with the reversible barrel.</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li>A really cute mix of white and purple.</li>
            <li>A couple of things to be aware of before buying -</li>
            <li>can’t say for sure if the Instyler is better than a traditional flat iron or not.  </li>
            <li>and this took more time than blow drying and using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a flat iron I love it.</li>
            <li>think I’ll have the curling technique down with some more practice, but for now I use it primarily to create nearly straight hair that is curled under for body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and for me the InStyler Wet to Dry worked best at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>when they say &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34; they DO NOT mean straight out the shower without even quick ring out</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and its so fast to style!</li>
            <li>Great idea but not good for thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to try this product for so long and read many reviews on it before deciding to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Long hair would take more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much that eventually I put away my flat iron I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>I have an older InStyler hair tool and have liked it, so when I saw the InStyler Wet</li>
            <li>There are videos on youtube you can watch that might help, but, what it boils down to is that you have to find your own groove with it.  </li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s a lot of it) hair to the kind of heat for the kind of time it takes to dry even one small section that&#x27;s already damp-dry, and</li>
            <li>dry hair works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly used it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li>, it works very much like my older InStyler, where the friction from the heated barrel provides the drying effect.</li>
            <li>It is a great styler for dry hair, but not for wet hair.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li>The videos on the InStyler site recommend towel drying your hair as much as possible for the best results; in the video, it looks like the model’s hair is only slightly damp.</li>
            <li>Oh, also, you can’t touch the end of the barrel to steady the device; it gets hot (and it</li>
            <li>, it makes the hair look shiny and amazing, and you can twist it just a little at the tip to do a turn in or out.</li>
            <li>Work good but hard to use</li>
            <li>powered on, an amber light illuminates, and shortly thereafter, the iron is nearly instantly ready to be put to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did it and really didnt like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It has made styling my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are very helpful.</li>
            <li>This style is much safer to use, I found no worries of hair getting entangled</li>
            <li>Fast forward to yesterday (1/5/15).</li>
            <li>Works really well for straightening and drying.  </li>
            <li>it was to much work to get a straight look.  </li>
            <li>It is very unhandy and doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the ease of use with this.</li>
            <li>InStyler really means damp-to-dry.</li>
            <li>so you have to REALLY hold it until your hand cramps.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and untameable hair.</li>
            <li>You really can’t skip blow drying by using this product.</li>
            <li>I think so much heat would be damaging, too.</li>
            <li>That would make it much easier to use.</li>
            <li>to the wet feature, this is merely okay.  </li>
            <li>I had been eyeballing an InStyler for quite awhile, but was turned off by the whole &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; hype of it as I haven&#x27;t had much luck with those types of items.</li>
            <li>If I want it really well styled I can go over it again</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My wife reports that this device works very well.</li>
            <li>- you can hold the unit however is comfortable and just reverse the rotation with a double \\&quot;click closed\\&quot; of the brush and barrel&lt;</li>
            <li>though I prefer the straight).</li>
            <li>I expected more than I should have from this product</li>
            <li>Dries hair really well, curls and flips need hairspray though.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well</li>
            <li>and I got my hair curled and straightened much faster than I ever had before.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;ve done demos for friends and family.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this instyler to anyone with very unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>the Instyler makes my bangs and hair frizzy and seems to take to much time to get my hair as straight as I want it to be.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work how is said takes to much time</li>
            <li>BUT when i use this iron my hair comes out so soft, smooth, and straight but not pin straight like a natural looking straight</li>
            <li>This works best on damp hair, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a wet to dry styler because you can&#x27;t even use it on wet hair,</li>
            <li>It is so much better than a regular flat iron - it leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, but with volume like you would get from blowdrying your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that accounts for the Max straightening more quickly and with greater ease, but even comparing the lowest heat on the Max to the middle speed on the Wet to Dry</li>
            <li>I finally got something right!</li>
            <li>This works fairly well, however, the “wet to dry” thing proved (with me anyway) to be a joke.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, her hair looks better than it did when she used her previous straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely would have returned it if I had done so within the proper time frame, but I kept hoping that it was more user error...</li>
            <li>Actually they make a similar product which you can reverse the barrel rotation, which is a better choice because it is easier to maneuver around your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product works and it&#x27;s a decent option.</li>
            <li>I always feel like I don&#x27;t have enough hands to be able to work the blow dryer and brush at the same time</li>
            <li>You also have to make sure there aren’t any tangles in your hair, because the stiff bristles aren’t very forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>high setting is for damp hair and works quite well.</li>
            <li>passes on high.</li>
            <li>High heat is 410 degrees.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone, for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of crazy hearing your hair snap, crackle and pop when it&#x27;s wet and getting dried, but it really does a great job of drying my hair while lightly styling it with just the one pass.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used this on dry clean wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I really like it and am pleasantly surprised by the time it saves me in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It gives me great volume on the crown and works just as quickly as my expensive straighter.</li>
            <li>If you turn the iron over, its easier to get the brush to pass thru the section that just went over the barrel, which adds to the shine and corrects the issue of barrel spin, but makes the flip under a bit more tricky (I usually to the tips twice, once for straight and shiny, then turn the device over for the flip under).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wet hair feature is okay, as in practice it just barely works.  </li>
            <li>Normally, straightening my hair can take over an hour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that effective in comparison to using it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>But that was a baseline model without the new additions of being able to style your hair and dry it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this product I was able to be done in less then 30 minutes with results better than with my other flat iron.</li>
            <li>The rotating barrel is new</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m satisfied enough with the results to keep using it, even though it takes twice as long as the blow dryer!  </li>
            <li>To Dry Rotating Iron, Purple, 1-14 Inch, I was very interested in trying it.</li>
            <li>I could I would give it 4.5 stars, for the amazing shine and straight, taking away half a star for awkwardness of other functions.</li>
            <li>for the curling feature of this iron, I thought it was pretty solid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The iron gets sufficiently hot with the 3 different heat settings.</li>
            <li>and WOW I couldn&#x27;t believe the results EVEN AFTER SLEEPING!</li>
            <li>I had actually ordered my first Instyler via television</li>
            <li>This has removed the blow dryer step completely!</li>
            <li>the delivery was super fast and omg this adds so much volume to the hair, unbelievable.</li>
            <li>My niece spends half the day messing around with these things, so I take it they&#x27;re engaging.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how it tries to straighten the ends either because it pulls it out really quick.</li>
            <li>but you have to be extremely careful or you will burn yourself really quick, which I did.  </li>
            <li>I used the InSytler on dry hair right before I went to bed - I just had to try it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never actually used it on wet hair because I wash may hair at night, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work right out of the shower, but it works really well for my hair (fine &amp; straight)</li>
            <li>I think the tool makes the curling process more difficult than it needs to be, but if you are looking for an all-in-one product, it might be worth the extra effort to be able to pack less in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is fine as a styling tool, but as far as the &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; concept goes, it&#x27;s a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li>so I like it better on medium and even then it only takes 3 passes to dry &amp; style with our without my argon oil flat iron spray.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>used this on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s non-relaxed curly hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was surprised to hear how favorably my wife stated the system</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t go far exploring the drying feature of this unit.</li>
            <li>but so far so</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised that this has replaced my hair straightener.</li>
            <li>I still use my old straightener from walmart bc</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to my blow dryer, dried my hair most of the way, and then went back to the iron.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair or my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  </li>
            <li>suppose I could have just used it at the high temp, sizzle and all, but the potential damage bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, a little beyond my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Pieces seemed to start getting loose after first week of use</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of getting my wet hair dry; I have thick wavy hair and just towel drying before using this InStyler doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>First, the instructions make it clear that your hair shouldn&#x27;t be wet</li>
            <li>This is a solidly constructed iron; its ergonomic body, and firm bristles provide wet to dry styling for big, beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>You hit it once for low, twice for medium and three times for the high setting.  </li>
            <li>Major brownie points!</li>
            <li>The whole appeal for me was to get out of the shower, not waste time blow-drying and style my hair with the time it would take to dry it instead.</li>
            <li>Single pass nice and slow</li>
            <li>Wrap your hair in a towel turbin while you get dressed and do your normal lotion/deodorant routine and it dries it quite enough in that</li>
            <li>It will take you a while to love it, it was very hard to use the first few times and it gets really</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be better than the regular instyler, but the wet to dry simply isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It works, and for dry hair it works really well.  </li>
            <li>The holding mechanism is not strong enough for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For one, the “Wet to Dry” part of the name isn’t true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m concerned about subjecting my fine but thick</li>
            <li>The iron heats up to a max of around 410 degrees pretty quickly and has a few settings to get less heat if desired.</li>
            <li>BUYER BEWARE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the two for one deal back in November 2014 for my wife directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>And my hair was barely wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color white also makes it look professional</li>
            <li>This InStyler Wet to Dry Rotating Iron is a thoughtfully designed heat utensil that makes me wonder how I managed to go so long without one.</li>
            <li>Everything about this tool feels precision crafted, no loose or wobbly parts, no creaky housing.</li>
            <li>These include the need to towel dry first to get your hair as dry as possible.  </li>
            <li>To straighten my entire head, it took just over 30 minutes which was much quicker than other stylers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This works only on damp hair, not wet hair.  </li>
            <li>it is the only way to go whether you need low settings medium settings or to dry your hair with the high settings.</li>
            <li>I have very course curly hair that takes me forever to do because I usually shower and go, without much time to do my hair or to dry it.</li>
            <li>This InStyler rotating styler makes it explicitly clear in it&#x27;s instructions (and product labels) to towel dry your hair first as thoroughly as possible in order to take advantage of the &#x27;wet to dry&#x27; functionality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whose hair it does work well in, but it&#x27;s not the right product for the people in my family.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough to reach outlets far away from the surface you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>Just make sure there’s tension in the hair when pulling it down the hair and that you pull it slowly.  </li>
            <li>I’m not a morning person, and I wash my hair every day, so the wet to dry feature was really why I wanted this</li>
            <li>My wife used this multiple times and reported that the wet feature was thoughtful but would fail because her hair would consistently slip and come out and cause her to basically have to stop and try over again to get the iron going again.  </li>

            <li> It has some nice features, great instructions and works well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it worked that good</li>
            <li> Gives a good deal of waves and creates volume.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side, however, I can leave it a bit damp and get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>

            <li> My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> and she loved it</li>
            <li> but this might be a good choice for travel.</li>
            <li> Good straightener.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used the original instyler which belongs to a friend, it worked great!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this, but wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Still love the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li> My damaged hair looks healthy!</li>

            <li> Love this tool!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing  </li>
            <li> I think that is really makes her hair look great!  </li>
            <li> I liked how the rotating iron made my hair look.</li>
            <li> I liked how the barrel smoothed my hair and curled the ends.</li>
            <li> InStyler site has video tips that show how to use this tool best, and they are very helpful.</li>
            <li> the videos for the unit aren&#x27;t exactly enthusiastic about you using the InStyler as a dryer, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> kit includes a nice carry bag, a sectioning comb, and a protective, snap on shield.</li>
            <li> was wonderful and I highly prefer that to this, but, they stopped manufacturing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came early and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Better use liquid ones like TRESemmé Heat Tamer Spray.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased the irons, I told the lady on the phone that this was a Christmas gift and would not be used until after Christmas which was more than 30 days out.</li>
            <li> The lady told me she could not refund me because it was more than 30 days out.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but maybe I need to read the directions more closely.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love my in styler....</li>
            <li> love how its does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> This is when the iron started redeeming itself a bit, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> And with practice, I got better at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the owners manual and follow the tips, our you could end up with tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I haven’t yet mastered the ability to make ringlet curls with this tool, but I have really liked the way it produces smooth body for my hair (see uploaded</li>
            <li> It worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It does everything it claims and more.</li>
            <li> The instyler is so much better</li>
            <li> I can see better results in my hair by using it.</li>
            <li> I was just ok.  </li>
            <li> Blow dryer works better and faster for my type hair.</li>
            <li> I love the shine it gave my hair and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li> Will buy again unless I find a better product.</li>
            <li> I love my InStyler.</li>
            <li> the swiveling cord that I love - no tangling or kinking where the cord meets the unit</li>
            <li> the InStyler Max has on top of that is:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Single-purpose appliances do a better job</li>
            <li> I love this tool.  </li>
            <li> (Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to shave off sometime</li>
            <li> after I use it more, who knows).  </li>
            <li> I am sure working with the Instyler more</li>
            <li> It did straighten and was able to get the wave at the bottom as part of the style</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> she love it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even perfect for my short hair that I have now (around my shoulder length).</li>
            <li> ne more.</li>
            <li> i love this iron.</li>
            <li> it even works better then</li>
            <li> i love the shine my hair has when i am done using it although i also use heat protector products when i do anything with irons of any sort or blow dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a pretty good system.  </li>
            <li> BUT it works best on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> 1.25\\&quot; barrel seems to be at its best creating loose, flowing curls.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair easily and leaves a natural and beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> It heats up to your setting in under a minute and is easy to use without tugging or pulling on hair.</li>
            <li> Easily reversible direction of rotation on the barrel -</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, followed the directions</li>
            <li> it’s easy to accidentally hit the off button.  </li>
            <li> If you accidentally hit it again, (which is so easy to do)</li>
            <li> /&gt;InStyler provides a removable cool tip that screws into the end of the barrel, which is nice to get a better hold of the hot appliance while you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides that works fine.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Both probably helped my hair look shinier than without, but the Ionic Hot Brush was easier to use and, thus, made me feel like I had more control, allowing me to shape my hair better.</li>
            <li> but it was doing fine then yesterday</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- 3 heat settings (fine, medium, coarse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally fine straight/ a lil wavy hair)</li>
            <li> i do my hair section by section and it has worked perfectly fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure that over time I will get more advanced in how I use this but for the time being having my hair look smooth when I dry it is a very good start.</li>
            <li> The handle is cool to the touch, the cord has a generous length, and the comb section is just the right length to be effective without snagging or tangling.</li>
            <li> wish it did work because to be able to curl slightly wet hair would be a great convenience.</li>
            <li> now i have the perfect hair day everyday, no frizzy baby hairs flying arround for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> The curling iron is well built and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting to have the smooth, silky look which I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy and not the nice wavy hair you see on tv</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don’t feel that the spinning brush does much except make sounds.  </li>
            <li> The curling function is just so-so (for my hair), but since I really like the all-in-one capabilities of this product, I am still, overall, impressed with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SUPER DOPER COOL love it</li>
            <li> brush at the end is a nice feature, and the quality of construction is high.  </li>
            <li> instructions are easy to read and come with pictures which do a good job explaining how to properly use this.</li>
            <li> InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush gave my hair better results.  </li>
            <li> I have used the original for years</li>
            <li> If I could do it all over again, I would order the original instyler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used InStyler before, and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I also love that you can curl or flip the ends for a really pretty look.</li>
            <li> a styling tool, it works as well as most of the ones that I have, but at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Anything tighter will require a bit more technique and effort but even for those first getting accustomed to the styler you&#x27;ll have no problems producing decent/acceptable results and can gradually work your way up to expanded styling options as your familiarity with the product increases.</li>
            <li> and I think it infuses my hair with the oil and WEN because my curly/kinky/frizzy fine hair (I am white with &amp;#34;Ethnic&amp;#34; hair) comes out GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves how easy it is to use!  </li>
            <li> electric cord is nice and long which is a great feature for being able to move around and use this and accommodate being in the bathroom and not be immediately next to the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However it does work great on my damp to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> The swivel cord helps a lot specially when you switch sides.</li>
            <li> I paid in full  ($154.00) instead of taking the payment option.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but I was still able to put a bit of body in there.</li>
            <li> out that that&#x27;s not quite true.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re patient, you have a good amount of arm strength, and your hair is on the longish side, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall a really good investment.</li>
            <li> and it actually feels like it&#x27;s good for my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems more gentle.</li>
            <li> No issues I observed with catching hair, either on my above-shoulder length or a family member&#x27;s near waist-length</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, and with practice I will be able to use it for curls as well (</li>
            <li> and I had to let it cool.</li>
            <li> I still have to put this down to separate the piece hair I want to use it on and then pick it up again, but my hair looks surprisingly good -- and definitely better than with</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, heats up quickly, and makes my hair feel bouncy and pretty.</li>
            <li> The other great thing about this InStyler is that you can use it on damp towel-dried hair to help finish the drying and styling all at once.</li>
            <li> the price on this styler is a bit steep, so make sure you can use as many of these features as possible.</li>
            <li> just how quick it was to style my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I love it, recommend it, and will purchase more as gifts in the future.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair that takes forever to straighten.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth and straight or even smooth and curly.</li>
            <li> hair has to be barely damp for this to work effectively.</li>
            <li> I have never used heat protectant with this instyler and my hair still looks very healthy and I have almost no split ends at all (same as before).</li>
            <li> So fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> it works good to dry and straighten, but I feel like it made my hair frizzy (i used leave in conditioner and heat protectant spray) and couldn&#x27;t reach my roots.</li>
            <li> Now on not-in-the-least-damp hair, dry hair, it does fairly well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a cool concept, and it actually did get my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will be trying her&#x27;s out, to see if it does my old hair as good as it does young hair!  </li>
            <li> However, I feel the hold of the product on my hair from top to the ends was slightly loose even when I used more hair.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair very shiny and smooth, and I have gotten quite a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li> I have straight hair and used my straightener to smooth my hair and add volume.</li>
            <li> Is good but not to try it in wet</li>
            <li> I have a very curly (frizzy and troublesome...) section of hair on the very top of my head, and that section was a bit more difficult to straighten, but it still did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> It lacks the power to properly pull and curl hair and it takes forever to warm</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall, this styler does a good job drying out your hair and a proper run through of your strands will always produce a healthy looking sheen with noticeable volume lift.</li>
            <li> it worked best if I used it on slightly damp hair, not wet hair.</li>
            <li> and delivery was also super fast!</li>
            <li> In other words, if you are just looking for a straightener, you can find something else that&#x27;s cheaper and just as good.</li>
            <li> The barrel turns outward when held in the right hand, so it causes the curls to want to flip out instead of under.</li>
            <li> A good iron to dry your hair and straighten it at the same, also love the fact that you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level.</li>
            <li> i got the waves all over the place hot mess kind of waves!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, worth the money!</li>
            <li> Once you have your own system down, everything is cool.  </li>
            <li> comes with a Thermal Guard  training aid which is recommended for use when you are first getting used to this iron.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush over this tool.  </li>
            <li> As a curling iron, it’s pretty meh.</li>
            <li> It does get pretty hot, so you&#x27;ll want to watch where you are placing your fingers.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth one and love them.</li>
            <li> Love the In-Styler, but I see no difference in this one and the regular one.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Just an overall better look and \\&quot;feel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Wait for a sale, or go ahead and buy the Wet-to-Dry&#x27;s more robust big brother, with the reversible barrel.to \\&quot;four</li>
            <li> Wait for a sale, or go ahead and buy the Wet-to-Dry&#x27;s more robust big brother, with the reversible barrel.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> A really cute mix of white and purple.</li>
            <li> A couple of things to be aware of before buying -</li>
            <li> can’t say for sure if the Instyler is better than a traditional flat iron or not.  </li>
            <li> and this took more time than blow drying and using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a flat iron I love it.</li>
            <li> think I’ll have the curling technique down with some more practice, but for now I use it primarily to create nearly straight hair that is curled under for body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and for me the InStyler Wet to Dry worked best at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> when they say &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34; they DO NOT mean straight out the shower without even quick ring out</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and its so fast to style!</li>
            <li> Great idea but not good for thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product for so long and read many reviews on it before deciding to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long hair would take more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it so much that eventually I put away my flat iron I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I have an older InStyler hair tool and have liked it, so when I saw the InStyler Wet</li>
            <li> There are videos on youtube you can watch that might help, but, what it boils down to is that you have to find your own groove with it.  </li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a lot of it) hair to the kind of heat for the kind of time it takes to dry even one small section that&#x27;s already damp-dry, and</li>
            <li> dry hair works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly used it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> , it works very much like my older InStyler, where the friction from the heated barrel provides the drying effect.</li>
            <li> It is a great styler for dry hair, but not for wet hair.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li> The videos on the InStyler site recommend towel drying your hair as much as possible for the best results; in the video, it looks like the model’s hair is only slightly damp.</li>
            <li> Oh, also, you can’t touch the end of the barrel to steady the device; it gets hot (and it</li>
            <li> , it makes the hair look shiny and amazing, and you can twist it just a little at the tip to do a turn in or out.</li>
            <li> Work good but hard to use</li>
            <li> powered on, an amber light illuminates, and shortly thereafter, the iron is nearly instantly ready to be put to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did it and really didnt like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It has made styling my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are very helpful.</li>
            <li> This style is much safer to use, I found no worries of hair getting entangled</li>
            <li> Fast forward to yesterday (1/5/15).</li>
            <li> Works really well for straightening and drying.  </li>
            <li> it was to much work to get a straight look.  </li>
            <li> It is very unhandy and doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the ease of use with this.</li>
            <li> InStyler really means damp-to-dry.</li>
            <li> so you have to REALLY hold it until your hand cramps.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and untameable hair.</li>
            <li> You really can’t skip blow drying by using this product.</li>
            <li> I think so much heat would be damaging, too.</li>
            <li> That would make it much easier to use.</li>
            <li> to the wet feature, this is merely okay.  </li>
            <li> I had been eyeballing an InStyler for quite awhile, but was turned off by the whole &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; hype of it as I haven&#x27;t had much luck with those types of items.</li>
            <li> If I want it really well styled I can go over it again</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My wife reports that this device works very well.</li>
            <li> - you can hold the unit however is comfortable and just reverse the rotation with a double \\&quot;click closed\\&quot; of the brush and barrel&lt;</li>
            <li> though I prefer the straight).</li>
            <li> I expected more than I should have from this product</li>
            <li> Dries hair really well, curls and flips need hairspray though.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well</li>
            <li> and I got my hair curled and straightened much faster than I ever had before.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;ve done demos for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this instyler to anyone with very unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> the Instyler makes my bangs and hair frizzy and seems to take to much time to get my hair as straight as I want it to be.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work how is said takes to much time</li>
            <li> BUT when i use this iron my hair comes out so soft, smooth, and straight but not pin straight like a natural looking straight</li>
            <li> This works best on damp hair, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a wet to dry styler because you can&#x27;t even use it on wet hair,</li>
            <li> It is so much better than a regular flat iron - it leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, but with volume like you would get from blowdrying your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that accounts for the Max straightening more quickly and with greater ease, but even comparing the lowest heat on the Max to the middle speed on the Wet to Dry</li>
            <li> I finally got something right!</li>
            <li> This works fairly well, however, the “wet to dry” thing proved (with me anyway) to be a joke.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, her hair looks better than it did when she used her previous straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely would have returned it if I had done so within the proper time frame, but I kept hoping that it was more user error...</li>
            <li> Actually they make a similar product which you can reverse the barrel rotation, which is a better choice because it is easier to maneuver around your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product works and it&#x27;s a decent option.</li>
            <li> I always feel like I don&#x27;t have enough hands to be able to work the blow dryer and brush at the same time</li>
            <li> You also have to make sure there aren’t any tangles in your hair, because the stiff bristles aren’t very forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> high setting is for damp hair and works quite well.</li>
            <li> passes on high.</li>
            <li> High heat is 410 degrees.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone, for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of crazy hearing your hair snap, crackle and pop when it&#x27;s wet and getting dried, but it really does a great job of drying my hair while lightly styling it with just the one pass.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, but I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used this on dry clean wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I really like it and am pleasantly surprised by the time it saves me in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It gives me great volume on the crown and works just as quickly as my expensive straighter.</li>
            <li> If you turn the iron over, its easier to get the brush to pass thru the section that just went over the barrel, which adds to the shine and corrects the issue of barrel spin, but makes the flip under a bit more tricky (I usually to the tips twice, once for straight and shiny, then turn the device over for the flip under).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet hair feature is okay, as in practice it just barely works.  </li>
            <li> Normally, straightening my hair can take over an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that effective in comparison to using it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> But that was a baseline model without the new additions of being able to style your hair and dry it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product I was able to be done in less then 30 minutes with results better than with my other flat iron.</li>
            <li> The rotating barrel is new</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m satisfied enough with the results to keep using it, even though it takes twice as long as the blow dryer!  </li>
            <li> To Dry Rotating Iron, Purple, 1-14 Inch, I was very interested in trying it.</li>
            <li> I could I would give it 4.5 stars, for the amazing shine and straight, taking away half a star for awkwardness of other functions.</li>
            <li> for the curling feature of this iron, I thought it was pretty solid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The iron gets sufficiently hot with the 3 different heat settings.</li>
            <li> and WOW I couldn&#x27;t believe the results EVEN AFTER SLEEPING!</li>
            <li> I had actually ordered my first Instyler via television</li>
            <li> This has removed the blow dryer step completely!</li>
            <li> the delivery was super fast and omg this adds so much volume to the hair, unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My niece spends half the day messing around with these things, so I take it they&#x27;re engaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it tries to straighten the ends either because it pulls it out really quick.</li>
            <li> but you have to be extremely careful or you will burn yourself really quick, which I did.  </li>
            <li> I used the InSytler on dry hair right before I went to bed - I just had to try it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually used it on wet hair because I wash may hair at night, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work right out of the shower, but it works really well for my hair (fine &amp; straight)</li>
            <li> I think the tool makes the curling process more difficult than it needs to be, but if you are looking for an all-in-one product, it might be worth the extra effort to be able to pack less in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is fine as a styling tool, but as far as the &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; concept goes, it&#x27;s a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> so I like it better on medium and even then it only takes 3 passes to dry &amp; style with our without my argon oil flat iron spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> used this on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s non-relaxed curly hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was surprised to hear how favorably my wife stated the system</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t go far exploring the drying feature of this unit.</li>
            <li> but so far so</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised that this has replaced my hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I still use my old straightener from walmart bc</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to my blow dryer, dried my hair most of the way, and then went back to the iron.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair or my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  </li>
            <li> suppose I could have just used it at the high temp, sizzle and all, but the potential damage bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, a little beyond my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Pieces seemed to start getting loose after first week of use</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of getting my wet hair dry; I have thick wavy hair and just towel drying before using this InStyler doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> First, the instructions make it clear that your hair shouldn&#x27;t be wet</li>
            <li> This is a solidly constructed iron; its ergonomic body, and firm bristles provide wet to dry styling for big, beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> You hit it once for low, twice for medium and three times for the high setting.  </li>
            <li> Major brownie points!</li>
            <li> The whole appeal for me was to get out of the shower, not waste time blow-drying and style my hair with the time it would take to dry it instead.</li>
            <li> Single pass nice and slow</li>
            <li> Wrap your hair in a towel turbin while you get dressed and do your normal lotion/deodorant routine and it dries it quite enough in that</li>
            <li> It will take you a while to love it, it was very hard to use the first few times and it gets really</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be better than the regular instyler, but the wet to dry simply isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It works, and for dry hair it works really well.  </li>
            <li> The holding mechanism is not strong enough for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For one, the “Wet to Dry” part of the name isn’t true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned about subjecting my fine but thick</li>
            <li> The iron heats up to a max of around 410 degrees pretty quickly and has a few settings to get less heat if desired.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the two for one deal back in November 2014 for my wife directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> And my hair was barely wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color white also makes it look professional</li>
            <li> This InStyler Wet to Dry Rotating Iron is a thoughtfully designed heat utensil that makes me wonder how I managed to go so long without one.</li>
            <li> Everything about this tool feels precision crafted, no loose or wobbly parts, no creaky housing.</li>
            <li> These include the need to towel dry first to get your hair as dry as possible.  </li>
            <li> To straighten my entire head, it took just over 30 minutes which was much quicker than other stylers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This works only on damp hair, not wet hair.  </li>
            <li> it is the only way to go whether you need low settings medium settings or to dry your hair with the high settings.</li>
            <li> I have very course curly hair that takes me forever to do because I usually shower and go, without much time to do my hair or to dry it.</li>
            <li> This InStyler rotating styler makes it explicitly clear in it&#x27;s instructions (and product labels) to towel dry your hair first as thoroughly as possible in order to take advantage of the &#x27;wet to dry&#x27; functionality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whose hair it does work well in, but it&#x27;s not the right product for the people in my family.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to reach outlets far away from the surface you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> Just make sure there’s tension in the hair when pulling it down the hair and that you pull it slowly.  </li>
            <li> I’m not a morning person, and I wash my hair every day, so the wet to dry feature was really why I wanted this</li>
            <li> My wife used this multiple times and reported that the wet feature was thoughtful but would fail because her hair would consistently slip and come out and cause her to basically have to stop and try over again to get the iron going again.  </li>
            <li> Your hair cannot be extremely wet, but if it is towel dry, it really does dry and straighten at the same time!</li>
            <li> I prefer to blow dry to just barely damp to start</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of luck with this iron on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It does not do near what the Conair wet/dry straigher with rotation does except I will give credit where credit is due</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling damaged like a regular flat iron does.</li>
            <li> This combination curling brush and flat iron has two heat settings and takes several minutes to heat up.</li>
            <li> The curls didn’t last very long, either, maybe 30 minutes even though I held my hair in the iron for twenty seconds, which is double the recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally, then wet my hands and ran them through my hair before using the instyler.  </li>
            <li> I still had to flat iron my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> It never lays flat and I have to pin it up every day.</li>
            <li> My hair is laying perfectly flat with NO waves.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these Instylers for a long time and finally went ahead and purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it holds the hair taught while the flat iron goes through.  </li>
            <li> Even on dry hair and with a few passes on high heat it left hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron works must faster!</li>
            <li> Not only didn&#x27;t it dry my hair, it made it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to reviews giving it a low rating because you have to towel dry your hair.</li>
            <li> (dry enough that the strands don’t all stick together).&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a dry styler, it works well enough.  </li>
            <li> I either have to vigorously dry my hair, or wait 30 minutes after my shower before it&#x27;s un-wet enough to style.</li>
            <li> it might become easier but only on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Product took as long as using a hair dryer and flat iron...</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it is difficult to use on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Because the barrel spins in only one direction you have to load hair from the front on one side and the back on the other.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use my regular flat iron than to have my hair get tangled in the instyler wet to dry.</li>
            <li> I have not rly styled my hair with it yet other than straightning and a few curls but the first thing I noticed is it says wet to dry and is supposed to save u time.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately it didn&#x27;t exactly give me the professionally done look as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It has long bristles to help keep the hair organized as it passes through the iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took just as long, if not longer, to do my hair with this product as it would have if I blow-dried &amp; straightened it.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been blowdrying, straightening &amp; then curling my hair for so long</li>
            <li> I used it with my long hair when I had it</li>
            <li> It takes way to long on wet hair and the end result is just not the same as you would see on dry hair.</li>
            <li> provided you towel dry it first, and it can, but this takes FOREVER, over half an hour in my hair, which is only shoulder length but quite thick.</li>
            <li> I still have to blow-dry because it take way too long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We had the same experience with two other InStyler products and will not recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had to send back due to my arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and it is a challenge wrapping it between the brush and roller.</li>
            <li> dry hair</li>
            <li> Of course you shouldn&#x27;t hop out of a pool or shower and expect it to dry and style with your hair dripping.</li>
            <li> To Dry Rotating Iron.</li>
            <li> The importance of gliding the iron once to dry and once to style.</li>
            <li> If your hair is damp, you are supposed to run it once through to dry your hair and then run it again to style it.  </li>
            <li> It says that it can also dry your hair,</li>
            <li> It takes me FOREVER to dry my hair, even with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be fairly dry before this works.</li>
            <li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t need to be completely dry to use the InStyler, but you still need to use a towel to remove excess water.</li>
            <li> Her hair was completely dry, although it did have jojoba oil in it.</li>
            <li> I still have to blow dry my hair before I can use this.</li>
            <li> The tutorial says “glide once to dry, once to style.”</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so damaged and dry</li>
            <li> Still have to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This product did not curl, straighten, or dry my hair.</li>
            <li> yes you do have to towel dry your hair before using ...</li>
            <li> Under these conditions your dampened hair does manage to effectively dry out while running it through the styler</li>
            <li> My hair was damp when I used it and still didn&#x27;t dry it after five times.</li>
            <li> it dosent get ur hair fully dry for about 30 min to an hour and ur roots</li>
            <li> Even with damp hair, it didn’t do the trick and didn’t dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry your hair and just leaves it a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I like the rotating iron - or at least I think I do, but it&#x27;s so hard to complete a whole hairstyle because the brush feels like it&#x27;s just pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> But if you have shorter, thinner hair that doesn&#x27;t take a really long time to dry (i.e., you can use the wet to dry feature), and if you need an all-in-one styler, this may be the product for you.the wet to dry feature), and if you need an all-in-one styler, this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure I would have paid nearly $100 for that feature alone.</li>
            <li> So overall I think it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> --here&#x27;s a helpful tip--buy it at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because not only can you use a 20% off coupon, but, if you hate it, they&#x27;ll take it back! :)</li>
            <li> If this were the only thing it claimed to do, I would give it five stars hands down</li>
            <li> despite the fact that the wet to dry feature didn&#x27;t work for me, I still like the results I got from using this iron to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tool with great expectations to help with straightening my thick curly hair, and I am completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but went ahead and bought it after several reviews and research.</li>
            <li> I thought i would give this Wet to Dry InStyler</li>
            <li> /&gt;It spins in one direction only, I have to say I was a little concerned about that, and it is a bit of a problem (being right-handed and preferring a turn under</li>
            <li> There is no way one could actually dry even slightly damp hair without it taking a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I am better off using the round brush and the hairdryer without having to twist my wrist like crazy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found a bit silly was that this is called a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; InStyler and there are literally two spots of purple on the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> I reminded her that this was a Christmas gift and has only been used a few times since Christmas, and all I was told was &amp;</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> I wanted to review this item and see how my wife might view this hair styler given the supposed wet feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Partially usable with modification, or with lowered expectations.</li>
            <li> Although identical in price at this writing, I&#x27;m convinced that the InStyler Max is an upgrade over the Wet to Dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s really not a time saver at all.</li>
            <li> I have just-past shoulder length hair that is thick and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not sure if I am being overly cautious, but my hair will not dry with just one pass through.  </li>
            <li> I’m rubbish at doing anything with my hair, but I’m always curious about products that look like they’ll help me do something other than throw my hair in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> half to air dry bc</li>
            <li> it spins the wrong way), but it’s not nearly the issue I thought it would be as the barrel doesn’t really grab the hair.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair, even when I&#x27;ve towel dried and pre- dried with hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> like I found with the other style irons.</li>
            <li> to almost dry and then tried using the instyler again all it did was make my hair a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - not super thick and not super thin, naturally straight and not curly at all, and unless I go super slow, I need to make at least two passes over the sections of hair to get them dry and looking how I want.  </li>
            <li> This is a very Wet</li>
            <li> Usually they don’t work for me, and the InStyler Wet to Dry Rotating Iron is just another to add to the “Didn’t Work”</li>
            <li> Less quality compare to other instyler</li>
            <li> Received this late last week.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse hair and this made my ends look fried.</li>
            <li> When I tried using the rotating function to curl my hair, my hair would slide out if I tried to curl down to the ends.</li>
            <li> I usually use my InStyler after my hair is already dry, but it does work if you want to use it on damp hair.</li>
            <li> the flat iron in sister sucks</li>
            <li> (at least towel dried as much as possible).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE HAD IT LESS</li>
            <li> and there were some slight frizz.</li>
            <li> less shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s a black cagey looking thing that clips to the length of the tool.  </li>
            <li> I am not impress, not a good wet to dry takes a lot of time</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me, you’ll be gliding to dry three or four times, so that doesn’t cut down on time at all, and</li>
            <li> I do have long, thick hair, so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on my type.</li>
            <li> The barrel doesn&#x27;t clamp tightly to the brush.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t hard to do; just towel dry and squeeze the excess moisture out.</li>
            <li> They paid attention to all the little details in the design of this tool, not skimping anywhere, and it shows.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if the brush piece opened a little wider when I am trying to wrap my hair around it to make curls.</li>
            <li> Tried it with both my fianc&amp;eacute;, who has long thick hair, and her BFF, a stylist that has short and thin hair, and we couldn&#x27;t get the InStyler to work at a..  </li>
            <li> dont be discouraged if you dont get the hang of it in the beginning, its takes a little practice getting used to.</li>
            <li> The rotating saves a little time going through the hair.</li>
            <li> I still use a little product before running this through my hair because without it my hair is still frizzy and</li>
            <li> When I tried to dry my hair with this product, I mean, just forget it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair with lots of cowlicks.</li>
            <li> I dried and styled in 2</li>
            <li> It does what is says and my hair is quickly dried when damp.</li>
            <li> it’s just a few hairs, and they just loosen faster rather that being immediately expelled.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair and used it.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy and robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and towel dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> I blowed dried my hair</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and do it with freshly dried hair (before styling products are added).  </li>
            <li> That could take a few times of using it.  </li>
            <li> so usually I just aim the dryer at my hair and then put it down periodically to brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> them mean towel dry it a little bit that takes but a few seconds!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the iron doesn’t grip the hair very tightly.</li>
            <li> It does a poor job of drying my hair and once dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my hair to straighten and then curl it</li>
            <li> a little hard to use...will need to practice using it.</li>
            <li> They usually are to bulky, or break, or burn me or rip out my hair.</li>
            <li> really not sure that there&#x27;s any difference between the barrels to account for this unit being marketed as a dryer and the Max not being promoted in that way.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed for I really thought I could use the one product, instead of a dryer and a straighter and a rotation brush.</li>
            <li> not sure why people are so shocked that it doesn&#x27;t dry sopping wet hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still a klutz with this product but the fact that it combines the drying action and the brush makes me feel like it&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Common sense.</li>
            <li> Very different results and extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint is that the rotating bit cannot be reversed, making it slightly awkward to use on the one side of her head.</li>
            <li> stars\\&quot; on this unit if it wasn&#x27;t being sold on the basis of doing something that it does not-so-well, that might even damage delicate hair.</li>
            <li> stars\\&quot; on this unit if it wasn&#x27;t being sold on the basis of doing something that it does not-so-well, that might even damage delicate hair.</li>
            <li> well and section and move the styler slowly through the section.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I color and highlight my medium texture thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> The importance of gliding this slowly while using it.</li>
            <li> if you have thick hair, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> The benefit is also that the dryer your hair is, the less you&#x27;ll be using the InStyler, because holding it up for so long can give you a bad case of arm</li>
            <li> It was too expensive and NOT worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The technique is a little difficult</li>
            <li> I will continue to give bad reviews wherever possible and hope this company goes out of business.</li>
            <li> NOT worth $100!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take some practice for my thick, curly hair - and time!</li>
            <li> My hair may be too thin - it doesn&#x27;t even hit the brush and ends up spinning out of the tool.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS BROKEN</li>
            <li> Remember to use lower settings if your hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> to admit its a  bit expensive though for a hair styler, and i would never use it on my damp hair because i feel like it gives it the burned hair smell.</li>
            <li> Sadly instyler literally has to spell this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but 30 days have passed since you received them&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that it was difficult or cumbersome or anything; it&#x27;s just that it was taking way too</li>
            <li> I had no issues with tangling at all, even when I got a bit careless with how I was using it.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even laughable.  </li>
            <li> Fiction is laughable.  </li>
            <li> This was difficult and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is by no means a bad item, just merely not as great as it should or could be.</li>
            <li> also found the iron incredibly awkward to use on myself.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t awkward in some places to keep the flip up or flip under going</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because I want to return it but threw out the box. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, save your money, just a flash in the pan, not good, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how bad this product is.  </li>
            <li> Fiction so bad</li>
            <li> Bad move on my part, expense move</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I got frustrated with the damage I feeled</li>
            <li> Highly highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It failed horribly.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> but one of the brushes broke~the rep I spoke to said they do not make replacements :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> It will take you a while to love it, it was very hard to use the first few times and it gets really hot!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now i have the perfect hair day everyday, no frizzy baby hairs flying arround for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to admit its a  bit expensive though for a hair styler, and i would never use it on my damp hair because i feel like it gives it the burned hair smell.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with her iron</li>
            <li> I bought this today and will return it tomorrow.  I followed the directions exactly….towel dry hair well and section and move the styler slowly through the section.  Not only didn&#x27;t it dry my hair, it made it frizzy.  I have shoulder length thick, wavy hair and this took more time than blow drying and using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to reviews giving it a low rating because you have to towel dry your hair. Of course you shouldn&#x27;t hop out of a pool or shower and expect it to dry and style with your hair dripping. These are the people we watch on world&#x27;s dumbest. Sadly instyler literally has to spell this out. Common sense. Wrap your hair in a towel turbin while you get dressed and do your normal lotion/deodorant routine and it dries it quite enough in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high setting is for damp hair and works quite well. I dried and styled in 2 passes on high. I color and highlight my medium texture thick hair so I like it better on medium and even then it only takes 3 passes to dry &amp; style with our without my argon oil flat iron spray.</li>
            <li> My hair may be too thin - it doesn&#x27;t even hit the brush and ends up spinning out of the tool.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> Is good but not to try it in wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did it and really didnt like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;In dry hair works better. I have long wavy hair. Thats my opinion. Oh and dont put any &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; products on hair before. Better use liquid ones like TRESemmé Heat Tamer Spray. But dont use any hair lotions. Besides that works fine.</li>
            <li> A good iron to dry your hair and straighten it at the same, also love the fact that you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has made styling my hair so much easier.  I have thick shoulder length hair and now I can actual style with different techniques.  BUT it works best on dry hair.  It takes way to long on wet hair and the end result is just not the same as you would see on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Evolution of the straightening iron and curling iron is present in this rotating iron. It can be used as either a curler or a straightener. The curling iron is well built and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It has long bristles to help keep the hair organized as it passes through the iron. The iron heats up to a max of around 410 degrees pretty quickly and has a few settings to get less heat if desired. It heats up to your setting in under a minute and is easy to use without tugging or pulling on hair. I also like the auto-shut off safety feature as irons are often left on at my house.</li>
            <li> This is a very Wet To Dry Rotating Iron. It has some nice features, great instructions and works well. It is light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has three heat settings.  Low heat is 285 degrees. Medium heat is 315 degrees. High heat is 410 degrees. It has a 30 second rapid heat-up and auto safety shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a Thermal Guard  training aid which is recommended for use when you are first getting used to this iron.  It is supposed to protect hair from burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are easy to read and come with pictures which do a good job explaining how to properly use this. It lists four things that you must know before using this product.  These include the need to towel dry first to get your hair as dry as possible.  The importance of gliding the iron once to dry and once to style. The importance of gliding this slowly while using it. You should also listen for the crackle which means moisture is evaporating from the barrel and not your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light and easy to use.  It does a great job. The instructions are very helpful.</li>
            <li> This InStyler Wet to Dry Rotating Iron is a thoughtfully designed heat utensil that makes me wonder how I managed to go so long without one. They paid attention to all the little details in the design of this tool, not skimping anywhere, and it shows. Everything about this tool feels precision crafted, no loose or wobbly parts, no creaky housing. The handle is cool to the touch, the cord has a generous length, and the comb section is just the right length to be effective without snagging or tangling.</li>
            <li> This style is much safer to use, I found no worries of hair getting entangled like I found with the other style irons. Perfect, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I like this item. It does what is says and my hair is quickly dried when damp. It would be helpful if the brush piece opened a little wider when I am trying to wrap my hair around it to make curls. My hair is very long and it is a challenge wrapping it between the brush and roller. Still love the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the two for one deal back in November 2014 for my wife directly from the manufacturer. I paid in full  ($154.00) instead of taking the payment option. When I purchased the irons, I told the lady on the phone that this was a Christmas gift and would not be used until after Christmas which was more than 30 days out. The lady told me that she would document my account that it was a Christmas gift. Fast forward to yesterday (1/5/15). I called to try and return because my wife could not get the irons to curl her hair as shown on the advertisement. The lady told me she could not refund me because it was more than 30 days out. I reminded her that this was a Christmas gift and has only been used a few times since Christmas, and all I was told was &amp;#34;I see the account is documented. I&#x27;m sorry, but 30 days have passed since you received them&amp;#34;. This is a pathetic way to run a business!!! I will continue to give bad reviews wherever possible and hope this company goes out of business. Buy at your own risk! They will take your money, sell you a gimmick product and then want to disappear.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves how easy it is to use!  She also loves how it makes her hair feel and look!! I think that is really makes her hair look great!  It is a great buy already. I just hope that it lasts a long-long time!! I will be trying her&#x27;s out, to see if it does my old hair as good as it does young hair!  I believe it can!</li>
            <li> I used this on dry clean wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t work. Not only did it make my hair frizzy but the barrel stopped spinning and I hadn&#x27;t even used it for an hour. Highly highly disappointed. I purchased this about a week ago and used it today. It&#x27;s unfortunate because I want to return it but threw out the box. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how bad this product is.  It does not dry your hair and just leaves it a frizzy mess.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush over this tool.  First, the instructions make it clear that your hair shouldn&#x27;t be wet (at least towel dried as much as possible).  If your hair is damp, you are supposed to run it once through to dry your hair and then run it again to style it.  I&#x27;m  not sure if I am being overly cautious, but my hair will not dry with just one pass through.  So, this product advertises that you can skip the hair dryer, but I would rather just use my hair dryer and then a separate styling tool, because a hair dryer is still easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush gave my hair better results.  Using the Rotating Iron did not give me the same frizz control.  Both probably helped my hair look shinier than without, but the Ionic Hot Brush was easier to use and, thus, made me feel like I had more control, allowing me to shape my hair better.</li>
            <li> Works really well for straightening and drying.  Because the barrel spins in only one direction you have to load hair from the front on one side and the back on the other.  Takes some practice to do the crown of your head.  Not so great for curling but maybe I need to read the directions more closely.</li>
            <li> I have used the original for years and I love it. I tried this one after rave reviews of my friend. I&#x27;m not a fan of this one. It does a poor job of drying my hair and once dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my hair to straighten and then curl it</li>
            <li> Love my in styler.... love how its does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> NOT worth $100!!!! I have semi wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t even make that strait!</li>
            <li> I thought that the spinning barrels would make the straightening process easier... it does not, unless you are left handed. The barrel turns outward when held in the right hand, so it causes the curls to want to flip out instead of under. Definitely would have returned it if I had done so within the proper time frame, but I kept hoping that it was more user error... it isnt..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it worked that good it was to much work to get a straight look.  The flat iron works must faster! I sent mine back!</li>
            <li> As a flat iron I love it. Single pass nice and slow does the trick, it makes the hair look shiny and amazing, and you can twist it just a little at the tip to do a turn in or out. If this were the only thing it claimed to do, I would give it five stars hands down as it does this wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt; It says that it can also dry your hair, provided you towel dry it first, and it can, but this takes FOREVER, over half an hour in my hair, which is only shoulder length but quite thick. I prefer to blow dry to just barely damp to start (dry enough that the strands don’t all stick together).&lt;br /&gt; As a curling iron, it’s pretty meh. The technique is a little difficult and I had an issue burning myself trying. Oh, also, you can’t touch the end of the barrel to steady the device; it gets hot (and it turns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It spins in one direction only, I have to say I was a little concerned about that, and it is a bit of a problem (being right-handed and preferring a turn under it spins the wrong way), but it’s not nearly the issue I thought it would be as the barrel doesn’t really grab the hair. I thought it might kick the under sections out, but if it does it at all it’s just a few hairs, and they just loosen faster rather that being immediately expelled. If you turn the iron over, its easier to get the brush to pass thru the section that just went over the barrel, which adds to the shine and corrects the issue of barrel spin, but makes the flip under a bit more tricky (I usually to the tips twice, once for straight and shiny, then turn the device over for the flip under).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would give it 4.5 stars, for the amazing shine and straight, taking away half a star for awkwardness of other functions.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of luck with this iron on wet hair. I have just-past shoulder length hair that is thick and naturally wavy. It takes me FOREVER to dry my hair, even with a blow dryer. When I tried to dry my hair with this product, I mean, just forget it. I stopped about 25% of the way through. It isn&#x27;t that it was difficult or cumbersome or anything; it&#x27;s just that it was taking way too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to my blow dryer, dried my hair most of the way, and then went back to the iron. This is when the iron started redeeming itself a bit, in my opinion. I liked how the rotating iron made my hair look. It&#x27;s kind of a cool concept, and it actually did get my hair straight and smooth. I have a very curly (frizzy and troublesome...) section of hair on the very top of my head, and that section was a bit more difficult to straighten, but it still did a pretty good job. And with practice, I got better at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the curling feature of this iron, I thought it was pretty solid. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but I was still able to put a bit of body in there. I think the tool makes the curling process more difficult than it needs to be, but if you are looking for an all-in-one product, it might be worth the extra effort to be able to pack less in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So despite the fact that the wet to dry feature didn&#x27;t work for me, I still like the results I got from using this iron to straighten my hair. The curling function is just so-so (for my hair), but since I really like the all-in-one capabilities of this product, I am still, overall, impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution:  the price on this styler is a bit steep, so make sure you can use as many of these features as possible. In other words, if you are just looking for a straightener, you can find something else that&#x27;s cheaper and just as good. But if you have shorter, thinner hair that doesn&#x27;t take a really long time to dry (i.e., you can use the wet to dry feature), and if you need an all-in-one styler, this may be the product for you.the wet to dry feature), and if you need an all-in-one styler, this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and for me the InStyler Wet to Dry worked best at straightening my hair. I did find that to keep it from getting tangled it worked best if I used it on slightly damp hair, not wet hair. To straighten my entire head, it took just over 30 minutes which was much quicker than other stylers I&#x27;ve tried. It does get pretty hot, so you&#x27;ll want to watch where you are placing your fingers. Overall this iron makes it easier for me to change up my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a couple of times. It is very unhandy and doesn&#x27;t do what it promises. I am better off using the round brush and the hairdryer without having to twist my wrist like crazy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tool with great expectations to help with straightening my thick curly hair, and I am completely disappointed. It is easier to use my regular flat iron than to have my hair get tangled in the instyler wet to dry. I was expecting it to be better than the regular instyler, but the wet to dry simply isn&#x27;t. If I could do it all over again, I would order the original instyler. I have used the original instyler which belongs to a friend, it worked great! Which is why I ordered one. Very different results and extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used InStyler before, and I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with the result. But that was a baseline model without the new additions of being able to style your hair and dry it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that that&#x27;s not quite true. Your hair has to be fairly dry before this works. That isn&#x27;t hard to do; just towel dry and squeeze the excess moisture out. The benefit is also that the dryer your hair is, the less you&#x27;ll be using the InStyler, because holding it up for so long can give you a bad case of arm cramps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On almost-dry hair, it works very much like my older InStyler, where the friction from the heated barrel provides the drying effect. Your hair comes out straightened, glossy, and polished. Beware, though, there is a learning curve with this appliance. If you&#x27;re patient, you have a good amount of arm strength, and your hair is on the longish side, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t need to be completely dry to use the InStyler, but you still need to use a towel to remove excess water. The rotating barrel is new so you need some learning curve to get used to it. Actually they make a similar product which you can reverse the barrel rotation, which is a better choice because it is easier to maneuver around your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick specs:&lt;br /&gt;– Tourmaline ceramic plates&lt;br /&gt;– Multiple heat settings up to 410°F&lt;br /&gt;– 30 seconds heat up&lt;br /&gt;– Ionic bristles&lt;br /&gt;– swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, just don&#x27;t expect that it would do wonders.  Gives a good deal of waves and creates volume.  The swivel cord helps a lot specially when you switch sides.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Tried it with both my fianc&amp;eacute;, who has long thick hair, and her BFF, a stylist that has short and thin hair, and we couldn&#x27;t get the InStyler to work at a..  It lacks the power to properly pull and curl hair and it takes forever to warm up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had the same experience with two other InStyler products and will not recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this product. I just don&#x27;t think it works well with my hair or my daughter&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m African-American and my hair is relaxed. The brush just pulls and pulls and pulls on my hair. I like the rotating iron - or at least I think I do, but it&#x27;s so hard to complete a whole hairstyle because the brush feels like it&#x27;s just pulling my hair out. And my hair was barely wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s non-relaxed curly hair. Her hair was completely dry, although it did have jojoba oil in it. She was screaming for me to stop because of the pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron gets sufficiently hot with the 3 different heat settings. The cord is long enough to reach outlets far away from the surface you&#x27;re using. The brush is simply not made for our hair. I&#x27;m not sure whose hair it does work well in, but it&#x27;s not the right product for the people in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it did work because to be able to curl slightly wet hair would be a great convenience.</li>
            <li> This works best on damp hair, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a wet to dry styler because you can&#x27;t even use it on wet hair, just damp. I really appreciated the ease of use with this. I had no issues with tangling at all, even when I got a bit careless with how I was using it. Be sure to read the owners manual and follow the tips, our you could end up with tangled hair. I liked how the barrel smoothed my hair and curled the ends. Overall a really good investment.</li>
            <li> I have an older InStyler hair tool and have liked it, so when I saw the InStyler Wet To Dry Rotating Iron, Purple, 1-14 Inch, I was very interested in trying it. I’m not a morning person, and I wash my hair every day, so the wet to dry feature was really why I wanted this appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, although the title of the product uses the term wet-to-dry, the manual and reality prove this to be an exaggeration. InStyler really means damp-to-dry. I still have to blow dry my hair before I can use this. On the bright side, however, I can leave it a bit damp and get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler site has video tips that show how to use this tool best, and they are very helpful. I haven’t yet mastered the ability to make ringlet curls with this tool, but I have really liked the way it produces smooth body for my hair (see uploaded photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I’ll have the curling technique down with some more practice, but for now I use it primarily to create nearly straight hair that is curled under for body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InStyler provides a removable cool tip that screws into the end of the barrel, which is nice to get a better hold of the hot appliance while you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this appliance.</li>
            <li> This works only on damp hair, not wet hair.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair or my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  Watch the YouTube videos for great tips!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use. Doesn&#x27;t stay closed so you have to REALLY hold it until your hand cramps.  It was too expensive and NOT worth the money.  I gave it away..</li>
            <li> It worked better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my InStyler!! It does everything it claims and more. I have very frizzy and untameable hair. I have used dozens of similar gadgets over the years. They usually are to bulky, or break, or burn me or rip out my hair. But not this! I just use this and I am good to go. So fast and easy to use. My hair is smooth and salon perfect every time and no hair loss or burns!!</li>
            <li> I’m rubbish at doing anything with my hair, but I’m always curious about products that look like they’ll help me do something other than throw my hair in a ponytail. Usually they don’t work for me, and the InStyler Wet to Dry Rotating Iron is just another to add to the “Didn’t Work” pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, the “Wet to Dry” part of the name isn’t true. The videos on the InStyler site recommend towel drying your hair as much as possible for the best results; in the video, it looks like the model’s hair is only slightly damp. You really can’t skip blow drying by using this product. The tutorial says “glide once to dry, once to style.” If you have thick hair like me, you’ll be gliding to dry three or four times, so that doesn’t cut down on time at all, and I think so much heat would be damaging, too. You also have to make sure there aren’t any tangles in your hair, because the stiff bristles aren’t very forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the iron doesn’t grip the hair very tightly. When I tried using the rotating function to curl my hair, my hair would slide out if I tried to curl down to the ends. The curls didn’t last very long, either, maybe 30 minutes even though I held my hair in the iron for twenty seconds, which is double the recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the iron incredibly awkward to use on myself. The brush side is big and in the way when you’re trying to look in the mirror and wrap hair around the iron side.</li>
            <li> Wife like it she  It good</li>
            <li> I am disappointed. I have wanted to try this product for so long and read many reviews on it before deciding to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took just as long, if not longer, to do my hair with this product as it would have if I blow-dried &amp; straightened it. I do have long, thick hair, so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on my type.</li>
            <li> dont work like suppose to</li>
            <li> This is my fourth one and love them.</li>
            <li> if you have thick hair, don&#x27;t get it. I have really thick coarse hair and this made my ends look fried. I don&#x27;t like how it tries to straighten the ends either because it pulls it out really quick. I towel dried my hair and used it. it works good to dry and straighten, but I feel like it made my hair frizzy (i used leave in conditioner and heat protectant spray) and couldn&#x27;t reach my roots. I am sad to say I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, save your money, just a flash in the pan, not good, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that eventually I put away my flat iron I have been using for years. The instyler is so much better I can see better results in my hair by using it.</li>
            <li> I was just ok.  It did not save time as I had hoped. Blow dryer works better and faster for my type hair.</li>
            <li> I wish it rotated in both directions. That would make it much easier to use.</li>
            <li> It BURNED TWO INCHES OF MY HAIR OFF. After thoroughly creaking out I proceeded to call customer service. I told the man that it had burned two inches of my hair off and I thought I should report it and he hung up on me. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> a little hard to use...will need to practice using it.</li>
            <li> Did not work or meet expectations</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to review this item and see how my wife might view this hair styler given the supposed wet feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good system.  As a dry styler, it works well enough.  In fact, I was surprised to hear how favorably my wife stated the system worked.&lt;br /&gt;The brush at the end is a nice feature, and the quality of construction is high.  It feels heavy and robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric cord is nice and long which is a great feature for being able to move around and use this and accommodate being in the bathroom and not be immediately next to the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the wet feature, this is merely okay.  I think this gets an A as an idea, and probably a B- for execution.  My wife used this multiple times and reported that the wet feature was thoughtful but would fail because her hair would consistently slip and come out and cause her to basically have to stop and try over again to get the iron going again.  So, this is a great idea, but in practice doesn&#x27;t work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this basis, I give this item 3.5 stars.  It works, and for dry hair it works really well.  The wet hair feature is okay, as in practice it just barely works.  This is by no means a bad item, just merely not as great as it should or could be.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth InStyler I have tried and I like it. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of getting my wet hair dry; I have thick wavy hair and just towel drying before using this InStyler doesn&#x27;t work for me. However it does work great on my damp to dry hair. It is easy to use, heats up quickly, and makes my hair feel bouncy and pretty.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeballing an InStyler for quite awhile, but was turned off by the whole &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; hype of it as I haven&#x27;t had much luck with those types of items. I&#x27;m happy to say, this thing is amazing. My hair hasn&#x27;t gotten caught or snagged on any plates like it used to with my Chi.  I love the shine it gave my hair and just how quick it was to style my hair with this. Normally, straightening my hair can take over an hour. With this product I was able to be done in less then 30 minutes with results better than with my other flat iron. The other great thing about this InStyler is that you can use it on damp towel-dried hair to help finish the drying and styling all at once. It&#x27;s kind of crazy hearing your hair snap, crackle and pop when it&#x27;s wet and getting dried, but it really does a great job of drying my hair while lightly styling it with just the one pass. If I want it really well styled I can go over it again and it just locks in that style beautifully. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This instyler does not work on my hair</li>
            <li> I am not impress, not a good wet to dry takes a lot of time the flat iron in sister sucks and I&#x27;ve try the curls and never work eather... it works, is just not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work the way I expected it to. The barrel doesn&#x27;t clamp tightly to the brush. I still had to flat iron my hair after using it. I was under the impression that this would save me time with that process.</li>
            <li> SUPER DOPER COOL love it</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have very thick coarse hair with lots of cowlicks. It never lays flat and I have to pin it up every day. I used the InSytler on dry hair right before I went to bed - I just had to try it and WOW I couldn&#x27;t believe the results EVEN AFTER SLEEPING! My hair is laying perfectly flat with NO waves. Well worth the money. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it is difficult to use on fine hair.  The holding mechanism is not strong enough for fine hair.  Great idea but not good for thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this. Best buy ever! This gives me a salon blowout look but at home. I use oil and WEN leave in on my hair when it&#x27;s damp and use this and I think it infuses my hair with the oil and WEN because my curly/kinky/frizzy fine hair (I am white with &amp;#34;Ethnic&amp;#34; hair) comes out GORGEOUS. My damaged hair looks healthy! Because my hair is so damaged and dry I only wash it (with WEN once a week). I used to get salon blowouts and leave them for a week and than wash my hair and be stuck with gross frizzy hair again. Now....I can just use this once a week and it actually feels like it&#x27;s good for my hair. I&#x27;m so happy. I love this product!</li>
            <li> i purchased this item as a gift and she loved it so I guess it does what it needs to. 😊</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t how get a hold of no body but it was doing fine then yesterday turn it on and where you turn it on was melted will not work now</li>
            <li> My wife reports that this device works very well. Her only complaint is that the rotating bit cannot be reversed, making it slightly awkward to use on the one side of her head. Having said that, her hair looks better than it did when she used her previous straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key to my rating system (extrapolate for music and movies): * &#x3D; Terrible. Unusable. Fiction so bad it&#x27;s not even laughable.  ** &#x3D; Substandard. Partially usable with modification, or with lowered expectations. Fiction is laughable.  *** &#x3D; Usable, but won&#x27;t purchase again. Wouldn&#x27;t read fiction by this author again, unless stuck in an airport for 12 hours with nothing else to read.  **** &#x3D; Meets my expectations. Will buy again unless I find a better product. Will read this author again. ***** &#x3D; Exceeds my expectations. Will buy author&#x27;s work automatically.</li>
            <li> Love this tool!  Wish I had purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take some practice for my thick, curly hair - and time!</li>
            <li> Love the In-Styler, but I see no difference in this one and the regular one. Still have to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This product did not curl, straighten, or dry my hair. It failed horribly.</li>
            <li> It really works! I love my InStyler. It is so much better than a regular flat iron - it leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, but with volume like you would get from blowdrying your hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling damaged like a regular flat iron does. It seems more gentle. I usually use my InStyler after my hair is already dry, but it does work if you want to use it on damp hair. Your hair cannot be extremely wet, but if it is towel dry, it really does dry and straighten at the same time! I also love that you can curl or flip the ends for a really pretty look. I use it almost every day!</li>
            <li> For the same price listed for this iron, as I write this, I&#x27;d recommend the InStyler Max 2-Way Rotating Iron, which I also had the opportunity to evaluate for Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InStyler \\&quot;Wet-To-Dry\\&quot; unit has:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- the swiveling cord that I love - no tangling or kinking where the cord meets the unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- the smoothing, rotating barrel that can also curl or do flip ups/unders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- 3 heat settings (fine, medium, coarse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- No issues I observed with catching hair, either on my above-shoulder length or a family member&#x27;s near waist-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the InStyler Max has on top of that is:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Easily reversible direction of rotation on the barrel - so it isn&#x27;t awkward in some places to keep the flip up or flip under going - you can hold the unit however is comfortable and just reverse the rotation with a double \\&quot;click closed\\&quot; of the brush and barrel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- A fourth heat setting. I don&#x27;t know if that accounts for the Max straightening more quickly and with greater ease, but even comparing the lowest heat on the Max to the middle speed on the Wet to Dry, Max was the winner for my units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Just an overall better look and \\&quot;feel\\&quot;. Although identical in price at this writing, I&#x27;m convinced that the InStyler Max is an upgrade over the Wet to Dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t go far exploring the drying feature of this unit. I&#x27;m concerned about subjecting my fine but thick (there&#x27;s a lot of it) hair to the kind of heat for the kind of time it takes to dry even one small section that&#x27;s already damp-dry, and the videos for the unit aren&#x27;t exactly enthusiastic about you using the InStyler as a dryer, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really not sure that there&#x27;s any difference between the barrels to account for this unit being marketed as a dryer and the Max not being promoted in that way. I&#x27;d be closer to \\&quot;four stars\\&quot; on this unit if it wasn&#x27;t being sold on the basis of doing something that it does not-so-well, that might even damage delicate hair. Wait for a sale, or go ahead and buy the Wet-to-Dry&#x27;s more robust big brother, with the reversible barrel.to \\&quot;four stars\\&quot; on this unit if it wasn&#x27;t being sold on the basis of doing something that it does not-so-well, that might even damage delicate hair.

            <li> This combination curling brush and flat iron has two heat settings and takes several minutes to heat up. Single-purpose appliances do a better job but this might be a good choice for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a solidly constructed iron; its ergonomic body, and firm bristles provide wet to dry styling for big, beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When powered on, an amber light illuminates, and shortly thereafter, the iron is nearly instantly ready to be put to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes a nice carry bag, a sectioning comb, and a protective, snap on shield. My niece spends half the day messing around with these things, so I take it they&#x27;re engaging.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair, even when I&#x27;ve towel dried and pre- dried with hair dryer.  Even on dry hair and with a few passes on high heat it left hair frizzy.  Did nothing as advertised, sending back this paperweight. I&#x27;d give it zero stars if possible.</li>
            <li> This is fine as a styling tool, but as far as the &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; concept goes, it&#x27;s a complete waste of time. The whole appeal for me was to get out of the shower, not waste time blow-drying and style my hair with the time it would take to dry it instead. Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair has to be barely damp for this to work effectively. Otherwise you end up passing the wand over and over again until the hair is try which is just additional heat damage to the hair. Not saving me any time or effort over drying then styling, but much more tedious. So it&#x27;s really not a time saver at all. I either have to vigorously dry my hair, or wait 30 minutes after my shower before it&#x27;s un-wet enough to style. And that&#x27;s for not-too-thick, shoulder-length hair. Long hair would take more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a styling tool, it works as well as most of the ones that I have, but at a much higher price. I do like the built in brush concept, though, because I don&#x27;t have to pre-brush the hair sections before styling. It essentially does that for me. But I&#x27;m not sure I would have paid nearly $100 for that feature alone.</li>
            <li> MAde my wife so happy! I finally got something right!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but went ahead and bought it after several reviews and research. I have very course curly hair that takes me forever to do because I usually shower and go, without much time to do my hair or to dry it. Tried this after a shower and oh my gosh! It was awesome. It was easy to use, followed the directions and it worked just the way it said it would. My hair is straight, and with practice I will be able to use it for curls as well (though I prefer the straight). I would highly recommend this product, worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had to send back due to my arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> The day it came in I had just washed my hair. used it and was amazed how beautiful my hair came out</li>
            <li> Very good product n price.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it claimed to do. I love it, recommend it, and will purchase more as gifts in the future.</li>
            <li> I had actually ordered my first Instyler via television so when I was looking for another one I was scared that it might not come with everything that I had before. It came early and it&#x27;s perfect. A really cute mix of white and purple. It straightens my hair easily and leaves a natural and beautiful shine. When I use this, my hair stays straightened and nice for a week before I have to redo it!</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE - THIS UNIT NO LONGER WORKS!  I&#x27;VE HAD IT LESS THAN A YEAR AND IT IS BROKEN WITH NO WARRANTY OR REPIAR OPTION!  - I&#x27;M DOWNGRADING MY REVIEW FROM A 5 TO A 1! - I&#x27;ve been blowdrying, straightening &amp; then curling my hair for so long I thought i would give this Wet to Dry InStyler a try.  I really like it and am pleasantly surprised by the time it saves me in the morning.  I still have to blow-dry because it take way too long to dry my hair.  However, I no longer have to straighten &amp; then curl!  I love this tool.  I have a short reverse bob &amp; flip it under.  It gives me great volume on the crown and works just as quickly as my expensive straighter.</li>
            <li> I bought the InStyler on the recommendation of a friend, as something to use on my short bob instead of a blow dryer and a barrel brush.  So far, I&#x27;m satisfied enough with the results to keep using it, even though it takes twice as long as the blow dryer!  (Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to shave off sometime after I use it more, who knows).  It does make my hair very shiny and smooth, and I have gotten quite a lot of compliments.  A couple of things to be aware of before buying - yes you do have to towel dry your hair before using ... not sure why people are so shocked that it doesn&#x27;t dry sopping wet hair.  I don&#x27;t think any product can do that.  My hair is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - not super thick and not super thin, naturally straight and not curly at all, and unless I go super slow, I need to make at least two passes over the sections of hair to get them dry and looking how I want.  The instruction packet recommends using a heat protection spray, and I would second that, especially if you have colored hair.  The only thing I found a bit silly was that this is called a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; InStyler and there are literally two spots of purple on the whole thing.  It&#x27;s white.  But other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li> LOVE ITTT!! the delivery was super fast and omg this adds so much volume to the hair, unbelievable. Could never create this look with a blow dryer, the instyler is amazing!!!!!! and delivery was also super fast! love it! dont be discouraged if you dont get the hang of it in the beginning, its takes a little practice getting used to.</li>
            <li> My 3rd instyler. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Work good but hard to use</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I expected more than I should have from this product but I am disappointed with my purchase.  I have wanted one of these Instylers for a long time and finally went ahead and purchased it.  It does not do near what the Conair wet/dry straigher with rotation does except I will give credit where credit is due, the Instyler does not leave dent marks and the Conair wetdry does sometime. There is no way one could actually dry even slightly damp hair without it taking a very long time.  Now on not-in-the-least-damp hair, dry hair, it does fairly well but you have to be extremely careful or you will burn yourself really quick, which I did.  I am sure working with the Instyler more it might become easier but only on dry hair.  I am so disappointed for I really thought I could use the one product, instead of a dryer and a straighter and a rotation brush. I would have returned the Instyler but I just knew it would work for me, I read all the reviews, I watched the videoes of how-to-do&#x27;s, so, I threw the box away before I actually tried the Instyler.  Bad move on my part, expense move, for now I have to keep the Instyler.  I am never buying outside the Conair line again.  I have always purchaed Conair products and so I hope I remember this experience if I am tempted again.</li>
            <li> I got frustrated with the damage I feeled I was doing to my hair. I followed the directions and towel dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Using this item, steam sizzled from my hair. I tried using a lower temperature, but it didn&#x27;t seem to get the hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could have just used it at the high temp, sizzle and all, but the potential damage bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, a little beyond my shoulders. It is not a lot of hair, so I don&#x27;t think I was extending the capabilities of the device.</li>
            <li> Wife review: I&#x27;m a bit on the fence about this product. I&#x27;ve mostly used it on my dry hair. I like how it is a rotating iron. The color white also makes it look professional, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t exactly give me the professionally done look as advertised. The rotating saves a little time going through the hair. However, I feel the hold of the product on my hair from top to the ends was slightly loose even when I used more hair. I had to go over my hair about 3 times to get the effect I wanted and there were some slight frizz. It did straighten and was able to get the wave at the bottom as part of the style but I was expecting to have the smooth, silky look which I didn&#x27;t get. The product works and it&#x27;s a decent option. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on damp/wet hair. It&#x27;s really not that effective in comparison to using it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is amazing  I love it</li>
            <li> Good straightener. Needs a learning curve to use.</li>
            <li> Dries hair really well, curls and flips need hairspray though.</li>
            <li> happy with the product . she love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product for my hair..i don&#x27;t have complain!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent experience with the seller the product arrived on time and I reall like this product! Five stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this instyler for a year now and it&#x27;s perfect. I used it with my long hair when I had it and it worked very well and I got my hair curled and straightened much faster than I ever had before. I have the 1-1/4&amp;#34; barrel and it&#x27;s even perfect for my short hair that I have now (around my shoulder length). I have never used heat protectant with this instyler and my hair still looks very healthy and I have almost no split ends at all (same as before). When curling my hair I&#x27;ve even accidentally touched the heated barrel on medium temperature and it stung a bit but I was left with no burn or mark and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all afterwards. I highly recommend this to anyone, for me it is the only way to go whether you need low settings medium settings or to dry your hair with the high settings. Everything works as described.</li>
            <li> Great instyler, I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it</li>
            <li> Good product. I have really thick hair so sometimes it over heated and I had to let it cool.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair that takes forever to straighten. This has removed the blow dryer step completely! My hair is super soft and its so fast to style! I&#x27;ve only used this twice but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it goes in both directions. I still use a little product before running this through my hair because without it my hair is still frizzy and less shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes styling faster!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised that this has replaced my hair straightener. I have straight hair and used my straightener to smooth my hair and add volume. Now it has been replaced by my InStyler. It took a little getting used to, but I love this product. I&#x27;ve never actually used it on wet hair because I wash may hair at night, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work right out of the shower, but it works really well for my hair (fine &amp; straight) I like it so much that I&#x27;ve done demos for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am a klutz when it comes to styling my hair.  I always feel like I don&#x27;t have enough hands to be able to work the blow dryer and brush at the same time so usually I just aim the dryer at my hair and then put it down periodically to brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a klutz with this product but the fact that it combines the drying action and the brush makes me feel like it&#x27;s not that bad.  I still have to put this down to separate the piece hair I want to use it on and then pick it up again, but my hair looks surprisingly good -- and definitely better than with the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure that over time I will get more advanced in how I use this but for the time being having my hair look smooth when I dry it is a very good start.</li>
            <li> This InStyler rotating styler makes it explicitly clear in it&#x27;s instructions (and product labels) to towel dry your hair first as thoroughly as possible in order to take advantage of the &#x27;wet to dry&#x27; functionality. Under these conditions your dampened hair does manage to effectively dry out while running it through the styler and you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when you hear some snaps and crackles as the moisture is evaporated via the heating barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1.25\\&quot; barrel seems to be at its best creating loose, flowing curls. Anything tighter will require a bit more technique and effort but even for those first getting accustomed to the styler you&#x27;ll have no problems producing decent/acceptable results and can gradually work your way up to expanded styling options as your familiarity with the product increases. Overall, this styler does a good job drying out your hair and a proper run through of your strands will always produce a healthy looking sheen with noticeable volume lift.</li>
            <li> Very good product and excellent service.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mother, and she loved it !</li>
            <li> Received this late last week.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this instyler to anyone with very unruly hair.  I let my hair dry naturally, then wet my hands and ran them through my hair before using the instyler.  It works great.  Remember to use lower settings if your hair is thin.  If you follow directions, you can do anything with this tool.</li>
            <li> My hair was damp when I used it and still didn&#x27;t dry it after five times. I blowed dried my hair to almost dry and then tried using the instyler again all it did was make my hair a little frizzy. Was so excited to get this, but wasn&#x27;t impressed. It&#x27;s a great concept, but it needs improvement.</li>
            <li> This was difficult and cumbersome to use. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth and straight or even smooth and curly. This thing made my hair frizzy. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this apprehensively bc it was a lot of money and the reviews seemed on the fence. After I got it I used it for almost a month before desideing to write a review bc it takes time to learn how to use a hair tool. I have not rly styled my hair with it yet other than straightning and a few curls but the first thing I noticed is it says wet to dry and is supposed to save u time. Well to me I figured I wouldn&#x27;t have to use my hair dryer or straightener ne more. However, u still have to use a hair dryer if ur in a rush bc it dosent get ur hair fully dry for about 30 min to an hour and ur roots half to air dry bc obviously you&#x27;ll burn urself. So overall I think it&#x27;s not worth the money. I still use my old straightener from walmart bc the Instyler makes my bangs and hair frizzy and seems to take to much time to get my hair as straight as I want it to be. (P.s. I have naturally fine straight/ a lil wavy hair)</li>
            <li> My online question was a about it works on dual voltage and the answer was Yes ir is. But i have received the product and it is not. So...will not work in mu country! Can i have my money back??</li>
            <li> Difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t curl easily&lt;br /&gt;I burned myself trying to use</li>
            <li> i love this iron. if you watch the videos they recommend on the owners manual its really simple and you will see just how to use it to make it work. when they say &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34; they DO NOT mean straight out the shower without even quick ring out them mean towel dry it a little bit that takes but a few seconds! i do my hair section by section and it has worked perfectly fine it even works better then my ionic straightener that i have! i love the shine my hair has when i am done using it although i also use heat protector products when i do anything with irons of any sort or blow dryer. My hair is very wavy and not the nice wavy hair you see on tv i got the waves all over the place hot mess kind of waves! BUT when i use this iron my hair comes out so soft, smooth, and straight but not pin straight like a natural looking straight and i absolutely love it! i could not be happier with it!</li>
            <li> Oops I meant to give it 3 stars. It is a great styler for dry hair, but not for wet hair. This is my second instyler, the fiirst one I got about a year ago but one of the brushes broke~the rep I spoke to said they do not make replacements :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work how is said takes to much time</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend for her B-day. She absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think she uses anything else to straighten her hair.&lt;br /&gt;She takes it every where.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great gift for you Guys out there........ Major brownie points!</li>
            <li> never should have bought</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Instyler. It has meet all my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Less quality compare to other instyler I bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Pieces seemed to start getting loose after first week of use</li>
            <li> Product took as long as using a hair dryer and flat iron...no time saving benefits.</li>
            <li> 100% satis field.tanks</li>
            <li> This works fairly well, however, the “wet to dry” thing proved (with me anyway) to be a joke.  Even with damp hair, it didn’t do the trick and didn’t dry my hair.  Do yourself a favor and do it with freshly dried hair (before styling products are added).  There are videos on youtube you can watch that might help, but, what it boils down to is that you have to find your own groove with it.  That could take a few times of using it.  Once you have your own system down, everything is cool.  Just make sure there’s tension in the hair when pulling it down the hair and that you pull it slowly.  Honestly, I don’t feel that the spinning brush does much except make sounds.  I suppose it holds the hair taught while the flat iron goes through.  Be careful—it’s easy to accidentally hit the off button.  It’s located at the bottom of the tool where the cord connects to it.  You hit it once for low, twice for medium and three times for the high setting.  If you accidentally hit it again, (which is so easy to do) it shuts it off.&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler comes with a safety cover to prevent burns.  It’s a black cagey looking thing that clips to the length of the tool.  This hasn’t gotten in my way at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t say for sure if the Instyler is better than a traditional flat iron or not.  I know that the Maxiglide I had for 5 years (just died on me) was wonderful and I highly prefer that to this, but, they stopped manufacturing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS--here&#x27;s a helpful tip--buy it at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because not only can you use a 20% off coupon, but, if you hate it, they&#x27;ll take it back! :)</li>
            <li> It is 120V and in my country it is 220.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad</li>
