            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the best experiences with the Tweezerman products I personally own.</li>

            <li>This worked great..  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>Him and I both love tweezerman tweezers, so I figured that these would be equally impressive.</li>
            <li>Very happy with quality of product, much better than anything I could find at a grocery,drug store..</li>
            <li>These are excellent clippers and cut amazingly smooth...</li>
            <li>believe those ones would be as good,</li>
            <li>and he needed a really good nail clipper set.</li>
            <li>This one, not so good.  </li>
            <li>They look good  </li>
            <li>THEY LOOKED SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>They are workable and the blade seems good</li>
            <li>Considering these are fairly inexpensive</li>
            <li>Revlon makes a good clipper at a lot lower cost.</li>
            <li>really be good with a built in nail file, without it....almost a loser.</li>
            <li>Darn good nail clippers and value for the money.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a good set of nail clippers and these looked like they were made well.  </li>
            <li>Under $10 seems like a fair price.</li>
            <li>Good quality and nicely&lt;br /&gt;made.</li>
            <li>These clippers look good in the picture</li>
            <li>and they do a good job of clipping nail.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very satisfied...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a very good product; nice steel, perfect cuts, and looks it&#x27;s gonna last a good couple of years.</li>
            <li>They will work better and have a nail file too!</li>
            <li>I put them in is stocking, and he was pleased!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just amazing ..</li>
            <li>The truth is, Tweezerman nail clippers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>delivered in a nice package, appears to be machined well,  works well.   </li>
            <li>(I spend a lot of time away from my own stuff--</li>
            <li>They do look nice</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>These are a nice pair of nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>Clean and non-ragged cuts make the job so easy and appearances especially good.  </li>
            <li>Nice clippers, but</li>
            <li>A file would be nice improvement to these clippers.</li>
            <li>I kind of regret that I bought them.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are perfect for guys and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li>Guess these are kind of overkill for me.  </li>
            <li>these look really nice</li>
            <li>If you are looking for decent quality clippers then consider these.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>really great set, with clean finish.</li>
            <li>So they cut very easily.</li>
            <li>They looked good online, when I got them I was really impressed, not only do they cut nicely but the look stylish too.</li>
            <li>So far these have worked out wonderfully.</li>
            <li>But not in a lovable Reese-Witherspoon-circa-2001 kind of way.</li>
            <li>My search for good stainless steel clippers continues!!!</li>
            <li>These clipper do a great job and price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought a pair of tweezers for my eyebrows that were actually really good.</li>
            <li>The large clipper works great.  </li>
            <li>I have some 59 cent clippers that are better than these.</li>
            <li>Love these nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>Love that you get two.</li>
            <li>they go out of their way making \\&quot;you\\&quot; a satisfied \\&quot;customer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>I bought them because my household needed more than just the one set of clippers we&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure someone out there might prefer them this way, but I can&#x27;t imagine why or in what context.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>sure what I was expecting</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have the file attachment many nail clippers do but that aside the construction of these is top notch and</li>
            <li>I already have Tweezerman tweezers and love them</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another problem, besides not being able to trim your nails, is that the rivet that holds the lever pops off</li>
            <li>I love these-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should have more functionality built into them.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Able to trim as needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was fooled by many favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day it&#x27;s just a nail clipperâ€”but this one is made of heavier metal and clips much more efficiently than its $1 or $2 drugstore equivalents.</li>
            <li>Better than the ones you buy at the gas station.  </li>
            <li>Okay That is all I have to say.</li>
            <li>Most people on the planet want a concave cut that rounds your nails</li>
            <li>Got the clippers and they are top notch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 95% sure these are fakes.</li>
            <li>I bought this set on the recommendation of a prominent household product review site.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their entire line of products and this nailclipper is really great!</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were Tweezerman, and I was under the impression that Tweezerman was a safe brand to buy.</li>
            <li>Tweezers, clippers, even their emory boards are top notch.</li>
            <li>They feel much better in my hands than the cheaper ones you might find at a discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] which has worked great.</li>
            <li>What more can one expect from nail clippers.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy high quality products at a good prize, buy tweezeman!</li>
            <li>Will always buy from them, make very clean clips.</li>
            <li>The new set looks to have a slightly more robust pin, and they clip very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Tweezerman set of tweezers for about 5 years and was happy to see this set when I needed to get a new clipper.</li>
            <li>Could easily find something better.</li>
            <li>Has a nice brushed finish and does a great job of trimming finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>The brushed steel makes isn&#x27;t ideal for rotating the lever to and from safe mode.  </li>
            <li>After about three months of use, they&#x27;ve dulled to the point of becoming unusable.</li>
            <li>After breaking many cheap flimsy pairs i decided to step up to these.  </li>
            <li>I was able to smooth out the finish with a couple passes on a wire wheel, but I wish they offered a polished finish.</li>
            <li>but they are very sharp and better than the cheep stuff in town, best nail clipper i ever owned</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t easily see why</li>
            <li>They cut cleanly, and without over-stressing the top part of the clipper.  </li>
            <li>oh so easily.</li>
            <li>AND EASILY DO THE JOB WITHOUT ANY STRUGGLE.</li>
            <li>The way that the balance is used they are just easy to manipulate and use with ease.  </li>
            <li>but I will happily but that separate from the same brand as the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>I find them easy to handle</li>
            <li>Strong durable nail clipper.</li>
            <li>metal but seems to be strong enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i liked my old cheap ones better but these are without a doubt more durable.</li>
            <li>and his work fine too)  </li>
            <li>The clippers also don&#x27;t have a built-in nail file, which is fine with me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this set for over 2 years and everything still works fine.</li>
            <li>they worked fine...</li>
            <li>They work just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product but be careful because&lt;</li>
            <li>These feel solid and clip great.</li>
            <li>Still working wonderfully after a few years.</li>
            <li>Also, with a lifetime warrany and free sharpening, there&#x27;s no risk to buying this item.  </li>
            <li>The Tweezerman clippers are a great overall product.</li>
            <li>A fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>If you are considering buying some cheap knock-off, save your money and go for the cadillac of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>They are more than worth the price.</li>
            <li>The price was great for a set of such quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the matte finish, I prefer a smooth polished finish</li>
            <li>The cheap ones of course do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cheap ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace my primary nail cutters but this pair was not up to my standards.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was a cheap and well reviewed nail clipper</li>
            <li>&amp; it does not have any cheap file attached.  </li>
            <li>This is a really cheap product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Hence it&#x27;s nice to have stainless steel nail clippers that you might take into a shower or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to to file them smooth with a separate nail file.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are made in China but there is a free sharpening guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an issue with even cheap drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set because I liked my wife&#x27;s Tweezerman clipper so much.</li>
            <li>These are very well built nicely constructed clippers.  </li>
            <li>But there is one thing missing that seems to have been an excellent invention</li>
            <li>The quality of these clippers is great especially at the price.</li>
            <li>and then they produced a product so cheap that your fingernails have ragged edges.</li>
            <li>The smaller nail clipper is great for fingers.  </li>
            <li>These are nice heavy clippers that work great.  </li>
            <li>These do an excellent job of clipping my thick nails, and they do it with a nice clean cut the first time!</li>
            <li>, they are Sharp and cut clean and quick and one of the best parts is the company will sharpen them for free</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I did not have the original packaging</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for and these are worth paying for (if you do not lose them!)</li>
            <li>Your original implement will not be returned.</li>
            <li>REMEMBER HOW I OBTAINED THE ORIGINAL)</li>
            <li>LIKE THE ORIGINAL DOES.  </li>
            <li>These clippers, both of them, do not cut clean.</li>
            <li>They cut clean and sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why, I don&#x27;t know, but the lack of one means you can&#x27;t clean underneath your nails with the pointy end of the file.</li>
            <li>consider Tweezerman to generally be the best brand available when it comes to manual personal grooming items like scissors, tweezers, and clippers.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!</li>
            <li>Nothing special here, but does get it&#x27;s job done.</li>
            <li>They were right!  </li>
            <li>They do their job just right!</li>
            <li>The clippers are straight rather than curved so they do not create nice rounded corners, but that is not difficult to fix.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about tweeter man.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman clippers work great and stay sharp.</li>
            <li>what a great deal on these clippers, they are very sturdy and made to last.</li>
            <li>, Tuesday 9/20/2011.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived really quick.</li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very high quality and get the job done easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are great clippers that are very sharp and operate</li>
            <li>but these are nothing new or better.</li>
            <li>review follows:&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago (so about 2 years old), they started tearing the nails and not cutting cleanly without having to apply a lot more pressure to the cutters.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two sets: the first ones were great; second set, not so much.</li>
            <li>As someone who was tired of cheap clippers that would either break or rust easily these were a welcome improvement.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised that the edges of these clippers didn&#x27;t line up perfectly when I took them out of the package.</li>
            <li>A very high quality product that doesnt feel cheap in my hands.</li>
            <li>They seem very well built compared to the cheap drugstore ones that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Though the stainless feels like each piece is stamped with semi-sharp edges, the clippers are stronger than the cheap ones that I have bought from the drug store.  </li>
            <li>A bit to pricy but is worth it</li>
            <li>worth the price and would buy again</li>
            <li>Not at all worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say these are worth the $9</li>
            <li>well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Forever stamp: $0.44), were pretty quick about it, and the clippers work well.  </li>
            <li>Also, they didn&#x27;t cut nearly as quiet and cleanly as my wife&#x27;s authentic Tweezerman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this set for my husband whom is very pickey about his clippers.</li>
            <li>I spent more money than I normally would on clippers, thinking it was time to get a nice pair.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, and the movement seems good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Priced right.  </li>
            <li>when you press, it clips of the nail right there.</li>
            <li>These nail and toenail clippers work well and are sized right.</li>
            <li>The finger nail clipper is all right, but I ended up buying a dedicated toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li>Work great for me; don&#x27;t feel like they will fall apart like others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>We were hoping for a sharp easy to use clipper better than the Revlon variety.  </li>
            <li>ITEM DELIVERED QUICKLY AND IS VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also surprised how easily these rusted.</li>
            <li>Plus they are priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>i hope to have more luck with my next order.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I immediately regretted my purchase upon first use.  </li>
            <li>Threw them in the trash after first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically you could get a much better product by spending $2.99 at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>We have many pair because these are the only ones my husband will use.</li>
            <li>It is worth noting there isn&#x27;t a built in file, but I don&#x27;t really use them anyway.  </li>
            <li>They have a lifetime sharpening guarantee - pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>The Seki&#x27;s are a step above the Tweezerman&#x27;s but Seki&#x27;s also cost more.</li>
            <li>the whole reason I bought them!.  </li>
            <li>On top of that they cut my nails about the same as the $3 chrome-plate clippers from the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered &amp; got it promptly.  </li>
            <li>My hubby got these for Christmas (from me) and he really likes them, they do the job!  </li>
            <li>I must say these have held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman also offers FREE sharpening of all their implements.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to cut your nails when they&#x27;re wet.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the cut is convex!  </li>
            <li>Overall, just a fine set of clippers and worthy of continued use.</li>
            <li>I threw them away upon first use.  </li>
            <li>Would probably be ok if it were just left on the counter.</li>
            <li>The weight of the Tweezerman is the first thing that one notices.</li>
            <li>Not that i&#x27;m an avid consumer of nail clippers, but these have surpassed my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>It works nice, appears to be sharp and well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other tweezerman products that I&#x27;ve liked so trusted the name brand.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>:  Don&#x27;t cut close or clean and frequently leave hangnails.  </li>
            <li>I used the large, straight one right after getting it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased a tweezerman stainless nail clipper set.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a minor curve which better follows my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The title of my review pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li>I found them to be solid and sharp and at a great price for this product.</li>
            <li>I love them -- particularly the larger size for toenails.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp!  </li>
            <li>Works great on my normal nails, and my husband&#x27;s freaky, monstrously thick toe nails.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a good set of clippers for a long time and finally tried these.</li>
            <li>They have a certain heft to them, and you can feel the quality.</li>
            <li>The one positive thing (that moved my rating up from 1 star) is that the large toenail clipper is straight rather than arc-shaped, so you can clip straight across the nail as you are supposed to do to avoid ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>Tough loss, because this product is still great without it.</li>
            <li>After having so many bad clippers, these are great.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>We like the clippers that are straight across.  </li>
            <li>If you need a real workout for your hand, then go ahead and get these, if not, consider something else.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like them, but the toenail clippers are so mis-aligned that they rip instead of cut.  </li>
            <li>Very inconsistent quality on these clippers.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would not matter to me</li>
            <li>ones are sturdy enough to withstand cheap version maybe ..  </li>
            <li>I used to use cheap clippers and after getting these, I will never go back as I now see the quality of cut and build.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy, stainless , and a well known brand.  </li>
            <li>not because they were made in Asia like all the others, but because they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) were advertised as stainless steel and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These went straight into the trash-</li>
            <li>how can stainless steel rust?</li>
            <li>I give it a 2 for the fact that we have a stainless steel item that is rusting.</li>
            <li>The fingernail clipper cuts a rounded edge, and the toenail clipper cuts a straight edge (for preventing ingrown toenails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clip much easier too.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set]]</li>
            <li>With a convex edge, I end up having to make between a dozen and twenty cuts on each nail, to get a contour that resembles the fingertip.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t conceive of a valid reason to make nail clippers straight or convex.  </li>
            <li>Reordered Seki clippers and they work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are made of a material that is light, but feels really solid when using them.</li>
            <li>My unbranded, made-in-China, drugstore clippers work much better.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my nail clippers and have been using Revlon clippers for a while</li>
            <li>every way that it&#x27;s different from the cheap ones</li>
            <li>I expected better quality from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>They seem to be made of stainless steel and have not rusted.  </li>
            <li>I only use them when I can&#x27;t find my cheap clippers these were purchased to replace.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any product from Tweezerman!</li>
            <li>Then you open the package and find them to be heavier than the cheap, shiny ones you may be used to.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made nail clipper set.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers are curved, and the toenail clippers are almost straight.</li>
            <li>They come in a matte, stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li>However this toenail clipper gives a convex cut and will give your toenails horns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to really think about the quality of a toe nail clipper before.</li>
            <li>Too much work to return for refund.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel that does not feel like a</li>
            <li>These are stainless steel</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>THE CLIPPERS CUT VERY WELL</li>
            <li>heavier duty metal and much sharper.  </li>
            <li>Decided to give it 4 stars and not 3 because it clips really, really well.</li>
            <li>IT worked very well for about 2 weeks and then fell appart in my pocket.</li>
            <li>By definition, not made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>These clippers feel very durable as well.</li>
            <li>Over 6 months, the blades got progressively duller and so they did not hold the edge very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have stainless products from Rubis and Seiki Edge that can sit in water for days and not show even the slightest bit of oxidation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have stainless products from Rubis and Seiki Edge that can sit in water for days and not show even the slightest bit of oxidation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also look really nice--polished stainless steel.</li>
            <li>and it cuts nails very well..</li>
            <li>This set works very well.  </li>
            <li>Pros&lt;br /&gt;Solid Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;Low</li>
            <li>, because of the dullness of the blades, the cuts are very rough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>these are made well and seem very durable, just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall this was a nice, simple purchase that I don&#x27;t regret in the slightest.</li>
            <li>This Tweezerman fingernail clipper does a superior job of cutting the nail, almost good enough to not need a file.</li>
            <li>just wish they were more sharp .</li>
            <li>I havent had a problem yet and love my other tweezerman products</li>
            <li>I would prefer they both have a curve, as most all of my other nail clippers have.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, it has given me the opportunity to learn how nail clippers are put together, but the frequency with which they collapse is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Apparently this product has much better quality, but the productivity was almost the same.</li>
            <li>To me, this is the only way to ensure a clean clip with ease.  </li>
            <li>They are really really sharp, which is great but be careful with over clipping or getting your skin!</li>
            <li>Next, they notice that there is no rotating file/picker thing that helps clean under the nails.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is good stuff</li>
            <li>This is a high quality Stainless Nail Clipper Set from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I used to have to grapple with my old clippers in order to cut my toenails (which are not enormously thick or anything), but these clippers cut right through.</li>
            <li>have never had more fragile nails in my life than when I used this product; now that I&#x27;m back to quality clippers, I have almost no broken</li>
            <li>I guess I was lucky with the set I was sent after some reviews said the edges were rough and didn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
            <li>These are very heavy duty and nice.  </li>
            <li>They cut very well, sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, stainless steel (never rust), and very simple.</li>
            <li>One less thing to have to share :)</li>
            <li>These are solidly built, and are sure to last.</li>
            <li>After trying them a few times and wondering why they didn&#x27;t work well, I finally accepted the fact that they look good but won&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>The main problem is that because of the angle that the clipping edge is made, you can&#x27;t trim up close.</li>
            <li>I love the smaller size, he likes the bigger set.</li>
            <li>At least more so than the cheap-o ones I was dealing with!</li>
            <li>I have no idea what nail clippers all these other people are reviewing, but the ones I have don&#x27;t work and turn something quick and easy into a massive chore.</li>
            <li>My mom had a Revlon from the 60s that was extremely high quality.  </li>
            <li>They do appear to be durable and of reasonably high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality nail clipper set.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for a quality pair of nail clippers made from Grade A materials.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it and get it back together, but I was not thrilled that it was that easy for them to come apart.</li>
            <li>The toenail clippers are actually a bit too large for my smaller toes, but for a man&#x27;s toes they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>nail clippers that are real sharp and IMHO do better job than this ones ..</li>
            <li>I would guess they are made from a low grade of 400-series stainless steel that holds an edge better then some other types of stainless but also rusts...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfortable to hold, easy to use, and sharp.</li>
            <li>They were sharp and cut cleanly, and seemed to be high quality, stainless steel</li>
            <li>This is a simple and useful nail clipper set.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the extra dollars for the quality.  </li>
            <li>wish I had looked closely at the tiny photo so that I might have observed that the blade on the larger clipper was not concave, although the blade on the shorter clipper, which is much more clearly shown in the picture,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many pairs of nail clippers I&#x27;ve bought from stores like Target or Walgreens -- not cheap ones either -- yet none of them compare to these Tweezerman clippers.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are good, but the small pair fell apart on me on the second use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how long that will last but will update when I know more.</li>
            <li>Seem to work just fine and are sharp.</li>
            <li>These are fine for the money I would recommend to other people.</li>
            <li>I was tired of the cheap clippers that bend easily.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a short nail you can&#x27;t get close in enought to cut it right.</li>
            <li>I finally caved in and quit buying the $1 clippers at cvs that sucked and broke right away.</li>
            <li>I love them, and they are so sharp that you WILL make yourself bleed if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and quick growing nails and yet these clippers work great with little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>However, the large toenail clippers are not sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown all the other ones (cheaply made) that I used to have away.</li>
            <li>They are a bit harder to press down than other ones, but the end result is all that matters, and they deliver good clean cuts.</li>
            <li>I sent them in to Tweezerman for repair/replacement, and they replaced them with a brand new set.  </li>
            <li>so I was in the market for new clippers.  </li>
            <li>My husband was overdue for new clippers.</li>
            <li>I nned new clippers and found that the Tweezeman clippers were rated well.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE concern for products such as clippers, tweezers, and scissors given how this can present health risks!</li>
            <li>These are nice heavy duty nail clippers, but mine started rusting towards the back.</li>
            <li>Head to the nearest discount store or pharmacy and toss a couple of bucks for a cheap, basic, generic, unpretentious and not over-packaged pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my hands and went back to just the regular clippers that are light weight.  </li>
            <li>Inspected thoroughly and I was surprised by the high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Could find something of the exact same quality at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a standard set of nail clippers that aren&#x27;t crappy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just got unlucky with the Tweezerman but the fact that my first and only purchase was defective make me question the quality control.</li>
            <li>The cut cleanly and have a sharp edge.  </li>
            <li>Cuts sharply and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>GIVE A SHARP CLEAN CUT</li>
            <li>But for all that it&#x27;s worth, the price (remember they are a whopping 7-10 times MORE expensive than the regular ones) is worth paying for in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Cheap, not so sharp, no fingernail file, the larger one is straight, not curved.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out that while the main body and lever arm of the clippers are stainless steel, the pin that connects the pieces together is made out of a softer metal/alloy and it has been deforming from the pressure of clipping and also being gouged by the harder stainless steel pieces.  </li>
            <li>With the clean stainless steel construction, these clippers are expected to last forever.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something just a bit better than your average, Chinese nail clipper from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>are much bigger than I expected them to be, but it makes it very easy for us people with larger hands.</li>
            <li>Go spend a little more money on something German.</li>
            <li>I had assumed these toenail clippers would be shaped like every other nail clipper I have ever used, and didn&#x27;t know I needed to &amp;#34;beware&amp;#34; the tricky straight (slightly convex) blade shape when shopping for a new one.  </li>
            <li>so you push harder and you can see the HUGE amount of flex/bend in the arm of the clipper before it actually clips the nail.</li>
            <li>clippers basically fell apart when they were two years old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For $10 for a pair of clippers, I would expect it to last much, much longer than 3 years.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a fan of the stainless look) and cut well and even though they&#x27;re only nail clippers, $9 wasn&#x27;t a fortune to pay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, no problems.</li>
            <li>On the toe nail clipper I miss the file that my old nail clippers, toe and finger had.</li>
            <li>I have been very happily surprised.</li>
            <li>This is a bulldog&#x27;s mouth with teeth too far from the objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Larger nail clipper has no curve it is a straight edge.  </li>
            <li>They are stainless steel, and you can definitely feel the difference in quality between these and the 99-cent clippers you buy at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s far from polished.</li>
            <li>They seem to be very sturdy and will probably last a while.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a La Cross clipper with a clip catcher at a drug store, which have worked very well.</li>
            <li>I paid their comparatively hefty price because they were advertised as stainless and I like to buy things that will last.  </li>
            <li>Whereas it should be more &amp;#34;pointy.&amp;#34; Think of a bulldog&#x27;s short mouth trying to eat a bug in a narrow hole.</li>
            <li>These work well enough and are worth the $10 seeing how they will probably last for ever.</li>
            <li>You can tell they are good quality and were not all that expensive.  </li>
            <li>Some have commmented that they arent sharp enough but they seem to work fine for me so far.</li>
            <li>This makes a very nice stocking stuffer, especially for the men in the family, who I find difficult to buy for.</li>
            <li>The brushed metal finish is fantastic and the cutters are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>I miss the little swing-out pin though to clean the edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>Effortless to use, even on my titanium like nails, the clippers make clean, burr-less cuts that require little or no touch up with a file.</li>
            <li>when i first ordered these i felt i paid too much, but i am not very glad that i got them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After buying and subsequently throwing away countless pairs of nail clippers, I decided to look for something that absolutely does not rust!</li>
            <li>THIS &#x27;TWEEZERMAN STAINLESS NAIL CLIPPER SET&#x27; IS THE FIRST SET I&#x27;VE FOUND WHICH IS HEAVY AND MANAGEABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO MAKE A SHARP, CLEAN CUT</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quality, and highly polished surfaces resist rust even when left on the shower</li>
            <li>They are made out of a very high quality steel, are super sharp and require minimal effort to use.</li>
            <li>I lost that pair so needed a new &#x27;big&#x27; clipper.</li>
            <li>I have a Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Wide Grip Slant</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are solid stainless for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a major hassle and it makes me just want to throw them out.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;the blades are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>Bare bones!  </li>
            <li>They barely cut &amp; when they do, it&#x27;s not a sharp even edge.</li>
            <li>The slightly and almost unseen rough surfaces of the clippers permit easy use and a reduction of slippage.  </li>
            <li>The finish of both clippers is dull which makes them feel cheap, and the blades are so blunt that you really have to work to cut the nail, which is not very reasuring during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sharpen our Tweezers, Nippers and Scissors which have become dull through normal use FREE for as long as the implement can be resharpened.</li>
            <li>week, it finally became clear what the problem was:  </li>
            <li>(they just moved their repair center, and were projecting 6 weeks, so it was a reasonable turn-around).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why these are apparently made just for</li>
            <li>I should have kept these and sent him packing with my old, generic clipper.</li>
            <li>My old toenail cutters were the same design</li>
            <li>I actually threw out my old clippers to use these instead.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set to not only get a new clipper for use at home, but also to have the smaller clipper to throw in my travel kit.  </li>
            <li>You will end up with perfectly straight edges and sharp points all over the place.  </li>
            <li>The thick steel pretty much guarantees these should last forever,</li>
            <li>I bought this because my Podiatrist told me I would get more ingrown toenails if I didn&#x27;t start cutting my toes with a straight nail clipper.</li>
            <li>The little clipper sprang apart the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Instead of being the light, effective, well-designed, easy-to-use clippers available at any local store, these clippers are heavy, poorly designed (actually hurts my hands to press on them), they can&#x27;t cut unless you experiment and experiment with every single angle on every single fingernail, and even then you worry that if you don&#x27;t get it exactly right, you are going to end up accidentally cutting yourself.</li>
            <li>A heavy, substantial, well-made product that is sharp, precise and made to do one thing, clip your nail well.</li>
            <li>On at least four occasions I have had both fingernail and toenail clippers abruptly fall apart during nothing more strenuous than a routine nail trimming.</li>
            <li>I think the angle between the 2 edges is&amp;#34; too vertical&amp;#34; -- straight up and down.</li>
            <li>New, they are sharper than my other toenail clippers</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are excellent clippers and cut amazingly smooth...</li>

            <li> THEY LOOKED SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> They are workable and the blade seems good</li>
            <li> Considering these are fairly inexpensive</li>
            <li> Revlon makes a good clipper at a lot lower cost.</li>
            <li> really be good with a built in nail file, without it....almost a loser.</li>
            <li> Darn good nail clippers and value for the money.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a good set of nail clippers and these looked like they were made well.  </li>
            <li> Under $10 seems like a fair price.</li>
            <li> Good quality and nicely&lt;br /&gt;made.</li>
            <li> These clippers look good in the picture</li>
            <li> and they do a good job of clipping nail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very satisfied...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a very good product; nice steel, perfect cuts, and looks it&#x27;s gonna last a good couple of years.</li>
            <li> They will work better and have a nail file too!</li>
            <li> I put them in is stocking, and he was pleased!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just amazing ..</li>
            <li> The truth is, Tweezerman nail clippers are amazing.  </li>
            <li> delivered in a nice package, appears to be machined well,  works well.   </li>
            <li> (I spend a lot of time away from my own stuff--</li>
            <li> They do look nice</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> These are a nice pair of nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Clean and non-ragged cuts make the job so easy and appearances especially good.  </li>
            <li> Nice clippers, but</li>
            <li> A file would be nice improvement to these clippers.</li>
            <li> I kind of regret that I bought them.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are perfect for guys and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Guess these are kind of overkill for me.  </li>
            <li> these look really nice</li>
            <li> If you are looking for decent quality clippers then consider these.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> really great set, with clean finish.</li>
            <li> So they cut very easily.</li>
            <li> They looked good online, when I got them I was really impressed, not only do they cut nicely but the look stylish too.</li>
            <li> So far these have worked out wonderfully.</li>
            <li> But not in a lovable Reese-Witherspoon-circa-2001 kind of way.</li>
            <li> My search for good stainless steel clippers continues!!!</li>
            <li> These clipper do a great job and price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought a pair of tweezers for my eyebrows that were actually really good.</li>
            <li> The large clipper works great.  </li>
            <li> I have some 59 cent clippers that are better than these.</li>
            <li> Love these nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Love that you get two.</li>
            <li> they go out of their way making \\&quot;you\\&quot; a satisfied \\&quot;customer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> I bought them because my household needed more than just the one set of clippers we&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure someone out there might prefer them this way, but I can&#x27;t imagine why or in what context.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> sure what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the file attachment many nail clippers do but that aside the construction of these is top notch and</li>
            <li> I already have Tweezerman tweezers and love them</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem, besides not being able to trim your nails, is that the rivet that holds the lever pops off</li>
            <li> I love these-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should have more functionality built into them.</li>
            <li> They are simply the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Able to trim as needed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was fooled by many favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day it&#x27;s just a nail clipperâ€”but this one is made of heavier metal and clips much more efficiently than its $1 or $2 drugstore equivalents.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones you buy at the gas station.  </li>
            <li> Okay That is all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Most people on the planet want a concave cut that rounds your nails</li>
            <li> Got the clippers and they are top notch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 95% sure these are fakes.</li>
            <li> I bought this set on the recommendation of a prominent household product review site.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their entire line of products and this nailclipper is really great!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were Tweezerman, and I was under the impression that Tweezerman was a safe brand to buy.</li>
            <li> Tweezers, clippers, even their emory boards are top notch.</li>
            <li> They feel much better in my hands than the cheaper ones you might find at a discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] which has worked great.</li>
            <li> What more can one expect from nail clippers.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy high quality products at a good prize, buy tweezeman!</li>
            <li> Will always buy from them, make very clean clips.</li>
            <li> The new set looks to have a slightly more robust pin, and they clip very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Tweezerman set of tweezers for about 5 years and was happy to see this set when I needed to get a new clipper.</li>
            <li> Could easily find something better.</li>
            <li> Has a nice brushed finish and does a great job of trimming finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> The brushed steel makes isn&#x27;t ideal for rotating the lever to and from safe mode.  </li>
            <li> After about three months of use, they&#x27;ve dulled to the point of becoming unusable.</li>
            <li> After breaking many cheap flimsy pairs i decided to step up to these.  </li>
            <li> I was able to smooth out the finish with a couple passes on a wire wheel, but I wish they offered a polished finish.</li>
            <li> but they are very sharp and better than the cheep stuff in town, best nail clipper i ever owned</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t easily see why</li>
            <li> They cut cleanly, and without over-stressing the top part of the clipper.  </li>
            <li> oh so easily.</li>
            <li> AND EASILY DO THE JOB WITHOUT ANY STRUGGLE.</li>
            <li> The way that the balance is used they are just easy to manipulate and use with ease.  </li>
            <li> but I will happily but that separate from the same brand as the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> I find them easy to handle</li>
            <li> Strong durable nail clipper.</li>
            <li> metal but seems to be strong enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i liked my old cheap ones better but these are without a doubt more durable.</li>
            <li> and his work fine too)  </li>
            <li> The clippers also don&#x27;t have a built-in nail file, which is fine with me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for over 2 years and everything still works fine.</li>
            <li> they worked fine...</li>
            <li> They work just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product but be careful because&lt;</li>
            <li> These feel solid and clip great.</li>
            <li> Still working wonderfully after a few years.</li>
            <li> Also, with a lifetime warrany and free sharpening, there&#x27;s no risk to buying this item.  </li>
            <li> The Tweezerman clippers are a great overall product.</li>
            <li> A fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying some cheap knock-off, save your money and go for the cadillac of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> They are more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> The price was great for a set of such quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the matte finish, I prefer a smooth polished finish</li>
            <li> The cheap ones of course do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheap ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my primary nail cutters but this pair was not up to my standards.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a cheap and well reviewed nail clipper</li>
            <li> &amp; it does not have any cheap file attached.  </li>
            <li> This is a really cheap product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Hence it&#x27;s nice to have stainless steel nail clippers that you might take into a shower or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to to file them smooth with a separate nail file.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are made in China but there is a free sharpening guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an issue with even cheap drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set because I liked my wife&#x27;s Tweezerman clipper so much.</li>
            <li> These are very well built nicely constructed clippers.  </li>
            <li> But there is one thing missing that seems to have been an excellent invention</li>
            <li> The quality of these clippers is great especially at the price.</li>
            <li> and then they produced a product so cheap that your fingernails have ragged edges.</li>
            <li> The smaller nail clipper is great for fingers.  </li>
            <li> These are nice heavy clippers that work great.  </li>
            <li> These do an excellent job of clipping my thick nails, and they do it with a nice clean cut the first time!</li>
            <li> , they are Sharp and cut clean and quick and one of the best parts is the company will sharpen them for free</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> I did not have the original packaging</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for and these are worth paying for (if you do not lose them!)</li>
            <li> Your original implement will not be returned.</li>
            <li> REMEMBER HOW I OBTAINED THE ORIGINAL)</li>
            <li> LIKE THE ORIGINAL DOES.  </li>
            <li> These clippers, both of them, do not cut clean.</li>
            <li> They cut clean and sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why, I don&#x27;t know, but the lack of one means you can&#x27;t clean underneath your nails with the pointy end of the file.</li>
            <li> consider Tweezerman to generally be the best brand available when it comes to manual personal grooming items like scissors, tweezers, and clippers.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> Nothing special here, but does get it&#x27;s job done.</li>
            <li> They were right!  </li>
            <li> They do their job just right!</li>
            <li> The clippers are straight rather than curved so they do not create nice rounded corners, but that is not difficult to fix.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about tweeter man.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman clippers work great and stay sharp.</li>
            <li> what a great deal on these clippers, they are very sturdy and made to last.</li>
            <li> , Tuesday 9/20/2011.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived really quick.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very high quality and get the job done easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are great clippers that are very sharp and operate</li>
            <li> but these are nothing new or better.</li>
            <li> review follows:&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago (so about 2 years old), they started tearing the nails and not cutting cleanly without having to apply a lot more pressure to the cutters.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two sets: the first ones were great; second set, not so much.</li>
            <li> As someone who was tired of cheap clippers that would either break or rust easily these were a welcome improvement.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the edges of these clippers didn&#x27;t line up perfectly when I took them out of the package.</li>
            <li> A very high quality product that doesnt feel cheap in my hands.</li>
            <li> They seem very well built compared to the cheap drugstore ones that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Though the stainless feels like each piece is stamped with semi-sharp edges, the clippers are stronger than the cheap ones that I have bought from the drug store.  </li>
            <li> A bit to pricy but is worth it</li>
            <li> worth the price and would buy again</li>
            <li> Not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say these are worth the $9</li>
            <li> well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Forever stamp: $0.44), were pretty quick about it, and the clippers work well.  </li>
            <li> Also, they didn&#x27;t cut nearly as quiet and cleanly as my wife&#x27;s authentic Tweezerman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this set for my husband whom is very pickey about his clippers.</li>
            <li> I spent more money than I normally would on clippers, thinking it was time to get a nice pair.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and the movement seems good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Priced right.  </li>
            <li> when you press, it clips of the nail right there.</li>
            <li> These nail and toenail clippers work well and are sized right.</li>
            <li> The finger nail clipper is all right, but I ended up buying a dedicated toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li> Work great for me; don&#x27;t feel like they will fall apart like others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> We were hoping for a sharp easy to use clipper better than the Revlon variety.  </li>
            <li> ITEM DELIVERED QUICKLY AND IS VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also surprised how easily these rusted.</li>
            <li> Plus they are priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> i hope to have more luck with my next order.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I immediately regretted my purchase upon first use.  </li>
            <li> Threw them in the trash after first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically you could get a much better product by spending $2.99 at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> We have many pair because these are the only ones my husband will use.</li>
            <li> It is worth noting there isn&#x27;t a built in file, but I don&#x27;t really use them anyway.  </li>
            <li> They have a lifetime sharpening guarantee - pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The Seki&#x27;s are a step above the Tweezerman&#x27;s but Seki&#x27;s also cost more.</li>
            <li> the whole reason I bought them!.  </li>
            <li> On top of that they cut my nails about the same as the $3 chrome-plate clippers from the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered &amp; got it promptly.  </li>
            <li> My hubby got these for Christmas (from me) and he really likes them, they do the job!  </li>
            <li> I must say these have held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman also offers FREE sharpening of all their implements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to cut your nails when they&#x27;re wet.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the cut is convex!  </li>
            <li> Overall, just a fine set of clippers and worthy of continued use.</li>
            <li> I threw them away upon first use.  </li>
            <li> Would probably be ok if it were just left on the counter.</li>
            <li> The weight of the Tweezerman is the first thing that one notices.</li>
            <li> Not that i&#x27;m an avid consumer of nail clippers, but these have surpassed my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> It works nice, appears to be sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tweezerman products that I&#x27;ve liked so trusted the name brand.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> :  Don&#x27;t cut close or clean and frequently leave hangnails.  </li>
            <li> I used the large, straight one right after getting it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a tweezerman stainless nail clipper set.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a minor curve which better follows my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The title of my review pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li> I found them to be solid and sharp and at a great price for this product.</li>
            <li> I love them -- particularly the larger size for toenails.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp!  </li>
            <li> Works great on my normal nails, and my husband&#x27;s freaky, monstrously thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good set of clippers for a long time and finally tried these.</li>
            <li> They have a certain heft to them, and you can feel the quality.</li>
            <li> The one positive thing (that moved my rating up from 1 star) is that the large toenail clipper is straight rather than arc-shaped, so you can clip straight across the nail as you are supposed to do to avoid ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Tough loss, because this product is still great without it.</li>
            <li> After having so many bad clippers, these are great.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> We like the clippers that are straight across.  </li>
            <li> If you need a real workout for your hand, then go ahead and get these, if not, consider something else.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like them, but the toenail clippers are so mis-aligned that they rip instead of cut.  </li>
            <li> Very inconsistent quality on these clippers.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would not matter to me</li>
            <li> ones are sturdy enough to withstand cheap version maybe ..  </li>
            <li> I used to use cheap clippers and after getting these, I will never go back as I now see the quality of cut and build.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy, stainless , and a well known brand.  </li>
            <li> not because they were made in Asia like all the others, but because they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) were advertised as stainless steel and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These went straight into the trash-</li>
            <li> how can stainless steel rust?</li>
            <li> I give it a 2 for the fact that we have a stainless steel item that is rusting.</li>
            <li> The fingernail clipper cuts a rounded edge, and the toenail clipper cuts a straight edge (for preventing ingrown toenails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clip much easier too.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set]]</li>
            <li> With a convex edge, I end up having to make between a dozen and twenty cuts on each nail, to get a contour that resembles the fingertip.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t conceive of a valid reason to make nail clippers straight or convex.  </li>
            <li> Reordered Seki clippers and they work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are made of a material that is light, but feels really solid when using them.</li>
            <li> My unbranded, made-in-China, drugstore clippers work much better.  </li>
            <li> They are much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my nail clippers and have been using Revlon clippers for a while</li>
            <li> every way that it&#x27;s different from the cheap ones</li>
            <li> I expected better quality from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> They seem to be made of stainless steel and have not rusted.  </li>
            <li> I only use them when I can&#x27;t find my cheap clippers these were purchased to replace.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any product from Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> Then you open the package and find them to be heavier than the cheap, shiny ones you may be used to.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made nail clipper set.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are curved, and the toenail clippers are almost straight.</li>
            <li> They come in a matte, stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li> However this toenail clipper gives a convex cut and will give your toenails horns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to really think about the quality of a toe nail clipper before.</li>
            <li> Too much work to return for refund.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel that does not feel like a</li>
            <li> These are stainless steel</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> THE CLIPPERS CUT VERY WELL</li>
            <li> heavier duty metal and much sharper.  </li>
            <li> Decided to give it 4 stars and not 3 because it clips really, really well.</li>
            <li> IT worked very well for about 2 weeks and then fell appart in my pocket.</li>
            <li> By definition, not made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> These clippers feel very durable as well.</li>
            <li> Over 6 months, the blades got progressively duller and so they did not hold the edge very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have stainless products from Rubis and Seiki Edge that can sit in water for days and not show even the slightest bit of oxidation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have stainless products from Rubis and Seiki Edge that can sit in water for days and not show even the slightest bit of oxidation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also look really nice--polished stainless steel.</li>
            <li> and it cuts nails very well..</li>
            <li> This set works very well.  </li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Solid Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;Low</li>
            <li> , because of the dullness of the blades, the cuts are very rough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> these are made well and seem very durable, just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall this was a nice, simple purchase that I don&#x27;t regret in the slightest.</li>
            <li> This Tweezerman fingernail clipper does a superior job of cutting the nail, almost good enough to not need a file.</li>
            <li> just wish they were more sharp .</li>
            <li> I havent had a problem yet and love my other tweezerman products</li>
            <li> I would prefer they both have a curve, as most all of my other nail clippers have.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side, it has given me the opportunity to learn how nail clippers are put together, but the frequency with which they collapse is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Apparently this product has much better quality, but the productivity was almost the same.</li>
            <li> To me, this is the only way to ensure a clean clip with ease.  </li>
            <li> They are really really sharp, which is great but be careful with over clipping or getting your skin!</li>
            <li> Next, they notice that there is no rotating file/picker thing that helps clean under the nails.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is good stuff</li>
            <li> This is a high quality Stainless Nail Clipper Set from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I used to have to grapple with my old clippers in order to cut my toenails (which are not enormously thick or anything), but these clippers cut right through.</li>
            <li> have never had more fragile nails in my life than when I used this product; now that I&#x27;m back to quality clippers, I have almost no broken</li>
            <li> I guess I was lucky with the set I was sent after some reviews said the edges were rough and didn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
            <li> These are very heavy duty and nice.  </li>
            <li> They cut very well, sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, stainless steel (never rust), and very simple.</li>
            <li> One less thing to have to share :)</li>
            <li> These are solidly built, and are sure to last.</li>
            <li> After trying them a few times and wondering why they didn&#x27;t work well, I finally accepted the fact that they look good but won&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> The main problem is that because of the angle that the clipping edge is made, you can&#x27;t trim up close.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size, he likes the bigger set.</li>
            <li> At least more so than the cheap-o ones I was dealing with!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what nail clippers all these other people are reviewing, but the ones I have don&#x27;t work and turn something quick and easy into a massive chore.</li>
            <li> My mom had a Revlon from the 60s that was extremely high quality.  </li>
            <li> They do appear to be durable and of reasonably high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like high quality.</li>
            <li> High quality nail clipper set.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for a quality pair of nail clippers made from Grade A materials.</li>
            <li> I was able to find it and get it back together, but I was not thrilled that it was that easy for them to come apart.</li>
            <li> The toenail clippers are actually a bit too large for my smaller toes, but for a man&#x27;s toes they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> nail clippers that are real sharp and IMHO do better job than this ones ..</li>
            <li> I would guess they are made from a low grade of 400-series stainless steel that holds an edge better then some other types of stainless but also rusts...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfortable to hold, easy to use, and sharp.</li>
            <li> They were sharp and cut cleanly, and seemed to be high quality, stainless steel</li>
            <li> This is a simple and useful nail clipper set.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the extra dollars for the quality.  </li>
            <li> wish I had looked closely at the tiny photo so that I might have observed that the blade on the larger clipper was not concave, although the blade on the shorter clipper, which is much more clearly shown in the picture,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many pairs of nail clippers I&#x27;ve bought from stores like Target or Walgreens -- not cheap ones either -- yet none of them compare to these Tweezerman clippers.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are good, but the small pair fell apart on me on the second use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long that will last but will update when I know more.</li>
            <li> Seem to work just fine and are sharp.</li>
            <li> These are fine for the money I would recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the cheap clippers that bend easily.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a short nail you can&#x27;t get close in enought to cut it right.</li>
            <li> I finally caved in and quit buying the $1 clippers at cvs that sucked and broke right away.</li>
            <li> I love them, and they are so sharp that you WILL make yourself bleed if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and quick growing nails and yet these clippers work great with little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> However, the large toenail clippers are not sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown all the other ones (cheaply made) that I used to have away.</li>
            <li> They are a bit harder to press down than other ones, but the end result is all that matters, and they deliver good clean cuts.</li>
            <li> I sent them in to Tweezerman for repair/replacement, and they replaced them with a brand new set.  </li>
            <li> so I was in the market for new clippers.  </li>
            <li> My husband was overdue for new clippers.</li>
            <li> I nned new clippers and found that the Tweezeman clippers were rated well.  </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE concern for products such as clippers, tweezers, and scissors given how this can present health risks!</li>
            <li> These are nice heavy duty nail clippers, but mine started rusting towards the back.</li>
            <li> Head to the nearest discount store or pharmacy and toss a couple of bucks for a cheap, basic, generic, unpretentious and not over-packaged pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and went back to just the regular clippers that are light weight.  </li>
            <li> Inspected thoroughly and I was surprised by the high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Could find something of the exact same quality at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a standard set of nail clippers that aren&#x27;t crappy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got unlucky with the Tweezerman but the fact that my first and only purchase was defective make me question the quality control.</li>
            <li> The cut cleanly and have a sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> Cuts sharply and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> GIVE A SHARP CLEAN CUT</li>
            <li> But for all that it&#x27;s worth, the price (remember they are a whopping 7-10 times MORE expensive than the regular ones) is worth paying for in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Cheap, not so sharp, no fingernail file, the larger one is straight, not curved.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out that while the main body and lever arm of the clippers are stainless steel, the pin that connects the pieces together is made out of a softer metal/alloy and it has been deforming from the pressure of clipping and also being gouged by the harder stainless steel pieces.  </li>
            <li> With the clean stainless steel construction, these clippers are expected to last forever.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something just a bit better than your average, Chinese nail clipper from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> are much bigger than I expected them to be, but it makes it very easy for us people with larger hands.</li>
            <li> Go spend a little more money on something German.</li>
            <li> I had assumed these toenail clippers would be shaped like every other nail clipper I have ever used, and didn&#x27;t know I needed to &amp;#34;beware&amp;#34; the tricky straight (slightly convex) blade shape when shopping for a new one.  </li>
            <li> so you push harder and you can see the HUGE amount of flex/bend in the arm of the clipper before it actually clips the nail.</li>
            <li> clippers basically fell apart when they were two years old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For $10 for a pair of clippers, I would expect it to last much, much longer than 3 years.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a fan of the stainless look) and cut well and even though they&#x27;re only nail clippers, $9 wasn&#x27;t a fortune to pay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, no problems.</li>
            <li> On the toe nail clipper I miss the file that my old nail clippers, toe and finger had.</li>
            <li> I have been very happily surprised.</li>
            <li> This is a bulldog&#x27;s mouth with teeth too far from the objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Larger nail clipper has no curve it is a straight edge.  </li>
            <li> They are stainless steel, and you can definitely feel the difference in quality between these and the 99-cent clippers you buy at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s far from polished.</li>
            <li> They seem to be very sturdy and will probably last a while.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a La Cross clipper with a clip catcher at a drug store, which have worked very well.</li>
            <li> I paid their comparatively hefty price because they were advertised as stainless and I like to buy things that will last.  </li>
            <li> Whereas it should be more &amp;#34;pointy.&amp;#34; Think of a bulldog&#x27;s short mouth trying to eat a bug in a narrow hole.</li>
            <li> These work well enough and are worth the $10 seeing how they will probably last for ever.</li>
            <li> You can tell they are good quality and were not all that expensive.  </li>
            <li> Some have commmented that they arent sharp enough but they seem to work fine for me so far.</li>
            <li> This makes a very nice stocking stuffer, especially for the men in the family, who I find difficult to buy for.</li>
            <li> The brushed metal finish is fantastic and the cutters are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> I miss the little swing-out pin though to clean the edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> Effortless to use, even on my titanium like nails, the clippers make clean, burr-less cuts that require little or no touch up with a file.</li>
            <li> when i first ordered these i felt i paid too much, but i am not very glad that i got them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After buying and subsequently throwing away countless pairs of nail clippers, I decided to look for something that absolutely does not rust!</li>
            <li> THIS &#x27;TWEEZERMAN STAINLESS NAIL CLIPPER SET&#x27; IS THE FIRST SET I&#x27;VE FOUND WHICH IS HEAVY AND MANAGEABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO MAKE A SHARP, CLEAN CUT</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quality, and highly polished surfaces resist rust even when left on the shower</li>
            <li> They are made out of a very high quality steel, are super sharp and require minimal effort to use.</li>
            <li> I lost that pair so needed a new &#x27;big&#x27; clipper.</li>
            <li> I have a Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Wide Grip Slant</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are solid stainless for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a major hassle and it makes me just want to throw them out.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;the blades are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> Bare bones!  </li>
            <li> They barely cut &amp; when they do, it&#x27;s not a sharp even edge.</li>
            <li> The slightly and almost unseen rough surfaces of the clippers permit easy use and a reduction of slippage.  </li>
            <li> The finish of both clippers is dull which makes them feel cheap, and the blades are so blunt that you really have to work to cut the nail, which is not very reasuring during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sharpen our Tweezers, Nippers and Scissors which have become dull through normal use FREE for as long as the implement can be resharpened.</li>
            <li> week, it finally became clear what the problem was:  </li>
            <li> (they just moved their repair center, and were projecting 6 weeks, so it was a reasonable turn-around).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are apparently made just for</li>
            <li> I should have kept these and sent him packing with my old, generic clipper.</li>
            <li> My old toenail cutters were the same design</li>
            <li> I actually threw out my old clippers to use these instead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to not only get a new clipper for use at home, but also to have the smaller clipper to throw in my travel kit.  </li>
            <li> You will end up with perfectly straight edges and sharp points all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The thick steel pretty much guarantees these should last forever,</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Podiatrist told me I would get more ingrown toenails if I didn&#x27;t start cutting my toes with a straight nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The little clipper sprang apart the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Instead of being the light, effective, well-designed, easy-to-use clippers available at any local store, these clippers are heavy, poorly designed (actually hurts my hands to press on them), they can&#x27;t cut unless you experiment and experiment with every single angle on every single fingernail, and even then you worry that if you don&#x27;t get it exactly right, you are going to end up accidentally cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> A heavy, substantial, well-made product that is sharp, precise and made to do one thing, clip your nail well.</li>
            <li> On at least four occasions I have had both fingernail and toenail clippers abruptly fall apart during nothing more strenuous than a routine nail trimming.</li>
            <li> I think the angle between the 2 edges is&amp;#34; too vertical&amp;#34; -- straight up and down.</li>
            <li> New, they are sharper than my other toenail clippers</li>
            <li> The smaller nail clipper is either very dull or misaligned, because it does not make a clean cut; my nails are frayed after I use this clipper</li>
            <li> Knives lose their cutting surface quickly; however, Tweezerman Nail Clippers do not lose their cutting edges anywhere near as quickly and that alone is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Makes clean cuts on thick nails, with enough pressure (not very sharp).&lt;br /&gt;Thin</li>
            <li> the Tweezers, Nippers or Scissors becomes damaged and cannot be sharpened, we will send you a coupon to purchase a new implement at half its current suggested price, redeemable on Tweezerman.com.</li>
            <li> These had little divots along the edges like older clippers do when you&#x27;ve used them to cut things like clothing tags, etc.  </li>
            <li> , I mean I have other set of &amp;#34; cheap &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The lever pops off nearly every other use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp but doesn&#x27;t clip as easily as my old Revlon clipper.  </li>
            <li> That said, I also think the toe clippers are a bit too flat and not curved enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving in my original review about how the clippers were broken, just FYI.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the edges of my nails rough and uneven, as it does not give a sharp, clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are dull (not sharp) and take unusual strength to cut through typical middle age adult nails (not elderly talons).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these for any average size male adult.</li>
            <li> and they threw in a small one as well (which I&#x27;ll probably never use, as I have a large curved one I&#x27;ve used a while and like).    </li>
            <li> the high price I feel is not justified by the quality of the item.</li>
            <li> These cost very little, appear to be very well made, and work quite well.</li>
            <li> I will see how long the sharpness of the clippers last.</li>
            <li> Also, the toenail clipper is a flat edge cut.</li>
            <li> I can tell they are well made and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> They both appear to be sturdy and I think they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> At the current price, I think these are a terrible value because it is more than twice the price of other products which are built better.</li>
            <li> At the current price, I think these are a terrible value because it is more than twice the price of other products which are built better.</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal to replace my nail clippers every few months.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say after a couple weeks with the new clippers I do miss the little swing out on my cheapos...</li>
            <li> Hopefully these will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less slippery and easier to hold onto than my old ones (another brand).&lt;br /&gt;Neither of the clippers has a nail</li>
            <li> They are on track to last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2012)</li>
            <li> Based upon my experience with Tweezerman, I will have this set for a number of years and may only need to replace it if I loose them.</li>
            <li> You could trim a dinosaur claw with the large trimmers, and it&#x27;s hard to trim hangnails with the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If these sit in a small amount of water overnight, by the next day they are starting to oxidize pretty heavily</li>
            <li> While by no means the worst clippers I have ever used, I expected these to have a quality comparable to the clippers I own by Seiki Edge, as the pricing was pretty similar (and as of today, this Tweezerman set is actually DOUBLE the price of the Seiki Edge fingernail and toenail clipper set.)</li>
            <li> From the first usage, these had the same issues of some less expensive brands I have used, which is slightly cracking/shearing the nail at the top outer portion to where the cut is not very clean and the nail is sharp.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive, but will last forever.</li>
            <li> This means you have to push down on them pretty hard, and then your fingers are pushing the part of the clipper that&#x27;s not rounded, so it leaves a big dent in your finger.</li>
            <li> The toenail clipper (the larger of the two items) has a straight -- actually it&#x27;s slightly CONVEX -- cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> Something of a minor revelation to learn that there are high-quality clippers to be had.</li>
            <li> I have some minor annoyances with the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because your nails are left so rough</li>
            <li> The lack of grip on the lever is also a minor irritant, especially if you&#x27;re using it while your fingers are wet.</li>
            <li> While I would not classify any of my Tweezerman products as &amp;#34;poor quality,&amp;#34; I would classify all of them as a very poor value because other makers are producing the same kinds of products at a greater level of quality, and for the same price or less.</li>
            <li> At $7 for new, I&#x27;m not sure if this means much, but at least it says they stand by the product.</li>
            <li> The larger pair have multiple rust spots on them after less than six months.  </li>
            <li> Our old clippers, perhaps 40 years old, were not working too well, and are very hard to sharpen.  </li>
            <li> They are rock solid and sharp.</li>
            <li> I WRITE THIS REVIEW ESPECIALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN USING THEIR FINGERS AND HANDS FOR MANY SMALL TEDIOUS TASKS.</li>
            <li> the fingernail and toenail clippers were not all that sharp to begin with, and especially the toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to recommend a product if another maker produces the same product at a higher quality standard and/or at a lower price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to recommend a product if another maker produces the same product at a higher quality standard and/or at a lower price.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and I have no issues using them regularly.</li>
            <li> Also, it left my nails particularly sharp on the ends.</li>
            <li> So far, they have retained sharp cutting edges, producing clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell in the picture, is the bigger pair has a completely straight blade, while the little one has a curve.  </li>
            <li> These are not shiny like the ones you normally see at the store, they are dull and matte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned mine for 5 years now and haven&#x27;t had a single issue.</li>
            <li> The pin is larger, and they don&#x27;t get used as much, but they are also starting to fail.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of disregarding some earlier reviews warning that these nail clippers are not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My nails are not hard to cut and these are a little too heavy for me to handle.  </li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that they don&#x27;t come with the flip-out file/pick that I&#x27;m used to on previous nail clippers, but that was already known before purchasing.</li>
            <li> They cut easier and are less likely to blast into someone&#x27;s eye.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a higher-quality product that will last for decades, and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> When they were delivered, I was a little surprised to see the handles were black and not as pictured on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they stay sharp as long as the ones they are replacing.</li>
            <li> If I were not lazy, I&#x27;d be forced to buff or file out the irregularities.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> New these are sharp and cut easily; I hardly had to apply any pressure.</li>
            <li> my socks will last a little longer too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx again.&lt;br /&gt;Mark</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they keep growing back.  </li>
            <li> Many folks including our household will use clippers too long past their cutting utility.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and have fairly thin nails and these things clip my nails very jagged.</li>
            <li> Jeez, never thought I&#x27;d actually be reviewing nail clipper but had to wan everyone.</li>
            <li> THEY DID NOT CUT AS I EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying cheaper pairs at local pharmacies and buy these instead.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the rough finish</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I have spent money on high-end clippers is so this does not happen</li>
            <li> Made in China product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut is not very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy, with big thick finger and toenails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a higher-quality product that will last for decades, and it&#x27;s half the price.lth risks!</li>
            <li> (it will also bend your nail flat as you press on it, which I found to be a little discomforting)  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I&#x27;ve spent money on other brands.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are very sharp and seem to be of a high quality from use over the past few months.</li>
            <li> My major complaint, and</li>
            <li> These are not very sharp, making it hard to clip your nails.  </li>
            <li> no hangers or sharp edges @</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I found they are not that sharp</li>
            <li> Instead, they leave sharp, ragged edged nails.</li>
            <li> THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE SHARP.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as sharp as my other pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp, like me.</li>
            <li> ) I&#x27;ve had them for close to three years and they are just as sharp and cut just as well as when I received them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp.  </li>
            <li> and I am totally embarrassed to have paid $34 for a product that was no better, and</li>
            <li> I like the build quality and the precision feel, but they are not as sharp as the $2.99 clippers I bought at the discount store.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well made, &amp; sharp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other set.</li>
            <li> Both work well, and are extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> nail clippers are sharp and work well.</li>
            <li> The point is, these are still sharp, and don&#x27;t break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp be careful!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Again, something that has never been an issue with any other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sharp and feels</li>
            <li> I have from other makers.</li>
            <li> (the same goes for their small scissors, which rust even faster.)</li>
            <li> One issue I have with other clippers is that they are not well-crafted and don&#x27;t clip well from the edges/corners.</li>
            <li> with Sharp Edges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The non-cutting edges are sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soldier, a lot of marching, and keeping your toes trimmed, but not too short or poorly trimmed, is critical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The big clipper cutting blades are straight, not curvely.  </li>
            <li> just average for me.</li>
            <li> While these are well made products, they are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, in my opinion</li>
            <li> My husband has really thick fingernails and toenails, so it has been a challenge to find ones that actually CUT, not mash, his nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced any issues with either clipper, and they both get used frequently by my husband and I.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smaller fingernail pair of clippers -- which has never been subject to use on toes -- is unacceptably dull.  </li>
            <li> When you press down to clip, the jaw closes and doesn&#x27;t clip...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp, sturdy and clips well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very sharp to begin</li>
            <li> they work well and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp , and cut your nails like butter .</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and well-made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a slightly CONCAVE edge, so that I can make a slightly rounded cut.  </li>
            <li> I have had less problems with in grown toe nails since I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> I got my previous nail clipper set at Walmart for $ 3.</li>
            <li> Not expensive enough to return, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the clippers lack the file attachment that&#x27;s been on every pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless for normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But otherwise, they are a really heavy duty set of clippers and very sharp also.</li>
            <li> After a month on our bathroom sink exposed to normal water splashing they began to rust so bad they left rust stains on the porcelain.</li>
            <li> Hey little britches, these finger/toe clippers are indeed sharper than the ones I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; because the steel has a matte finish, and they don&#x27;t bother with the little flip out file.  </li>
            <li> Cut is not clean- thin flap left holding the trimming to the nail so that you then have to tear or pull the trimming off and then file the ragged edge.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve got extra tough nails.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze really hard to get these to clip, and they seem to leave a slightly rough edge.</li>
            <li> I have spent countless $5.00 on useless nail clippers over the years.  </li>
            <li> the cutting blades are very dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The handle is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just pay a few extr bucks and get a brand name.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> A bit heavy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re on the chunky side and feel heavy.</li>
            <li> They are just too thick and wide.</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months in my dop kit....</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re VERY sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP!</li>
            <li> The fingernail clippers are as bad or worse right out package than any generic or wore out pair I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to admit that the few nail trimmings I&#x27;ve done using them have left my nails noticeably rough.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with the el-cheapo nail clippers I&#x27;ve had in my bathroom drawer for years, these provide a straighter, blunter, less refined cut that makes my nails appear slightly scalloped.  </li>
            <li> Neither of these clippers comes with the small, attached nail file that is typically included with nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> For a Tweezerman-brand product, I am disappointed with how quickly it dulled.  </li>
            <li> Wish manufacturers would make the small clippers just a little bigger and easier to hold for us guys with poor dexterity.</li>
            <li> other problem is the edges on the handles of the clippers seem almost as sharp as the blades.&lt;br /&gt;These are very uncomfortable to press down, especially when you need added pressure to get your nails to cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall these were much worse than the inexpensive store bought clippers that have lasted 5-10 years for me in the past.</li>
            <li> Should it not be the other way around, I mean, it is your body.</li>
            <li> They are so hard to press down.</li>
            <li> a bit hard to snip through the nail and leaves them very sharp looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> The items are not superior in any way to other clippers...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as the first time I used the nail clippers they promptly broke into several parts.</li>
            <li> and sometimes a small one (for the baby toe) does the trick.</li>
            <li> BUT IN ANY EVENT I WAS NOT SATISFIED.  </li>
            <li> However, the nail clipper is around 1/3 of an inch too short, making it a bit uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The small clipper in the package is misaligned, but this could be a quality control issue.</li>
            <li> These clippers are no better than the 89-cent clippers at the checkout counter.  </li>
            <li> cutting action is too sharp/hard</li>
            <li> These are not your ordinary set of clippers.</li>
            <li> That just shows that either the metal is cheap or where it&#x27;s clamped to the base is weak.</li>
            <li> but actually are not great to use, because the leverage on them is poor.</li>
            <li> The reason I got these clippers was because I had a greate experience with Tweezerman scissors however the clippers were a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> They cut through his tough nails, and are sharp!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since we thought the stainless steel was the way to go.  </li>
            <li> But is oh so hard to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do not have to press hard to get them to cut.</li>
            <li> but they are hard to use because of the design.</li>
            <li> While the clippers are pretty sharp, they have three disappointing and/or painful</li>
            <li> - THAT YOU CAN OPEN FOR LEVERAGE WHEN  CUTTING.  </li>
            <li> At least there is no rust on the blades though.</li>
            <li> - it just doesn&#x27;t work well (at least on my nails).</li>
            <li> Mine came with a a tiny nick on one of the cutting edges which created a defective cut.</li>
            <li> My nails are thick, but my husband and sons aren&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> but they just don&#x27;t cut it for thick nails.</li>
            <li> These clippers were too small and weak to clip anyones toe nails.</li>
            <li> These are serious...</li>
            <li> The clippers actually work by cutting once and not leaving or tearing anything behind.</li>
            <li> The rough finish gave me a nails on the chalkboard feeling when the face of the cutting edges rubbed on my nails.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty upset that I got fake crap from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife hated them, so I gave the big one away and saved the little one as a backup.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you have thick nails!</li>
            <li> I saw reviews on these not being so tough</li>
            <li> The new Revlon fingernail clippers are horrible, they saved some very small fraction of a penny by getting rid of the tabs that hold the lever bar in place</li>
            <li> In a few weeks time they were hard to cut nails with and started to rust badly.</li>
            <li> but, it is difficult to cut through thick nails.</li>
            <li> and I am really confused.</li>
            <li> I suspect they might work well for people with thin nails</li>
            <li> They have not rusted, scratched, or broken.</li>
            <li> The toe nail clipper on this set is not curved, and that is the secret sauce that anyone doing a lot of walking/running should know.&lt;br /&gt;There is zero tolerance in the clipper,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually broken my wife&#x27;s clippers on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> My husband got annoyed to have to always go into my nail polish caddy to get some clippers.</li>
            <li> fact that these clippers are being sold for $21 per set is laughable given their shoddy construction and poor design.</li>
            <li> Looking at the other reviews I must have gotten some bad ones.</li>
            <li> These are by far the worst nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORSE!</li>
            <li> THE PICTURE WAS PROBABLY STALE &amp; NEVER CHANGED.</li>
            <li> She was angry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s are actually very thin, so there should not have been any problem with his at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I NEVER write bad reviews</li>
            <li> My toenails are like steel, yet these clippers have no problem cutting through them.  </li>
            <li> If fact, neither clipper has a file which was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Despite the Tweezerman quality, dirty looks will be directed at you.</li>
            <li> and so I do not have to file my nails after cutting them.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d accidently cut into my toe.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how bad they are.</li>
            <li> IT COULD BE THAT I RECEIVED A BAD SET</li>
            <li> I FEEL BADLY -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if these were seeded by manufacturer or I received a badly machined set.  </li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> perhaps I received a bad sample.</li>
            <li> Her anger was directed at me using her nail clippers, not me breaking them.</li>
            <li> The squared-off corners of the clipper parts can dig painfully into the pads and sides of your fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed when these were sub-par.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of these from the start.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an idiot.  </li>
            <li> Maybe some of those bad reviews are from people with nasty iron nails!</li>
            <li> I have a horrible habit of biting and pulling my nails off</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> what a great deal on these clippers, they are very sturdy and made to last.</li>
            <li> A bit to pricy but is worth it</li>
            <li> Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this set, one for my car &amp; one for my pocket. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> You can not find these any place.  We like the clippers that are straight across.  They are GREAT!  I think we got the last ones.</li>
            <li> Instead of being the light, effective, well-designed, easy-to-use clippers available at any local store, these clippers are heavy, poorly designed (actually hurts my hands to press on them), they can&#x27;t cut unless you experiment and experiment with every single angle on every single fingernail, and even then you worry that if you don&#x27;t get it exactly right, you are going to end up accidentally cutting yourself. I have no idea what nail clippers all these other people are reviewing, but the ones I have don&#x27;t work and turn something quick and easy into a massive chore. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Looking at the other reviews I must have gotten some bad ones. No doubt these are junk. I purchased two. I threw one in the trash. It would not cut anything. The pair I have kept are going in the trash too. They cut sometimes. The handle is not comfortable. I contacted the manufacturer and they showed no interest in replacing. I have some 59 cent clippers that are better than these. I would not recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and useful nail clipper set.  With the clean stainless steel construction, these clippers are expected to last forever.  The only reason that one would have to replace them is if they are lost.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this set for my husband whom is very pickey about his clippers. Him and I both love tweezerman tweezers, so I figured that these would be equally impressive. Well, they&#x27;re not. They are so hard to press down. My nails are thick, but my husband and sons aren&#x27;t at all. My son&#x27;s are actually very thin, so there should not have been any problem with his at all. If you need a real workout for your hand, then go ahead and get these, if not, consider something else. I&#x27;m going to continue my search for the perfect clippers. If these loosen up, I&#x27;ll update my review, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any hope.</li>
            <li> These are serious... At least more so than the cheap-o ones I was dealing with! These feel solid and clip great.</li>
            <li> very good , for finger and toe nails does a good job of removeing toe and finger nails its just what i needed give 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a tweezerman stainless nail clipper set.  I am impressed with the craftmanship.  It is worth the extra dollars for the quality.  I will see how long the sharpness of the clippers last.</li>
            <li> I spent more money than I normally would on clippers, thinking it was time to get a nice pair.  I really wanted to like them, but the toenail clippers are so mis-aligned that they rip instead of cut.  I contacted Tweezerman twice thinking I got defective clippers, and they have yet to respond after several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> delivered in a nice package, appears to be machined well,  works well.   I bought 2 sets.</li>
            <li> Who thinks about things like this? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a pair of nail clippers as well-made as these. And they&#x27;re VERY sharp! So they cut very easily. Why have I put up with crappy dime store clippers all these years!? Something of a minor revelation to learn that there are high-quality clippers to be had. I&#x27;m really impressed. Very useful.</li>
            <li> just average for me. in the end i decided not to keep it. i hope to have more luck with my next order.</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent quality on these clippers. I&#x27;ve owned two sets: the first ones were great; second set, not so much. After about three months of use, they&#x27;ve dulled to the point of becoming unusable. And the darn things just don&#x27;t want to stay together. The lever pops off nearly every other use. I&#x27;ve owned several Tweezerman products, but these clippers just aren&#x27;t up to par.</li>
            <li> Still working wonderfully after a few years.</li>
            <li> These work just as you&#x27;d expect. They clip your nails, no fuss or hassle. Overall this was a nice, simple purchase that I don&#x27;t regret in the slightest.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great!  My husband has really thick fingernails and toenails, so it has been a challenge to find ones that actually CUT, not mash, his nails.  These clipper do a great job and price is definitely right.  Also, with a lifetime warrany and free sharpening, there&#x27;s no risk to buying this item.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are excellent clippers and cut amazingly smooth...no hangers or sharp edges @ all...but I have to knock off one star for their lack of a nail cleaner...I really thought it would not matter to me but I have to say after a couple weeks with the new clippers I do miss the little swing out on my cheapos... worth the price and would buy again</li>
            <li> Could find something of the exact same quality at Walgreens. Could easily find something better. Not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> The items are not superior in any way to other clippers...the high price I feel is not justified by the quality of the item.</li>
            <li> I have a Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Wide Grip Slant and it&#x27;s just amazing .. believe those ones would be as good, b ut turns out are not ..  Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I found they are not that sharp, I mean I have other set of &amp;#34; cheap &amp;#34; nail clippers that are real sharp and IMHO do better job than this ones ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ones are sturdy enough to withstand cheap version maybe ..  just wish they were more sharp .</li>
            <li> These clippers, both of them, do not cut clean. Instead, they leave sharp, ragged edged nails. I don&#x27;t know why I bought another Tweezerman product. The scissors I bought for trimming my mustache pull, not cut, my hair which HURTS A LOT. I originally bought a pair of tweezers for my eyebrows that were actually really good. The rest of their products I have tried however, are junk. Stay away from Tweezerman. Go spend a little more money on something German.</li>
            <li> I used to use cheap clippers and after getting these, I will never go back as I now see the quality of cut and build.</li>
            <li> Love these nail clippers.  Very sharp, sturdy and clips well.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right.  Love that you get two. Sometimes I need a big&lt;br /&gt;one and sometimes a small one (for the baby toe) does the trick.</li>
            <li> Following up now in March 2016.  Clippers are working great, no problems.  They are on track to last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2012) Purchased these in June 2009.  They were sharp and cut cleanly, and seemed to be high quality, stainless steel construction.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers basically fell apart when they were two years old.  I sent them in to Tweezerman for repair/replacement, and they replaced them with a brand new set.  It took about 4 weeks (they just moved their repair center, and were projecting 6 weeks, so it was a reasonable turn-around).  The new set looks to have a slightly more robust pin, and they clip very nicely.  Hopefully these will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving in my original review about how the clippers were broken, just FYI.  Again, note that Tweezerman replaced the broken set for free (my shipping to them cost all of one Forever stamp: $0.44), were pretty quick about it, and the clippers work well.  So, I am happy with this product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review follows:&lt;br /&gt;About 9 months ago (so about 2 years old), they started tearing the nails and not cutting cleanly without having to apply a lot more pressure to the cutters.  I couldn&#x27;t easily see why this was.&lt;br /&gt;Last week, it finally became clear what the problem was:  The metal pin that goes through the clippers pulled through and came out, and the clippers fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that while the main body and lever arm of the clippers are stainless steel, the pin that connects the pieces together is made out of a softer metal/alloy and it has been deforming from the pressure of clipping and also being gouged by the harder stainless steel pieces.  The pin finally sheered off the flange and came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10 for a pair of clippers, I would expect it to last much, much longer than 3 years.  I&#x27;ve bought cheapo sets from a dime store that have lasted over a dozen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also took apart the larger toe nail clippers to see if they are suffering from the same problem, and they are.  The pin is larger, and they don&#x27;t get used as much, but they are also starting to fail.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend a while ago, who had been using scissors on a Swiss Army knife to cut his nails (sometimes I just don&#x27;t get it...)  So, while I don&#x27;t use them often, I have borrowed them on occasion (I spend a lot of time away from my own stuff-- and his work fine too)  They do look nice (I&#x27;m a fan of the stainless look) and cut well and even though they&#x27;re only nail clippers, $9 wasn&#x27;t a fortune to pay.  The toenail clippers are actually a bit too large for my smaller toes, but for a man&#x27;s toes they&#x27;re fine. They&#x27;re sturdy, stainless , and a well known brand.  I&#x27;d say these are worth the $9</li>
            <li> I joke that my husband has Hobbit feet and he needed a really good nail clipper set. I trust Tweezerman with my eyebrows and now I trust them with my husband&#x27;s fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li> Cheap, not so sharp, no fingernail file, the larger one is straight, not curved.  My mom had a Revlon from the 60s that was extremely high quality.  This one, not so good.  They don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. Some people spend tens, hundreds of dollars to take care of their cars, iPods and digital cameras. Then, go out and buy a pair of nail clippers - the cheapest ones - for $.99 at a gas station. Should it not be the other way around, I mean, it is your body. Last week I picked up a pair of these for $7 at my local Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, no problems. I love them, and they are so sharp that you WILL make yourself bleed if you&#x27;re not careful. Being used to &#x27;gas station shears&#x27; I had no problem doing just so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying and subsequently throwing away countless pairs of nail clippers, I decided to look for something that absolutely does not rust! I like to keep a pair of clippers in the shower, and my sink, porcelain covered metal frame, would develop brown rust spots after 1-2 days of a clipper being left there. That&#x27;s when the Tweezerman set caught my eye, not because they were made in Asia like all the others, but because they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) were advertised as stainless steel and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Guaranteed for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the event that I damaged them, it says here on the packaging that they will replace them at 1/2 price for me. (S&amp;H not included). At $7 for new, I&#x27;m not sure if this means much, but at least it says they stand by the product. But for all that it&#x27;s worth, the price (remember they are a whopping 7-10 times MORE expensive than the regular ones) is worth paying for in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Both of these nail clippers cut well. On the toe nail clipper I miss the file that my old nail clippers, toe and finger had. Hopefully they stay sharp as long as the ones they are replacing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are apparently made just for \\&quot;him\\&quot;--I am a woman, and they work great for me. I used to have to grapple with my old clippers in order to cut my toenails (which are not enormously thick or anything), but these clippers cut right through. The clippers are straight rather than curved so they do not create nice rounded corners, but that is not difficult to fix. The clippers also don&#x27;t have a built-in nail file, which is fine with me (I never use files), but that may be a deterrent for some. I like that I now have one set for my toes and one for my fingers. I recommend these clippers for their effectiveness and quality at such a low price!</li>
            <li> Pros:  * They look good  Cons:  * Cut is not clean- thin flap left holding the trimming to the nail so that you then have to tear or pull the trimming off and then file the ragged edge.  * blades are tall and vertical so that it&#x27;s a challenge to get them under the nail (between the nail and fingertip).</li>
            <li> Very happy with quality of product, much better than anything I could find at a grocery,drug store..</li>
            <li> These are by far the worst nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m a guy and have fairly thin nails and these things clip my nails very jagged. When you press down to clip, the jaw closes and doesn&#x27;t clip...so you push harder and you can see the HUGE amount of flex/bend in the arm of the clipper before it actually clips the nail. That just shows that either the metal is cheap or where it&#x27;s clamped to the base is weak. Jeez, never thought I&#x27;d actually be reviewing nail clipper but had to wan everyone. Just pay a few extr bucks and get a brand name. These went straight into the trash- that&#x27;s how bad they are.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THESE CLIPPERS AND THEY WERE NOT THAT GREAT.  THEY DID NOT CUT AS I EXPECTED.  THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE SHARP.  IT COULD BE THAT I RECEIVED A BAD SET BUT IN ANY EVENT I WAS NOT SATISFIED.  THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE A NAIL CLEANER - THAT YOU CAN OPEN FOR LEVERAGE WHEN  CUTTING.  I FEEL BADLY - THEY LOOKED SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> These are nice heavy duty nail clippers, but mine started rusting towards the back. Wait... how can stainless steel rust? I haven&#x27;t figured that one out yet. At least there is no rust on the blades though. Also, the toenail clipper is a flat edge cut. It is not rounded like the fingernail clippers. I dont know about everyone else, but I like my toenails rounded not jagged. But otherwise, they are a really heavy duty set of clippers and very sharp also. Cuts through my nails like butter. I give it a 2 for the fact that we have a stainless steel item that is rusting.</li>
            <li> Do not understand the hype at  all on this set? The fingernail clippers are as bad or worse right out package than any generic or wore out pair I have ever used. Think I will stick with Revlon from Walmart. Might as well, being this German brand of clippers is MADE IN CHINA!</li>
            <li> These are solidly built, and are sure to last. However, the nail clipper is around 1/3 of an inch too short, making it a bit uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman clippers are a great overall product. They are a bit harder to press down than other ones, but the end result is all that matters, and they deliver good clean cuts. They have a certain heft to them, and you can feel the quality. Plus they are priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> I gave the toenail clipper away, because I use the fingernail clipper for both my fingers and toes. The fingernail clipper cuts a rounded edge, and the toenail clipper cuts a straight edge (for preventing ingrown toenails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great clippers that are very sharp and operate smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have an \\&quot;under the nail scraper\\&quot; that I would like.</li>
            <li> Satisfaction counts at amazon.com they go out of their way making \\&quot;you\\&quot; a satisfied \\&quot;customer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;There you go!&lt;br /&gt;The clippers were at my door at 9:10 am this morning, Tuesday 9/20/2011.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived really quick. Hey little britches, these finger/toe clippers are indeed sharper than the ones I&#x27;ve been using. These clip much easier too.&lt;br /&gt;Now my socks will last a little longer too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx again.&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G686U4 Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set]]</li>
            <li> These do appear to be sturdy, good-quality clippers.  I bought them because my household needed more than just the one set of clippers we&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I immediately regretted my purchase upon first use.  The toenail clipper (the larger of the two items) has a straight -- actually it&#x27;s slightly CONVEX -- cutting edge.  I&#x27;m used to a slightly CONCAVE edge, so that I can make a slightly rounded cut.  With a convex edge, I end up having to make between a dozen and twenty cuts on each nail, to get a contour that resembles the fingertip.  It is a major hassle and it makes me just want to throw them out.  I can&#x27;t conceive of a valid reason to make nail clippers straight or convex.  I&#x27;m sure someone out there might prefer them this way, but I can&#x27;t imagine why or in what context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had looked closely at the tiny photo so that I might have observed that the blade on the larger clipper was not concave, although the blade on the shorter clipper, which is much more clearly shown in the picture, *is* in fact concave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that is not an issue for you, then these are a great purchase.  They do appear to be durable and of reasonably high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just feel a bit tricked.  I had assumed these toenail clippers would be shaped like every other nail clipper I have ever used, and didn&#x27;t know I needed to &amp;#34;beware&amp;#34; the tricky straight (slightly convex) blade shape when shopping for a new one.  So, yay, a nine-dollar caveat emptor lesson.  Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The large clipper works great.  The small clipper in the package is misaligned, but this could be a quality control issue.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all. Threw them in the trash after first use. Reordered Seki clippers and they work very well.</li>
            <li> The brushed metal finish is fantastic and the cutters are extremely sharp. A fantastic deal. Stop shopping, buy these now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an idiot.  I have spent countless $5.00 on useless nail clippers over the years.  I thought it was normal to replace my nail clippers every few months.  The truth is, Tweezerman nail clippers are amazing.  They&#x27;re solid.  They feel solid.  They cut my glitter-bedazzled nails without any give.  I cannot believe I&#x27;ve spent money on other brands. If you are considering buying some cheap knock-off, save your money and go for the cadillac of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Solid set of nail clippers. They seem very well built compared to the cheap drugstore ones that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Ugh! Sorry, I NEVER write bad reviews but this product is a piece of trash. The little clipper sprang apart the first time I tried to use it. I finally got it back together after about twenty minutes of frustration. The finish of both clippers is dull which makes them feel cheap, and the blades are so blunt that you really have to work to cut the nail, which is not very reasuring during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically you could get a much better product by spending $2.99 at your local drug store. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Someone else reported that it takes a lot of force to clip with these clippers.  They are workable and the blade seems good but, it is difficult to cut through thick nails.</li>
            <li> Works on women too.  My only complaint is that they keep growing back.  Might want to buy two pair of these.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews on these not being so tough and I am really confused. These are sturdy stainless and feel heavy enough to stop a bullet. Maybe some of those bad reviews are from people with nasty iron nails! I havent had a problem yet and love my other tweezerman products</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers. We have many pair because these are the only ones my husband will use. Cuts even the toughest, thickest nails with ease. I have had less problems with in grown toe nails since I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp!  I can tell they are well made and will last a long time.  I would recommend this if you have thick nails!</li>
            <li> Yup. They are nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made of a material that is light, but feels really solid when using them. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that they don&#x27;t come with the flip-out file/pick that I&#x27;m used to on previous nail clippers, but that was already known before purchasing.</li>
            <li> After trying them a few times and wondering why they didn&#x27;t work well, I finally accepted the fact that they look good but won&#x27;t work for me.  My unbranded, made-in-China, drugstore clippers work much better.  I suspect they might work well for people with thin nails but they just don&#x27;t cut it for thick nails.</li>
            <li> While these are well made products, they are not worth the money. Nothing special here, but does get it&#x27;s job done.</li>
            <li> These dont come with a nail file or a under nail scraper but they are very sharp and better than the cheep stuff in town, best nail clipper i ever owned</li>
            <li> These are very heavy duty and nice.  They are much better than I expected.  They are more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like these clippers.  Though the stainless feels like each piece is stamped with semi-sharp edges, the clippers are stronger than the cheap ones that I have bought from the drug store.  They cut cleanly, and without over-stressing the top part of the clipper.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of disregarding some earlier reviews warning that these nail clippers are not worth the price.  They were right!  I&#x27;m sorry to admit that the few nail trimmings I&#x27;ve done using them have left my nails noticeably rough.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with the el-cheapo nail clippers I&#x27;ve had in my bathroom drawer for years, these provide a straighter, blunter, less refined cut that makes my nails appear slightly scalloped.  If I were not lazy, I&#x27;d be forced to buff or file out the irregularities.&lt;br /&gt;But I shouldn&#x27;t HAVE to!  Yes, these are sturdy, thick-guage steel workhorses that will (regrettably?) last me a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d advise you to look elsewhere, and consider what others have suggested: Head to the nearest discount store or pharmacy and toss a couple of bucks for a cheap, basic, generic, unpretentious and not over-packaged pair of nail clippers. Spare yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone who has a thing for nail clippers and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> I got my previous nail clipper set at Walmart for $ 3. Apparently this product has much better quality, but the productivity was almost the same. That&#x27;s the reason I give only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I like Tweezerman products but these nail clippers are no different from a $2 set you get at the chemist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I was expecting but these are nothing new or better.</li>
            <li> Best Nail Clippers I&#x27;ve ever used, they are Sharp and cut clean and quick and one of the best parts is the company will sharpen them for free</li>
            <li> Considering these are fairly inexpensive I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have been very happily surprised. These are nice heavy clippers that work great.  They don&#x27;t have the file attachment many nail clippers do but that aside the construction of these is top notch and well worth the price.  The cut cleanly and have a sharp edge.  Nice product. I would buy again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> These clippers are no better than the 89-cent clippers at the checkout counter.  Revlon makes a good clipper at a lot lower cost.</li>
            <li> They are high-quality, solid pieces of machinery... but they don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;The handle pops out from the retaining pin and both can get lost.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting action is too sharp/hard - it just doesn&#x27;t work well (at least on my nails). You will end up with perfectly straight edges and sharp points all over the place.  (it will also bend your nail flat as you press on it, which I found to be a little discomforting)  If you are trying to cut metal wire or something I bet these would work great though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, save your money and stick with the cheapo ones you&#x27;ve had forever.  They will work better and have a nail file too!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these!  They cut through his tough nails, and are sharp!  I put them in is stocking, and he was pleased!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is the best brand (that I know of) for tweezing and/or clipping. I purchased this for my son when he left for college. I should have kept these and sent him packing with my old, generic clipper. I guess I should order a set for myself.</li>
            <li> Strong durable nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many pairs of nail clippers I&#x27;ve bought from stores like Target or Walgreens -- not cheap ones either -- yet none of them compare to these Tweezerman clippers.  I love them -- particularly the larger size for toenails.  My toenails are like steel, yet these clippers have no problem cutting through them.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend them to everyone!  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying cheaper pairs at local pharmacies and buy these instead.  They&#x27;re brilliant!</li>
            <li> These are a nice pair of nail clippers.  The blades are sharp, and the movement seems good.  It is worth noting there isn&#x27;t a built in file, but I don&#x27;t really use them anyway.  My major complaint, and it&#x27;s hard to tell in the picture, is the bigger pair has a completely straight blade, while the little one has a curve.  I would prefer they both have a curve, as most all of my other nail clippers have.  Not a deal breaker, but that&#x27;s my preference.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nail Clipper set but received a pair of tweezers instead. I do nt have time to fuss with returns for these types of things, but I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the best nail clippers, but they get the job done.  They aren&#x27;t as sharp as my other pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my nail clippers and have been using Revlon clippers for a while but I always misplace them so I was in the market for new clippers.  I already have Tweezerman tweezers and love them so I gave their clippers a chance.  The price was great for a set of such quality.  They cut clean and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the matte finish, I prefer a smooth polished finish but that&#x27;s a personal preference and something that I have already gotten used to and don&#x27;t notice anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, I bought 2 sets and am happy with the choice!</li>
            <li> The main problem is that because of the angle that the clipping edge is made, you can&#x27;t trim up close. If it&#x27;s a short nail you can&#x27;t get close in enought to cut it right. I think the angle between the 2 edges is&amp;#34; too vertical&amp;#34; -- straight up and down. Whereas it should be more &amp;#34;pointy.&amp;#34; Think of a bulldog&#x27;s short mouth trying to eat a bug in a narrow hole. Can&#x27;t get his teeth in the hole. ITOH a bird with a pointy beak can do the job. This is a bulldog&#x27;s mouth with teeth too far from the objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short (it IS short) it&#x27;s useless for normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem, besides not being able to trim your nails, is that the rivet that holds the lever pops off oh so easily. But is oh so hard to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another problem is that it does not have a nail cleaner. I guess they didn&#x27;t think of it. The cheap ones of course do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another problem is that it does NOT have a nail file! Incredible. The cheap ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were they thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every way that it&#x27;s different from the cheap ones IT&#x27;S WORSE!</li>
            <li> I finally caved in and quit buying the $1 clippers at cvs that sucked and broke right away. I love these- they cut well and with the twin pack, I can always find one pair.</li>
            <li> Inspected thoroughly and I was surprised by the high quality for the price. Would recommend to anyone. Very sharp! h</li>
            <li> These are impressive.  After breaking many cheap flimsy pairs i decided to step up to these.  They are rock solid and sharp.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my primary nail cutters but this pair was not up to my standards.  They now sit in my work desk just in case I need an emergency clip.</li>
            <li> Yes they are as they appear in the picture, simple.&lt;br /&gt;Should have more functionality built into them. Should have been cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the edges of these clippers didn&#x27;t line up perfectly when I took them out of the package. To me, this is the only way to ensure a clean clip with ease.  These had little divots along the edges like older clippers do when you&#x27;ve used them to cut things like clothing tags, etc.  I expected better quality from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> As someone who was tired of cheap clippers that would either break or rust easily these were a welcome improvement. I&#x27;ve owned mine for 5 years now and haven&#x27;t had a single issue. I would defiantly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp, like me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;ve had them for close to three years and they are just as sharp and cut just as well as when I received them.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have very thick and quick growing nails and yet these clippers work great with little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;3) They have a lifetime sharpening guarantee - pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;4) They are simply the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had - I&#x27;ve thrown all the other ones (cheaply made) that I used to have away.</li>
            <li> For a Tweezerman-brand product, I am disappointed with how quickly it dulled.  It wasn&#x27;t very sharp to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller fingernail pair of clippers -- which has never been subject to use on toes -- is unacceptably dull.  It leaves the edges of my nails rough and uneven, as it does not give a sharp, clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have an appreciation for my Revlon pair, which has lasted me forever -- despite being meant for fingers, I&#x27;ve used it on my toes for years and years and it&#x27;s still sharp.  I&#x27;m not touting Revlon, but out of all the items I&#x27;ve been given over the years, the only pair of clippers and set of tweezers I&#x27;ve retained happen both to be Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point being: I always coveted the more expensive Tweezerman items in the drugstores, etc. but after this experience, I see no reason to try Tweezerman again.</li>
            <li> Cuts sharply and cleanly.  Able to trim as needed.  The larger one make clipping of the big toe nails a snap.</li>
            <li> Seems like high quality. They cut very well, sharp and easy to use. You do not have to press hard to get them to cut.</li>
            <li> really be good with a built in nail file, without it....almost a loser. Why make it so that we have to carry a file also?</li>
            <li> Darn good nail clippers and value for the money.  The Seki&#x27;s are a step above the Tweezerman&#x27;s but Seki&#x27;s also cost more.</li>
            <li> Totally unimpressed with these nail clippers.  Purchased in 2009 and should have returned them within the allotted time period.  I am only writing this review now since I recently ordered a different set of clippers after working around these dogs for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fooled by many favorable reviews.  Don&#x27;t know if these were seeded by manufacturer or I received a badly machined set.  However, they were garbage and I am totally embarrassed to have paid $34 for a product that was no better, and in my ways worse, than the cheap items sold at the local pharmacy or grocery.  My bad.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  You have been warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Don&#x27;t cut close or clean and frequently leave hangnails.  They are dull (not sharp) and take unusual strength to cut through typical middle age adult nails (not elderly talons).  Larger nail clipper has no curve it is a straight edge.  I prefer a minor curve which better follows my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  Only one.  They seem to be made of stainless steel and have not rusted.  They should last forever in my medicine cabinet on a back shelf.  I only use them when I can&#x27;t find my cheap clippers these were purchased to replace.</li>
            <li> A very high quality product that doesnt feel cheap in my hands. The clippers actually work by cutting once and not leaving or tearing anything behind.</li>
            <li> I like the build quality and the precision feel, but they are not as sharp as the $2.99 clippers I bought at the discount store. Not expensive enough to return, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was turned off by the price, which (before opening the package) seemed unwarranted. At the end of the day it&#x27;s just a nail clipperâ€”but this one is made of heavier metal and clips much more efficiently than its $1 or $2 drugstore equivalents.</li>
            <li> So far these have worked out wonderfully. They are sturdy and cut my nails well. I keep them in the bathroom and have not had any problems with rusting.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. Skip those cheapo clippers at the drugstore and get these. Save you time and $$$</li>
            <li> The title of my review pretty much says it all.  I would guess they are made from a low grade of 400-series stainless steel that holds an edge better then some other types of stainless but also rusts...the whole reason I bought them!.  After a month on our bathroom sink exposed to normal water splashing they began to rust so bad they left rust stains on the porcelain. On top of that they cut my nails about the same as the $3 chrome-plate clippers from the grocery store.  They are made in China. My search for good stainless steel clippers continues!!!</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Super robust</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Podiatrist told me I would get more ingrown toenails if I didn&#x27;t start cutting my toes with a straight nail clipper. I bought this because it was a cheap and well reviewed nail clipper and they threw in a small one as well (which I&#x27;ll probably never use, as I have a large curved one I&#x27;ve used a while and like).    I used the large, straight one right after getting it. It works nice, appears to be sharp and well made. I like it and recommend the product. They both appear to be sturdy and I think they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered &amp; got it promptly.  Sturdy, well made, &amp; sharp.  &amp; it does not have any cheap file attached.  If fact, neither clipper has a file which was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones you buy at the gas station.  These work well enough and are worth the $10 seeing how they will probably last for ever.</li>
            <li> My hubby got these for Christmas (from me) and he really likes them, they do the job!  Highly recommend any product from Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> These are very high quality and get the job done easily. I&#x27;ve had this set for over 2 years and everything still works fine. I&#x27;ve never experienced any issues with either clipper, and they both get used frequently by my husband and I.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Tweezerman set of tweezers for about 5 years and was happy to see this set when I needed to get a new clipper. These are not your ordinary set of clippers. You get two, one for fingers, one for toes. You will see a difference immediately, even before opening the package. These are not shiny like the ones you normally see at the store, they are dull and matte. Then you open the package and find them to be heavier than the cheap, shiny ones you may be used to. This is part of the Tweezerman experience. A heavy, substantial, well-made product that is sharp, precise and made to do one thing, clip your nail well. Based upon my experience with Tweezerman, I will have this set for a number of years and may only need to replace it if I loose them.</li>
            <li> I must say these have held up pretty well. They have not rusted, scratched, or broken. Heck, I haven&#x27;t even lost them yet.</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap product. The nail clipper broke in third use. I did not have the original packaging so I could not return.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this d... brand again.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. They are stainless steel, and you can definitely feel the difference in quality between these and the 99-cent clippers you buy at Wal-Mart. Tweezerman also offers FREE sharpening of all their implements. You don&#x27;t even pay a processing fee or return shipping fee.</li>
            <li> Probably the best clippers I have ever owned.  A bit heavy but you get what you pay for and these are worth paying for (if you do not lose them!)</li>
            <li> This is a very well made nail clipper set. Has a nice brushed finish and does a great job of trimming finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend of mine got me hooked on the Tweezerman brand of products.  Will always buy from them, make very clean clips.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. After having so many bad clippers, these are great. I&#x27;m a soldier, a lot of marching, and keeping your toes trimmed, but not too short or poorly trimmed, is critical. The toe nail clipper on this set is not curved, and that is the secret sauce that anyone doing a lot of walking/running should know.&lt;br /&gt;There is zero tolerance in the clipper, when you press, it clips of the nail right there. Well worth the money. I&#x27;ll never buy any other set.</li>
            <li> These nail and toenail clippers work well and are sized right. The nail clippers are curved, and the toenail clippers are almost straight. They&#x27;re on the chunky side and feel heavy. I didn&#x27;t like the rough finish - it&#x27;s far from polished. The rough finish gave me a nails on the chalkboard feeling when the face of the cutting edges rubbed on my nails. I was able to smooth out the finish with a couple passes on a wire wheel, but I wish they offered a polished finish.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are great! They seem to be very sturdy and will probably last a while. They come in a matte, stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li> The finger nail clipper is all right, but I ended up buying a dedicated toenail clipper.  This one just doesn&#x27;t have enough leverage to do the job.</li>
            <li> These clippers were too small and weak to clip anyones toe nails. Okay That is all I have to say. Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to not only get a new clipper for use at home, but also to have the smaller clipper to throw in my travel kit.  Both work well, and are extremely sharp.  I also appreciate the non-polished surfaces on the clippers -- I feel it makes them easier to grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to cut your nails when they&#x27;re wet.  They cut easier and are less likely to blast into someone&#x27;s eye.  Hence it&#x27;s nice to have stainless steel nail clippers that you might take into a shower or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I left my Tweezerman fingernail clippers in the shower ONE day and the darned thing started rusting where the blades are welded together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve kept the toenail clippers out of the shower and tossed the fingernail clippers.  However the toenail clippers are destined for the trashcan too.  Take a close look at the toenail clipper.  Blow up that picture.  The shape of the cut is convex!  Now imagine using that on your toenails.  Most people on the planet want a concave cut that rounds your nails so they don&#x27;t scratch and tear at things.  However this toenail clipper gives a convex cut and will give your toenails horns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveate Emptor.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good set of nail clippers and these looked like they were made well.  Got the clippers and they are top notch. You can tell they are good quality and were not all that expensive.  Item shipped quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied...</li>
            <li> I WRITE THIS REVIEW ESPECIALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN USING THEIR FINGERS AND HANDS FOR MANY SMALL TEDIOUS TASKS. THIS &#x27;TWEEZERMAN STAINLESS NAIL CLIPPER SET&#x27; IS THE FIRST SET I&#x27;VE FOUND WHICH IS HEAVY AND MANAGEABLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO MAKE A SHARP, CLEAN CUT AND EASILY DO THE JOB WITHOUT ANY STRUGGLE. I GIVE IT 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to really think about the quality of a toe nail clipper before. I&#x27;ve always had Revlon that I buy at a drug store and they worked great. I lost that pair so needed a new &#x27;big&#x27; clipper. I&#x27;ve used other tweezerman products that I&#x27;ve liked so trusted the name brand. These clippers suck! They barely cut &amp; when they do, it&#x27;s not a sharp even edge. Back to the drugstrore clippers for me.</li>
            <li> I realize this is the &amp;#34;His&amp;#34; trimmers, but they seem too big, even for a guy.  You could trim a dinosaur claw with the large trimmers, and it&#x27;s hard to trim hangnails with the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; ones.  They are just too thick and wide.</li>
            <li> The fingernail (child?) nail clippers are sharp and work well. However, the large toenail clippers are not sharp. I ended up buying a La Cross clipper with a clip catcher at a drug store, which have worked very well.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as the first time I used the nail clippers they promptly broke into several parts. Too much work to return for refund.</li>
            <li> Neither of these clippers comes with the small, attached nail file that is typically included with nail clippers.  This means you have no way of cleaning dirt out from under your nails, or pushing cuticles back.  The smaller nail clipper is either very dull or misaligned, because it does not make a clean cut; my nails are frayed after I use this clipper and I have to to file them smooth with a separate nail file.  The one positive thing (that moved my rating up from 1 star) is that the large toenail clipper is straight rather than arc-shaped, so you can clip straight across the nail as you are supposed to do to avoid ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far! No complaints! Best value for the money. Searched a lot for the best tweezers, read all the reviews and chose these and I don&#x27;t regret my decision!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for decent quality clippers then consider these.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed.  Stainless steel that does not feel like a toy.&lt;br /&gt;They are made in China but there is a free sharpening guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;About our Guarantee:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our implements are guaranteed to perform and are guaranteed against manufacturing defects.

            <li> Nice sharp pair of clippers.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with even cheap drug store clippers.  I lost the ones I had been using.  I saw these and gave it a try.  I have some minor annoyances with the product.  I like files built in the lever. The brushed steel makes isn&#x27;t ideal for rotating the lever to and from safe mode.  Is the build over kill for me? Yes.  The thick steel pretty much guarantees these should last forever, even if it doesn&#x27;t, it has a great warranty.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers are not like knives.  Knives lose their cutting surface quickly; however, Tweezerman Nail Clippers do not lose their cutting edges anywhere near as quickly and that alone is fantastic.  Many folks including our household will use clippers too long past their cutting utility.  These are stainless steel and I do not expect an edge loss for years especially the way they are working now.  Clean and non-ragged cuts make the job so easy and appearances especially good.  The slightly and almost unseen rough surfaces of the clippers permit easy use and a reduction of slippage.  The way that the balance is used they are just easy to manipulate and use with ease.  Overall, just a fine set of clippers and worthy of continued use.</li>
            <li> Wish manufacturers would make the small clippers just a little bigger and easier to hold for us guys with poor dexterity. Otherwice they work well and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Price</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I liked my wife&#x27;s Tweezerman clipper so much. When they were delivered, I was a little surprised to see the handles were black and not as pictured on Amazon. Also, they didn&#x27;t cut nearly as quiet and cleanly as my wife&#x27;s authentic Tweezerman&#x27;s. Then tonight I compared the Tweezerman font between mine that I ordered on Amazon and my wife&#x27;s that she got from Rite Aid and they are definitely different. I&#x27;m 95% sure these are fakes. Do not buy these. It&#x27;s only $9 bucks but I&#x27;m pretty upset that I got fake crap from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband was overdue for new clippers. Tweezerman clippers work great and stay sharp. Purchased his and her set. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING A DUPLICATE NAIL CLIPPER OF WHAT I ALREADY HAD (CAN&#x27;T REMEMBER HOW I OBTAINED THE ORIGINAL) BASED ON THE PICTURE OF THE CLIPPER THAT WAS DISPLAYED.  THE CLIPPER I RECEIVED WAS NOT WHAT WAS DISPLAYED &amp; DIDN&#x27;T GIVE A SHARP CLEAN CUT LIKE THE ORIGINAL DOES.  I RECEIVED A TIMELY &amp; EFFICIENT REFUND OF MY MONEY BUT WOULD RATHER HAVE RECEIVED THE CLIPPER I ORDERED.  I WAS INFORMED THE PICTURE WAS PROBABLY STALE &amp; NEVER CHANGED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy, with big thick finger and toenails. I clip them every week or so, and these Tweezerman nail clippers have been great! I bought them almost a year ago, here on Amazon, so this review is of a well used set of nail trimmers. I&#x27;ve actually broken my wife&#x27;s clippers on my toe nails. Yes, broke them. She was angry. Her anger was directed at me using her nail clippers, not me breaking them. But that isn&#x27;t the point. The point is, these are still sharp, and don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discourage using them in public. Despite the Tweezerman quality, dirty looks will be directed at you.</li>
            <li> Very well made. These are extremely sharp be careful!&lt;br /&gt;They are much bigger than I expected them to be, but it makes it very easy for us people with larger hands.</li>
            <li> We were hoping for a sharp easy to use clipper better than the Revlon variety.  I have arthritis and was hoping it was easier to use.  It&#x27;s sharp but doesn&#x27;t clip as easily as my old Revlon clipper.  I&#x27;m disappointed since we thought the stainless steel was the way to go.  We&#x27;ll stick with what we have or go to the Japanese variety.</li>
            <li> I bought this set on the recommendation of a prominent household product review site. Sadly, I couldn&#x27;t have disagreed more with the review&#x27;s glowing praise. (Incidentally, the site has since retracted its recommendation.) While the clippers are pretty sharp, they have three disappointing and/or painful drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The squared-off corners of the clipper parts can dig painfully into the pads and sides of your fingers. I have to hold the clippers with a washcloth when clipping. The problem is probably the way I hold the clippers, but I&#x27;ve done it that way my entire life, and only with these has it ever been an issue. Ergonomically, they&#x27;re a failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Oddly, the clippers lack the file attachment that&#x27;s been on every pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Why, I don&#x27;t know, but the lack of one means you can&#x27;t clean underneath your nails with the pointy end of the file. Again, something that has never been an issue with any other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) They fall apart! On at least four occasions I have had both fingernail and toenail clippers abruptly fall apart during nothing more strenuous than a routine nail trimming. On the bright side, it has given me the opportunity to learn how nail clippers are put together, but the frequency with which they collapse is ridiculous. This is something that has happened to me maybe twice in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that these clippers are being sold for $21 per set is laughable given their shoddy construction and poor design.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a standard set of nail clippers that aren&#x27;t crappy. Nice and sharp, stainless steel (never rust), and very simple.</li>
            <li> ITEM DELIVERED QUICKLY AND IS VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM. THE CLIPPERS CUT VERY WELL AND I FEEL THEY WILL LAST FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them... I threw them away upon first use.  My old toenail cutters were the same design but I don&#x27;t know who made them...they worked fine... heavier duty metal and much sharper.  These are junk IMHO.</li>
            <li> The clippers are good, but the small pair fell apart on me on the second use. The pin that holds it together popped out. I was able to find it and get it back together, but I was not thrilled that it was that easy for them to come apart.</li>
            <li> I found them to be solid and sharp and at a great price for this product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good set of clippers for a long time and finally tried these. Best clippers i have ever had.</li>
            <li> a bit hard to snip through the nail and leaves them very sharp looking and feeling. i liked my old cheap ones better but these are without a doubt more durable.</li>
            <li> These are not very sharp, making it hard to clip your nails.  Not worth the money, in my opinion</li>
            <li> when i first ordered these i felt i paid too much, but i am not very glad that i got them. i actually ended up buying a second pack for my wife.</li>
            <li> Solid, well made nail clippers.  I was tired of the cheap clippers that bend easily.  4 stars only because there is no file.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman clipper set is a great value .  The blades are very sharp , and cut your nails like butter . I like the brushed metal finish too .</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about tweeter man. If you enjoy high quality products at a good prize, buy tweezeman!</li>
            <li> New these are sharp and cut easily; I hardly had to apply any pressure. Work great for me; don&#x27;t feel like they will fall apart like others I&#x27;ve had in the past. Under $10 seems like a fair price.</li>
            <li> But, these have a tendency to crack my nails.  They also leave a sharper edge than my regular clippers.  I am not fond of the toenail clippers with the inverse curve.  I find I have to pay extra care so as not to catch skin with the clipper.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but be careful because&lt;br /&gt;the blades are pretty sharp. Good quality and nicely&lt;br /&gt;made.</li>
            <li> These work great and are the best cutters i have owned. They have held up well and should do so for years to come.</li>
            <li> The reason I got these clippers was because I had a greate experience with Tweezerman scissors however the clippers were a major disappointment. In a few weeks time they were hard to cut nails with and started to rust badly. Wont be buying a Tweezerman product again.</li>
            <li> High quality nail clipper set. They work perfectly for my travel kit for traveling at work. The nail clippers are very sharp and seem to be of a high quality from use over the past few months.</li>
            <li> really great set, with clean finish. I miss the little swing-out pin though to clean the edge of the nail. The lack of grip on the lever is also a minor irritant, especially if you&#x27;re using it while your fingers are wet. Decided to give it 4 stars and not 3 because it clips really, really well.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products. This makes a very nice stocking stuffer, especially for the men in the family, who I find difficult to buy for.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze really hard to get these to clip, and they seem to leave a slightly rough edge. My wife hated them, so I gave the big one away and saved the little one as a backup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their entire line of products and this nailclipper is really great! sharp and feels sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont get those blunt ends anymore</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were Tweezerman, and I was under the impression that Tweezerman was a safe brand to buy. So I was disappointed when these were sub-par. They don&#x27;t cut all the way through your nail. So you end up sort of perforating your nail. And you either have to clip in the same spot a couple of times, or you have to sort of &#x27;bend and snap,&#x27; if you will... But not in a lovable Reese-Witherspoon-circa-2001 kind of way.</li>
            <li> IT worked very well for about 2 weeks and then fell appart in my pocket. Would probably be ok if it were just left on the counter.</li>
            <li> New, they are sharper than my other toenail clippers and I don&#x27;t need two hand.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike their $33 nipper which wouldn&#x27;t work with two hands.</li>
            <li> Makes clean cuts on thick nails, with enough pressure (not very sharp).&lt;br /&gt;Thin metal but seems to be strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;Matte finish and non-rounded lever. Less slippery and easier to hold onto than my old ones (another brand).&lt;br /&gt;Neither of the clippers has a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;Were packaged in a non-sealed, re-closeable clam shell that could be used to store them.</li>
            <li> These are very well built nicely constructed clippers.  I bought them based upon the price and the reviews.  But there is one thing missing that seems to have been an excellent invention every nail clipper I&#x27;ve used in my lifetime has which this has not - the swiveling metal nail file with nail jam remover.  I guess the aristocrats that purchase this model have separate tools for filing and picking.  But I don&#x27;t.  I prefer them built into my clippers.  That said, I also think the toe clippers are a bit too flat and not curved enough.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers, but I paid their comparatively hefty price because they were advertised as stainless and I like to buy things that will last.  The larger pair have multiple rust spots on them after less than six months.  By definition, not made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman clippers are the sharpest nail clippers I have found. Effortless to use, even on my titanium like nails, the clippers make clean, burr-less cuts that require little or no touch up with a file.</li>
            <li> The quality of these clippers is great especially at the price. These clippers feel very durable as well. They do their job just right!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality Stainless Nail Clipper Set from Tweezerman. Great for stocking stuffers or even  your traveling bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality, and highly polished surfaces resist rust even when left on the shower shelf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold, easy to use, and sharp.</li>
            <li> I nned new clippers and found that the Tweezeman clippers were rated well.  They work just fine.  I find the toe clipper works well on the fingers too.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! VERY SHARP!</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; because the steel has a matte finish, and they don&#x27;t bother with the little flip out file.  Bare bones!  But yeah, they seem well made and hopefully they last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> They looked good online, when I got them I was really impressed, not only do they cut nicely but the look stylish too. Great buy.</li>
            <li> The toenail clipper, why is it curved that way? It&#x27;s backwards. My wife says, \\&quot;why are your toenails pointy up on the corners? They&#x27;re sharp! Go sleep on the couch!\\&quot; Don&#x27;t buy backwards curved nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible habit of biting and pulling my nails off so I decided to turn it into a healthier habit by getting these. Some have commmented that they arent sharp enough but they seem to work fine for me so far. what else does one write about nail clippers. They work.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are great. They are made out of a very high quality steel, are super sharp and require minimal effort to use. I do wish they had a file/scraper but I will happily but that separate from the same brand as the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> Works great on my normal nails, and my husband&#x27;s freaky, monstrously thick toe nails. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something just a bit better than your average, Chinese nail clipper from the drugstore. But it&#x27;s a very good product; nice steel, perfect cuts, and looks it&#x27;s gonna last a good couple of years. For the price, a perfect purchase!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes the best grooming supplies. Tweezers, clippers, even their emory boards are top notch. A little more expensive, but will last forever.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the best experiences with the Tweezerman products I personally own. While I would not classify any of my Tweezerman products as &amp;#34;poor quality,&amp;#34; I would classify all of them as a very poor value because other makers are producing the same kinds of products at a greater level of quality, and for the same price or less. I do not feel these clippers are built to the quality standard that I expect at the price premium paid, and I do not feel these clippers are comparable in quality to similarly-priced clippers I have from other makers. Therefore, I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of these from the start. While by no means the worst clippers I have ever used, I expected these to have a quality comparable to the clippers I own by Seiki Edge, as the pricing was pretty similar (and as of today, this Tweezerman set is actually DOUBLE the price of the Seiki Edge fingernail and toenail clipper set.) The Tweezerman clippers I got are not in any way comparable in quality to my Seiki Edge ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the fingernail and toenail clippers were not all that sharp to begin with, and especially the toenail clippers. From the first usage, these had the same issues of some less expensive brands I have used, which is slightly cracking/shearing the nail at the top outer portion to where the cut is not very clean and the nail is sharp. One of the reasons I have spent money on high-end clippers is so this does not happen and so I do not have to file my nails after cutting them. Over 6 months, the blades got progressively duller and so they did not hold the edge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also surprised how easily these rusted. If these sit in a small amount of water overnight, by the next day they are starting to oxidize pretty heavily (the same goes for their small scissors, which rust even faster.) This is a HUGE concern for products such as clippers, tweezers, and scissors given how this can present health risks! I have stainless products from Rubis and Seiki Edge that can sit in water for days and not show even the slightest bit of oxidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to recommend a product if another maker produces the same product at a higher quality standard and/or at a lower price. So at the price I paid, I do not think these were a very good value and if I could do it over I would not have purchased them. At the current price, I think these are a terrible value because it is more than twice the price of other products which are built better. If my opinion means anything to you, I would advise purchasing the clippers from Seiki Edge instead of these Tweezerman clippers. It&#x27;s a higher-quality product that will last for decades, and it&#x27;s half the price.lth risks!

            <li> I guess I was lucky with the set I was sent after some reviews said the edges were rough and didn&#x27;t cut right. These are sharp and I have no issues using them regularly.</li>
            <li> My husband got annoyed to have to always go into my nail polish caddy to get some clippers. These made a great gift. I actually threw out my old clippers to use these instead. They are really really sharp, which is great but be careful with over clipping or getting your skin! They also look really nice--polished stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Seem to work just fine and are sharp. Don&#x27;t know how long that will last but will update when I know more.</li>
            <li> The new Revlon fingernail clippers are horrible, they saved some very small fraction of a penny by getting rid of the tabs that hold the lever bar in place and then they produced a product so cheap that your fingernails have ragged edges. This Tweezerman fingernail clipper does a superior job of cutting the nail, almost good enough to not need a file. A file would be nice improvement to these clippers.</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months in my dop kit.... They do indeed rust.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. The weight of the Tweezerman is the first thing that one notices. Next, they notice that there is no rotating file/picker thing that helps clean under the nails. Tough loss, because this product is still great without it.</li>
            <li> These clippers look good in the picture but they are hard to use because of the design. I kind of regret that I bought them.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and well-made. One issue I have with other clippers is that they are not well-crafted and don&#x27;t clip well from the edges/corners. These do not have that issue. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for a quality pair of nail clippers made from Grade A materials. However, within 2-3 uses the nail clipper popped into pieces. I could reassemble it, but it kept falling apart. Also, it left my nails particularly sharp on the ends. Overall these were much worse than the inexpensive store bought clippers that have lasted 5-10 years for me in the past. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love the smaller size, he likes the bigger set. These are great! One less thing to have to share :)</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are perfect for guys and are holding up very well. I recommend purchasing them with a nail cleaner as well to dig out any dirt underneath the nails before clipping. If you&#x27;d like a pair to last you, these are the ones. They feel much better in my hands than the cheaper ones you might find at a discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider Tweezerman to generally be the best brand available when it comes to manual personal grooming items like scissors, tweezers, and clippers.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a a tiny nick on one of the cutting edges which created a defective cut. I replaced it with a [[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] which has worked great. I now have 3 of the Seki&#x27;s which all work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got unlucky with the Tweezerman but the fact that my first and only purchase was defective make me question the quality control.</li>
            <li> These cut well. What more can one expect from nail clippers. So far, they have retained sharp cutting edges, producing clean cuts.</li>
            <li> This worked great..  tweezerman products are always the beez kneeez.  Seriously this is good stuff and it cuts nails very well..</li>
            <li> This set works very well.  I use these for both fingers and toes.  The smaller nail clipper is great for fingers.  My wife likes to use it on her feet because she has smaller fingers.  I would recommend these for any average size male adult.</li>
            <li> These do an excellent job of clipping my thick nails, and they do it with a nice clean cut the first time!</li>
            <li> This set of clippers are well made and do the job they are designed for.  I find them easy to handle and they do a good job of clipping nail.  Working well for me.</li>
            <li> Not that i&#x27;m an avid consumer of nail clippers, but these have surpassed my expectations for the price. I am happy with this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Our old clippers, perhaps 40 years old, were not working too well, and are very hard to sharpen.  These cost very little, appear to be very well made, and work quite well.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Solid Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;Low Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Dull Blades&lt;br /&gt;Handles with Sharp Edges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are solid stainless for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the cutting blades are very dull.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of force to get these clippers to snap your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Then, because of the dullness of the blades, the cuts are very rough.&lt;br /&gt;Because your nails are left so rough, you get a lot chipped and hanging nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had more fragile nails in my life than when I used this product; now that I&#x27;m back to quality clippers, I have almost no broken nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is the edges on the handles of the clippers seem almost as sharp as the blades.&lt;br /&gt;These are very uncomfortable to press down, especially when you need added pressure to get your nails to cut.&lt;br /&gt;I actually resorted to trying to soften the edges using a metal file, which didn&#x27;t seem to help much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But perhaps I received a bad sample.</li>
            <li> These are fine for the money I would recommend to other people. They are reasonably priced. I have used them weekly</li>
            <li> Guess these are kind of overkill for me.  My nails are not hard to cut and these are a little too heavy for me to handle.  I have arthritis in my hands and went back to just the regular clippers that are light weight.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - these are made well and seem very durable, just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was afraid I&#x27;d accidently cut into my toe.</li>
            <li> Made in China product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut is not very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big clipper cutting blades are straight, not curvely.  The non-cutting edges are sharp.</li>
            <li> these look really nice but actually are not great to use, because the leverage on them is poor. This means you have to push down on them pretty hard, and then your fingers are pushing the part of the clipper that&#x27;s not rounded, so it leaves a big dent in your finger. Maybe I&#x27;ve got extra tough nails.</li>
