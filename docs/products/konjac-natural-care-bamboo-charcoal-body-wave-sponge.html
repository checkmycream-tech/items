    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent for exfoliating, scrubbing, and rejuvenating skin.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is great!</li>
            <li>Also, a fair price!</li>
            <li>I came across these looking on Amazon and charcoal is supposed to be a great tool for fighting acne.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Feels good to the touch, but mine ripped two days in.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel and the ability to not use product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love these body/facial sponges!  </li>
            <li>This is made really nicely.</li>
            <li>It came already damp, which was nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent gentle exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my son and so far he is very happy with this sponge.</li>
            <li>Def will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a couple months and it has already started to tear at the top.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Nice for very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It is truly a worthy companion!</li>
            <li>With the body wash I use, the liquid just sits on top of the sponge without being absorbed.</li>
            <li>So listen up you Gladiators of Grime, Soldiers of Spotless, and Contenders of Clean</li>
            <li>but i guess this one isn&#x27;t as good as the last one.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that this is my second time buying a Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Deteriorated quickly afterward.</li>
            <li>The texture is quite rubbery, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>When I used it it was spectacular, it left my skin feeling light, clean, and more amazing than any other cleansing sponge I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Not bad but only can be use max for 1-2 months as it&#x27;s easily tear up..</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
            <li>Makes body wash very sudsy</li>
            <li>It does not lather as much, but that may be because I don&#x27;t feel the need to pour as much wash onto this.</li>
            <li>I guess i was taken in by the great reviews of this product, because i spent ten bucks to find out its ONLY a sponge.</li>
            <li>I love Konjac sponges and have bought several different brands before buying this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little more abrasive.  </li>
            <li>The only thing its infused with is good intentions (to relieve you of your hard earned cash).</li>
            <li>I want to add that this seller is fantastic to purchase from and will definitely buy future items as well.</li>
            <li>Pro: very soft in use  Con: has crumbled into pieces after 2 days use</li>
            <li>My sponge was soft, durable, and I even bought a couple as gifts.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really bothers me was that the string fell out the third time I used it, so I can&#x27;t hang it anymore.</li>
            <li>They appear to help exfoliate the dryer skin I am starting to have as I mature.</li>
            <li>This tenacious little masterpiece has endured several grueling months of lathering, rinsing, &amp; repeating - and has never failed!</li>
            <li>I could use it right away and not have to wait while it went from dry to wet.</li>

            <li> I could use it right away and not have to wait while it went from dry to wet.</li>
            <li> After a little over a week, there has not been considerable change to my skin&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> A little cleaning product is all you need and the sponge produces a lot of lather and skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I noticed it is starting to tear in other places.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really dry sponge, but it was in fact moist in the packaging.</li>
            <li> sponge has a thread attached for hanging so your sponge can dry.</li>
            <li> As a dude, I wanted something for the shower that allowed me to lather up soap and scrub like a pouf, BUT I also wanted something that would stand up to more than a few measly weeks of scrubbing my rugged man-hide.</li>
            <li> I am actually using less soap then when I was using a loofah!  </li>
            <li> It has definitely helped to improve the texture of my skin in less than a week!  </li>
            <li> It has a slight smell to it, which I assume comes from the charcoal.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used one before, you&#x27;re def missing out.</li>
            <li> I typically use them for a circular massage, scrubbing without soap, before I get into the shower, then proceed with washing up as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their product in the past before</li>
            <li> : Your shower sidekick has arrived, and it&#x27;s ready to fight dirty!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.</li>
            <li> I love Konjac sponges and have bought several different brands before buying this one. If you haven&#x27;t used one before, you&#x27;re def missing out. My sponge was soft, durable, and I even bought a couple as gifts. Def will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a couple months and it has already started to tear at the top. I noticed it is starting to tear in other places. I&#x27;ve used their product in the past before but i guess this one isn&#x27;t as good as the last one.    This is made really nicely. It came already damp, which was nice. I could use it right away and not have to wait while it went from dry to wet.</li>
            <li> This premium sponge is the softest out in the market! It&#x27;s so good that this is my second time buying a Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li> I like the luxurious feeling this sponge gives.  It soaps up well.  I am actually using less soap then when I was using a loofah!  I will replace my sponge when it needs it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son and so far he is very happy with this sponge. I came across these looking on Amazon and charcoal is supposed to be a great tool for fighting acne. I am happy with the results. His skin looks like their is already an improvement. I am also waiting on charcoal soap to try that with the sponge. I want to add that this seller is fantastic to purchase from and will definitely buy future items as well.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and the ability to not use product!</li>
            <li> Pro: very soft in use  Con: has crumbled into pieces after 2 days use</li>

            <li> I like these sponges. They are made from the same plant as konnyaku and shirataki noodles, so they have a &amp;#34;squiggly&amp;#34; feel to them.  They appear to help exfoliate the dryer skin I am starting to have as I mature. I typically use them for a circular massage, scrubbing without soap, before I get into the shower, then proceed with washing up as usual.</li>
            <li> Feels good to the touch, but mine ripped two days in.  Deteriorated quickly afterward.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting this in the mail and was eager to use it. I was expecting a really dry sponge, but it was in fact moist in the packaging. When I used it it was spectacular, it left my skin feeling light, clean, and more amazing than any other cleansing sponge I have used in the past. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It has definitely helped to improve the texture of my skin in less than a week!  I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes body wash very sudsy</li>
            <li> love this product so much. I&#x27;ve noticed a massive difference of skin smoothness and cleanliness since using!!</li>
            <li> As a dude, I wanted something for the shower that allowed me to lather up soap and scrub like a pouf, BUT I also wanted something that would stand up to more than a few measly weeks of scrubbing my rugged man-hide. I demanded durability! Enter the Konjac sponge! This tenacious little masterpiece has endured several grueling months of lathering, rinsing, &amp; repeating - and has never failed! It is truly a worthy companion! So listen up you Gladiators of Grime, Soldiers of Spotless, and Contenders of Clean: Your shower sidekick has arrived, and it&#x27;s ready to fight dirty!</li>

            <li> This sponge is great! A little cleaning product is all you need and the sponge produces a lot of lather and skin is soft. sponge has a thread attached for hanging so your sponge can dry. will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle exfoliant. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I thought it would be a little more abrasive.  I was looking for a loofah alternative.  But it holds soap and body wash well.</li>
