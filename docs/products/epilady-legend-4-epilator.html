            <li>I haven&#x27;t found it to be THAT great.  </li>

            <li>Great price, works well</li>

            <li>Product works great for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I AM APPAULED AT A COMPANY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT COMPANY AND SUPPOSED TO MAKE A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Works great on my legs</li>
            <li>I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE HAS EXPERIENCED BLISTERS AFTER EPILATION WITH THE EPILADY LEGEND.  </li>
            <li>HAS ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE EXPERIENCED THIS?  </li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>The Epilady Legend 4th Generation is a great replacement.  </li>
            <li>Worked great on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>works great, painless and saves a lot of money on waxing&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I experienced a lot of pain here.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>It was great.  </li>
            <li>However, it is GREAT for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I have been using epiladys for years and the revisions for the 4th version are great.  </li>
            <li>Then the great idea....</li>
            <li>It is a great solution for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; women.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very easy to use, portable</li>
            <li>I love my results!!</li>

            <li>Better than the one I had (for about 16 years!!)</li>
            <li>Be sure to order the Epilation cream too!!</li>
            <li>yes it has been very effective.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I guess is a good product fro brave girls, eventhough i read the reviews</li>
            <li>Not quite as successful in the bikini area;</li>
            <li>I purchased the item again from another seller on Amazon, and the package was perfect, and I was able to give it to her.  </li>
            <li>I told her how much I loved it, and now she loves it too.</li>
            <li>I had the Coil Epilady years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I have been delighted with the device.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hair remover --- I use it on my face.</li>
            <li>After that, you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Good customer service.</li>
            <li>AND I TAKE EXTREMELY GOOD CARE OF MY  POSSESIONS AND  </li>
            <li>Epilady had really good reviews, so I got it.</li>
            <li>Does its job and a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get a good loofah and some lotion with alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li>Good............. ....... . .</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair shake though</li>
            <li>exfoliating, moisturizing and all that happiness to prevent ingrown</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I returned it otherwise</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair try for about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I needed a really good pep talk.</li>
            <li>The battery does not hold a good charge.</li>
            <li>maybe another brand would be good but</li>
            <li>The device arrived promptly and with packaging in good condition.</li>
            <li>It was very easy and worked great.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it without having it plugged in too was great.  </li>
            <li>Great results :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>So I did return this one but am very pleased with the Epilady product.</li>
            <li>It was the latest rage, the great technological innovation that would save us from our razors....</li>
            <li>great item, love it,</li>
            <li>but right now it performs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I found it best to use right after the shower.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an epilator, and I am very happy!  </li>
            <li>This is better than waxing and saves you a ton of money compared to waxing!  </li>
            <li>everyone loves them more now!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>We love the Epilady!</li>
            <li>Make sure you are purchasing from an authorized dealer before you place your order!  </li>
            <li>Sure!  </li>
            <li>Love this epilator!</li>
            <li>She loves it, and says it works so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>I bought two more for my daughters too!</li>
            <li>It does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I am silky smooth from head to toe, and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>great for fine hair but does nothing for hardier growth.  </li>
            <li>I have used this type of depilatory for over 25 years, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It works great on my under -arm, but my legs don&#x27;t feel smooth like when I use the razor.</li>
            <li>Kind of worked for awhile but never got all the hair off.</li>
            <li>It was delivered before the delivery date and I used to use an epilady, years ago, and it kind of hurt...</li>
            <li>and I was kind of nervous since I didn&#x27;t know how it was supposed to feel.</li>
            <li>It removes the unwanted hair on my legs nicely.</li>
            <li>I used to own one of these.</li>
            <li>This feature is handy.</li>
            <li>but I figured I&#x27;d just try my best to take it like a champ because I really wanted the results that it promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I TELL IS THE HONEST TO GODS TRUTH.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it really compares to others, but like I said, for me, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>Not my kind of hair removal.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it is cordless though</li>
            <li>nice that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>love, love, love my epilady and will never shave my legs again or wax or thread my face!!</li>
            <li>At first I kept checking to make sure it was plucking and not shaving LOL!  </li>
            <li>THE EPILADY WORKS BEST ON A PARTICULAR TYPE OF HAIR...</li>
            <li>I bought this especially to uses on my face for unwanted hair, and it does a wonderful job, I&#x27;m sure it would work great on you legs</li>
            <li>This new modle is awesome.  </li>
            <li>And my new best friend!</li>
            <li>Its my new best friend!</li>
            <li>The fact that quick touch-ups were easier with an epilator was great too.</li>
            <li>Looks like Mom was right!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best Epilator that I have had so far.  </li>
            <li>Each method has its own drawbacks and most of which I found unacceptable.</li>
            <li>it works, and it is much more effective then shaving, but it hurts like a mother....</li>
            <li>2-3 times a month for maintenance and more effective</li>
            <li>have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Super effective!</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, the reviews were good!  </li>
            <li>I was happy with it first until it broke.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just saving some money by purchasing from the seller with the lowest price, but turns out in this case, it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>and quick too!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not discuss bikini line, but I&#x27;m certain it will work great.</li>
            <li>Honestly love this product.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on this product I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Will know better in the months to come.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go with the more compact version</li>
            <li>and I love it just as well.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I spend more time using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like an irritant than pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I just love the ease of the epilady,My legs never feel stubbley anymore ,</li>
            <li>It was ok but not an Epilady.  </li>
            <li>Then I went to their web site but the price was more than I could afford.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it so many times</li>
            <li>so that was even better.</li>
            <li>But the Epilady does a better job.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the easier it will become.</li>
            <li>I was even able to do some of my bikini area.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
            <li>For those of you that can&#x27;t tolerate pain, I would recommend just putting some baby powder on and make sure that you stretch the skin where you plan to shave.  </li>
            <li>If you want to have smooth skin and no hair, I would recommend purchasing!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase, even ordered a 2nd one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>People say your tolerance builds up the more you use it, but I have not experianced this.</li>
            <li>Keeps my most tender area hairless (lips)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people still shave when this is available!</li>
            <li>I have owned many Epiladys.  </li>
            <li>Then, I thought surely I was psyching myself out about it..</li>
            <li>I have been a user of the Epilady product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love the option of using the electricity or battery.  </li>
            <li>Works okay.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t quite do the more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I think it is more my anxiety than pain or product difficulties.</li>
            <li>The hair stays away longer for sure.</li>
            <li>Have been extremely pleased with it and wished I had gotten one sooner.  </li>
            <li>The newer version had more heads</li>
            <li>I also have a Tweeze that I love and can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
            <li>I love the 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I have been using epilators for more then 15 years.</li>
            <li>I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO USE MY EPILADY;</li>
            <li>While it did hurt quite a bit more than I had hoped, I don&#x27;t know how</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I got it.</li>
            <li>NO, it does NOT remove more than 60% on my face.</li>
            <li>I think this product works better in some areas over others and that&#x27;s why I rated it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Over all I am more satisfied with the Epilady over bleaching my face</li>
            <li>so it does better on the arms.  </li>
            <li>You have to be able to see what you are doing to see if you&#x27;ve removed all the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>It works okay, hurts a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love my Epilady, have used them for many years.</li>
            <li>Four of us on my household love</li>
            <li>You have to move it over the area many, many times.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve had this a year and decided it was time to write a review.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Epiladys for over 20 years and love them.</li>
            <li>, I tried it over the course of a month just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Go with Braun and make sure you research</li>
            <li>So if you are planning to do this, make sure you know what you are getting into.</li>
            <li>Mostly I use below Knees.</li>
            <li>After many uses, I no longer even felt any stinging.</li>
            <li>Love using in car when my husband and I are on a driving vacation.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to have mostly smooth legs</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be better.</li>
            <li>This Legend 4 is so much better.  </li>
            <li>No pain -- feels more like a &amp;#34;micro-massage&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I bought this epilator to replace a Braun model that I dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li>I am so glad a did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to find it.  </li>
            <li>Many many years ago, somewhere in my college days, my grandmother gave me an Epilady for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>More time-consuming, but also much more satisfying.</li>
            <li>I love amazon.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad Amazon.com has it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better ones we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting this epilady would be better than the one I have had for about 15 years, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>AND if you use it properly.. It does a wonderful job</li>
            <li>- leaves my skin smooth for weeks!</li>
            <li>Plenty of power, but you must keep it plugged in to get the most use.</li>
            <li>I love that his one is cordless.  </li>
            <li>Now I love this and can tolerate it anywhere I need to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this epilady legend 4.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming the more</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>so much better then waxing.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the Epilady.</li>
            <li>Gets better with time.</li>
            <li>Light, dual voltage if you travel and it smooth your skin, good bye hair</li>
            <li>thx:)</li>
            <li>It pinches a lot sometimes, but it&#x27;s so much better than waxing or plucking.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I use it once a week or every 10 days and my legs are always looking and feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>Love not having to shave.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it sure beats shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>It works better and faster.  </li>
            <li>I am so unbelievably happy with my new epilady!  </li>
            <li>The Epicady seems like a good choice for first time users.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it is so worth it!!</li>
            <li>Had an issue with the cord 11 months after purchasing, but customer service was great and is sending me a new one.  </li>
            <li>I think the new model is a great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to epilators, but I have to say the Epilady  legend 4 is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d waxed for years but never used an epilator, so this was a joy--no more messiness of the waxing, easy to use all over, even in tackling bikini line and underarm.  </li>
            <li>My legs were smooth and awesome until the hairs started growing back.</li>
            <li>I find it works best if use the epilady on a consistent basis, keeping up with new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Many many years ago I purchased the original epilady and did use it for some time.  </li>
            <li>How to ruin an excellent product ... pity.</li>
            <li>I promise it makes it so much better and practically pain free.</li>
            <li>They say you can wait three weeks or so between sessions, but I really love a smooth feel</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, yes it hurts the first time you use it, but the pain greatly decreases the more you use it.</li>
            <li>But the 30 day return was the clincher....and right from the moment I started using this I&#x27;ve been thrilled.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this product!!</li>
            <li>I used to have the original elpilady and that one worked sooo much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grab hairs you don&#x27;t want to remove</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The maintenance is SOO easy.  </li>
            <li>makes it easy to do bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I use an older eliplator which I thought was good.  </li>
            <li>The epilator seems much faster and stronger and that makes it more effective.</li>
            <li>Be aware that if your hair is very fine, no epilator will be able to remove all of it.</li>
            <li>It does great with more course hair, but I have to go back over fine body hair quite a bit to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The directions say to charge for a full 12 hours out of the box, but I was able to do two rounds of epilation (legs and underarms) before charging.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator and to be honest</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the convenience of using this for when I don&#x27;t have easy access to an outlet or lighting when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li>Takes a while to do my legs with fine fuzz and hair direction and all, but with the hair softening over time, I haven&#x27;t had to remove hair as often since it doesn&#x27;t feel all stubbly.  </li>
            <li>It ran fine</li>
            <li>(years of waxing means some of my hairs grow out really fine).  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and it seems to break it off and leave stubble for about 50% of my leg areas--bummer.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried maybe a half dozen of these over 20 years, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>but I am so impressed with this little device that I had to give it props.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a HUGE money and time saver folks.  </li>
            <li>Having owned one of the first editions of the Epilady, I can really say this is an amazing improvement!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the product&#x27;s ability to remove the root, therefore not leaving a shadow for my underarms.  </li>
            <li>The angle is really important.</li>
            <li>Epilady&#x27;s used to glide smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li>Works great but not on the finer facial hair.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for coarse hairs on the legs.</li>
            <li>you are going to get one, don&#x27;t go cheap.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product a lot.</li>
            <li>effective and battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you are fair skinned, sensitive skinned, etc, think twice.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I USED THE EILADY LEGEND FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WAS PLEASED WITH HOW EASY AND COMFORTABLE THE EPILADY WAS TO HANDLE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>My only comment (not negative) is that the  PAG (Perfect Angle Guide) attachment seems to just cut the hair and not pull it out by the root</li>
            <li>Epilady is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is an effective product with high quality.</li>
            <li>You could not find the original Epilady anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I deffinately was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This unit replaces my original one after 15 years.</li>
            <li>I ORIGINALLY PURCHASHED AN EPILADY</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered the original Epilady like I had before.</li>
            <li>The first time is the hardest for sure...</li>
            <li>I miss the original version.</li>
            <li>so a lot of mine are super fine) and around the knees.</li>
            <li>Although I was TERRIFIED the first time I used it, the sensation was more discomfort than pain, and has disappeared with my continued use.  </li>
            <li>(the original coil model did not work there for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope they love them as much as I do!</li>
            <li>The current model is light and rechargeable, so good for travel too.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this is the best way to deal with unwanted hair and overall</li>
            <li>Super smooth results.</li>
            <li>INITIAL PAIN IS WORTH IT!!!!  </li>
            <li>/handle the epliator correctly to remove hairs, but so far I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love that it can be recharged as the Tweeze cannot and uses up batteries pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the Braun has 3 speeds and a special \\&quot;crown\\&quot; with something made to massage the skin in order to reduce the pain, while pulling the hair.</li>
            <li>I have many large tattoos, so</li>
            <li>Wow, amazing.</li>
            <li>but then again, in time I may grow to love it as much as my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful at all.  </li>
            <li>My mom had one of the originals back in the 80s and loved hers.  </li>
            <li>What I love about Epilators is how much money I have saved over razors and waxing during 25 years.</li>
            <li>AGAIN SHOPPING FOR ANOTHER FULL SIZED</li>
            <li>, I may just have the fastest growing hair in the world, but leg hair removed by the root shouldn&#x27;t be visible in 2 days I think.. and a good 50% of the hair growing back is ingrown and just under the surface of the skin, making it</li>
            <li>definitely say that for a mid-range priced epilator (with 40 tweezers) it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li>Works very well, much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because I know have childbirth to compare it to, but still, it was tolerable, and not bad at all when used after that as maintenance.  </li>
            <li>The edges were pretty easy.</li>
            <li>This model is a huge step above the original, and I am glad to spend hard-earned money on something that leaves my skin smooth, without razor stubble after one day.</li>
            <li>Super fast and more powerful than the one I bought about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>AND THERE WAS ONLY 1 KIND AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally a couple of days ago as i sat on a sofa positioned over a rug with padding under it, it slipped from my hand as I was attempting a quick touchup on my leg before heading out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still pain, just mild pain.  </li>
            <li>But, it also is more productive than the older ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was shipped and delivered quickly and had no issues with seller, in fact it was cheaper than going to the Epilady website.</li>
            <li>It removed my underarm hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Works well and quickly</li>
            <li>I have been using Epilady since the very first model.</li>
            <li>In researching which one to buy, I realized I bought the very first one ever, 25 years ago.</li>
            <li>It just feels like the tweezers have dulled since the very first time..</li>
            <li>Holds a good long charge on the batteries.</li>
            <li>After a lot of sifting through numerous models this is a great replacement for an older model that died.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and cost as much as your one waxing appointment.</li>
            <li>What I love about this new one is cordless.</li>
            <li>Bought this new model and love it.</li>
            <li>risky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Epilady EP-810-33A several days ago, and am so glad I took the plunge!</li>
            <li>I gave it only four stars because it does miss some stubble, but I still love it!</li>
            <li>I had an original Epilady (the coil type) when they first came out.</li>
            <li>since fast was fine for me.  </li>
            <li>This little gem works great.</li>
            <li>A great product for women with heavy hair growth.</li>
            <li>then the face and arm pits because it&#x27;s just a smooth straight surface</li>
            <li>It was better, by far, but still tended to snag your skin and hurt when it grabbed and yanked out your hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has one and loves it completely - she would give it a 5 * for sure.  </li>
            <li>The Epilady looks more intimidating the the Braun smooth, smaller design.</li>
            <li>Among all the hair removal method I have tried, it is so far the easiest and most economical one.</li>
            <li>Id say its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>, I was so happy that when my old razor stopped working, I would buy it again years later.</li>
            <li>This one is more gentle, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It hurts some, but is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>My arm pits were more sensitive</li>
            <li>But satisfying so far</li>
            <li>This model is worth the investment</li>
            <li>I have an old epilady from about 15 years ago, and it works so much better</li>
            <li>But now I have such smooth underarms that look way better than they</li>
            <li>And even if you stuck it out and endured the agony to try to get your money&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li>Really powerful.</li>
            <li>It hurts but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It is well designed to fit nicely in a woman&#x27;s hand, well balanced to do its job, conveniently cordless when charged up, and quieter than any other I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Epilady user since the 1980s, probably one of their first models.</li>
            <li>Item delivered quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove hair neariy as good as other Epilady</li>
            <li>This model is all right but does not work as well as</li>
            <li>You do have to get the right angle with this one though.</li>
            <li>the hair will be tweezed right out.</li>
            <li>Worked great first few times using it.  </li>
            <li>I had an original Epilady for years and loved it so much that when it finally died, I bought a new one right away.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and came with a guide attachment to teach you the proper angle to hold it against your skin to pull the hair out.</li>
            <li>I feel like it plucks faster, hurts less, and removes more hair in one swipe if you more slower.</li>
            <li>I almost enjoy maintenance now because it&#x27;s totally painfree and so easy to</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts at first, but it&#x27;s bearable and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This epilady was fun for first time epilation</li>
            <li>This epilady was fun for first time epilation</li>
            <li>As long as I do it real quick every two days or so, I stay pretty hair free.</li>
            <li>Also it was worth the price alone when I got a very tiny fine sliver out of my butt cheek with it!</li>
            <li>I ordered this because, as an older woman, my skin is rough and shaving is hazardous!</li>
            <li>It works nearly as quickly as an electric razor, and of course lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is kind of dry</li>
            <li>but when I use it against my skin, my dry skin gets kind of irritated.</li>
            <li>If you have been waxing, then this product is a perfect alternate and not as messy.</li>
            <li>I was only brave enough to use this on my bikini line once, but maybe others are tougher than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>More powerful then the last one I had.</li>
            <li>This new Epilady Legend doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, I even did my under arms!!!</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I would be hair free for at least one full week, but not the case.  </li>
            <li>so I can take it with me whilst away and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my original one was until I received the new one.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all!</li>
            <li>The cat came and investigated the noise, and was as interested as me.</li>
            <li>I had an Epilady years ago when they first came out.  </li>
            <li>, my legs are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it last for even more years.</li>
            <li>I would like a smaller-headed device for the face, but this one worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>IT DID HURT AT FIRST, BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO USE IT</li>
            <li>have gone by since I had the first one.  </li>
            <li>I was in ecstasy with this item when i first purchased.  </li>
            <li>and I ended up with literally hundreds of ingrown leg hairs, red, infected, caught under the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>The first one I received had to be returned because one prong stuck out a bit</li>
            <li>It does pinch a bit at first</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>I recommend waxing first and then using Epilady to maintain it.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this much more than waxing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cleaner!  </li>
            <li>Had received a dud the first time.</li>
            <li>Find it to not be as consistent and take a lot longer</li>
            <li>After first time, I never felt that again.</li>
            <li>I try to plug the Epilady in at bedtime and unplug it promptly first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>The thing is I&#x27;ve had to use it about every two days for like two weeks in order to get all those hairs that weren&#x27;t grown out the first time around.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it on my legs</li>
            <li>not only is your hair not used to being plucked out, but you HAVE a lot more hair than after you&#x27;ve been doing it a while.  </li>
            <li>After that first time, I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  </li>
            <li>It can be ticklish at first to get used to using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an epilator since they first came out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>First, it does sting during use because it is ripping out the hair by the root.</li>
            <li>The Epicady seems like a good choice for first time users.ou are a first time user, chances are that you will experience a lot of pain during the first few times.</li>
            <li>First time to use an epilator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using an Epilady.  </li>
            <li>the first go around on the bikini area</li>
            <li>It took me about 3 hours the first time I did this to remove all the hair and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about this I think it&#x27;s worth a try - given the fact that the price is reasonable - and see how it works for you.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 3 hours the first time I did this to remove all the hair and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about this I think it&#x27;s worth a try - given the fact that the price is reasonable - and see how it works for you.  </li>
            <li>The description of the product states exactly what you are going to received.</li>
            <li>When my first one broke, I was devastated...</li>
            <li>When I first started using an Epilady</li>
            <li>This my first epilator.</li>
            <li>After the first week, I didn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with the newer version, seems I have to keep going over the same area of the leg, before it grabs all the hair, even after using it for a month or more.</li>
            <li>It rips the hair out so if you aren&#x27;t ready for that, move along!</li>
            <li>First off, I am a guy</li>
            <li>Note: The first time using this HURT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The FIRST time you use it, THERE WILL BE PAIN.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>For personal care products, I will always make sure the seller is authorized before purchase.  </li>
            <li>First time epilators -</li>
            <li>I was only able to do my legs...</li>
            <li>it really gets better and easier and is completely worth it if your that daily shaver type of person).  </li>
            <li>I had my first one for 13 years and have gone through 2 of the newer versions within 1 year and now 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user of an epilator</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always pull the hair on the first pass, so keep moving around to get all hairs.</li>
            <li>Absolutely would NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I higher end&lt;br /&gt;/stronger battery.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Legs were smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I got my first Epilady probably 30 years ago and at first</li>
            <li>The earlier version brought tears to my eyes, but I struggled on until I just couldn&#x27;t any more.  </li>
            <li>This one is so much nicer!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for this for so long, I am happy I finally found it!</li>
            <li>I had an old one and thought a new model might do a better job but no difference.  </li>
            <li>So far hair continues to come back - but so easy to use and not painful (on chin)!</li>
            <li>It definitely takes some getting used to but it is also definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>So is making sure to follow the directions: warm bath or steamy shower to open the pores, and don&#x27;t put lotion on for half an hour.</li>
            <li>So much better than shaving or depilitories and last so much longer.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am in love with this product and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it over 10 years ago, it really hurt when I removed the hair with it.</li>
            <li>Hurts the first time if you&#x27;re really hairy</li>
            <li>You really do get used to it after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I love how long I can go between shaving my underarms and legs.  </li>
            <li>This really did hurt when I first used it</li>
            <li>I had to really grit my teeth to get threw the first use</li>
            <li>I still love it because the hair stays gone for so long.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and the results last for a month.</li>
            <li>I barely feel the prick when I use it now, even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Easy for her to work with and faster than the earlier epilator as well.</li>
            <li>Its design is smart and sturdy.</li>
            <li>epilator would miss smaller hairs, even some longer ones that were growing really fine</li>
            <li>and it did work fine initially, but eventually gave out.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this exact model almost three years ago through a different website.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a total loss, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair (assuming that is indeed the problem for me).</li>
            <li>Bought two of these for wife and daughter not as great as advertised , proof is that both still using other after giving a long trial with this product if u like unwelcome PSIN</li>
            <li>This one does not come with a light which actually helps in certain settings.</li>
            <li>And I stayed hair free for about 2 weeks before really noticing anything coming back in.</li>
            <li>but it is very tricky to get all the hair from your thighs removed.</li>
            <li>I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would die after like 10 minutes of continuous use</li>
            <li>really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model at all</li>
            <li>The arm that I used the epilady on was much smoother since the hair was removed from the root and stayed hairless longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked really well under the arms and in the bikini</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s much easier to pack in a suitcase .</li>
            <li>/&gt;--it just took much longer to get rid of hairs.  </li>
            <li>It felt like it was missing more and more hairs as the weeks went on so that with each use i was going over an area several times just to get rid of as much hair as i could (not all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried charging and the red light still goes on when it is plugged in, but nope, it refuses to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for the cordless feature and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Epilady.  </li>
            <li>This worked really well</li>
            <li>As for the pain level is not too much.</li>
            <li>i thought this should have lasted longer being as it is very pricey</li>
            <li>I used it on my underarms and it was gentle to use.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the one I used twenty years ago.</li>
            <li>my arms did not get red at all, and were baby smooth after using the epilady.  </li>
            <li>I had to watch online videos to really get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liberating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is good--a recharge gives two or three hours of use (which translates in real life to weeks).</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about trying it - after all it does rip your hair out by the roots...</li>
            <li>HELL, U ALREADY SPENT UR MONEY ON IT, THEY JUST WANT MORE TO FIX IT  </li>
            <li>but I appreciated the wireless option as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li>However, it did not hurt as much as others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I am a real user of this product and this is a legitimate review.  </li>
            <li>It does remove the hair very well on the legs if you can just power through the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really freaked me</li>
            <li>it, After 6 months of use we have much thinner hair.</li>
            <li>very tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep skin very taut in order to not have it get rolled up in epilator (ESP.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely manner and works very well.</li>
            <li>Very thorough.</li>
            <li>After awhile when using regularly, your legs will always look and feel smooth, even if there are missd hairs.</li>
            <li>If you are hairy, you probably know how much of a pain all that can be!&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>Could these things really have improved that much?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>But the next week I did find where I used it was still free of hair.</li>
            <li>Really does get the hair off and keeps off longer.</li>
            <li>Being a truck driver I don&#x27;t have much time for shaving.</li>
            <li>my legs/arms feel so smooth afterward and it lasts for a while until the next shaving.</li>
            <li>but I have very fuzzy cheeks.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This item was p;urchased as a gift to my wife and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It takes FOREVER to do a whole leg.  </li>
            <li>No broken</li>
            <li>With the epilady the hair does grow in  much softer and lighter.  </li>
            <li>Makes life much easier than using wax.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>This epilady works,but not as well, but it does not hurt that much to use it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the old model, which I wondered about because it looked so different.</li>
            <li>and I said, well I&#x27;ll wait a few weeks and see how effective it really is.  </li>
            <li>and I find it difficult to get into good light to see my hairs when I am attached to a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, the most frustrating thing for me was that it caused more ingrown hair than my razor does.</li>
            <li>In addition, use the epilator after shower or in a warm steamy room if possible so that your pores open, allowing the hair to come out easier.</li>

            <li>I had the old Epilady from many years ago (with the coiled spring thing) which I used on my legs only.  </li>
            <li>Definitely works better right after a shower when pores are open.</li>
            <li>After that you&#x27;ll have a super lasting battery ;)</li>
            <li>Actually, compared to some older models of epilators I have tried, this is a near miracle. :-)  </li>
            <li>It works quickly and painlessly and I now have legs I can bare.</li>
            <li>With time and using the tips from the other reviewers I should be able to use this product on my legs...hopefully.</li>
            <li>I bought the 2nd competitor one because I was on vacation and forgot to bring my original.</li>
            <li>It works much faster that the older models.  </li>
            <li>do not know how long it will take for the hair to grow back, but I am encouraged by how easy and quick this was to use.</li>
            <li>, when this new model popped up one day as a Lightning Deal, it occurred to me to wonder how such ineffective torture devices were faring in today&#x27;s age of readily available customer reviews.  </li>
            <li>Yup, to my relief - finally, it came right out with my Epilady!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give the Legend 4 to my sister as gift for her birthday, but when I received it, the package was completely crushed, and I could easily tell it was not because of shipping.  </li>
            <li>according to the instructions, you have to drain the battery completely and then charge it exactly for 8 hours each time, and there is nothing to indicate when it is done.</li>
            <li>not worth going anywhere more.</li>
            <li>With the new model I finished in 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li>Eventually, the more you use, the less hair you will have.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars is that is doesn&#x27;t seem to work as efficiently as my 10 year older non-rechargable model.</li>
            <li>This epilator is OK, but you need to spend a lot of time before your legs are done, passing several times on the same area.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a while until my older sister asked me if I still had it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; like the older one did.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it would do a decent job for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I used to go over and over an area with an older epilator</li>
            <li>Going 4 to 6 weeks between using this doesn&#x27;t seem at all realistic to me.  </li>
            <li>Going 4 to 6 weeks between using this doesn&#x27;t seem at all realistic to me.  </li>
            <li>We replaced a much older epilator with this one and wife seems to like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I am using this product for over 15 years, have gone through different models, this recent one has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>It was just a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>I had an older model of the EpiLady</li>
            <li>Tender on the upper lip - but overall so much better than tweezing, waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li>and yes it does hurt at first and in those more sensitive areas but each time gets a little easier</li>
            <li>It leaves skin very soft and really helps with in growns.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time you use this your skin is silky smooth but after the first time you won&#x27;t really have silky smooth skin anymore because the hair begins to grow back at different rates in different areas so while you may be able to remove all the hair that is long enough to remove there will be some just below the surface that will poke out the next day and those you wouldn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li>I hate shaving and this is the perfect alternative to waxing, which will cost you way more money in the long run.</li>
            <li>and I have a high threshold for pain.  </li>
            <li>It was turned on high.</li>
            <li>with this thing are a no brainer, but I highly recommend it for arm pits too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>but I have a high tolerence for pain after all these years of razors, wax, threading, a no no, tweezing one at a time....</li>
            <li>It felt like sharp little pricks - not terrible by any means, and I was able to completely do both legs with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the performance initially; hair regrowth has been less, and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all after the first couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It does a much smoother job than the old one or the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Much quieter than my old one.  </li>
            <li>The first time, it took me 30 minutes to do both legs almost all the way up, both arms (I am really hairy), underarms, &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34;, and facial area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li>Since this hair comes back in within a week I don&#x27;t know that the pain and the time involved is worth it to continue using it in those areas.  </li>
            <li>Since this hair comes back in within a week I don&#x27;t know that the pain and the time involved is worth it to continue using it in those areas.  </li>
            <li>This is slow going, but effective.</li>
            <li>Stretching the skin as you use it definitely helps ease any discomfort, as well as making sure your skin is dry.</li>
            <li>The trick here was to use a little baby powder on the skin first, then use a clean towel to remove excess followed by the Epilady.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update on a later date, but right now I&#x27;d encourage you to buy.</li>
            <li>Priced right, a definite five star item.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any other epilator to compare it to, but it seems  to do what it promises, and the customer service is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Wireless is nice even if you do not necessarily need it, but charging it is a pain and may not last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like my new Epilady</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Epilady for over 20 years and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>LIVE ALONE  </li>
            <li>Therefore I decided to buy a new one, hoping for some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now with the faster new ones that&#x27;s all I use.</li>
            <li>I have found that it really doesn&#x27;t last a whole month though.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it is NOT more effective than my barely working Braun.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular epilady because my old one broke after 10 years of use.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t really have silky smooth skin anymore because the hair begins to grow back at different rates in different areas so while you may be able to remove all the hair that is long enough to remove there</li>
            <li>poor review is because it broke in a spectacular way after only 6 uses: the last two times I used it, the device ran out of charge very quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was supposed to be more quiet than other models.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does hurt for the first time but only because you have alot of hair.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Only hurts the first time around.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the first time you use it (especially in the bikini area) it hurts.</li>
            <li>It really will pluck even short short hairs that have barely surfaced, so when you are finished you have soft smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can find less than perfect with the Epilady is that it&#x27;s difficult to epilate the fine baby hairs on my upper thighs.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with any type of hair removal other than shaving and the first 3 times using the Epilady HURT.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I only got about 1/8th of my leg done and then needed a break.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me about this product and at first I brushed it off as another fad.</li>
            <li>the past 25 years or so, Epilady has been one of my favorite jokes.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth to the touch and view with my dark coarse hair.</li>
            <li>but you can not press down with this but only run it very lightly over your face.  </li>
            <li>After i used i get all my leg red red red.... and sallow, I have to pass several times over the same place to get a good result.</li>
            <li>This new model is completely different and is much improved.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly, but not appreciably more quiet.</li>
            <li>It works better than my Braun ever did and there is less pulling associated with the hair removal, especially in the under arm region.</li>
            <li>one lasted several years and luckily amazon keeps track of prior purchases</li>
            <li>And lastly, the skin tends to be red after each use, it usually fades in a few hours so it&#x27;s best to do this at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to remove hair all over, but the head is large enough to cover full areas quickly.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t complete even one leg.</li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement to my old one.</li>
            <li>The skin under my arms and in my bikini area is way too sensitive, so that option is out for me.  </li>
            <li>I used it in my face, and I have rosacea, which makes your face sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I had a different brand that went a lot faster and ripped that hair out fast.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I wanted the cordless convenience, my old cordless Braun had died.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt really pickup enough hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this epilady to replace my 10 year old one.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to do that with the old one.  </li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d bought the old model.</li>
            <li>It seems to work so far.  </li>
            <li>The old one I had you needed to use in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old epilady.</li>
            <li>but so far it has performed as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It was also faster than  my old one.  </li>
            <li>And also my legs were not as flaky after using it as with my old one.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait for all your hair to start growing out, but rather start early and keep using it every couple of days to maintain it.</li>
            <li>My old one just faded away.</li>
            <li>There is quite a difference between the old one and this one.</li>
            <li>But the Epilady has completely changed my relationship to body hair.</li>
            <li>is that nothing indicates when recharging is complete, so</li>
            <li>Shall I pursue my action to call them even though I bought it from you?</li>
            <li>AND  FOR ALL 3  OF EACH ONE TO DO THIS, SAME BRAND AND MOD NUMBER, THEN THERE MUST BE A FLAW SOMEWHERES</li>
            <li>Some of these reviews seem to be professional writers that are maybe hired to leave reviews.  </li>
            <li>I will probably also continue to use this on my arms because that hair grows back in so fast with a razor.  </li>
            <li>I will probably also continue to use this on my arms because that hair grows back in so fast with a razor.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So maybe it&#x27;s only by comparison that this one feels so much easier on the nerves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I would like to share a tip: if you are a first time user, chances are that you will experience a lot of pain during the first few times.</li>
            <li>Bought this one and expected it to be at least as good since years</li>
            <li>I like the faster speed setting and moving it more slowly on my arm.  </li>
            <li>of have to push down when using it to get full effect.</li>
            <li>However, I am not very happy with the latest model.</li>
            <li>It did pretty well on my face;  even though the head is a little large for use on the face.</li>
            <li>The fact that it wasn&#x27;t good with smaller hairs made it not a good option for facial hairs&lt;</li>
            <li>I would never do my under arms and it took pretty long too!!</li>
            <li>She had a much older model, obviously, because this is painless!!!  </li>
            <li>Went through two older versions and this is faster and smaller.  </li>
            <li>However, after the first few moments of use, I tend not to feel the sting so much.</li>
            <li>Finally, after over 10 years, my older model just needed a rest.....</li>
            <li>Once in a while it catches on a hair and there&#x27;s a little tug, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend if you find yourself shaving daily.  </li>
            <li>My upper legs are fine and light, but unfortunately those don&#x27;t get pulled by the epilady</li>
            <li>but when only a few hairs come in at a time...VERY easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>The negatives are 1) its kinda loud and 2) the hairs really attach to it, making it hard to leave it extra clean.</li>
            <li>While Epilady is a bit more expensive, it works so much better that the price difference is not important.,</li>
            <li>But it does work, it just takes a little time to remove the hair and you will likely still have to do some light plucking with tweezers for those hairs that this just won&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li>The new Epilady I just use like a regular style shaver.  </li>
            <li>Finally decided to buy the new cordless version.  </li>
            <li>It was just ok, found out the hard way not to use under arms!</li>
            <li>It does very well on the arms and is easier to use on the arms except in areas you can&#x27;t see like the back of the upper arms.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough for this to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>My white Swedish skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Use warm/wet compress for a minute prior to epilating and barely glide over the skin, making sure not to press to hard</li>
            <li>Twenty minutes every two weeks is all it takes, I apply plain EVOO when I&#x27;m done, and the next morning all redness is gone and my legs are so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised by how easy and relatively painless (at least compared to waxing)</li>
            <li>After my first complete epilation, I went back every few days and got any new growth.  </li>
            <li>but it does a pretty decent job in a small amount of time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only charged it once so far</li>
            <li>My old Epilady finally stopped working after 20 years of use.  </li>
            <li>Product pulls skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>so I left the old one at summer home.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I will purchase a smaller one.  </li>
            <li>EACH ONE, ALL THREE OF THEM,, A FEW MONTHS AFTER  RECEIVING, STARTED  RATTLING ,  GRINDING  , AND NOT CUTTING WELL</li>
            <li>sadly most of the hair it removes is just broken rather then pulled out.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on my legs and underarms and the more you use it the less painful; to be honest, it only hurt in my underarms the firt time, after that it is easier, I just have to touch up plus the hair is thinner and weaker.</li>
            <li>it just isn&#x27;t the same as the old unit that I have, it&#x27;s noisy now but as long as it works, I&#x27;ll continue using it, instead of the new one..</li>
            <li>Yes there is some stinging, but it&#x27;s minor unless you are doing any super sensitive areas or just have very sensitive or delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, that&#x27;s why I love this little machine, it pulls the hair out down to the root which makes it slower to grow back to where I can feel it.</li>
            <li>Hair on arms &amp; legs is becoming less and less.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to shave my legs though, but the hair dosent grow back as fast on the legs, which is a big plus lady&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The secret to using it is right after a hot shower when your pores are open.  </li>
            <li>It is so far improved from the earlier prototypes, it should have a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise it removes the hair totally and when it grows back there is no stubble feel, the hair is soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The armpits are by far the most difficult to do with this product.  </li>
            <li>You have to do little circles and many little circles in the same area before it removes the hair.  </li>
            <li>After talking to a friend and discovering we both were female chin hair bearers, with several failed methods of removal, she tried the Epilady and found it extremely effective.</li>
            <li>ibuprofen the first few times you use this.</li>
            <li>Clean non-hairy arms and legs last for 2-3 wks and after having used these products for several years I have very little hair left on my arms and legs</li>
            <li>Even though it added a little time, my legs were SO SMOOTH, and the epilady reduced the wee dark spots of hair root</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Epilady - the first one lasted 5 years, the second one lasted 10 years, so although the cost may seem high, this product costs less than $8 per year - what other method can beat that?</li>
            <li>After getting through the initial pain from the first &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; over my legs, it does hurt much less!</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;d be sorry because the hair would come back strong!  </li>
            <li>my face, I will say that because the head is larger and there is a buffer on each side of the head, you can&#x27;t get very close to your ears, but with one pass it gets a lot of the tiny little fine hairs and in a few minutes (probably less than five)</li>
            <li>If you press down it will remove a light layer of your skin and you will be left with red patches that will take a few days to heal and go away.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and no matter how carefully and slowly I move, this just doesn&#x27;t pick up some of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Next time I need a new device, I may well try one of the other brands.</li>
            <li>that was the most painful because there was so much hair to remove.  </li>
            <li>that was the most painful because there was so much hair to remove.  </li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it to be THAT great.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> I AM APPAULED AT A COMPANY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT COMPANY AND SUPPOSED TO MAKE A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Works great on my legs</li>
            <li> I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE HAS EXPERIENCED BLISTERS AFTER EPILATION WITH THE EPILADY LEGEND.  </li>
            <li> HAS ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE EXPERIENCED THIS?  </li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> The Epilady Legend 4th Generation is a great replacement.  </li>
            <li> Worked great on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> works great, painless and saves a lot of money on waxing&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I experienced a lot of pain here.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It was great.  </li>
            <li> However, it is GREAT for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I have been using epiladys for years and the revisions for the 4th version are great.  </li>
            <li> Then the great idea....</li>

            <li> Be sure to order the Epilation cream too!!</li>
            <li> yes it has been very effective.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I guess is a good product fro brave girls, eventhough i read the reviews</li>
            <li> Not quite as successful in the bikini area;</li>
            <li> I purchased the item again from another seller on Amazon, and the package was perfect, and I was able to give it to her.  </li>
            <li> I told her how much I loved it, and now she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I had the Coil Epilady years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I have been delighted with the device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair remover --- I use it on my face.</li>
            <li> After that, you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Good customer service.</li>
            <li> AND I TAKE EXTREMELY GOOD CARE OF MY  POSSESIONS AND  </li>
            <li> Epilady had really good reviews, so I got it.</li>
            <li> Does its job and a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get a good loofah and some lotion with alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li> Good............. ....... . .</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair shake though</li>
            <li> exfoliating, moisturizing and all that happiness to prevent ingrown</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I returned it otherwise</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair try for about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I needed a really good pep talk.</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold a good charge.</li>
            <li> maybe another brand would be good but</li>
            <li> The device arrived promptly and with packaging in good condition.</li>
            <li> It was very easy and worked great.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it without having it plugged in too was great.  </li>
            <li> Great results :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> So I did return this one but am very pleased with the Epilady product.</li>
            <li> It was the latest rage, the great technological innovation that would save us from our razors....</li>
            <li> great item, love it,</li>
            <li> but right now it performs perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I found it best to use right after the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an epilator, and I am very happy!  </li>
            <li> This is better than waxing and saves you a ton of money compared to waxing!  </li>
            <li> everyone loves them more now!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> We love the Epilady!</li>
            <li> Make sure you are purchasing from an authorized dealer before you place your order!  </li>
            <li> Sure!  </li>
            <li> Love this epilator!</li>
            <li> She loves it, and says it works so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I bought two more for my daughters too!</li>
            <li> It does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I am silky smooth from head to toe, and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> great for fine hair but does nothing for hardier growth.  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of depilatory for over 25 years, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It works great on my under -arm, but my legs don&#x27;t feel smooth like when I use the razor.</li>
            <li> Kind of worked for awhile but never got all the hair off.</li>
            <li> It was delivered before the delivery date and I used to use an epilady, years ago, and it kind of hurt...</li>
            <li> and I was kind of nervous since I didn&#x27;t know how it was supposed to feel.</li>
            <li> It removes the unwanted hair on my legs nicely.</li>
            <li> I used to own one of these.</li>
            <li> This feature is handy.</li>
            <li> but I figured I&#x27;d just try my best to take it like a champ because I really wanted the results that it promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I TELL IS THE HONEST TO GODS TRUTH.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it really compares to others, but like I said, for me, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not my kind of hair removal.</li>
            <li> It is nice that it is cordless though</li>
            <li> nice that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> love, love, love my epilady and will never shave my legs again or wax or thread my face!!</li>
            <li> At first I kept checking to make sure it was plucking and not shaving LOL!  </li>
            <li> THE EPILADY WORKS BEST ON A PARTICULAR TYPE OF HAIR...</li>
            <li> I bought this especially to uses on my face for unwanted hair, and it does a wonderful job, I&#x27;m sure it would work great on you legs</li>
            <li> This new modle is awesome.  </li>
            <li> And my new best friend!</li>
            <li> Its my new best friend!</li>
            <li> The fact that quick touch-ups were easier with an epilator was great too.</li>
            <li> Looks like Mom was right!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best Epilator that I have had so far.  </li>
            <li> Each method has its own drawbacks and most of which I found unacceptable.</li>
            <li> it works, and it is much more effective then shaving, but it hurts like a mother....</li>
            <li> 2-3 times a month for maintenance and more effective</li>
            <li> have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Super effective!</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, the reviews were good!  </li>
            <li> I was happy with it first until it broke.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just saving some money by purchasing from the seller with the lowest price, but turns out in this case, it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> and quick too!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not discuss bikini line, but I&#x27;m certain it will work great.</li>
            <li> Honestly love this product.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this product I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Will know better in the months to come.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go with the more compact version</li>
            <li> and I love it just as well.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I spend more time using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like an irritant than pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I just love the ease of the epilady,My legs never feel stubbley anymore ,</li>
            <li> It was ok but not an Epilady.  </li>
            <li> Then I went to their web site but the price was more than I could afford.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it so many times</li>
            <li> so that was even better.</li>
            <li> But the Epilady does a better job.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the easier it will become.</li>
            <li> I was even able to do some of my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
            <li> For those of you that can&#x27;t tolerate pain, I would recommend just putting some baby powder on and make sure that you stretch the skin where you plan to shave.  </li>
            <li> If you want to have smooth skin and no hair, I would recommend purchasing!  </li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase, even ordered a 2nd one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> People say your tolerance builds up the more you use it, but I have not experianced this.</li>
            <li> Keeps my most tender area hairless (lips)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people still shave when this is available!</li>
            <li> I have owned many Epiladys.  </li>
            <li> Then, I thought surely I was psyching myself out about it..</li>
            <li> I have been a user of the Epilady product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love the option of using the electricity or battery.  </li>
            <li> Works okay.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t quite do the more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think it is more my anxiety than pain or product difficulties.</li>
            <li> The hair stays away longer for sure.</li>
            <li> Have been extremely pleased with it and wished I had gotten one sooner.  </li>
            <li> The newer version had more heads</li>
            <li> I also have a Tweeze that I love and can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
            <li> I love the 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for more then 15 years.</li>
            <li> I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO USE MY EPILADY;</li>
            <li> While it did hurt quite a bit more than I had hoped, I don&#x27;t know how</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I got it.</li>
            <li> NO, it does NOT remove more than 60% on my face.</li>
            <li> I think this product works better in some areas over others and that&#x27;s why I rated it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> Over all I am more satisfied with the Epilady over bleaching my face</li>
            <li> so it does better on the arms.  </li>
            <li> You have to be able to see what you are doing to see if you&#x27;ve removed all the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It works okay, hurts a lot.  </li>
            <li> I love my Epilady, have used them for many years.</li>
            <li> Four of us on my household love</li>
            <li> You have to move it over the area many, many times.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve had this a year and decided it was time to write a review.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Epiladys for over 20 years and love them.</li>
            <li> , I tried it over the course of a month just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Go with Braun and make sure you research</li>
            <li> So if you are planning to do this, make sure you know what you are getting into.</li>
            <li> Mostly I use below Knees.</li>
            <li> After many uses, I no longer even felt any stinging.</li>
            <li> Love using in car when my husband and I are on a driving vacation.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to have mostly smooth legs</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be better.</li>
            <li> This Legend 4 is so much better.  </li>
            <li> No pain -- feels more like a &amp;#34;micro-massage&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I bought this epilator to replace a Braun model that I dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li> I am so glad a did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad to find it.  </li>
            <li> Many many years ago, somewhere in my college days, my grandmother gave me an Epilady for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> More time-consuming, but also much more satisfying.</li>
            <li> I love amazon.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m glad Amazon.com has it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the better ones we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting this epilady would be better than the one I have had for about 15 years, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> AND if you use it properly.. It does a wonderful job</li>
            <li> - leaves my skin smooth for weeks!</li>
            <li> Plenty of power, but you must keep it plugged in to get the most use.</li>
            <li> I love that his one is cordless.  </li>
            <li> Now I love this and can tolerate it anywhere I need to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this epilady legend 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming the more</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> so much better then waxing.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love the Epilady.</li>
            <li> Gets better with time.</li>
            <li> Light, dual voltage if you travel and it smooth your skin, good bye hair</li>
            <li> thx:)</li>
            <li> It pinches a lot sometimes, but it&#x27;s so much better than waxing or plucking.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I use it once a week or every 10 days and my legs are always looking and feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> Love not having to shave.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it sure beats shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> It works better and faster.  </li>
            <li> I am so unbelievably happy with my new epilady!  </li>
            <li> The Epicady seems like a good choice for first time users.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it is so worth it!!</li>
            <li> Had an issue with the cord 11 months after purchasing, but customer service was great and is sending me a new one.  </li>
            <li> I think the new model is a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to epilators, but I have to say the Epilady  legend 4 is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d waxed for years but never used an epilator, so this was a joy--no more messiness of the waxing, easy to use all over, even in tackling bikini line and underarm.  </li>
            <li> My legs were smooth and awesome until the hairs started growing back.</li>
            <li> I find it works best if use the epilady on a consistent basis, keeping up with new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Many many years ago I purchased the original epilady and did use it for some time.  </li>
            <li> How to ruin an excellent product ... pity.</li>
            <li> I promise it makes it so much better and practically pain free.</li>
            <li> They say you can wait three weeks or so between sessions, but I really love a smooth feel</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, yes it hurts the first time you use it, but the pain greatly decreases the more you use it.</li>
            <li> But the 30 day return was the clincher....and right from the moment I started using this I&#x27;ve been thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this product!!</li>
            <li> I used to have the original elpilady and that one worked sooo much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grab hairs you don&#x27;t want to remove</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The maintenance is SOO easy.  </li>
            <li> makes it easy to do bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I use an older eliplator which I thought was good.  </li>
            <li> The epilator seems much faster and stronger and that makes it more effective.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if your hair is very fine, no epilator will be able to remove all of it.</li>
            <li> It does great with more course hair, but I have to go back over fine body hair quite a bit to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The directions say to charge for a full 12 hours out of the box, but I was able to do two rounds of epilation (legs and underarms) before charging.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and to be honest</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the convenience of using this for when I don&#x27;t have easy access to an outlet or lighting when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li> Takes a while to do my legs with fine fuzz and hair direction and all, but with the hair softening over time, I haven&#x27;t had to remove hair as often since it doesn&#x27;t feel all stubbly.  </li>
            <li> It ran fine</li>
            <li> (years of waxing means some of my hairs grow out really fine).  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and it seems to break it off and leave stubble for about 50% of my leg areas--bummer.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe a half dozen of these over 20 years, and this is the best.</li>
            <li> but I am so impressed with this little device that I had to give it props.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a HUGE money and time saver folks.  </li>
            <li> Having owned one of the first editions of the Epilady, I can really say this is an amazing improvement!  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the product&#x27;s ability to remove the root, therefore not leaving a shadow for my underarms.  </li>
            <li> The angle is really important.</li>
            <li> Epilady&#x27;s used to glide smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great but not on the finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for coarse hairs on the legs.</li>
            <li> you are going to get one, don&#x27;t go cheap.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product a lot.</li>
            <li> effective and battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you are fair skinned, sensitive skinned, etc, think twice.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I USED THE EILADY LEGEND FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WAS PLEASED WITH HOW EASY AND COMFORTABLE THE EPILADY WAS TO HANDLE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> My only comment (not negative) is that the  PAG (Perfect Angle Guide) attachment seems to just cut the hair and not pull it out by the root</li>
            <li> Epilady is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is an effective product with high quality.</li>
            <li> You could not find the original Epilady anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I deffinately was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This unit replaces my original one after 15 years.</li>
            <li> I ORIGINALLY PURCHASHED AN EPILADY</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered the original Epilady like I had before.</li>
            <li> The first time is the hardest for sure...</li>
            <li> I miss the original version.</li>
            <li> so a lot of mine are super fine) and around the knees.</li>
            <li> Although I was TERRIFIED the first time I used it, the sensation was more discomfort than pain, and has disappeared with my continued use.  </li>
            <li> (the original coil model did not work there for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope they love them as much as I do!</li>
            <li> The current model is light and rechargeable, so good for travel too.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, this is the best way to deal with unwanted hair and overall</li>
            <li> Super smooth results.</li>
            <li> INITIAL PAIN IS WORTH IT!!!!  </li>
            <li> /handle the epliator correctly to remove hairs, but so far I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I love that it can be recharged as the Tweeze cannot and uses up batteries pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the Braun has 3 speeds and a special \\&quot;crown\\&quot; with something made to massage the skin in order to reduce the pain, while pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> I have many large tattoos, so</li>
            <li> Wow, amazing.</li>
            <li> but then again, in time I may grow to love it as much as my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful at all.  </li>
            <li> My mom had one of the originals back in the 80s and loved hers.  </li>
            <li> What I love about Epilators is how much money I have saved over razors and waxing during 25 years.</li>
            <li> AGAIN SHOPPING FOR ANOTHER FULL SIZED</li>
            <li> , I may just have the fastest growing hair in the world, but leg hair removed by the root shouldn&#x27;t be visible in 2 days I think.. and a good 50% of the hair growing back is ingrown and just under the surface of the skin, making it</li>
            <li> definitely say that for a mid-range priced epilator (with 40 tweezers) it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> Works very well, much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because I know have childbirth to compare it to, but still, it was tolerable, and not bad at all when used after that as maintenance.  </li>
            <li> The edges were pretty easy.</li>
            <li> This model is a huge step above the original, and I am glad to spend hard-earned money on something that leaves my skin smooth, without razor stubble after one day.</li>
            <li> Super fast and more powerful than the one I bought about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> AND THERE WAS ONLY 1 KIND AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally a couple of days ago as i sat on a sofa positioned over a rug with padding under it, it slipped from my hand as I was attempting a quick touchup on my leg before heading out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still pain, just mild pain.  </li>
            <li> But, it also is more productive than the older ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was shipped and delivered quickly and had no issues with seller, in fact it was cheaper than going to the Epilady website.</li>
            <li> It removed my underarm hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well and quickly</li>
            <li> I have been using Epilady since the very first model.</li>
            <li> In researching which one to buy, I realized I bought the very first one ever, 25 years ago.</li>
            <li> It just feels like the tweezers have dulled since the very first time..</li>
            <li> Holds a good long charge on the batteries.</li>
            <li> After a lot of sifting through numerous models this is a great replacement for an older model that died.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy and cost as much as your one waxing appointment.</li>
            <li> What I love about this new one is cordless.</li>
            <li> Bought this new model and love it.</li>
            <li> risky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Epilady EP-810-33A several days ago, and am so glad I took the plunge!</li>
            <li> I gave it only four stars because it does miss some stubble, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> I had an original Epilady (the coil type) when they first came out.</li>
            <li> since fast was fine for me.  </li>
            <li> This little gem works great.</li>
            <li> A great product for women with heavy hair growth.</li>
            <li> then the face and arm pits because it&#x27;s just a smooth straight surface</li>
            <li> It was better, by far, but still tended to snag your skin and hurt when it grabbed and yanked out your hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has one and loves it completely - she would give it a 5 * for sure.  </li>
            <li> The Epilady looks more intimidating the the Braun smooth, smaller design.</li>
            <li> Among all the hair removal method I have tried, it is so far the easiest and most economical one.</li>
            <li> Id say its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> , I was so happy that when my old razor stopped working, I would buy it again years later.</li>
            <li> This one is more gentle, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It hurts some, but is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> but so worth it.</li>
            <li> My arm pits were more sensitive</li>
            <li> But satisfying so far</li>
            <li> This model is worth the investment</li>
            <li> I have an old epilady from about 15 years ago, and it works so much better</li>
            <li> But now I have such smooth underarms that look way better than they</li>
            <li> And even if you stuck it out and endured the agony to try to get your money&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li> Really powerful.</li>
            <li> It hurts but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is well designed to fit nicely in a woman&#x27;s hand, well balanced to do its job, conveniently cordless when charged up, and quieter than any other I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Epilady user since the 1980s, probably one of their first models.</li>
            <li> Item delivered quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair neariy as good as other Epilady</li>
            <li> This model is all right but does not work as well as</li>
            <li> You do have to get the right angle with this one though.</li>
            <li> the hair will be tweezed right out.</li>
            <li> Worked great first few times using it.  </li>
            <li> I had an original Epilady for years and loved it so much that when it finally died, I bought a new one right away.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and came with a guide attachment to teach you the proper angle to hold it against your skin to pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> I feel like it plucks faster, hurts less, and removes more hair in one swipe if you more slower.</li>
            <li> I almost enjoy maintenance now because it&#x27;s totally painfree and so easy to</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts at first, but it&#x27;s bearable and well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This epilady was fun for first time epilation</li>
            <li> This epilady was fun for first time epilation</li>
            <li> As long as I do it real quick every two days or so, I stay pretty hair free.</li>
            <li> Also it was worth the price alone when I got a very tiny fine sliver out of my butt cheek with it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because, as an older woman, my skin is rough and shaving is hazardous!</li>
            <li> It works nearly as quickly as an electric razor, and of course lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is kind of dry</li>
            <li> but when I use it against my skin, my dry skin gets kind of irritated.</li>
            <li> If you have been waxing, then this product is a perfect alternate and not as messy.</li>
            <li> I was only brave enough to use this on my bikini line once, but maybe others are tougher than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> More powerful then the last one I had.</li>
            <li> This new Epilady Legend doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, I even did my under arms!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I would be hair free for at least one full week, but not the case.  </li>
            <li> so I can take it with me whilst away and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my original one was until I received the new one.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all!</li>
            <li> The cat came and investigated the noise, and was as interested as me.</li>
            <li> I had an Epilady years ago when they first came out.  </li>
            <li> , my legs are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it last for even more years.</li>
            <li> I would like a smaller-headed device for the face, but this one worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> IT DID HURT AT FIRST, BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO USE IT</li>
            <li> have gone by since I had the first one.  </li>
            <li> I was in ecstasy with this item when i first purchased.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up with literally hundreds of ingrown leg hairs, red, infected, caught under the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> The first one I received had to be returned because one prong stuck out a bit</li>
            <li> It does pinch a bit at first</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> I recommend waxing first and then using Epilady to maintain it.  </li>
            <li> I actually like this much more than waxing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cleaner!  </li>
            <li> Had received a dud the first time.</li>
            <li> Find it to not be as consistent and take a lot longer</li>
            <li> After first time, I never felt that again.</li>
            <li> I try to plug the Epilady in at bedtime and unplug it promptly first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> The thing is I&#x27;ve had to use it about every two days for like two weeks in order to get all those hairs that weren&#x27;t grown out the first time around.  </li>
            <li> first time I used it on my legs</li>
            <li> not only is your hair not used to being plucked out, but you HAVE a lot more hair than after you&#x27;ve been doing it a while.  </li>
            <li> After that first time, I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  </li>
            <li> It can be ticklish at first to get used to using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator since they first came out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> First, it does sting during use because it is ripping out the hair by the root.</li>
            <li> The Epicady seems like a good choice for first time users.ou are a first time user, chances are that you will experience a lot of pain during the first few times.</li>
            <li> First time to use an epilator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using an Epilady.  </li>
            <li> the first go around on the bikini area</li>
            <li> It took me about 3 hours the first time I did this to remove all the hair and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about this I think it&#x27;s worth a try - given the fact that the price is reasonable - and see how it works for you.  </li>

            <li> The description of the product states exactly what you are going to received.</li>
            <li> When my first one broke, I was devastated...</li>
            <li> When I first started using an Epilady</li>
            <li> This my first epilator.</li>
            <li> After the first week, I didn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with the newer version, seems I have to keep going over the same area of the leg, before it grabs all the hair, even after using it for a month or more.</li>
            <li> It rips the hair out so if you aren&#x27;t ready for that, move along!</li>
            <li> First off, I am a guy</li>
            <li> Note: The first time using this HURT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The FIRST time you use it, THERE WILL BE PAIN.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> For personal care products, I will always make sure the seller is authorized before purchase.  </li>
            <li> First time epilators -</li>
            <li> I was only able to do my legs...</li>
            <li> it really gets better and easier and is completely worth it if your that daily shaver type of person).  </li>
            <li> I had my first one for 13 years and have gone through 2 of the newer versions within 1 year and now 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of an epilator</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always pull the hair on the first pass, so keep moving around to get all hairs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely would NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I higher end&lt;br /&gt;/stronger battery.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Legs were smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I got my first Epilady probably 30 years ago and at first</li>
            <li> The earlier version brought tears to my eyes, but I struggled on until I just couldn&#x27;t any more.  </li>
            <li> This one is so much nicer!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for so long, I am happy I finally found it!</li>
            <li> I had an old one and thought a new model might do a better job but no difference.  </li>
            <li> So far hair continues to come back - but so easy to use and not painful (on chin)!</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some getting used to but it is also definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> So is making sure to follow the directions: warm bath or steamy shower to open the pores, and don&#x27;t put lotion on for half an hour.</li>
            <li> So much better than shaving or depilitories and last so much longer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am in love with this product and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it over 10 years ago, it really hurt when I removed the hair with it.</li>
            <li> Hurts the first time if you&#x27;re really hairy</li>
            <li> You really do get used to it after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I love how long I can go between shaving my underarms and legs.  </li>
            <li> This really did hurt when I first used it</li>
            <li> I had to really grit my teeth to get threw the first use</li>
            <li> I still love it because the hair stays gone for so long.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and the results last for a month.</li>
            <li> I barely feel the prick when I use it now, even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Easy for her to work with and faster than the earlier epilator as well.</li>
            <li> Its design is smart and sturdy.</li>
            <li> epilator would miss smaller hairs, even some longer ones that were growing really fine</li>
            <li> and it did work fine initially, but eventually gave out.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this exact model almost three years ago through a different website.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a total loss, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair (assuming that is indeed the problem for me).</li>
            <li> Bought two of these for wife and daughter not as great as advertised , proof is that both still using other after giving a long trial with this product if u like unwelcome PSIN</li>
            <li> This one does not come with a light which actually helps in certain settings.</li>
            <li> And I stayed hair free for about 2 weeks before really noticing anything coming back in.</li>
            <li> but it is very tricky to get all the hair from your thighs removed.</li>
            <li> I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would die after like 10 minutes of continuous use</li>
            <li> really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model at all</li>
            <li> The arm that I used the epilady on was much smoother since the hair was removed from the root and stayed hairless longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked really well under the arms and in the bikini</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s much easier to pack in a suitcase .</li>
            <li> /&gt;--it just took much longer to get rid of hairs.  </li>
            <li> It felt like it was missing more and more hairs as the weeks went on so that with each use i was going over an area several times just to get rid of as much hair as i could (not all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried charging and the red light still goes on when it is plugged in, but nope, it refuses to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for the cordless feature and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Epilady.  </li>
            <li> This worked really well</li>
            <li> As for the pain level is not too much.</li>
            <li> i thought this should have lasted longer being as it is very pricey</li>
            <li> I used it on my underarms and it was gentle to use.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the one I used twenty years ago.</li>
            <li> my arms did not get red at all, and were baby smooth after using the epilady.  </li>
            <li> I had to watch online videos to really get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very liberating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is good--a recharge gives two or three hours of use (which translates in real life to weeks).</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about trying it - after all it does rip your hair out by the roots...</li>
            <li> HELL, U ALREADY SPENT UR MONEY ON IT, THEY JUST WANT MORE TO FIX IT  </li>
            <li> but I appreciated the wireless option as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li> However, it did not hurt as much as others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I am a real user of this product and this is a legitimate review.  </li>
            <li> It does remove the hair very well on the legs if you can just power through the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really freaked me</li>
            <li> it, After 6 months of use we have much thinner hair.</li>
            <li> very tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep skin very taut in order to not have it get rolled up in epilator (ESP.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner and works very well.</li>
            <li> Very thorough.</li>
            <li> After awhile when using regularly, your legs will always look and feel smooth, even if there are missd hairs.</li>
            <li> If you are hairy, you probably know how much of a pain all that can be!&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Could these things really have improved that much?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> But the next week I did find where I used it was still free of hair.</li>
            <li> Really does get the hair off and keeps off longer.</li>
            <li> Being a truck driver I don&#x27;t have much time for shaving.</li>
            <li> my legs/arms feel so smooth afterward and it lasts for a while until the next shaving.</li>
            <li> but I have very fuzzy cheeks.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This item was p;urchased as a gift to my wife and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER to do a whole leg.  </li>
            <li> No broken</li>
            <li> With the epilady the hair does grow in  much softer and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Makes life much easier than using wax.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> This epilady works,but not as well, but it does not hurt that much to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the old model, which I wondered about because it looked so different.</li>
            <li> and I said, well I&#x27;ll wait a few weeks and see how effective it really is.  </li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to get into good light to see my hairs when I am attached to a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, the most frustrating thing for me was that it caused more ingrown hair than my razor does.</li>
            <li> In addition, use the epilator after shower or in a warm steamy room if possible so that your pores open, allowing the hair to come out easier.</li>

            <li> I had the old Epilady from many years ago (with the coiled spring thing) which I used on my legs only.  </li>
            <li> Definitely works better right after a shower when pores are open.</li>
            <li> After that you&#x27;ll have a super lasting battery ;)</li>
            <li> Actually, compared to some older models of epilators I have tried, this is a near miracle. :-)  </li>
            <li> It works quickly and painlessly and I now have legs I can bare.</li>
            <li> With time and using the tips from the other reviewers I should be able to use this product on my legs...hopefully.</li>
            <li> I bought the 2nd competitor one because I was on vacation and forgot to bring my original.</li>
            <li> It works much faster that the older models.  </li>
            <li> do not know how long it will take for the hair to grow back, but I am encouraged by how easy and quick this was to use.</li>
            <li> , when this new model popped up one day as a Lightning Deal, it occurred to me to wonder how such ineffective torture devices were faring in today&#x27;s age of readily available customer reviews.  </li>
            <li> Yup, to my relief - finally, it came right out with my Epilady!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give the Legend 4 to my sister as gift for her birthday, but when I received it, the package was completely crushed, and I could easily tell it was not because of shipping.  </li>
            <li> according to the instructions, you have to drain the battery completely and then charge it exactly for 8 hours each time, and there is nothing to indicate when it is done.</li>
            <li> not worth going anywhere more.</li>
            <li> With the new model I finished in 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Eventually, the more you use, the less hair you will have.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is that is doesn&#x27;t seem to work as efficiently as my 10 year older non-rechargable model.</li>
            <li> This epilator is OK, but you need to spend a lot of time before your legs are done, passing several times on the same area.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a while until my older sister asked me if I still had it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; like the older one did.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it would do a decent job for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I used to go over and over an area with an older epilator</li>
            <li> Going 4 to 6 weeks between using this doesn&#x27;t seem at all realistic to me.  </li>
            <li> Going 4 to 6 weeks between using this doesn&#x27;t seem at all realistic to me.  </li>
            <li> We replaced a much older epilator with this one and wife seems to like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for over 15 years, have gone through different models, this recent one has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> It was just a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of the EpiLady</li>
            <li> Tender on the upper lip - but overall so much better than tweezing, waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li> and yes it does hurt at first and in those more sensitive areas but each time gets a little easier</li>
            <li> It leaves skin very soft and really helps with in growns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time you use this your skin is silky smooth but after the first time you won&#x27;t really have silky smooth skin anymore because the hair begins to grow back at different rates in different areas so while you may be able to remove all the hair that is long enough to remove there will be some just below the surface that will poke out the next day and those you wouldn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving and this is the perfect alternative to waxing, which will cost you way more money in the long run.</li>
            <li> and I have a high threshold for pain.  </li>
            <li> It was turned on high.</li>
            <li> with this thing are a no brainer, but I highly recommend it for arm pits too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> but I have a high tolerence for pain after all these years of razors, wax, threading, a no no, tweezing one at a time....</li>
            <li> It felt like sharp little pricks - not terrible by any means, and I was able to completely do both legs with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the performance initially; hair regrowth has been less, and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all after the first couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It does a much smoother job than the old one or the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Much quieter than my old one.  </li>
            <li> The first time, it took me 30 minutes to do both legs almost all the way up, both arms (I am really hairy), underarms, &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34;, and facial area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li> Since this hair comes back in within a week I don&#x27;t know that the pain and the time involved is worth it to continue using it in those areas.  </li>
            <li> Since this hair comes back in within a week I don&#x27;t know that the pain and the time involved is worth it to continue using it in those areas.  </li>
            <li> This is slow going, but effective.</li>
            <li> Stretching the skin as you use it definitely helps ease any discomfort, as well as making sure your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> The trick here was to use a little baby powder on the skin first, then use a clean towel to remove excess followed by the Epilady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update on a later date, but right now I&#x27;d encourage you to buy.</li>
            <li> Priced right, a definite five star item.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any other epilator to compare it to, but it seems  to do what it promises, and the customer service is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Wireless is nice even if you do not necessarily need it, but charging it is a pain and may not last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like my new Epilady</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Epilady for over 20 years and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> LIVE ALONE  </li>
            <li> Therefore I decided to buy a new one, hoping for some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now with the faster new ones that&#x27;s all I use.</li>
            <li> I have found that it really doesn&#x27;t last a whole month though.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it is NOT more effective than my barely working Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular epilady because my old one broke after 10 years of use.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t really have silky smooth skin anymore because the hair begins to grow back at different rates in different areas so while you may be able to remove all the hair that is long enough to remove there</li>
            <li> poor review is because it broke in a spectacular way after only 6 uses: the last two times I used it, the device ran out of charge very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was supposed to be more quiet than other models.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does hurt for the first time but only because you have alot of hair.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> Only hurts the first time around.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the first time you use it (especially in the bikini area) it hurts.</li>
            <li> It really will pluck even short short hairs that have barely surfaced, so when you are finished you have soft smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can find less than perfect with the Epilady is that it&#x27;s difficult to epilate the fine baby hairs on my upper thighs.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with any type of hair removal other than shaving and the first 3 times using the Epilady HURT.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I only got about 1/8th of my leg done and then needed a break.  </li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product and at first I brushed it off as another fad.</li>
            <li> the past 25 years or so, Epilady has been one of my favorite jokes.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth to the touch and view with my dark coarse hair.</li>
            <li> but you can not press down with this but only run it very lightly over your face.  </li>
            <li> After i used i get all my leg red red red.... and sallow, I have to pass several times over the same place to get a good result.</li>
            <li> This new model is completely different and is much improved.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly, but not appreciably more quiet.</li>
            <li> It works better than my Braun ever did and there is less pulling associated with the hair removal, especially in the under arm region.</li>
            <li> one lasted several years and luckily amazon keeps track of prior purchases</li>
            <li> And lastly, the skin tends to be red after each use, it usually fades in a few hours so it&#x27;s best to do this at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to remove hair all over, but the head is large enough to cover full areas quickly.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t complete even one leg.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement to my old one.</li>
            <li> The skin under my arms and in my bikini area is way too sensitive, so that option is out for me.  </li>
            <li> I used it in my face, and I have rosacea, which makes your face sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I had a different brand that went a lot faster and ripped that hair out fast.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted the cordless convenience, my old cordless Braun had died.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt really pickup enough hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilady to replace my 10 year old one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to do that with the old one.  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought the old model.</li>
            <li> It seems to work so far.  </li>
            <li> The old one I had you needed to use in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old epilady.</li>
            <li> but so far it has performed as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It was also faster than  my old one.  </li>
            <li> And also my legs were not as flaky after using it as with my old one.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait for all your hair to start growing out, but rather start early and keep using it every couple of days to maintain it.</li>
            <li> My old one just faded away.</li>
            <li> There is quite a difference between the old one and this one.</li>
            <li> But the Epilady has completely changed my relationship to body hair.</li>
            <li> is that nothing indicates when recharging is complete, so</li>
            <li> Shall I pursue my action to call them even though I bought it from you?</li>
            <li> AND  FOR ALL 3  OF EACH ONE TO DO THIS, SAME BRAND AND MOD NUMBER, THEN THERE MUST BE A FLAW SOMEWHERES</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews seem to be professional writers that are maybe hired to leave reviews.  </li>
            <li> I will probably also continue to use this on my arms because that hair grows back in so fast with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I will probably also continue to use this on my arms because that hair grows back in so fast with a razor.  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So maybe it&#x27;s only by comparison that this one feels so much easier on the nerves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I would like to share a tip: if you are a first time user, chances are that you will experience a lot of pain during the first few times.</li>
            <li> Bought this one and expected it to be at least as good since years</li>
            <li> I like the faster speed setting and moving it more slowly on my arm.  </li>
            <li> of have to push down when using it to get full effect.</li>
            <li> However, I am not very happy with the latest model.</li>
            <li> It did pretty well on my face;  even though the head is a little large for use on the face.</li>
            <li> The fact that it wasn&#x27;t good with smaller hairs made it not a good option for facial hairs&lt;</li>
            <li> I would never do my under arms and it took pretty long too!!</li>
            <li> She had a much older model, obviously, because this is painless!!!  </li>
            <li> Went through two older versions and this is faster and smaller.  </li>
            <li> However, after the first few moments of use, I tend not to feel the sting so much.</li>
            <li> Finally, after over 10 years, my older model just needed a rest.....</li>
            <li> Once in a while it catches on a hair and there&#x27;s a little tug, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend if you find yourself shaving daily.  </li>
            <li> My upper legs are fine and light, but unfortunately those don&#x27;t get pulled by the epilady</li>
            <li> but when only a few hairs come in at a time...VERY easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> The negatives are 1) its kinda loud and 2) the hairs really attach to it, making it hard to leave it extra clean.</li>
            <li> While Epilady is a bit more expensive, it works so much better that the price difference is not important.,</li>
            <li> But it does work, it just takes a little time to remove the hair and you will likely still have to do some light plucking with tweezers for those hairs that this just won&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li> The new Epilady I just use like a regular style shaver.  </li>
            <li> Finally decided to buy the new cordless version.  </li>
            <li> It was just ok, found out the hard way not to use under arms!</li>
            <li> It does very well on the arms and is easier to use on the arms except in areas you can&#x27;t see like the back of the upper arms.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough for this to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> My white Swedish skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Use warm/wet compress for a minute prior to epilating and barely glide over the skin, making sure not to press to hard</li>
            <li> Twenty minutes every two weeks is all it takes, I apply plain EVOO when I&#x27;m done, and the next morning all redness is gone and my legs are so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised by how easy and relatively painless (at least compared to waxing)</li>
            <li> After my first complete epilation, I went back every few days and got any new growth.  </li>
            <li> but it does a pretty decent job in a small amount of time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only charged it once so far</li>
            <li> My old Epilady finally stopped working after 20 years of use.  </li>
            <li> Product pulls skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> so I left the old one at summer home.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I will purchase a smaller one.  </li>
            <li> EACH ONE, ALL THREE OF THEM,, A FEW MONTHS AFTER  RECEIVING, STARTED  RATTLING ,  GRINDING  , AND NOT CUTTING WELL</li>
            <li> sadly most of the hair it removes is just broken rather then pulled out.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on my legs and underarms and the more you use it the less painful; to be honest, it only hurt in my underarms the firt time, after that it is easier, I just have to touch up plus the hair is thinner and weaker.</li>
            <li> it just isn&#x27;t the same as the old unit that I have, it&#x27;s noisy now but as long as it works, I&#x27;ll continue using it, instead of the new one..</li>
            <li> Yes there is some stinging, but it&#x27;s minor unless you are doing any super sensitive areas or just have very sensitive or delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, that&#x27;s why I love this little machine, it pulls the hair out down to the root which makes it slower to grow back to where I can feel it.</li>
            <li> Hair on arms &amp; legs is becoming less and less.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to shave my legs though, but the hair dosent grow back as fast on the legs, which is a big plus lady&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The secret to using it is right after a hot shower when your pores are open.  </li>
            <li> It is so far improved from the earlier prototypes, it should have a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise it removes the hair totally and when it grows back there is no stubble feel, the hair is soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The armpits are by far the most difficult to do with this product.  </li>
            <li> You have to do little circles and many little circles in the same area before it removes the hair.  </li>
            <li> After talking to a friend and discovering we both were female chin hair bearers, with several failed methods of removal, she tried the Epilady and found it extremely effective.</li>
            <li> ibuprofen the first few times you use this.</li>
            <li> Clean non-hairy arms and legs last for 2-3 wks and after having used these products for several years I have very little hair left on my arms and legs</li>
            <li> Even though it added a little time, my legs were SO SMOOTH, and the epilady reduced the wee dark spots of hair root</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Epilady - the first one lasted 5 years, the second one lasted 10 years, so although the cost may seem high, this product costs less than $8 per year - what other method can beat that?</li>
            <li> After getting through the initial pain from the first &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; over my legs, it does hurt much less!</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;d be sorry because the hair would come back strong!  </li>
            <li> my face, I will say that because the head is larger and there is a buffer on each side of the head, you can&#x27;t get very close to your ears, but with one pass it gets a lot of the tiny little fine hairs and in a few minutes (probably less than five)</li>
            <li> If you press down it will remove a light layer of your skin and you will be left with red patches that will take a few days to heal and go away.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and no matter how carefully and slowly I move, this just doesn&#x27;t pick up some of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Next time I need a new device, I may well try one of the other brands.</li>
            <li> that was the most painful because there was so much hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> that was the most painful because there was so much hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> The hard part is getting the angle right in some of those areas.</li>
            <li> I admit, it was a little painful the first time, but it sure does the job!  </li>
            <li> I thought this product would be a coil but its a whole bunch of sharp little tweezers that grab at you and hurt like the merry old devil.  </li>
            <li> have only used it once so far, so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but it was fast, easy and not as painful as expected.</li>
            <li> and soon you will notice that the pain has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> and soon you will notice that the pain has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> High recommend, but remember it takes a little patience in the beginning.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the high speed yet because it&#x27;s a little intimidating for me, but maybe once I get the hang of using an epilator</li>
            <li> Though not completely pain-free, after reading about various products, I&#x27;d say epilady is as close to painless as possible.  </li>
            <li> head is too small to cover large areas.</li>
            <li> It is my first and after reading other reviews, I was a little nervous about the pain.</li>
            <li> Instructions on how to use not clear enough.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re old like me though, pull your skin tight enough</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going someplace, I get out my Epilady, and in a very few minutes, I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> For me since my leg hairs are very dark and thick and start growing back in like 3 hours of shaving, the Epilady is SO worth it!</li>
            <li> For $72 (when I bought it) I would have expected much more use before it failed.</li>
            <li> red and sometimes tiny red bumps appear but they only last a few hours.</li>
            <li> My hair was tied back but a single strand got caught.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice: you really do have to aim the device exactly opposite to the direction of hair growth, and this can mean several passes in various directions on your more complicated body areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice thus far so, but I can say it is more painful than I expected</li>
            <li> so was tired of shaving and having dark stubble on my legs, which didnt eel soft except right after I shaved.</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard to find the right epilator and was extremely hesitant to purchase.</li>
            <li> Epilady is lightweight, the charging cord is very thin and long, making it just as easy to use plugged in as not.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad until I did my underarms.</li>
            <li> did purchase Dr. Numb cream to apply before using this on my bikini area, and I am glad for that.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt like crazy the first use but continue to use and it will get much easier.</li>
            <li> It doe snot get the small hairs, so you always have to wait and wait until you are really hairy, so you can have an smooth result, which is inconvenient because it can take weeks until you get all the hairs of a specific area to grow and while that happen you skin looks and feels like sand paper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female with coarse dark hair and have been waxing for 30 years.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I waited so long to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Yelped out loud a few times.  </li>
            <li> And lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected, but it seems to strip the hair at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;It can be charged for several hours and then used.</li>
            <li> It fell with a soft plod on the carpet and turned off.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get all of the hairs off of my legs.</li>
            <li> The unit would only keep a charge for roughly 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> This holds a charge a long time too.</li>
            <li> What does grow back is finer and harder to see/feel.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I debated for a long while on which brand/type to replace it with.</li>
            <li> The battery of this one lasts soooooo long when charged that it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair literally becomes more sparse and thin and is less and less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a cut hair (like in shaving) is sharp and stubbly.</li>
            <li> , it was somewhat uncomfortable but worth it!  </li>
            <li> And you can only do a little bit at a time because it causes ingrown hairs and red bumps.</li>
            <li> It actually removes hair, including those pesky chin hairs, with very minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> So the initial removal was way worse than waxing because it takes so much longer.  </li>
            <li> I love the epliators because when I use them my hair grows slowly and thin, so I don&#x27;t have to remove it often.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: OK, it&#x27;s 10 months later, I gave this little appliance a \\&quot;rest\\&quot; during the cold months of long sleeves and jeans.</li>
            <li> I ended up selling this after a single use.</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase, so sick of red bumps.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is a bit tougher than the average girl.</li>
            <li> I only bought this one because after 5 years of careful use, I dropped my other one on a tile floor and shattered it.</li>
            <li> Waited too long to return it; but it was not very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> it was a bit painful, but now the hairs are so fine I barely feel anything.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it outside into a snowbank for safety, where it eventually ran itself down.</li>
            <li> it was hard to see where exactly those few stray hairs were.</li>
            <li> This one stung when first used on really hairy legs, but wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> I got used to the slight pain which is no big deal.  </li>
            <li> As others said initially you feel a slight prick when removing the hair but after that no issues.</li>
            <li> After that, it faded into discomfort and now it is only slightly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like less hair is growing back, but maybe I&#x27;m just not remembering what it was like at first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initial use for both legs can take several days, working small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> it only pulls about half of the hairs at a time..</li>
            <li> Although it continues to pull the hair (which is painful) it became less effective at removing it.</li>
            <li> A little sting on my upper lip</li>
            <li> It took a little time for her to get used to the pulling and burining pain after the initial use, but she says that it is not noticible now.  </li>
            <li> The pain level is not that bad on the face again because the facial hairs are so fine.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why there is a such a dramatic difference since the basic mechanism of action seems the same.</li>
            <li> I expected to not be able to do it, but to my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it painful and instead love the feeling</li>
            <li> It is the MOST painful around the knees.  </li>
            <li> The feeling is tolerable on my legs, but the epilator is just not very efficient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these over the years, different generations.  </li>
            <li> So I did it just partially, one spot at a time.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as expected.</li>
            <li> Expected updated technology.  </li>
            <li> As for &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; - it is minimal.</li>
            <li> The replacement does not have that problem, but it is still rough on the skin:</li>
            <li> I initially charged it for a few hours, as directed, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since.</li>
            <li> They were closed.</li>
            <li> There is no gentle way to RIP hairs out of your skin.</li>
            <li> a device like is could really NOT hurt.</li>
            <li> It only removes a few hairs at a time.</li>
            <li> I could only do a few seconds at a time in some areas</li>
            <li> Never really stubbly, either, and never had the gorilla-hair-poking-out-of-my-pantyhose problem,</li>
            <li> so I only did a few spots.</li>
            <li> I could only stand it for a few minutes each time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I hated to throw more money at the company that had been such a rip-off (rip-off... ripping my hair off... ha!), but I was in one of those holiday buying frenzies and the deal was good, and I couldn&#x27;t quite stop myself from hitting the buy button.</li>
            <li> Its just the old ones were so slow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those products that some people may end up loving while others will hate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those products that some people may end up loving while others will hate.  </li>
            <li> , the first time is a little uncomfortable but the more you use it, the less uncomfortable it is and the faster the removal.</li>
            <li> A lot less messy than waxing and, after the initial cost, way cheaper in the long run!</li>
            <li> By that I mean that it takes longer time/more times to go over a given area in order to remove all the hair compared to my Braun (keep in mind that for maximum efficiency I remove completely the plastic cover that limits the contact with the skin and do not have problems with the curve as some other reviewers have pointed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can take some serious pain but this was nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li> but I felt very little pain just a series of short sharp stings that were milder than I expected.</li>
            <li> After that it started to slow down considerably.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took quite a number of uses before I noticed regrowth really slowing down, but with each session the &amp;#34;plucking&amp;#34; sensation has decreased as regrowth has slowed and the hairs that do regrow are finer.</li>
            <li> Almost no pain at all since there is very little hairs left.</li>
            <li> If the results aren&#x27;t achieved, I won&#x27;t continue to use it and will seek other hair removal options.</li>
            <li> No more daily plucking!</li>
            <li> I used the epilady on one arm and shaved the other.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s extremely hairy on her legs</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will last because of the cordless feature</li>
            <li> That is why some say that it is a torture device and other (LIKE MYSELF)</li>
            <li> I did a LOT of research on waxing and epilating before making a purchase, and ended up with the Epilady due to</li>
            <li> so I do it routinely every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> THE WALLS OR SIDES OR EACH OTHER  </li>
            <li> IF THE OTHER BRANDS  </li>
            <li> It can literally be used everywhere and it manages to take out 95% of the side effects I&#x27;ve endured with other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty uncomfortable but it works.</li>
            <li> The biggest reasons I chose it where, price and other ratings.</li>
            <li> Other parts, like legs and arms, you have to go over again and again.</li>
            <li> The second time I did my bikini area it pinched me and removed a small chunk of skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to guess the other reviews were bought.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, my hair seems to come back as though I&#x27;m using a shaver.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but none of them every work correctly.</li>
            <li> And other places.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who hates having sandpaper for legs due to shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 other brands of epilators.</li>
            <li> but always just a little dry and bumpy feeling.  </li>
            <li> But down the center?  </li>
            <li> It is a little more painful</li>
            <li> so you have to be very careful.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow...</li>
            <li> my hair is very blonde and hard to see so</li>
            <li> I had left a bad review at first but with continued use it truly does get easier.</li>
            <li> My first time it wasn&#x27;t painful but the areas I cleared felt tingly like a scratch after that initial pass over.</li>
            <li> THOUGH IT IS NOT FAST, IT IS NOT AS MESSY</li>
            <li> so it took me a LONG time to get all the hair off initially and my bikini area looked weird with patches of hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It does take going over each area a few times but that is probably to be expected.</li>
            <li> The Epilady is significantly less painful than any epilator I have ever used, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not pull out all black hairs, but the ones that did didn&#x27;t grow back for at least a week.</li>
            <li> and I will have gotten the hair from one leg, knee down.</li>
            <li> but applying lotion calms it down and all is good.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> it slowed down even when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> This cuts down on the ingrown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that if you get a waxing before using this, you can cut way down on the pain...</li>
            <li> It was painful, but it was well worth it!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with other brands ... waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The device is not very loud and painful at first.  </li>
            <li> No pain involved, but I have been using a epilator for years and there is less and less regrowth.  </li>
            <li> mine  broke in less than two yrs.  </li>
            <li> Previously owned a Braun but wnated a cordless.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also the most painful on the legs - because the hair is thick on the legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a quick fix though.</li>
            <li> And if your pain threshold is less, you can use this too, you just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for 5+ years and this hurts less.</li>
            <li> I have the previous model.</li>
            <li> but you have to be patience and run it back and forward at least few times to remove all hair.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted almost 10 years before it gave out.  </li>
            <li> Just because it really works well in my underarm area I decided to keep it, but I was really frustrated about the low performance in legs.</li>
            <li> hurts like previous models.  </li>
            <li> However, as the hair grows back, it becomes softer and softer, and much easier to use the Epilady to remove, and not at all painful.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t pull the skin tight which you need to do</li>
            <li> You must pull the skin tight here because this Epilady can pinch that area and cut and remove chunks of skin.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful on the face though because you will want to press down to get those hard to get hairs</li>
            <li> I allows me to shave less often instead of everyday.</li>
            <li> The biggest con is you need to do this at least once a week if not more depending on how picky you are about removing every last hair.  </li>
            <li> The biggest con is you need to do this at least once a week if not more depending on how picky you are about removing every last hair.  </li>
            <li> If I do shave it&#x27;s every 3-4 weeks during the summer, if I use the epilady - every 2 months, due to very little hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> There is a little pain involved but nothing compared to being waxed.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to angle</li>
            <li> This is a neat little device.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hurts a little</li>
            <li> It did leave a little bit of a bumpy rash under my arms</li>
            <li> But, you will get over it in about 3-4 sessions on your legs and a little longer for your under arms.</li>
            <li> It has trouble getting the little hairs</li>
            <li> and it hardly looked like I made progress after a lot of time spent doing it.  </li>
            <li> The pain is more annoying than bad, and only happens when I do my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I HAD WASTED MY MONEY ON</li>
            <li> and I had gotten yo the point where I was shaving those few &amp;#34;witch hairs&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like geting a tattoo, it hurts but not to the point of crying out and screaming.</li>
            <li> and I did stop and &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; a few times while doing them.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not smooth and silk under the arms like it is on the face.  </li>
            <li> I am having trouble finding any advice addressing my problem, and I&#x27;m not seeing reviews mentioning stubble, either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> Once both legs done, u will want to touch up ever few days in the beginning.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks you&#x27;ll NEVER have to buy razors or shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> Replaced it, but the battery was giving me trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather shave every few days.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase based solely on laziness; I was tired of shaving my legs several times a week, wanted a longer-lasting alternative, and I&#x27;ve found it with this epilator!  </li>
            <li> For a week I&#x27;d tried tweezers, duck tape, Elmer&#x27;s glue dried....</li>
            <li> I had some red patches where this removed a thin layer of my skin that was embarrassing for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The second time it was less painful because there was less hair to remove because all the hair doesn&#x27;t come back in at once.  </li>
            <li> The second time it was less painful because there was less hair to remove because all the hair doesn&#x27;t come back in at once.  </li>
            <li> I thought the original was PAINFUL to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Pay a whole bunch of money to painfully rip out every other hair on my leg?  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin and medium brown hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I give it a poor rating is because it tweezes about half the hair on my legs and breaks the other half.  </li>
            <li> And yes is painful for the first few use.</li>
            <li> It was painful the first time, but not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> For the arm pit and the face I usually have to do it every day for a few days before I can remove all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very little body hair now, so even when I haven&#x27;t shaved or epiladied in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I found it painful and very time consuming.</li>
            <li> You can push past the pain if you get the desired results.  </li>
            <li> lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 5 years ago, I received one from a friend who was too timid and anxious to use hers.</li>
            <li> Not impressed and won&#x27;t be purchasing anything from Epilady in the future.</li>
            <li> OR THEY WERE JUST TOO MESSY!</li>
            <li> THIS is you don&#x27;t want to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small one--</li>
            <li> NO MORE WAISTING MY MONEY FOR A  COMPANY WHOM DOES NOT CARE AND MAKES A CRAPY PRODUCT..........  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will.  </li>
            <li> I usually bleach the hair on my face but started to worry that that was leaving a mustache stain</li>
            <li> I have been using this Epilady to remove the hair on my legs every 1-2 weeks for the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The initial hair removal is difficult since it&#x27;s basically just like tweezing.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Bye bye messy wax, too!</li>
            <li> I will use this epilady until I am dead!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and the skin on  </li>
            <li> The pain is not nearly has bad as I expected for the bikini area</li>
            <li> It was seriously hard to even finish the job.</li>
            <li> and it would hardly hold the charge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming and it gets hard to bring myself to deal with the time and the pain involved.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming and it gets hard to bring myself to deal with the time and the pain involved.  </li>
            <li> I hardly believed it had removed the hairs until I saw the remains.</li>
            <li> This product was hard for me to find</li>
            <li> Yes, it isn&#x27;t completely painless, but it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> However having unwanted body hair and having sensitive skin is a really bad combo</li>
            <li> I think I am officially soured on the idea of epilators.</li>
            <li> No where near as painful as waxing your face, which HURTS.  </li>
            <li> and if I feel the least bit of regrowth - I hit it with the Epilady and can forget it for days.</li>
            <li> I got used to the old one as painful as it could be at times.</li>
            <li> I have used an Epilady for at least 30 years and I can&#x27;t go without one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bad about missing hairs...or entire sides of my legs, so this was needed for shorts.</li>
            <li> and I have thick course hair</li>
            <li> have thick hair on my legs and underarms and it hurts to yank them out.  </li>
            <li> Your skin has to slowly adjust to it.</li>
            <li> No more shaving or waxing for me!</li>
            <li> Like, ALL body hair below the eyelashes, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> No more stubble!  </li>
            <li> it was surprisingly less painful than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it was painless, but in all fairness i understand thats not a reasonable request for the job i want it to perform, and it is less painful than lower cost ones that ive tried.</li>
            <li> The great shining symbol of the stupid things women will fall for and horrible things women will endure in their fruitless pursuit of beauty.  </li>
            <li> Recently I briefly went back to shaving my legs, but it was awful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how well this works because it is PAINFUL!</li>
            <li> It became less and less painful as I tried and after a couple of months I could use it all over my legs at one time.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to use it because a friend said she used to have one and the tweezer action was painful.  </li>
            <li> A little worst than the face but not the most painful spot on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over-all it was a disappointment for the money spent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this product may work for those with thin leg hairs, if you have thick leg hairs, be warned.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little less painful</li>
            <li> Worse ever, I have had on before different brand and this one is bad.</li>
            <li> Professional waxing is too expensive and home waxing is too painful.</li>
            <li> If you have a unwanted hair issue, I would say at least try it!</li>
            <li> when my other epilady had to be replaced I shaved my legs and they felt terrible the next day.</li>
            <li> No more expensive razors--yay.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to move the Epilady in small circles.  </li>
            <li> I am not very impressed with the Epilady.</li>
            <li> I was new to epilators but hated shaving and was tired of the expense of waxing.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend it for the tough hairs that would require tweezers</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that bad</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not very efficient but it is not too bad</li>
            <li> I had tried at home waxing, sugaring, personal &amp;#34;laser&amp;#34; but they were all painful and difficult to do by yourself.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt (anymore) and I would recommend it to all girls tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> I really am not happy with this epilator.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> To my fortune, it&#x27;s not any worse than getting waxed.  </li>
            <li> 3 BROKEN EPILATORS.</li>
            <li> In fact, winter is worse because pants + stubble make me shudder just thinking about it.</li>
            <li> I hid it when it got here and tried it in secret.  </li>
            <li> Usually I find the pain is only horrible when I haven&#x27;t done it in a while, but even when I keep up on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously disappointed that I spent money on this...thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for some reason the Epilady is also way less painful than the Braun ever was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster to just shave and a lot less painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster to just shave and a lot less painful.  </li>
            <li> I use it the less painful it will be.</li>
            <li> I am still using this epilator, but am very disappointed with it so far.</li>
            <li> It is not as painful as some of the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Tough hairs need a few roll overs to get them out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it both made an annoying noise and felt rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> No more!!!</li>
            <li> Now, I tried this several times on my underarms and let me just say that the pain was horrible!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, charging it is a pain in the neck -</li>
            <li> This is the least painful epilator that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Now multiply it by 8 and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve got when you try to use this horrible thing!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong...</li>
            <li> me being a guy and doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> It was expensive.  </li>
            <li> I felt horribly guilty about it.  </li>
            <li> Not happy!!</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY HATED SHAVING EVERY DAY AND OTHER HAIR REMOVAL PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> ( She LOVES it), but she has very thin blond hair.</li>
            <li> When I charged it up for some serious spring cleaning, it no longer holds a charge!!</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have loose or saggy skin, it will grab that and it bruises terribly!</li>
            <li> I think it works the worst on the face because the hairs on the face or the finest and hardest for those little tweezers to grab.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awkward place</li>
            <li> my Epilady Discrette Plus 810 which I still use but am afraid it is going.</li>
            <li> yes, it hurts like crazy.</li>
            <li> It pulled out my thick leg hairs very painfully.</li>
            <li> I have always been insecure but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I evedn tried my bikini area and it was just as bad.</li>
            <li> The pain level is not too bad under the arms.  </li>
            <li> I tried in the 80&#x27;s when they 1st came out and &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;, now not so bad.  </li>
            <li> This one is advertised as not being as painful.  </li>
            <li> Some people say it&#x27;s painful and others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it is way too painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful to use, but I knew it would be.  </li>
            <li> It was so painful around the knees it gives me a pit of a stomach ache when I do that area.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still painful.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still painful.  </li>
            <li> It is not as painful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It is painful in the bikini area and it can&#x27;t be used in the face at all.  </li>
            <li> Not as painful as anticipated.</li>
            <li> Painful, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> but I was sick of shaving/waxing my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I guess the honeymoon is over  :(</li>
            <li> IN THE  PRODUCTION OF THE PATHETIC USELESS MONEY</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would burst into flames!</li>
            <li> you hate shaving, or, like me, need your glasses to see what you&#x27;re doing (which makes shaving in the shower impractical), this is your salvation.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving</li>
            <li> I decided to start using this because I hate the feel of stubble.</li>
            <li> HATE.</li>
            <li> , I started to hate that tip</li>
            <li> i hate hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> , I hated it as it was painful to use.  </li>
            <li> I plan on returning this terrible product.</li>
            <li> It hurts terrible.</li>
            <li> stupid thing is because the reviews said it didn&#x27;t hurt!!</li>
            <li> Take waxing... the awful, awful pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> and it was absolutely positively HORRIBLE.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Kind of worked for awhile but never got all the hair off. About a week in just stopped removing hair at all.</li>
            <li> Honestly love this product. My friend ordered it too cause I told her how much I loved it, and now she loves it too. I use it everywhere and it&#x27;s just awesome. It doesn&#x27;t hurt (anymore) and I would recommend it to all girls tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this product I purchased it.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice thus far so, but I can say it is more painful than I expected and I have a high threshold for pain.  You can push past the pain if you get the desired results.  Will know better in the months to come.  If the results aren&#x27;t achieved, I won&#x27;t continue to use it and will seek other hair removal options.</li>
            <li> This worked just like it stated it would. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Would recommend it to anyone. Try it.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I had an earlier version of an epilator, which i used with trepidation. It worked, but you had to go over and over the same area to get all the hairs. (And I am not at all hairy) It also pinched/pulled quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 5 years ago, I received one from a friend who was too timid and anxious to use hers. It was better, by far, but still tended to snag your skin and hurt when it grabbed and yanked out your hair. Underarms were especially risky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Epilady EP-810-33A several days ago, and am so glad I took the plunge! It does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I am silky smooth from head to toe, and am very pleased. It is so far improved from the earlier prototypes, it should have a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate shaving, or, like me, need your glasses to see what you&#x27;re doing (which makes shaving in the shower impractical), this is your salvation.  There is a learning curve, for novices, but it&#x27;s simple, and no stubble under your arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: OK, it&#x27;s 10 months later, I gave this little appliance a \\&quot;rest\\&quot; during the cold months of long sleeves and jeans.I used it occasionally on my upper lip, but that&#x27;s all.When I charged it up for some serious spring cleaning, it no longer holds a charge!! If I want to use it, I have to be plugged in...I guess the honeymoon is over  :(</li>
            <li> I had the Coil Epilady years ago and loved it. I decided to go with the more compact version and I love it just as well. It works great for one thing. Even the tiniest stub of hair doesn&#x27;t get missed. Yes there is some stinging, but it&#x27;s minor unless you are doing any super sensitive areas or just have very sensitive or delicate skin. It&#x27;s great that you can use it with or without the cord.</li>
            <li> Love this. No more daily plucking! So far hair continues to come back - but so easy to use and not painful (on chin)!</li>
            <li> I am not very impressed with the Epilady. It does remove hair from the lower leg but it is very tricky to get all the hair from your thighs removed. I spend more time using it then I had anticipated. Not impressed and won&#x27;t be purchasing anything from Epilady in the future. If you want to spend 2 plus hours removing your leg hair then go for it but I would rather just have my legs waxed...</li>
            <li> While I know it&#x27;s not for everyone, I like Epilady and their products.  I enjoy the convenience of using this for when I don&#x27;t have easy access to an outlet or lighting when I am traveling.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is that is doesn&#x27;t seem to work as efficiently as my 10 year older non-rechargable model.</li>
            <li> The head of the epilator is curved, and doesn&#x27;t always make contact with the surface of the skin. There are some body areas where this epilator does not work at all because it can&#x27;t reach the hair. I bought it because it was supposed to be more quiet than other models. It is slightly, but not appreciably more quiet.</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have loose or saggy skin, it will grab that and it bruises terribly! Otherwise it removes the hair totally and when it grows back there is no stubble feel, the hair is soft. Only a cut hair (like in shaving) is sharp and stubbly. I have used this type of depilatory for over 25 years, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> When epilators came on the market, I jumped on the bandwagon. Au! It hurt! I couldn&#x27;t complete even one leg. And I tried. I tried and ended up throwing the darn torture instrument around the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come the newest version of the Epilady. A friend of mine recommended it, and with great trepidation I got this one. When it arrived, I plugged it in, and instantly started it on my arm. To my surprise it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all! The cat came and investigated the noise, and was as interested as me. I bet she wouldn&#x27;t want to feel it, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a couple of days later, I decided to try it UNDER my arm. I expected to not be able to do it, but to my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. So I continued, and got rid of the hair under my arms, as well as the bikini-line. Yes, it isn&#x27;t completely painless, but it is not that bad. It&#x27;s more like an irritant than pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase. I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Bought as a replacement to my old one.</li>
            <li> This epilator is OK, but you need to spend a lot of time before your legs are done, passing several times on the same area. I like the fact that it can be used with or without plugging, and that it can be used abroad, because of the 110/220 V compatibility.</li>
            <li> I ended up selling this after a single use. I found it painful and very time consuming. Maybe my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough for this to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I really am not happy with this epilator.  I wanted something I could use under my arms, bikini area, and legs.  The skin under my arms and in my bikini area is way too sensitive, so that option is out for me.  If you are fair skinned, sensitive skinned, etc, think twice.  The feeling is tolerable on my legs, but the epilator is just not very efficient.  I have fine hair, and no matter how carefully and slowly I move, this just doesn&#x27;t pick up some of the hair.  I have tried every tip I can find, and nothing helps.  I think I am officially soured on the idea of epilators.</li>
            <li> My daughter has one and loves it completely - she would give it a 5 * for sure.  I haven&#x27;t found it to be THAT great.  Sometimes it does not get all the hairs but then again, in time I may grow to love it as much as my daughter.  If you have a unwanted hair issue, I would say at least try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these over the years, different generations.  I love them. This new modle is awesome.  Super fast and more powerful than the one I bought about 8 years ago.  If this one lasts 8 years as well, I will be quite happy.</li>
            <li> I just love the ease of the epilady,My legs never feel stubbley anymore ,when my other epilady had to be replaced I shaved my legs and they felt terrible the next day. I would recommend this product to all the ladies out there</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product&#x27;s ability to remove the root, therefore not leaving a shadow for my underarms.  Takes a while to do my legs with fine fuzz and hair direction and all, but with the hair softening over time, I haven&#x27;t had to remove hair as often since it doesn&#x27;t feel all stubbly.  Had an issue with the cord 11 months after purchasing, but customer service was great and is sending me a new one.  I haven&#x27;t had any other epilator to compare it to, but it seems  to do what it promises, and the customer service is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Product ever!!! It was delivered before the delivery date and I used to use an epilady, years ago, and it kind of hurt...I would never do my under arms and it took pretty long too!! This new Epilady Legend doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, I even did my under arms!!! and quick too!! I would sooo recommend this product to everyone!! If I had 3 thumbs they would all be up!!!!</li>
            <li> Saved for when my wife can use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item once before and it is still working great. However this order from the seller had defective item, it stopped working after couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I had an Epilady years ago when they first came out.  I used it off and on for years and then finally bought a Panasonic hair removal system .  It was ok but not an Epilady.  You could not find the original Epilady anywhere.  Then I went to their web site but the price was more than I could afford.  I decided to check out Amazon and found one at a great price.  I love it.  It&#x27;s much better than the old model, which I wondered about because it looked so different. It does a much smoother job than the old one or the Panasonic.  I deffinately was not disappointed.  Some folks think they hurt but it&#x27;s really not that bad once you get used to it and once you do it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I expected. A lot less messy than waxing and, after the initial cost, way cheaper in the long run!</li>
            <li> I guess is a good product fro brave girls, eventhough i read the reviews i though i can handle the pain, but I actually don´t probably I exaggerate... After i used i get all my leg red red red.... and sallow, I have to pass several times over the same place to get a good result. I stop using it</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an epilator, and I am very happy!  I used it in my face, and I have rosacea, which makes your face sensitive.  Did not hurt.  A little sting on my upper lip but I got used to it during use, sting went away.  No where near as painful as waxing your face, which HURTS.  My face has yet to break out, which it does whenever I wax.  I&#x27;ll update on a later date, but right now I&#x27;d encourage you to buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this especially to uses on my face for unwanted hair, and it does a wonderful job, I&#x27;m sure it would work great on you legs but I don&#x27;t use it for my legs.</li>
            <li> It was just ok, found out the hard way not to use under arms! I feel more instruction is needed, we real caution for under arm use, my underarm took days to heal &amp; was ver painful. From my experience, I would only use on legs. Over-all it was a disappointment for the money spent.</li>
            <li> it takes forever to get all the hair off your leg. I had a different brand that went a lot faster and ripped that hair out fast.  I can hold a cell conversation for about ten minutes and I will have gotten the hair from one leg, knee down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilady for about 25 years now, and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to shaving shaving shaving and prickly razor stubble again.  Yes, it hurts at first, but it&#x27;s bearable and well worth it.  I have very little body hair now, so even when I haven&#x27;t shaved or epiladied in a couple of weeks, my legs are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was on sale and I&#x27;ve got to say that it is great! It&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used and I was kind of nervous since I didn&#x27;t know how it was supposed to feel. I used it on my legs and it worked great. But I think it works best on the underarms. It gets rid of all the stubborn hair. I&#x27;ve used it so many times and I&#x27;ve only charged it once so far so that was even better. I really thought it would die after like 10 minutes of continuous use but it didn&#x27;t. So this is a great buy, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun epilator for 10 years before it died. The Epilady looks more intimidating the the Braun smooth, smaller design. But the Epilady does a better job. Moving it in circles definitely helps with the pain. All epilators are going to hurt. You have to build your tolerance up. If you have never used an epilator before, start with your legs, when your hair is fairly short. The more you use it the easier it will become.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because, as an older woman, my skin is rough and shaving is hazardous! This is slow going, but effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted the cordless convenience, my old cordless Braun had died.  I was not impressed at all with the hair-removing system - it took FOREVER to do even part of one leg :)&lt;br /&gt;I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this model at all</li>
            <li> It removes the unwanted hair on my legs nicely. I have been using Epilady since the very first model. When I first used it over 10 years ago, it really hurt when I removed the hair with it. So I did it just partially, one spot at a time. It became less and less painful as I tried and after a couple of months I could use it all over my legs at one time. The current model is light and rechargeable, so good for travel too. Among all the hair removal method I have tried, it is so far the easiest and most economical one.</li>
            <li> This unit replaces my original one after 15 years. It works the same. Hopefully, it last for even more years.</li>
            <li> Not happy. head is too small to cover large areas. Doesnt really pickup enough hair. I have to go over the same spot several times to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not pain-free hair removal, but it works. To be honest I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad until I did my underarms. I was even able to do some of my bikini area. The hard part is getting the angle right in some of those areas. The angle is really important. So is making sure to follow the directions: warm bath or steamy shower to open the pores, and don&#x27;t put lotion on for half an hour. The former helps the hair come out and the latter keeps you form getting pimples where the lotion goes into the open hair follicles as they are tightening back up. The first time, it took me 30 minutes to do both legs almost all the way up, both arms (I am really hairy), underarms, &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34;, and facial area. I would like a smaller-headed device for the face, but this one worked pretty well. And I stayed hair free for about 2 weeks before really noticing anything coming back in. I would give it 5 stars if it only came with a bottle of bourbon to ease the pain.</li>
            <li> Many many years ago I purchased the original epilady and did use it for some time.  This new model is completely different and is much improved.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve only used it once last week and still no stuble. There is a little pain involved but nothing compared to being waxed. I finished both legs in about 45 minutes. Took me some time bc my hair is very blonde and hard to see so it was hard to see where exactly those few stray hairs were. I cannot believe I waited so long to buy this product. No more shaving or waxing for me!</li>
            <li> I ORIGINALLY PURCHASHED AN EPILADY ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO AND THERE WAS ONLY 1 KIND AVAILABLE. THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST THING EVER INVENTED FOR HAIR REMOVAL. IT DID HURT AT FIRST, BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO USE IT BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY HATED SHAVING EVERY DAY AND OTHER HAIR REMOVAL PRODUCTS I HAD WASTED MY MONEY ON NEVER WORKED LIKE THE ADVERTISEMENTS SAID OR THEY WERE JUST TOO MESSY! THE EPILADY IS AFORDABLE AND IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do but there&#x27;s some discomfort. I&#x27;ve only tested the product on my arm as that was all I could tolerate. I used the epilady on one arm and shaved the other. The arm that I used the epilady on was much smoother since the hair was removed from the root and stayed hairless longer. With time and using the tips from the other reviewers I should be able to use this product on my legs...hopefully.</li>
            <li> Hurts like heck but haven&#x27;t shaved legs in 3 weeks. Yelped out loud a few times.  Don&#x27;t have the courage to try it on my underarms or bikini area. &#x27;Nuff said. Will continue to use on legs. I used to have to shave legs DAILY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 10 years since I attempted to try an Epilady.  I thought the original was PAINFUL to say the least.  I saw the reviews on this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I hate shaving and I have thick course hair so Nair is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this yesterday and I LOVE IT.  It&#x27;s not painful at all.  It was very easy and worked great.  It felt great.  I&#x27;m hoping that I won&#x27;t have to shave as often and can just use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well under the arms and in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS is you don&#x27;t want to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> I bought this epilady to replace my 10 year old one. The big plus for me is that it is cordless, and can be used away from an electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> Wow, amazing. After years of waxing and shaving, I will never go back! So easy to use and the results last for a month. The best!</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as expected.</li>
            <li> It works really well. And lasts a long time. I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
            <li> I had an epilady years ago, and it took about a week to do my legs!  For some reason I decided to give it a shot again, and the technology is vastly improved!  It works nearly as quickly as an electric razor, and of course lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this is a way to save money/mess from waxing, and hating the feeling left after shaving.  It takes a little practice to angle/handle the epliator correctly to remove hairs, but so far I LOVE it!  The directions say to charge for a full 12 hours out of the box, but I was able to do two rounds of epilation (legs and underarms) before charging.</li>
            <li> Worked great first few times using it.  After that it started to slow down considerably.  Still runs but has no power</li>
            <li> I had an original Epilady for years and loved it so much that when it finally died, I bought a new one right away.  Lost that second one.  Bought this one and expected it to be at least as good since years have gone by since I had the first one.  Expected updated technology.  This one is advertised as not being as painful.  Well, it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out.  You go over the same spot like 50 times and it doesn&#x27;t get it all.  I still use this one, but supplement with Nair.  Didn&#x27;t have to do that with the old one.  Sigh.  Wish I&#x27;d bought the old model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months. Its design is smart and sturdy. It&#x27;s one of those products that makes you say, &amp;#34;Someone put some thought into this!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair. Be aware that if your hair is very fine, no epilator will be able to remove all of it.</li>
            <li> It seems to work so far.  It is not what I expected, but it seems to strip the hair at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;It can be charged for several hours and then used.</li>
            <li> I like my new Epilady EP-810-33A.  My old Epilady finally stopped working after 20 years of use.  The new Epilady I just use like a regular style shaver.  The old one I had you needed to use in a circular motion. Now it&#x27;s much easier to pack in a suitcase . I like it  a lot .</li>
            <li> Package was delivered by UPS and was making a humming noise. When opened it, I found the Epilady turned on. It was turned on high. The package was sealed and not damaged so it had to be turned on before it was packaged. So don&#x27;t know what this did to the battery. It ran fine and I let it charge over night but someone made a mistake by turning it on.</li>
            <li> I was in ecstasy with this item when i first purchased.  I&#x27;d waxed for years but never used an epilator, so this was a joy--no more messiness of the waxing, easy to use all over, even in tackling bikini line and underarm.  Again, because i&#x27;ve waxed for years pain wasn&#x27;t an issue. The fact that quick touch-ups were easier with an epilator was great too. Being able to use it without having it plugged in too was great.  Then as a couple of months went by i noticed the following issues:&lt;br /&gt;--the epilator would miss smaller hairs, even some longer ones that were growing really fine (years of waxing means some of my hairs grow out really fine).  The fact that it wasn&#x27;t good with smaller hairs made it not a good option for facial hairs&lt;br /&gt;--the epilator wasn&#x27;t holding its charge as well.  From the beginning the slower speed on my epilator never seemed to work, but i didn&#x27;t mind that since fast was fine for me.  Then it started growing sluggish once it wasn&#x27;t plugged in, so I started using the plug all the time&lt;br /&gt;--it just took much longer to get rid of hairs.  It felt like it was missing more and more hairs as the weeks went on so that with each use i was going over an area several times just to get rid of as much hair as i could (not all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a couple of days ago as i sat on a sofa positioned over a rug with padding under it, it slipped from my hand as I was attempting a quick touchup on my leg before heading out.  It fell with a soft plod on the carpet and turned off.  I thought the ON button had been pushed off but no, I put it on and it will not work at all.  I&#x27;ve tried charging and the red light still goes on when it is plugged in, but nope, it refuses to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a total of about 6 months that it worked.  I will admit i was super-zealous in using it when i got it, but I followed instructions on charging etc and it did work fine initially, but eventually gave out.  So now I&#x27;ve had to find a replacement--I checked out the reviews on the Braun 7921 and the Emjoi AP-18 and finally decided on the Emjoi because after the experience w the Epilady I wanted something plug-in over something rechargable even if it meant i&#x27;d be tied to outlets for a while.  May still decide on getting the Braun for comparison.  This epilady was fun for first time epilation but i wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.on the Braun 7921 and the Emjoi AP-18 and finally decided on the Emjoi because after the experience w the Epilady I wanted something plug-in over something rechargable even if it meant i&#x27;d be tied to outlets for a while.

            <li> I am 61 and I had gotten yo the point where I was shaving those few &amp;#34;witch hairs&amp;#34; on my neck/chin every day - I use this epilator once in a while and if I feel the least bit of regrowth - I hit it with the Epilady and can forget it for days. As for &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; - it is minimal. I may use it on my legs come summer - I tried it - again - not a big deal.....</li>
            <li> This is the best hair removal system out there.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and it does the job.  It also holds a charge&lt;br /&gt;for a good amount of time.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  Yes, it does hurt for the first time but only because you have alot of hair.  Eventually, the more you use, the less hair you will have. After a month or so of use, you won&#x27;t have to epilady for two weeks.  For those of you that can&#x27;t tolerate pain, I would recommend just putting some baby powder on and make sure that you stretch the skin where you plan to shave.  This will help ease the pain and eventually you won&#x27;t have to stretch the skin anymore.  This product is great on underarms, bikini, face, and your legs!  This is better than waxing and saves you a ton of money compared to waxing!  If you want to have smooth skin and no hair, I would recommend purchasing!  You can say goodbye to shavers and waxing forever!</li>
            <li> I have the oldest version of the epilady.  The secret to using it is right after a hot shower when your pores are open.  I got used to the slight pain which is no big deal.  I stopped using it for a while until my older sister asked me if I still had it and I told her yes.  She&#x27;s extremely hairy on her legs and she mentioned the day I tried it on her ankle, hair never grew back in that area and this was over 20 years ago.  So she wanted to see if I still used it because if not she wanted it.  I never realized the epilady was the culprit to lack of hair on my legs and underarm until she mentioned it.  If I do shave it&#x27;s every 3-4 weeks during the summer, if I use the epilady - every 2 months, due to very little hair on my legs.  I think I may buy this one from Woot that is on sale for 39.99 today.</li>
            <li> For various reason I can not use a razor to shave my legs, so I used to have them waxed.  That is no longer an option, so I purchased the Epilady.  I was a little afraid to use it because a friend said she used to have one and the tweezer action was painful.  She had a much older model, obviously, because this is painless!!!  And it works!  I am very happy with the purchase...in fact this is my second one because I dropped and lost the head when I removed it for cleaning (don&#x27;t ask!) so I bought another one.  Since I hadn&#x27;t written a review for that one, I am reviewing this second one. It came in two days as promised....I will have shaved legs for Easter!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Super effective!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old epilady. I have been using them for years. I allows me to shave less often instead of everyday.</li>
            <li> Works great and does a great job.  Very happy with my purchase, even ordered a 2nd one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> great for fine hair but does nothing for hardier growth.  Would not recommend it for the tough hairs that would require tweezers</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It takes a long time to shave my legs though, but the hair dosent grow back as fast on the legs, which is a big plus lady&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by how easy and relatively painless (at least compared to waxing) this is to use.  I wish I bought it years ago.</li>
            <li> I used to own one of these. It pulled out my thick leg hairs very painfully. My legs were smooth and awesome until the hairs started growing back. Then the hairs got caught under the skin and I ended up with literally hundreds of ingrown leg hairs, red, infected, caught under the top layer of skin. Some of the hairs became so infected I ended up with boils on my legs and have some scars from the boils. When my Dr. saw over 200 infected red blotches on my legs he told me to throw this product in the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product may work for those with thin leg hairs, if you have thick leg hairs, be warned.</li>
            <li> I have used Epilady Epilator for 25 years. I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my original one was until I received the new one. Amazing! So much better than shaving or depilitories and last so much longer. A great product for women with heavy hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Epilady user since the 1980s, probably one of their first models. As far as I am concerned, this is the best way to deal with unwanted hair and overall I have been delighted with the device. However, I am not very happy with the latest model. The first one I received had to be returned because one prong stuck out a bit so it both made an annoying noise and felt rough on the skin. The replacement does not have that problem, but it is still rough on the skin: Epilady&#x27;s used to glide smoothly over the skin. That is no longer the case. Next time I need a new device, I may well try one of the other brands. How to ruin an excellent product ... pity.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the cordless feature and it works very well.  I am not sure if it will last because of the cordless feature but right now it performs perfectly.  I like not  having to get tangled in the cord as I am wont to do at times. No pain involved, but I have been using a epilator for years and there is less and less regrowth.  I will update this should any problem occur but so far it has performed as advertised.  Hence the excellent rating.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this exact model almost three years ago through a different website. This is a neat little device. Some people say it&#x27;s painful and others don&#x27;t. I think everyone has a different pain tolerance so it will not be the same for everyone. When I did my legs it felt like tiny pinpricks over and over. It was not unbearable. It&#x27;s like geting a tattoo, it hurts but not to the point of crying out and screaming. People say your tolerance builds up the more you use it, but I have not experianced this. It still feels like tiny pinpricks when I use it. Bear in mind I only use it probably twice a month. It takes a long time to get all of the hairs off of my legs. When I am done my legs are red and sometimes tiny red bumps appear but they only last a few hours. Now, I tried this several times on my underarms and let me just say that the pain was horrible! It was seriously hard to even finish the job. I evedn tried my bikini area and it was just as bad. So I only use it for my legs. The hair grows back within a week for me. I only use it to touch up between shaves. Id say its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!  I really like this Epilady.  I consider myself somewhat of a wimp when it comes to pain but I was sick of shaving/waxing my bikini area.  This worked really well, it was somewhat uncomfortable but worth it!  Use warm/wet compress for a minute prior to epilating and barely glide over the skin, making sure not to press to hard and you&#x27;ll be fine.  Great results :)</li>
            <li> After talking to a friend and discovering we both were female chin hair bearers, with several failed methods of removal, she tried the Epilady and found it extremely effective. She recommended it to me and I said, well I&#x27;ll wait a few weeks and see how effective it really is.  After 3 weeks and no hair regrowth I purchased one myself.  It&#x27;s been 4 weeks, and except for the occasional straggler, no hair regrowth.  it claims up to 6 weeks so here&#x27;s hoping but so far so good.  Would highly recommend if you find yourself shaving daily.  It does pinch a bit at first but you get used to it and it is so worth it!!</li>
            <li> A newer model but works great. Keeps my most tender area hairless (lips) private ones everyone loves them more now!</li>
            <li> Works great but not on the finer facial hair. Hurts the first time if you&#x27;re really hairy but after that it&#x27;s no big deal</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I would be hair free for at least one full week, but not the case.  Product pulls skin if you&#x27;re not careful. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> It is a great epilator. You can you it corded or cordless. This feature is handy. As for the pain level is not too much. I guess it depends on your level to tolerate pain. That is why some say that it is a torture device and other (LIKE MYSELF) are not bother ed en by the pain.</li>
            <li> mine  broke in less than two yrs.  i thought this should have lasted longer being as it is very pricey i think...................</li>
            <li> I use an older eliplator which I thought was good.  I love the epliators because when I use them my hair grows slowly and thin, so I don&#x27;t have to remove it often.  I got this one on Woot because it was rechargeable and I find it difficult to get into good light to see my hairs when I am attached to a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Epilady 4 blew my mind!  Much quieter than my old one.  And NO pain.  Usually I find the pain is only horrible when I haven&#x27;t done it in a while, but even when I keep up on it it&#x27;s still pain, just mild pain.  This one I didn&#x27;t even feel.  At first I kept checking to make sure it was plucking and not shaving LOL!  It was also faster than  my old one.  And also my legs were not as flaky after using it as with my old one.  Get it!  I can&#x27;t believe people still shave when this is available!</li>
            <li> I admit, it was a little painful the first time, but it sure does the job!  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.  It hurts, but it works!</li>
            <li> I have owned many Epiladys.  I&#x27;m very impressed with how well the battery in this one holds it&#x27;s charge.  My last one I had for 7 years and it would hardly hold the charge.  But this one is great!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Epilady, and I hope to never be without one.</li>
            <li> Great price, works well, I was so happy that when my old razor stopped working, I would buy it again years later. Recommend</li>
            <li> This product could not be charged. The unit would only keep a charge for roughly 20 seconds. I returned the item.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this epilator. It is my first and after reading other reviews, I was a little nervous about the pain. Then, I thought surely I was psyching myself out about it.. No, it hurts. It definitely takes some getting used to but it is also definitely worth it!! I love my results!! I initially charged it for a few hours, as directed, and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since. I have been pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this product!! (:</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts. If you can handle waxing, you can handle the pain from this. I like you have control over the pain opposed to waxing. Saves money on the waxing and buying razors. Love this!!</li>
            <li> I have been a user of the Epilady product for many years.  Went through two older versions and this is faster and smaller.  Love the option of using the electricity or battery.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> If you ever waxed it&#x27;s time to graduate to this great epilator. Does it hurt? well,... yeah but it doesn&#x27;t have to. I recommend waxing first and then using Epilady to maintain it.  Don&#x27;t wait for all your hair to start growing out, but rather start early and keep using it every couple of days to maintain it. I promise it makes it so much better and practically pain free. I use this device on my legs, arms, arm pits and even bikini. It&#x27;s quick, easy and cost as much as your one waxing appointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair remover --- I use it on my face. Once in a while it catches on a hair and there&#x27;s a little tug, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I have used an Epilady for years. My old one just faded away. There is quite a difference between the old one and this one. I got used to the old one as painful as it could be at times. This one is more gentle, but it works very well. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; like the older one did. I used it on my underarms and it was gentle to use. It didn&#x27;t pull or leave any red marks or irritated areas. So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance. I also guess I forgot it was cordless, which is a plus. I had been using another brand for 15 years until it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This works well.  I have found that it really doesn&#x27;t last a whole month though. I doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the one I used twenty years ago.</li>
            <li> Only hurts the first time around.  After that, you are good to go.  I actually like this much more than waxing.  It&#x27;s so much cleaner!  I&#x27;m very pale and the skin on  my arms did not get red at all, and were baby smooth after using the epilady.  I like the faster speed setting and moving it more slowly on my arm.  I feel like it plucks faster, hurts less, and removes more hair in one swipe if you more slower.</li>
            <li> It is great!!! I loved it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair neariy as good as other Epilady I had and sometimes pinches the skin.  I wish I had ordered the original Epilady like I had before.</li>
            <li> Works okay. Had received a dud the first time. They tried replacing the cord. Didn&#x27;t work. Then they replaced the unit itself. Good customer service.</li>
            <li> Worse ever, I have had on before different brand and this one is bad.</li>
            <li> Previously owned a Braun but wnated a cordless. Find it to not be as consistent and take a lot longer</li>
            <li> My mom had one of the originals back in the 80s and loved hers.  So, I thought I&#x27;d give one a try. Having waxed, shaved, and everything in between, I figured why not?  I am so unbelievably happy with my new epilady!  It arrived yesterday and I&#x27;ve already used it on both legs, underarms, and the rest of both arms.  It hurts some, but is so worth it.  My skin has never felt so smooth.  Looks like Mom was right!!!</li>
            <li> Product works great for me.Very smooth to the touch and view with my dark coarse hair. I had to watch online videos to really get the hang of using it. I still can&#x27;t quite do the more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas. I think it is more my anxiety than pain or product difficulties. I&#x27;m gradually working that in. For arms and legs it is doing everything I wanted. No more expensive razors--yay. Pain is subjective--I have no pain on arms and legs. My first time it wasn&#x27;t painful but the areas I cleared felt tingly like a scratch after that initial pass over. After first time, I never felt that again.</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time you use it (especially in the bikini area) it hurts. But the Epilady has completely changed my relationship to body hair. Like, ALL body hair below the eyelashes, if you know what I mean. It takes a little practice: you really do have to aim the device exactly opposite to the direction of hair growth, and this can mean several passes in various directions on your more complicated body areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took quite a number of uses before I noticed regrowth really slowing down, but with each session the &amp;#34;plucking&amp;#34; sensation has decreased as regrowth has slowed and the hairs that do regrow are finer. I haven&#x27;t used a razor in months. It&#x27;s very liberating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good--a recharge gives two or three hours of use (which translates in real life to weeks). My only quibble--and it&#x27;s a small one--is that nothing indicates when recharging is complete, so I try to plug the Epilady in at bedtime and unplug it promptly first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I plan on returning this terrible product. It hurts terrible. I read reviews and thought it would work for me but it is way too painful. While trying to use it next to my ear, a strand of hair caught in it and it shattered. My hair was tied back but a single strand got caught. I was going to send it back after using it once. I tried calling the Epilady company and according to their instructions I need to call for a return request form. They were closed. Very dissatisfied with this product. Shall I pursue my action to call them even though I bought it from you? I would appreciate your input to this matter. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this is my second one.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hurts a little but so worth it. The hair stays away longer for sure. I use it all the time. Phyl p</li>
            <li> Works great, no complains!!</li>
            <li> I was new to epilators but hated shaving and was tired of the expense of waxing.  Though not completely pain-free, after reading about various products, I&#x27;d say epilady is as close to painless as possible.  You really do get used to it after the first couple of uses. I love how long I can go between shaving my underarms and legs.  Not quite as successful in the bikini area;</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and to be honest I feared the pain.  To my fortune, it&#x27;s not any worse than getting waxed.  It&#x27;s actually been kinda addictive.  The thing is I&#x27;ve had to use it about every two days for like two weeks in order to get all those hairs that weren&#x27;t grown out the first time around.  It leaves skin very soft and really helps with in growns.  The negatives are 1) its kinda loud and 2) the hairs really attach to it, making it hard to leave it extra clean. I found it best to use right after the shower. I&#x27;ve used it on legs, arms and underarms.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but I am so impressed with this little device that I had to give it props.  I did a LOT of research on waxing and epilating before making a purchase, and ended up with the Epilady due to it&#x27;s positive reviews.  I was very nervous about trying it - after all it does rip your hair out by the roots... but I figured I&#x27;d just try my best to take it like a champ because I really wanted the results that it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it on my legs it was surprisingly less painful than I expected.  It felt like sharp little pricks - not terrible by any means, and I was able to completely do both legs with no problem at all.  My arm pits were more sensitive and I did stop and &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; a few times while doing them.  The first time is the hardest for sure... not only is your hair not used to being plucked out, but you HAVE a lot more hair than after you&#x27;ve been doing it a while.  After my first complete epilation, I went back every few days and got any new growth.  They say you can wait three weeks or so between sessions, but I really love a smooth feel so I do it routinely every other day or so.  It really will pluck even short short hairs that have barely surfaced, so when you are finished you have soft smooth skin.  The only thing I can find less than perfect with the Epilady is that it&#x27;s difficult to epilate the fine baby hairs on my upper thighs.  It does great with more course hair, but I have to go back over fine body hair quite a bit to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase Dr. Numb cream to apply before using this on my bikini area, and I am glad for that.  It was painful the first time, but not unbearable.  The Dr. Numbs helped a lot!  After that first time, I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  I barely feel the prick when I use it now, even in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My daughter and I both use it.  It can be ticklish at first to get used to using. Stretching the skin as you use it definitely helps ease any discomfort, as well as making sure your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best Epilator that I have had so far.  By no means is it painless like some people say but it does a pretty decent job in a small amount of time.</li>
            <li> Waited too long to return it; but it was not very satisfactory. I had to go over and over the same area on my legs to get all the hair. And, the most frustrating thing for me was that it caused more ingrown hair than my razor does. It did pretty well on my face;  even though the head is a little large for use on the face.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I used my daughters Epilady recently.  It work so well I bought one for me</li>
            <li> Had read a lot of the reviews before deciding to order this.  Have been extremely pleased with it and wished I had gotten one sooner.  As others said initially you feel a slight prick when removing the hair but after that no issues.</li>
            <li> In researching which one to buy, I realized I bought the very first one ever, 25 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using an epilator since they first came out. I didn&#x27;t realize however that the one I replaced wasn&#x27;t an Epilady, it was a competitor. In those 25 years, this is only my 3rd one and I still have the 1st one and it works. I bought the 2nd competitor one because I was on vacation and forgot to bring my original. The newer version had more heads so I left the old one at summer home. Recently I dropped the competitors and the plastic broke. What I love about this new one is cordless. What I love about Epilators is how much money I have saved over razors and waxing during 25 years.</li>
            <li> Love it! Better than the one I had (for about 16 years!!)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Love it!  I&#x27;ve been using Epilady for over 20 years and needed a new one.  This does not dissappoint.</li>
            <li> SHABBY EXPERIENCE. I AM SO DISAPPOIONTED IN THE EPILADY GENERATIONS. I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM,,AT SEPERATE TIMES, SPENDING OVER A HUNDRED BUCKS EACH TIME.  EACH ONE, ALL THREE OF THEM,, A FEW MONTHS AFTER  RECEIVING, STARTED  RATTLING ,  GRINDING  , AND NOT CUTTING WELL AT ALL.  ITS AS IF THE  TWEEZEERS R AND WERE  GRINDING AGAINNST  THE WALLS OR SIDES OR EACH OTHER  AND CAN NOT BE USED. I CONTACTED THE COMPANY ON EACH ONE OF THEM, WITHIN  SIX MONTHS OF HAVING EACH ONE, &#x27;&#x27;3&#x27;&#x27; OF THEM AND  THEY SHUNNED ME  AND SAID  I WOULD HAVE TO RETURN IT TO THEIR COMPANY FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT AND PAY THEM TO REPAIR IT AND IF I DIDNT WANT TO DO THAT, OH WELL I AM STUCK  WITH OVER 500 BUXS OUT OF  POCKET AND  3 BROKEN EPILATORS. I AM APPAULED AT A COMPANY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT COMPANY AND SUPPOSED TO MAKE A GREAT PRODUCT. I&#x27;M DONE WITH THEM NOW. I AM NOW, YET AGAIN SHOPPING FOR ANOTHER FULL SIZED RECHARGABLE ONE AND IT WILL NOTTTTTTTTTTTTTT BE AN EPILADY.  EVEN  IF THE OTHER BRANDS  DO HURT TO  USE,  I DONT KNOW FOR A FACT, ONLY HAD EPILADY, THEN IT WILL HURT LESSSSSSSSSSSSS FOR ME IN MY WALLET TO USE  ANOTHER BRAND. I  DO TELL PEOPLE I KNOW , NOT TO GET THEIR BRAND.  CUSTOMER  SATISFACTION MEANS NOTHING UNDOUBTEDLY, TO THIS COMPANY.  AND  FOR ALL 3  OF EACH ONE TO DO THIS, SAME BRAND AND MOD NUMBER, THEN THERE MUST BE A FLAW SOMEWHERES IN THE  PRODUCTION OF THE PATHETIC USELESS MONEY WAISTING  PRODUCT. YET THEY DONT CARE. HELL, U ALREADY SPENT UR MONEY ON IT, THEY JUST WANT MORE TO FIX IT  NOW...  AND I TAKE EXTREMELY GOOD CARE OF MY  POSSESIONS AND  LIVE ALONE  AND DID NOT USE THE DAMN THINGS BUT ABOUT  5 TIMES  EACH MAYBE 6 TIMES EACH.  PROOF IS IN THE  THE CUSTOMERS EYES WHEN THEY GET THREE DIFF ONES OF SAME MODEL AND SAME PROBLEM. SHAME ON U EPILADY. I&#x27;M  DONE SPENDING MONEY ON YOUR PRODUCCT . NO MORE WAISTING MY MONEY FOR A  COMPANY WHOM DOES NOT CARE AND MAKES A CRAPY PRODUCT..........  WORD OF MOUTH IS EVERYTHING TO A BUSINESS, ESP. SINCE WAT I TELL IS THE HONEST TO GODS TRUTH.</li>
            <li> Works great on my legs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful to use, but I knew it would be.  Especially in the upper lip area.  It works well and I like the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable and you can use it either corded or cordless, so that&#x27;s convenient.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs yet.  Not sure I will.  The product fits in my hand well too.</li>
            <li> I also have a Tweeze that I love and can&#x27;t find anymore so I got this. It is wider than the Tweeze, but I can still use it on my face. I love the 2 speeds. I use it on my legs too. I love that it can be recharged as the Tweeze cannot and uses up batteries pretty quick. This holds a charge a long time too.</li>
            <li> This thing works like a charm! It&#x27;s quick and easy. I don&#x27;t find it painful and instead love the feeling &#x3D;)  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Since genetics have blessed me to be rather fuzzy, I have tried everything in order to manage it. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. However having unwanted body hair and having sensitive skin is a really bad combo no matter what you do. Each method has its own drawbacks and most of which I found unacceptable. Then I found the Epilady! It can literally be used everywhere and it manages to take out 95% of the side effects I&#x27;ve endured with other hair removal products. The hair that is removed takes a few weeks to start growing back and is generally much finer and thinner. And best thing about it is my skin is softer after each use with no tearing or irritation. That being said, there are a couple of cons. First, it does sting during use because it is ripping out the hair by the root. It feels a lot like the sting of a rubber band snapped on the skin. However, after the first few moments of use, I tend not to feel the sting so much. And lastly, the skin tends to be red after each use, it usually fades in a few hours so it&#x27;s best to do this at night. Overall, I am in love with this product and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There is no gentle way to RIP hairs out of your skin. it works, and it is much more effective then shaving, but it hurts like a mother....</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for more then 15 years. My last one was Braun. It still works but after a couple of years of regular use it needs to be replaced. Although it continues to pull the hair (which is painful) it became less effective at removing it. Therefore I decided to buy a new one, hoping for some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epilady had really good reviews, so I got it. To my surprise, it is NOT more effective than my barely working Braun. By that I mean that it takes longer time/more times to go over a given area in order to remove all the hair compared to my Braun (keep in mind that for maximum efficiency I remove completely the plastic cover that limits the contact with the skin and do not have problems with the curve as some other reviewers have pointed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for some reason the Epilady is also way less painful than the Braun ever was. Not sure why there is a such a dramatic difference since the basic mechanism of action seems the same. Moreover, the Braun has 3 speeds and a special \\&quot;crown\\&quot; with something made to massage the skin in order to reduce the pain, while pulling the hair. The Epilady is significantly less painful than any epilator I have ever used, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wireless option is a bonus. I never thought the wire was a problem for me but I appreciated the wireless option as soon as I started using it. Unfortunately, charging it is a pain in the neck - according to the instructions, you have to drain the battery completely and then charge it exactly for 8 hours each time, and there is nothing to indicate when it is done. Leaving it longer would overcharge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;1. This is the least painful epilator that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not very efficient but it is not too bad neither.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wireless is nice even if you do not necessarily need it, but charging it is a pain and may not last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I would like to share a tip: if you are a first time user, chances are that you will experience a lot of pain during the first few times. One way to deal with it is to take an iboprophin before using the epilator. In addition, use the epilator after shower or in a warm steamy room if possible so that your pores open, allowing the hair to come out easier. Be patient - resist shaving for a while and soon you will notice that the pain has decreased significantly. The Epicady seems like a good choice for first time users.ou are a first time user, chances are that you will experience a lot of pain during the first few times.

            <li> I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE HAS EXPERIENCED BLISTERS AFTER EPILATION WITH THE EPILADY LEGEND.  I USED THE EILADY LEGEND FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WAS PLEASED WITH HOW EASY AND COMFORTABLE THE EPILADY WAS TO HANDLE.  HOWEVER, I WOULD  HAVE TO EPILATE AN AREA FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE FOREVER TO GET THE EPILADY TO REMOVE THE HAIRS.  ALSO, THE SECOND TIME I USED THE EPILADY AND TRAVELED THE NEXT DAY, I THOUGHT I HAD CONTRACTED BED BUGS FROM THE HOTEL.  I WAS SO EMBARRASSED, I CALLED HOUSEKEEPING AT THE HOTEL AND THEY RAN TO MY RESCUE ONLY TO INFORM ME THAT THE PUSTULES I HAD ALL OVER MY LEGS WERE NOT THAT OF BED BUGS.  THEY THOUGHT I HAD AN ALLERGY TO SOMETHING I HAD EATEN.  AFTER THE THIRD USE, I NOTICED THE SAME TYPE OF PUSTULES IN EVERY AREA I HAD EPILATED--UNDER MY ARMS, ALL OVER MY LEGS AND IN MY BIKINI AREA.  HAS ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE EXPERIENCED THIS?  I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO USE MY EPILADY; THOUGH IT IS NOT FAST, IT IS NOT AS MESSY AS WAXING WHICH I&#x27;VE DONE FOR YEARS.  I&#x27;M THINKING PERHAPS MY BODY HAS TO ADJUST TO THE EPILADY FROM ALL THE YEARS OF WAXING.  I WISH MY EPILADY WOULD GRAB THE HAIR EASIER AND FASTER THAN HAVING TO GO OVER AN AREA FOREVER, NO MATTER WHAT LENGTH THE HAIR APPEARS TO BE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERHAPS THE EPILADY WORKS BEST ON A PARTICULAR TYPE OF HAIR...</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty uncomfortable but it works.</li>
            <li> First time to use an epilator. Maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is kind of dry but when I use it against my skin, my dry skin gets kind of irritated. but applying lotion calms it down and all is good.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of have to push down when using it to get full effect. But satisfying so far</li>
            <li> I searched a while before deciding on this one. The biggest reasons I chose it where, price and other ratings. It seemed like it would do a decent job for a decent price. While it did hurt quite a bit more than I had hoped, I don&#x27;t know how a device like is could really NOT hurt. It is after all, pulling out hairs! After getting through the initial pain from the first &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; over my legs, it does hurt much less! Almost no pain at all since there is very little hairs left. As long as I do it real quick every two days or so, I stay pretty hair free. For me since my leg hairs are very dark and thick and start growing back in like 3 hours of shaving, the Epilady is SO worth it! And my new best friend! Lol&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I got it. I&#x27;ve never tried another brand/type, so I don&#x27;t know how it really compares to others, but like I said, for me, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be a coil but its a whole bunch of sharp little tweezers that grab at you and hurt like the merry old devil.  I am going to try to return it because after one use I know it will never come out of the box again.</li>
            <li> Actually, compared to some older models of epilators I have tried, this is a near miracle. :-)  I wanted an epilator to use on my face, underarms, and legs.  I know this is a tall order, but this does work in all those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face, I will say that because the head is larger and there is a buffer on each side of the head, you can&#x27;t get very close to your ears, but with one pass it gets a lot of the tiny little fine hairs and in a few minutes (probably less than five) my chin, upper lip and cheeks were smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair on my legs and underarms and it hurts to yank them out.  I will not lie.  However, it did not hurt as much as others I have tried.  Maybe because the head rotates faster?  But, it also is more productive than the older ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I used to go over and over an area with an older epilator and it hardly looked like I made progress after a lot of time spent doing it.  I used it on my underarms and legs for a total of fifteen minutes for about three days and I was hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how long it will take for the hair to grow back, but I am encouraged by how easy and quick this was to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Epilady hair removers since the 80&#x27;s.  Finally, after over 10 years, my older model just needed a rest.....it slowed down even when plugged in.  The Epilady Legend 4th Generation is a great replacement.  I like the idea of rechargeable batteries.  Saves me money.  My only comment (not negative) is that the  PAG (Perfect Angle Guide) attachment seems to just cut the hair and not pull it out by the root so skip that recommendation that comes with the product.  This model is worth the investment and I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is a bit tougher than the average girl. NO, it does NOT remove more than 60% on my face. Other parts, like legs and arms, you have to go over again and again. Not my kind of hair removal. I would just like to add, my younger cousin told me about it ( She LOVES it), but she has very thin blond hair.</li>
            <li> I am a real user of this product and this is a legitimate review.  Some of these reviews seem to be professional writers that are maybe hired to leave reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using this Epilady for over 3 weeks now.  It&#x27;s my first time using an Epilady.  I have used this on my face, my arms, my arm pits, my legs and my bikini area.  I think this product works better in some areas over others and that&#x27;s why I rated it 3 stars.  I&#x27;ll start with the face.  I usually bleach the hair on my face but started to worry that that was leaving a mustache stain so I thought I&#x27;d try an Epilady.  I think it works the worst on the face because the hairs on the face or the finest and hardest for those little tweezers to grab.  But it does work, it just takes a little time to remove the hair and you will likely still have to do some light plucking with tweezers for those hairs that this just won&#x27;t remove.  You have to be careful on the face though because you will want to press down to get those hard to get hairs but you can not press down with this but only run it very lightly over your face.  If you press down it will remove a light layer of your skin and you will be left with red patches that will take a few days to heal and go away.  I had some red patches where this removed a thin layer of my skin that was embarrassing for a few days.  The pain level is not that bad on the face again because the facial hairs are so fine.  Over all I am more satisfied with the Epilady over bleaching my face so I will continue to use the Epilady on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The armpits are by far the most difficult to do with this product.  It&#x27;s an awkward place and you can&#x27;t pull the skin tight which you need to do and it&#x27;s difficult to move the Epilady in small circles.  One of the cons for this Epilady is you can&#x27;t use it like a regular razor.  You don&#x27;t just swipe up and the hair is removed.  You have to do little circles and many little circles in the same area before it removes the hair.  For the arm pit and the face I usually have to do it every day for a few days before I can remove all the hair.  It did leave a little bit of a bumpy rash under my arms and it&#x27;s not smooth and silk under the arms like it is on the face.  The pain level is not too bad under the arms.  A little worst than the face but not the most painful spot on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arms were easier then the face and arm pits because it&#x27;s just a smooth straight surface so it does better on the arms.  It is a little more painful then the face because the hair is thicker.  It does very well on the arms and is easier to use on the arms except in areas you can&#x27;t see like the back of the upper arms.  You have to be able to see what you are doing to see if you&#x27;ve removed all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the legs this product probably works the best on because the hair is thickest on the legs.  It works best and is easiest on the legs but it&#x27;s also the most painful on the legs - because the hair is thick on the legs.  It is the MOST painful around the knees.  It was so painful around the knees it gives me a pit of a stomach ache when I do that area.  It does remove the hair very well on the legs if you can just power through the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini area - yikes - I didn&#x27;t have the nerve to use this the first go around on the bikini area plus I was worn out after doing the face, arm pits, arms and legs.  The pain is not nearly has bad as I expected for the bikini area and it does work well on the bikini area but proceed with caution.  It&#x27;s easy to grab hairs you don&#x27;t want to remove so you have to be very careful.  You must pull the skin tight here because this Epilady can pinch that area and cut and remove chunks of skin.  The second time I did my bikini area it pinched me and removed a small chunk of skin.  That was it for me and I couldn&#x27;t go on anymore after that - in that area.  It really freaked me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this your skin is silky smooth but after the first time you won&#x27;t really have silky smooth skin anymore because the hair begins to grow back at different rates in different areas so while you may be able to remove all the hair that is long enough to remove there will be some just below the surface that will poke out the next day and those you wouldn&#x27;t get.  The biggest con is you need to do this at least once a week if not more depending on how picky you are about removing every last hair.  Going 4 to 6 weeks between using this doesn&#x27;t seem at all realistic to me.  I have to do this once a week every where.  However all the hairs don&#x27;t come back at the same time like it would with a razor but enough hair grows back in by the end of the week that it&#x27;s noticeable and needs to be removed.  It took me about 3 hours the first time I did this to remove all the hair and that was the most painful because there was so much hair to remove.  The second time it was less painful because there was less hair to remove because all the hair doesn&#x27;t come back in at once.  It took me about 2 hours to remove all the hair the second time around.  The third time I was getting used to the pain but it&#x27;s still painful.  It took me 1 hour and 45 minutes to remove all the hair the 3rd time around.  I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to use this for all areas on my body.  It&#x27;s time consuming and it gets hard to bring myself to deal with the time and the pain involved.  I think I will definitely continue to use this on my face rather than bleaching my face.  I will probably also continue to use this on my arms because that hair grows back in so fast with a razor.  I don&#x27;t know if I will continue using this on my arm pits, legs and bikini area though.  Since this hair comes back in within a week I don&#x27;t know that the pain and the time involved is worth it to continue using it in those areas.  It&#x27;s faster to just shave and a lot less painful.  I will use this all over for longer because my hope is if I continue to use this that the hair will stop growing in but I suspect if I were to stop using this all together all the hair would eventually come back in.  :-(  If you&#x27;re thinking about this I think it&#x27;s worth a try - given the fact that the price is reasonable - and see how it works for you.  It&#x27;s one of those products that some people may end up loving while others will hate.  You just won&#x27;t know until you give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.me you won&#x27;t really have silky smooth skin anymore because the hair begins to grow back at different rates in different areas so while you may be able to remove all the hair that is long enough to remove there will be some just below the surface that will poke out the next day and those you wouldn&#x27;t get.

            <li> Nope. Nope, nope, nope. The reviews lied! They ALL said this twirling satan device doesn&#x27;t hurt. LIES, I tell you, lies!! I can&#x27;t even use the thing because of the hurt!! The only reason I bought this (my mind said no, I should have listened) stupid thing is because the reviews said it didn&#x27;t hurt!! Take waxing... the awful, awful pain of waxing. Now multiply it by 8 and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve got when you try to use this horrible thing!! I&#x27;m going to guess the other reviews were bought. I&#x27;m seriously disappointed that I spent money on this...thing. Do not buy this!!</li>
            <li> The description of the product states exactly what you are going to received. It is an effective product with high quality.</li>
            <li> It works okay, hurts a lot.  I expect that because it pulls your hair out by the root, so it makes sense, it should hurt.  I had to go over an area like 5 times for it to feel like it might have worked properly.  After trying it several times, I went back to my razor.</li>
            <li> I love my Epilady, have used them for many years.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and it seems to break it off and leave stubble for about 50% of my leg areas--bummer.  I&#x27;ve used it three times, and I&#x27;m hoping that with enough effort, I will eventually get it all as the stubble grows out.  The device is not very loud and painful at first.  I am stubborn about returning to shaving after investing in this thing.  Worked great on my underarms.  Haven&#x27;t used it anywhere else. I am having trouble finding any advice addressing my problem, and I&#x27;m not seeing reviews mentioning stubble, either.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong...</li>
            <li> I have been using this Epilady to remove the hair on my legs every 1-2 weeks for the past 2 months.  This is my first experience with any type of hair removal other than shaving and the first 3 times using the Epilady HURT.  I have many large tattoos, so I don&#x27;t consider myself a pansy and I have no shame saying - it hurt.  After that, it faded into discomfort and now it is only slightly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it a poor rating is because it tweezes about half the hair on my legs and breaks the other half.  I end up with stubbly legs that remind me of legs that haven&#x27;t been shaved for a day or two.  I have fine hair and I&#x27;m wondering if that is the problem.  I contacted the company to see if they had any advice, but didn&#x27;t get a reply.  I have followed all the tips in their manual and on their website.  I keep using it because I hope that eventually the hairs that are getting tweezed will stop growing back. It&#x27;s not a total loss, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair (assuming that is indeed the problem for me).</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was nervous to do this again. I tried in the 80&#x27;s when they 1st came out and &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;, now not so bad.  Glad I made the purchase, so sick of red bumps. Now I won&#x27;t have them anymore! YAY!</li>
            <li> I have used an Epilady for at least 30 years and I can&#x27;t go without one.  When my first one broke, I was devastated...I searched online for another one. It&#x27;s amazing!!!  Thank God for Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> The best purchase I have ever made. Four of us on my household love it, After 6 months of use we have much thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned several epilady shavers. This model is all right but does not work as well as my Epilady Discrette Plus 810 which I still use but am afraid it is going. I would like them to bring back the Epilady Discrette Plus 810 that workes with batteries and a cord.</li>
            <li> I am still using this epilator, but am very disappointed with it so far. You have to move it over the area many, many times. It only removes a few hairs at a time. And you can only do a little bit at a time because it causes ingrown hairs and red bumps. Your skin has to slowly adjust to it. I also have to shave the regular way and use something to exfoliate the skin to help with the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Epilady - the first one lasted 5 years, the second one lasted 10 years, so although the cost may seem high, this product costs less than $8 per year - what other method can beat that? When I first started using an Epilady it was a bit painful, but now the hairs are so fine I barely feel anything. If you have been waxing, then this product is a perfect alternate and not as messy.</li>
            <li> Does its job and a good price. You do have to get the right angle with this one though. I am a veteran w epilator so in terms of pain, very low, very tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep skin very taut in order to not have it get rolled up in epilator (ESP. underarms)</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve had this a year and decided it was time to write a review. This my first epilator. It is very easy to use and came with a guide attachment to teach you the proper angle to hold it against your skin to pull the hair out. I decided to start using this because I hate the feel of stubble. HATE. It&#x27;s a sensory overload thing, I think. I am NOT the type of woman who views winter time as an opportunity to stop shaving. In fact, winter is worse because pants + stubble make me shudder just thinking about it. Anyway, that&#x27;s why I love this little machine, it pulls the hair out down to the root which makes it slower to grow back to where I can feel it. What does grow back is finer and harder to see/feel. I don&#x27;t feel like less hair is growing back, but maybe I&#x27;m just not remembering what it was like at first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here are my tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take ibuprofen the first few times you use this. After the first week, I didn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good loofah and some lotion with alpha hydroxy. This cuts down on the ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs with this thing are a no brainer, but I highly recommend it for arm pits too. It does not snag skin at all, and zero underarm stubble is a wonderful, wonderful thing. I was only brave enough to use this on my bikini line once, but maybe others are tougher than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer time, I use the epilady before the shower, and shave in the shower too. I&#x27;m bad about missing hairs...or entire sides of my legs, so this was needed for shorts. Even though it added a little time, my legs were SO SMOOTH, and the epilady reduced the wee dark spots of hair root that shaving leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine still holds a charge even after a year, but usually only enough for one use.</li>
            <li> I have an old epilady from about 15 years ago, and it works so much better, I hope it keeps working until I can find something that works as well.  with the newer version, seems I have to keep going over the same area of the leg, before it grabs all the hair, even after using it for a month or more. it just isn&#x27;t the same as the old unit that I have, it&#x27;s noisy now but as long as it works, I&#x27;ll continue using it, instead of the new one..</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. I cant speak for her but she owned one of these years ago and lost it.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner and works very well.</li>
            <li> works great, painless and saves a lot of money on waxing&lt;br /&gt;this is the best epilator I have tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly reccomended</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and my niece. We love the Epilady! This product works well. Be sure to order the Epilation cream too!!</li>
            <li> Good............. ....... . . .&lt;br /&gt; .  L l . L l . ,  ,b m, b bob b b b.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, yes it hurts the first time you use it, but the pain greatly decreases the more you use it.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these for wife and daughter not as great as advertised , proof is that both still using other after giving a long trial with this product if u like unwelcome PSIN then this is for u</li>
            <li> Best solution to management of hair issues</li>
            <li> I have been buying Epiladys for over 20 years and love them.</li>
            <li> I had an old one and thought a new model might do a better job but no difference.  This one does not come with a light which actually helps in certain settings. It is nice that it is cordless though</li>
            <li> I had been faithful to another brand of epilator for about 10 years. After two models (with updates to the heads), I decided to try the Epilady. I have no regrets. I thought I was inured to the irritation of epilating, but this model makes it virtually painless. I hardly believed it had removed the hairs until I saw the remains. Very thorough. Super smooth results.</li>
            <li> This product is great for coarse hairs on the legs. It rips the hair out so if you aren&#x27;t ready for that, move along! It hurts but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks and it actually works.  It is not as painful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to waxing. Professional waxing is too expensive and home waxing is too painful. I&#x27;m still getting used to the epilator but so far I like it. Definitely works better right after a shower when pores are open. It&#x27;s not a quick fix though. It&#x27;s takes several passes to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> We replaced a much older epilator with this one and wife seems to like it a lot. Easy for her to work with and faster than the earlier epilator as well.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a guy and I can&#x27;t stand hair.. my opinions about why aside, this DID remove hair.. sadly most of the hair it removes is just broken rather then pulled out. I gave it a fair shake though, I tried it over the course of a month just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t me being a guy and doing it wrong. I looked countless youtube videos and read reviews and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I may just have the fastest growing hair in the world, but leg hair removed by the root shouldn&#x27;t be visible in 2 days I think.. and a good 50% of the hair growing back is ingrown and just under the surface of the skin, making it so I have to dig it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to get one, don&#x27;t go cheap. Go with Braun and make sure you research (this is probably me just being a guy) exfoliating, moisturizing and all that happiness to prevent ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: The first time using this HURT. I can take some serious pain but this was nearly unbearable. So if you are planning to do this, make sure you know what you are getting into.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, my hair seems to come back as though I&#x27;m using a shaver. That scares me because I don&#x27;t want a five o&#x27;clock shadow!&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see as time goes by.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother-in-law and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last one lasted several years and luckily amazon keeps track of prior purchases so I didn&#x27;t have to search!</li>
            <li> No. It plucks hairs, it takes forever over 1 hour for below the knee and I still needed to shave. It hurts. And it just doesn&#x27;t work. Tried it a few times. And my sister in law did as well. Nope it&#x27;s a dude.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but none of them every work correctly. While Epilady is a bit more expensive, it works so much better that the price difference is not important.,</li>
            <li> I personally have used an Epilady now for over 20 years and haven&#x27;t shaved my legs since! Mostly I use below Knees. When first using, concentrate on small areas at a time. In the beginning it can sting, but not hurt. Initial use for both legs can take several days, working small sections at a time. Once both legs done, u will want to touch up ever few days in the beginning. I am a brunette so was tired of shaving and having dark stubble on my legs, which didnt eel soft except right after I shaved. After awhile when using regularly, your legs will always look and feel smooth, even if there are missd hairs. I would NEVER consider shaving my legs again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was shipped and delivered quickly and had no issues with seller, in fact it was cheaper than going to the Epilady website. High recommend, but remember it takes a little patience in the beginning. After many uses, I no longer even felt any stinging. Love using in car when my husband and I are on a driving vacation.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I meant to order the Epilady Value Pack. So I did return this one but am very pleased with the Epilady product.</li>
            <li> NEVER SHAVING AGAIN!  Holy cow...how did I go years and years of my life without this thing??  I&#x27;ve been telling all of my girlfriends about this and recommending that they all get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FIRST time you use it, THERE WILL BE PAIN.  The initial hair removal is difficult since it&#x27;s basically just like tweezing.  Tweezing hurts.  So this is tweezing on speed.  I&#x27;ve heard that if you get a waxing before using this, you can cut way down on the pain...so I&#x27;d advise doing that!  For me, I started with my legs.  The first time I used it, I only got about 1/8th of my leg done and then needed a break.  Took me about 3 sessions to get all the way through.  But now?  Now it&#x27;s enjoyable.  The maintenance is SOO easy.  The hairs come back in at all different times, unlike shaving where they all come in evenly at once.  I almost enjoy maintenance now because it&#x27;s totally painfree and so easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini.  Took me about 20 sessions.  The edges were pretty easy. I&#x27;d been waxed before so I was prepared for the pain.  But down the center?  Unbearable.  I could only do a few seconds at a time in some areas so it took me a LONG time to get all the hair off initially and my bikini area looked weird with patches of hair for a long time.  But now?  Still some pain but when only a few hairs come in at a time...VERY easy to maintain.  So the initial removal was way worse than waxing because it takes so much longer.  But the upkeep is WAY easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms took me about 4 sessions.  I&#x27;d never plucked or waxed this area before so I experienced a lot of pain here.  But now I have such smooth underarms that look way better than they ever have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE INITIAL PAIN IS WORTH IT!!!!  I use this device maybe once a week for ~15 minutes for maintenance.  I have pale skin and medium brown hair...but you can never see any of it as it comes back in!  It&#x27;s amazing to have mostly smooth legs all the time and never have to worry about hair growth.  The charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a HUGE money and time saver folks.  Stick it out...after a few weeks you&#x27;ll NEVER have to buy razors or shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> Item delivered quickly &amp; was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave about this enough.&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love my epilady and will never shave my legs again or wax or thread my face!! If you are hairy, you probably know how much of a pain all that can be!&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, the first time is a little uncomfortable but the more you use it, the less uncomfortable it is and the faster the removal. The hair literally becomes more sparse and thin and is less and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tattoo or piercings, you can tolerate this product, no question. And if your pain threshold is less, you can use this too, you just have to get used to it. Once you start using it, you wont&#x27; regret it.&lt;br /&gt;I have probably saved about $100 in razor blades in just 6 or so months from having the epilady. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> After a lot of sifting through numerous models this is a great replacement for an older model that died. Holds a good long charge on the batteries.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for over 15 years, have gone through different models, this recent one has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> Bought this thing a year ago. Well. I was happy with it first until it broke. Some of my hair from my head got stuck in it. Replaced it, but the battery was giving me trouble. I could not do the epilation without the power cord.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I started to hate that tip and these edges that they were on the way of my eppilation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting Braun epilator now. Hopefully it will be better.</li>
            <li> I use it on my arms and legs.  I had the old Epilady from many years ago (with the coiled spring thing) which I used on my legs only.  This Legend 4 is so much better.  No pain -- feels more like a &amp;#34;micro-massage&amp;#34;.  Hair on arms &amp; legs is becoming less and less.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give the Legend 4 to my sister as gift for her birthday, but when I received it, the package was completely crushed, and I could easily tell it was not because of shipping.  Seeing as I can&#x27;t give my sister a damaged package (not to mention it probably caused harm to the machine), I had to return it.  I purchased the item again from another seller on Amazon, and the package was perfect, and I was able to give it to her.  She absolutely loves it!  I called the people at Epilady to let them know about my experience, and they mentioned that wesaveyou$ is NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER of their products.  It&#x27;s a good thing I returned it otherwise the warranty on the machine would not have been valid if something would have happened to it.  BUYER BEWARE! Make sure you are purchasing from an authorized dealer before you place your order!  I thought I was just saving some money by purchasing from the seller with the lowest price, but turns out in this case, it was too good to be true.  For personal care products, I will always make sure the seller is authorized before purchase.  Lesson learned; disaster averted!</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator to replace a Braun model that I dropped one too many times. I debated for a long while on which brand/type to replace it with. I am extremely happy with this purchase. It works better than my Braun ever did and there is less pulling associated with the hair removal, especially in the under arm region. I have been epilating for over five years now (legs &amp; under arms, occasional bikini) and will never go back to shaving or waxing. First time epilators - yes, it hurts like crazy. But, you will get over it in about 3-4 sessions on your legs and a little longer for your under arms. I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t tried this sooner. A friend told me about this product and at first I brushed it off as another fad. I had tried at home waxing, sugaring, personal &amp;#34;laser&amp;#34; but they were all painful and difficult to do by yourself. However i started analyzing my 2014 budget and saw i was spending almost $800 a year on waxing and i decided to give this product a chance. I am so glad a did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once so far, so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but it was fast, easy and not as painful as expected. I have been waxing for 5+ years and this hurts less. It&#x27;s small enough to remove hair all over, but the head is large enough to cover full areas quickly.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Glad to find it.  Used one back in 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Correct when people say it hurts like hell. I was only able to do my legs...not worth going anywhere more. Did not pull out all black hairs, but the ones that did didn&#x27;t grow back for at least a week. My upper legs are fine and light, but unfortunately those don&#x27;t get pulled by the epilady</li>
            <li> Many many years ago, somewhere in my college days, my grandmother gave me an Epilady for Christmas.  It was the latest rage, the great technological innovation that would save us from our razors.... and it was absolutely positively HORRIBLE.  It was agony. It was expensive.  And even if you stuck it out and endured the agony to try to get your money&#x27;s worth... you still had hairy legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 25 years or so, Epilady has been one of my favorite jokes.  The great shining symbol of the stupid things women will fall for and horrible things women will endure in their fruitless pursuit of beauty.  Pay a whole bunch of money to painfully rip out every other hair on my leg?  Sure!  Sounds great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when this new model popped up one day as a Lightning Deal, it occurred to me to wonder how such ineffective torture devices were faring in today&#x27;s age of readily available customer reviews.  Much to my surprise, the reviews were good!  Could it be?  Could these things really have improved that much?  Could my 25 years of joking be out of date?  I hated to throw more money at the company that had been such a rip-off (rip-off... ripping my hair off... ha!), but I was in one of those holiday buying frenzies and the deal was good, and I couldn&#x27;t quite stop myself from hitting the buy button. I felt horribly guilty about it.  I didn&#x27;t tell anyone.  I hid it when it got here and tried it in secret.  I gave it a fair try for about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict?  Well, I&#x27;ll be stopping the jokes.  This one stung when first used on really hairy legs, but wasn&#x27;t too bad.  Maybe that&#x27;s because I know have childbirth to compare it to, but still, it was tolerable, and not bad at all when used after that as maintenance.  It also DID remove the hair.  But... legs were never razor-smooth.  Never really stubbly, either, and never had the gorilla-hair-poking-out-of-my-pantyhose problem, but always just a little dry and bumpy feeling.  In the end, I&#x27;ve gone back to therazor.  More time-consuming, but also much more satisfying.</li>
            <li> I have the previous model. The battery didn&#x27;t last that I always have to use it connected to the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;With this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one, the story is totally different. The battery of this one lasts soooooo long when charged that it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow the instructions, and fully charge the unit overnight if possible. After that you&#x27;ll have a super lasting battery ;)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love amazon. This product was hard for me to find but i&#x27;m glad Amazon.com has it.I&#x27;m a female i hate hair on my legs. And other places. And this Epilady 4 works great!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter.  It&#x27;s one of the better ones we&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve used the epilady for almost 15 years (stick with it til you get used to it...it really gets better and easier and is completely worth it if your that daily shaver type of person).  This one does well and gets the job done quicker then others I&#x27;ve tried.  2-3 times a month for maintenance and more effective then others....I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this epilady would be better than the one I have had for about 15 years, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It was just a lot more expensive and didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very easy to use, portable so I can take it with me whilst away and very reasonable price. Highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> It was great.  More powerful then the last one I had.</li>
            <li> I like and it really works but you have to be patience and run it back and forward at least few times to remove all hair. And yes is painful for the first few use.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t work for me on the face.  I have sensitive skin, so I will purchase a smaller one.  However, it is GREAT for my legs and underarms.  I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have used epilady for over 15 years. I had my first one for 13 years and have gone through 2 of the newer versions within 1 year and now 6 months. Just fell apart literally piece by piece. I miss the original version. These do not last for the price I&#x27;m paying. Not happy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of an epilator and yes it does hurt at first and in those more sensitive areas but each time gets a little easier AND if you use it properly.. It does a wonderful job - leaves my skin smooth for weeks!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product a lot. Not only does it get the hairs, but it keeps them away for an extended period of time (2+ weeks!) I haven&#x27;t shaved in over a month. Even when your hairs do grow back they come in blonde.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power, but you must keep it plugged in to get the most use. Definitely recommend this item to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for years.  My previous one lasted almost 10 years before it gave out.  I love that his one is cordless.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This product worked just like it said, it does sting alittle when it pulls the hair, but I got used to it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really did hurt when I first used it so I only did a few spots. But the next week I did find where I used it was still free of hair. I had to really grit my teeth to get threw the first use but now I can just use as I watch tv. I had left a bad review at first but with continued use it truly does get easier. Now I love this and can tolerate it anywhere I need to use it. Have not tried on my under arms yet but maybe one day. After a couple uses and getting used to it I use it all over my legs. Works pretty good. Really does get the hair off and keeps off longer. Being a truck driver I don&#x27;t have much time for shaving. And its a lot neater then wax. I&#x27;m hooked on this and will continue use of this. It does hurt like crazy the first use but continue to use and it will get much easier.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.  Caused red prickles all over my face.  Did not get rid of coarse hair.</li>
            <li> effective and battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love this epilady legend 4. I had never used an epilady before so was cautious about results. I have used this on my upper lip, chin, bikini are, underarm and legs. The only place that hurt during use was my underarms -- and quite frankly that hurt for a 15-30 min then the sensitivity went away. I&#x27;m assuming the more I use it the less painful it will be. If you follow the directions -- not pressing against skin, doing circular motions etc. the hair will be tweezed right out. It doesn&#x27;t always pull the hair on the first pass, so keep moving around to get all hairs. I find it works best if use the epilady on a consistent basis, keeping up with new hair growth. I recommend this product, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver- Clean non-hairy arms and legs last for 2-3 wks and after having used these products for several years I have very little hair left on my arms and legs It is so freeing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how well this works because it is PAINFUL! I could only stand it for a few minutes each time I tried it. I&#x27;d rather shave every few days.</li>
            <li> The thought of reducing leg-shaving frequency led me to purchase the Epilady.  Frankly, this was a BIG mistake.  It never did remove all the hair after going over the legs several times.  Absolutely would NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this. so much better then waxing.</li>
            <li> It might just be me but I felt very little pain just a series of short sharp stings that were milder than I expected. It does take going over each area a few times but that is probably to be expected. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of the EpiLady but it took me up to 45-50 minutes to get both my legs done. With the new model I finished in 20 minutes!  The epilator seems much faster and stronger and that makes it more effective. I think the new model is a great product and I recommend it to anyone who hates having sandpaper for legs due to shaving.</li>
            <li> Love it...my legs/arms feel so smooth afterward and it lasts for a while until the next shaving. Just the best.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This epilator works. It hurts, but it works (any epilator will hurt). I like that it&#x27;s rechargeable and cordless. I can&#x27;t imagine having to deal with a cord or having an outlet strategically placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the high speed yet because it&#x27;s a little intimidating for me, but maybe once I get the hang of using an epilator I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely say that for a mid-range priced epilator (with 40 tweezers) it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using epiladys for years and the revisions for the 4th version are great.  Help you to ensure that you always hold it to get the best hair removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 other brands of epilators. This is hands down the best. This is the second Epilady Legend I have purchased. I only bought this one because after 5 years of careful use, I dropped my other one on a tile floor and shattered it. Don&#x27;t bother with other brands ... waste of time and money. I&#x27;ve tried them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to epilators, but I have to say the Epilady  legend 4 is great. Some complain of pain but I like the way it feels on my legs, now the underarms and face is a different story! Let&#x27;s just say I needed a really good pep talk. But it does what it says. Love this epilator!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this years ago!  It works wonderfully.  Leaves skin smooth.  It was painful, but it was well worth it!  I would highly recommend this product.  Am very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> It works great on my under -arm, but my legs don&#x27;t feel smooth like when I use the razor. It is painful in the bikini area and it can&#x27;t be used in the face at all.  Just because it really works well in my underarm area I decided to keep it, but I was really frustrated about the low performance in legs. It doe snot get the small hairs, so you always have to wait and wait until you are really hairy, so you can have an smooth result, which is inconvenient because it can take weeks until you get all the hairs of a specific area to grow and while that happen you skin looks and feels like sand paper.</li>
            <li> Stings when hairs are pulled - but I have very fuzzy cheeks.  Tender on the upper lip - but overall so much better than tweezing, waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I never have prickly stubble like when shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the Epilady. Really powerful.</li>
            <li> nice that it is cordless.  makes it easy to do bikini line.  hurts like previous models.  makes skin smoth.  thanks</li>
            <li> It has trouble getting the little hairs (I&#x27;m naturally blonde so a lot of mine are super fine) and around the knees. I might get the coil type to compare. Also, pain factor is low. Gets better with time.</li>
            <li> Works very well, much better than shaving or waxing. Not as painful as anticipated. No need to use nearlyas often as I had to use the shaver or had to wax</li>
            <li> I like this Epilady and it seems to work alright. The battery does not hold a good charge. I can use this one time for about 5-10 minutes before it needs to be charged again. I did follow all directions on the initial charge, etc.  I just think it needs I higher end&lt;br /&gt;/stronger battery.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Light, dual voltage if you travel and it smooth your skin, good bye hair</li>
            <li> This was a purchase based solely on laziness; I was tired of shaving my legs several times a week, wanted a longer-lasting alternative, and I&#x27;ve found it with this epilator!  Although I was TERRIFIED the first time I used it, the sensation was more discomfort than pain, and has disappeared with my continued use.  Twenty minutes every two weeks is all it takes, I apply plain EVOO when I&#x27;m done, and the next morning all redness is gone and my legs are so smooth.  I gave it only four stars because it does miss some stubble, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> This item was p;urchased as a gift to my wife and she really likes it.  It took a little time for her to get used to the pulling and burining pain after the initial use, but she says that it is not noticible now.  She has used it for a month now and will not go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to a close relative--at her request.  She loves it, and says it works so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li> Finally decided to buy the new cordless version.  Works pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to catch all the hairs, so you have to go over each area multiple times.  It takes FOREVER to do a whole leg.  I&#x27;ll keep using it though.</li>
            <li> Instructions on how to use not clear enough. Painful, but tolerable. Legs were smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used one of these you must try it!  I got my first Epilady probably 30 years ago and at first, I hated it as it was painful to use.  However, as the hair grows back, it becomes softer and softer, and much easier to use the Epilady to remove, and not at all painful. No more stubble!  No more razor burn.  Recently I briefly went back to shaving my legs, but it was awful.  Bought this new model and love it.</li>
            <li> Not for me. I&#x27;m blond and it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Having owned one of the first editions of the Epilady, I can really say this is an amazing improvement!  Hardy any discomfort at all!!  The earlier version brought tears to my eyes, but I struggled on until I just couldn&#x27;t any more.  This one is so much nicer!  That being said, my blond, blue-eyed daughter who&#x27;s never known the daily hair battles of her Portuguese mother (!) tried it and sputtered, &amp;#34;Are you nuts?!!&amp;#34;  So maybe it&#x27;s only by comparison that this one feels so much easier on the nerves.  I will say that if you have any problems with ingrown hair, then you may want to figure out how to address that (and let me know)!  I still love it because the hair stays gone for so long.</li>
            <li> great item, love it, thx:)</li>
            <li> This little gem works great. I had an original Epilady (the coil type) when they first came out. That unit removed only leg hair for me. This design doesn&#x27;t let any hair get away. No broken hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It removed my underarm hair quickly. (I still have chills!) The trick here was to use a little baby powder on the skin first, then use a clean towel to remove excess followed by the Epilady. My white Swedish skin is very sensitive. I used some Hydrocortisone cream when finished. I won&#x27;t use deodorant for a day or so, until my skin looks normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not discuss bikini line, but I&#x27;m certain it will work great. (the original coil model did not work there for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epilady is lightweight, the charging cord is very thin and long, making it just as easy to use plugged in as not. This model is a huge step above the original, and I am glad to spend hard-earned money on something that leaves my skin smooth, without razor stubble after one day. Bye bye messy wax, too!</li>
            <li> I bought the Epilady about a year ago; but I have only used it 6 times. I was pleased with the performance initially; hair regrowth has been less, and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all after the first couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;My poor review is because it broke in a spectacular way after only 6 uses: the last two times I used it, the device ran out of charge very quickly. The final time, it would not turn off with the switch, and smoke started coming out of it. I had to throw it outside into a snowbank for safety, where it eventually ran itself down. I was afraid it would burst into flames! For $72 (when I bought it) I would have expected much more use before it failed.</li>
            <li> It pinches a lot sometimes, but it&#x27;s so much better than waxing or plucking.  If I&#x27;m going someplace, I get out my Epilady, and in a very few minutes, I&#x27;m ready to go.  The pain is more annoying than bad, and only happens when I do my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! If you&#x27;re old like me though, pull your skin tight enough you don&#x27;t catch your wrinkles in it! Also it was worth the price alone when I got a very tiny fine sliver out of my butt cheek with it! For a week I&#x27;d tried tweezers, duck tape, Elmer&#x27;s glue dried....nothing worked! Then the great idea....my Epilady! Yup, to my relief - finally, it came right out with my Epilady! I bought two more for my daughters too! Hope they love them as much as I do! Oh, and I use it once a week or every 10 days and my legs are always looking and feeling smooth! I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love not having to shave.  Works well and quickly</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for so long, I am happy I finally found it! I hate shaving and this is the perfect alternative to waxing, which will cost you way more money in the long run. I have tried it on my legs and underarms and the more you use it the less painful; to be honest, it only hurt in my underarms the firt time, after that it is easier, I just have to touch up plus the hair is thinner and weaker. I will eventually try the bikini line, after some prep of course!</li>
            <li> It works much faster that the older models.  Easier on the skin as well.  With the epilady the hair does grow in  much softer and lighter.  Its just the old ones were so slow.  I&#x27;ve used these for twenty years off and on because I didn&#x27;t have time and would go back to shaving.  Then I&#x27;d be sorry because the hair would come back strong!  Now with the faster new ones that&#x27;s all I use.</li>
            <li> Epilady is quick and easy to use. It is not as painful as some of the originals.&lt;br /&gt;Tough hairs need a few roll overs to get them out.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product over shaving.</li>
            <li> it only pulls about half of the hairs at a time..I&#x27;ve used this now for 4 weeks and still am not sold on it..maybe another brand would be good but not this one..the one thing I did discover is you need to exfoliate before use..that seems to help..It just feels like the tweezers have dulled since the very first time..I would not recommend this brand..</li>
            <li> The device arrived promptly and with packaging in good condition. It requires going over some areas several times, as it seems to skip some hairs. I would like it to be a little less painful (it&#x27;s somewhat like an ant bite). I need to use an&lt;br /&gt;astringent or witch hazel afterwards or ingrown hairs seem to sprout. All in all, it sure beats shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard to find the right epilator and was extremely hesitant to purchase. But the 30 day return was the clincher....and right from the moment I started using this I&#x27;ve been thrilled. Its my new best friend! It works quickly and painlessly and I now have legs I can bare. I&#x27;m a female with coarse dark hair and have been waxing for 30 years. I would have to grow out hair before rewaxing so always was self-conscious about hair growth.  No more!!! I&#x27;m liberated.  I totally recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular epilady because my old one broke after 10 years of use. It works better and faster.  I recommend this epilady.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy it 20 years ago? It is a great solution for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; women. Makes life much easier than using wax.</li>
            <li> yes it has been very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe a half dozen of these over 20 years, and this is the best. It actually removes hair, including those pesky chin hairs, with very minimal discomfort. It is well designed to fit nicely in a woman&#x27;s hand, well balanced to do its job, conveniently cordless when charged up, and quieter than any other I&#x27;ve had. Priced right, a definite five star item.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it was painless, but in all fairness i understand thats not a reasonable request for the job i want it to perform, and it is less painful than lower cost ones that ive tried.</li>
            <li> It hurts like hell but I have a high tolerence for pain after all these years of razors, wax, threading, a no no, tweezing one at a time.... This has my face feeling like silk. I have always been insecure but not anymore! I will use this epilady until I am dead! Haha IT IS AWESOME!!!!!! It hurts but it is worth it. Power through the discomfort and the results are the best!</li>
            <li> I used to have the original elpilady and that one worked sooo much better. This epilady works,but not as well, but it does not hurt that much to use it, so I guess it is a trade off.</li>
