            <li>Upsets me because I needed these for a craft fair this weekend</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner, and I felt the price was good.</li>
            <li>Yes, a good price, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Tubes are otherwise good quality and at a good price.</li>
            <li>If you make lip balms this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a four star because it&#x27;s a good product at a good price</li>
            <li>I would have loved these if they&#x27;d never miss an item on my orders.</li>
            <li>The material is sturdy and of good quality.</li>
            <li>These are good</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size and easy to use for anyone looking to make their own chapstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Love these for the price!</li>
            <li>The lids fit perfectly and are easy to fill.</li>
            <li>the box for shipping was overly large, but I am very happy with product.</li>
            <li>Tubes are packaged nicely with caps in a separate zip type bag</li>
            <li>I make my own lip balm with no yukky toxic, smelly ingredients.  </li>
            <li>how easy it is to make your own?!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are cheap but a good deal</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for is true in this case!!</li>
            <li>These tubes are nice quality, the turn mechanism works well, caps fit nicely.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>honestly better if you find a different/brand or website to order these from.</li>
            <li>I love these tubes,  the cap fits snugly, so</li>
            <li>Meaning that these tubes will only produce a .11 oz tube at best.  </li>
            <li>then I guess they would be ok.</li>
            <li>And this company has 100 at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I think the label I use hides most of the messiness</li>
            <li>but I have to use more liquid to fill it up since some is always drizzling out.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: you can do better than these.</li>
            <li>Look forward to ordering more when I need more.</li>
            <li>I like the oval shape better but these are ok for the price</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly, however the twist moves very easily, works its way up all the way when carried in pocket.</li>
            <li>Fit together nicely, turn easy and are tuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a nice product!</li>
            <li>These are a great price, and I love that they are packaged by 10, so I don&#x27;t have to go digging around a big box to find the caps.</li>
            <li>I bought a different brand first and those worked perfectly and didn&#x27;t leak at all.</li>
            <li>If these tubes fit your tube holder then they would be just fine</li>
            <li>Tubes have nice tight fitting lids and shipping was good.</li>
            <li>I have to cut the edge off before applying and that is a huge pain.</li>
            <li>They are also flimsy and bend at the rims when I try to fit them into my lip balm holder</li>
            <li>These are cheap and leaky.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>The cap fits well, &amp; the turning mechanism is smooth.</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>and cheap.  </li>
            <li>However, they are shorter then others that I have used and they don&#x27;t fit my label.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>they hold a good amount of lip balm, are easy to open and close, and are sturdier than I thought they would be!</li>
            <li>Ok, this is the thing, they work, the caps fit, very well.  </li>
            <li>diameter tubes...not cool</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the fit of the lids on these containers.  </li>
            <li>The caps on these don&#x27;t really fit properly and just kind of fall off.</li>
            <li>These lip balm tubes were well packaged and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Great little tubes.</li>
            <li>A little of the chap stick leaks through the stopper...but still great product.</li>
            <li>If we used clear labels these tubes would not look appealing.</li>
            <li>Other than that good product.</li>
            <li>they fall right off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better quality</li>
            <li>Good quality and arrived much sooner that expected!</li>
            <li>I got these because of the higher quantity and fully regret it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Caps do not fit good on tubes.</li>
            <li>Caps off another chapstick tube will fit nice and tight on these tubes, so clearly a problem with the caps themselves, not the tubes.</li>
            <li>I got the product fast and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>took a very long time to get items, most of them the contents don&#x27;t stay in the tube, they leak, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>Many of the caps are too loose.</li>
            <li>The top comes loose and my lip balm melted all over my pocket</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s just for personal use, you are fine, but I sell and give mine away</li>
            <li>The lids aren&#x27;t great, and the tubes themselves looked like they had been tossed around quite a bit with tiny little scratches.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but overall it&#x27;s an ethical question, if I&#x27;m buying organic products, but I&#x27;m buying containers that are made in a place that has little to no environmental regulations, it seems like a bit of an contradiction.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fit in my mold thing to pour multiple at a time.</li>
            <li>so once open you can secure again.  </li>
            <li>The empty tubes weighed .14 oz, after filling to max capacity (and even bubbling a drop or two on top)</li>
            <li>excellent for a bis unless you&#x27;re cutting corners&lt;br</li>
            <li>my customers really like them.</li>
            <li>The lids do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I needed them fast</li>
            <li>but if I had to put this much time into ones I was selling for profit I would have returned them and purchased from a seller that supplied the size that fits my tube tray.</li>
            <li>This tube also uses more product compared to the previous tubes that I used.</li>
            <li>(it holds the tubes steady when you pour in the liquid balm).</li>
            <li>The caps are loose although it has the  &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when you put it on.</li>
            <li>They refunded for the missing pieces be a use they count not get more from the company.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy them though if you want to keep them clear and don&#x27;t want to see the lip balm you make leak down to the bottom where it will never be able to be used.  </li>
            <li>the chapstick will not go down back in the tube nicely and leave some residue on the tube.</li>
            <li>Hoping a new batch comes in soon</li>
            <li>very clear to see product</li>
            <li>I like the clear tubes to show off the product and see how much you have left, but this really detracts.  </li>
            <li>The first time it was a tube and my second time it was a cap.</li>
            <li>great product but shipping is a little slow.</li>
            <li>The listing has the incorrect diameter under the details:0( they did not fit in my Chapstick tube tray that is made to fit .67&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have had a few that won&#x27;t twist up after they are filled as well.</li>
            <li>poor quality, most caps dont fit the tubes properly, smaller then expected, will not order again</li>
            <li>:  I have purchased clear lip balm tubes from numerous businesses,  part of and not part of Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Kid friendly (for at least five and up)</li>
            <li>The fist few I used for my diy lip balms worked fine (minus the pocket thing), but the last handful of times I&#x27;ve used them I have had to fill the bottom with Beeswax to keep the balms from leaking out the bottom.</li>
            <li>This product is just what it says, one hundred clear empty lip balm tubes.</li>

            <li> The listing has the incorrect diameter under the details:0( they did not fit in my Chapstick tube tray that is made to fit .67&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have had a few that won&#x27;t twist up after they are filled as well.</li>
            <li> poor quality, most caps dont fit the tubes properly, smaller then expected, will not order again</li>
            <li> :  I have purchased clear lip balm tubes from numerous businesses,  part of and not part of Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Kid friendly (for at least five and up)</li>
            <li> The fist few I used for my diy lip balms worked fine (minus the pocket thing), but the last handful of times I&#x27;ve used them I have had to fill the bottom with Beeswax to keep the balms from leaking out the bottom.</li>
            <li> This product is just what it says, one hundred clear empty lip balm tubes.</li>
            <li> Many had rough or uneven edges on the twist up end, meaning that if you try to use the last little bit of product at the end of the tube you will probably cut your lip!  </li>
            <li> The piece on the inside in the bottom comes up higher than in other tubes, so you&#x27;re actually losing a little product that can&#x27;t be used at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Clean and broken into two packages of 50</li>
            <li> Shipping and all went great, no complaints there, but the tubes are very thin and the tops do not fit tight enough.</li>
            <li> Will order again as I refuse to pay the outrageous prices for commercial chap stick and making my own organic at home, well worth it.</li>
            <li> You could see it had run down into the bottom near the part you turn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still undecided if it&#x27;s enough of an issue to switch back to the significantly more expensive tube I had used previously.</li>
            <li> Every single tube of the 20 I&#x27;ve filled so far have leaked to the bottom and have resulted in wasted lip balm and it looks pretty ugly.</li>
            <li> We had to use a home made version that doesn&#x27;t fit as snug and its difficult to set the tubes and makes for a hassle pouring.</li>
            <li> Works fine though the plastic seems a little thin.</li>
            <li> When I contacted customer service to see if others complained of the same issue, I was told to contact a professional!</li>
            <li> My other problem is that standard lip balm labels are a bit too tall for these tubes.</li>
            <li> Look at the pics form other seller, they seem to be the same product.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 3 stars because about half of them did stay on enough to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> Tops fit snug but aren&#x27;t impossible to open.</li>
            <li> Whoever makes these tubes must have made a bad batch around November 2013, because every seller (except this one) had reviews stating the caps didn&#x27;t fit!</li>
            <li> Some tubes were scratched / damaged, and they did not fit in my standard sized lip balm tube holder tray.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leak out completely, but it looks messy and is a waste of product.</li>
            <li> I opened it up, and the 100 empty lip balm containers were packed inside four separate mailing envelopes, each one of those was also as dirty as the main shipping envelope, and inside those, the lip balm containers themselves are completely coated in dirt and grime!</li>
            <li> The screw mechanism sits about halfway down the tube in the fully retracted position, so that when you put your product in, it appears as if you only have half a tube.  </li>
            <li> My product also leaked slightly to the bottom of the tube (this makes my end product not professional).</li>
            <li> These are not the type of Chapstick containers you can throw in your purse or pocket due to the fact the lids will pop off.</li>
            <li> Since these are for wedding favors for a family member we made due</li>
            <li> caps appear loose, but hold tight.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The lids snap on tightly, which is something I&#x27;ve had issues with before from other sellers.  </li>
            <li> I was on a deadline for Christmas and had to use them anyways, with the caps taped down.</li>
            <li> I think then some of the other tubes I&#x27;ve seen, just a little.  </li>
            <li> These tubes although are 0.15 ounce are wider than the typical tube.  </li>
            <li> They leaked a little down into the turning mechanism on some tubes.  </li>
            <li> I saved a little by buying these but won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> Also the plastic feels a bit flimsier than other lip balm tubes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The caps do not fit tight.  </li>
            <li> WASTED PRODUCT WITH THESE TUBES.</li>
            <li> So about 5-4 of the lids did not fit</li>
            <li> During that month I saw reviews popping up stating the caps did not fit, so I worried.  </li>
            <li> I have bought a few batches of these now.</li>
            <li> This makes it so that they do not fit in my tray that holds the tubes as I pour oils into them.</li>
            <li> A cap was also missing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go back down after being twisted up.</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> The English is broken and difficult to understand as the seller is in China (which I found out when I received my package in Chinese!).</li>
            <li> They fill nicely, no leaking and the caps snap on tight.  </li>
            <li> I will have to use these as sample tubes now, and will be ordering from my usual supplier.  </li>
            <li> What I do take issue with, is the fact that some of the lip balm leaked past the inside &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; and pooled at the bottom when I poured into some of the tubes</li>
            <li> I am not completely satisfied with these tubes.</li>
            <li> and I could get them sooner with Prime shipping than it would take to get them from my usual supplier.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s always an item missing!</li>
            <li> Which sucks when you are making lip balms to sell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use them and it&#x27;s too late to return them.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are poor quality, the lip balm leaks under the base so the end product looks messy and very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that labels are impossible to get to Stick on these</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, but I had a few leak and some of the covers were off so they didn&#x27;t snap on.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t have this problem - I consider it dishonest to sell them as is!</li>
            <li> These were just poor quality.</li>
            <li> The lids do, though, feel &#x27;thin&#x27;...almost too flexible.  </li>
            <li> I ordered from another seller which is shipping from China (still waiting for it to arrive) and I think it&#x27;s the same crap product.</li>
            <li> A serious product fail.</li>
            <li> These tubes are mediocre quality.</li>
            <li> Poor me!</li>
            <li> but I was sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the caps WILL NOT stay on.</li>
            <li> Very thin plastic.</li>
            <li> But these are very poorly made.</li>
            <li> When pouring lip balm or solid perfume into the tube, some of the liquid always leaks around the bottom and gets into the space between the lip balm base and the base of the tube.</li>
            <li> The package these were sent to me in was so dirty, I didn&#x27;t want to touch it.</li>
            <li> I would return this if I was not in desperate situation.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the tubes &amp; will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m appalled!</li>
            <li> This is horrible product!</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Many of the caps are too loose. They are also flimsy and bend at the rims when I try to fit them into my lip balm holder (it holds the tubes steady when you pour in the liquid balm). I saved a little by buying these but won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> These tube leaked all of my lip balm out of the bottom of the tubes when I poured in the warm solution! What a mess! A serious product fail. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> great product but shipping is a little slow.</li>
            <li> Good quality and arrived much sooner that expected!</li>
            <li> Love these. Work well and use them all the time.</li>
            <li> Very thin plastic. Don&#x27;t fit in my mold thing to pour multiple at a time. will never order again.</li>
            <li> My mom makes homemade lip balms and I bought these tubes for her. They work perfectly!</li>
            <li> These tubes are alright. The piece on the inside in the bottom comes up higher than in other tubes, so you&#x27;re actually losing a little product that can&#x27;t be used at the bottom. In addition, the tubes themselves felt to be of low quality AND were not secure--as in, my lip balms would actually run below the piece that moves the stick of lip balm up. You could see it had run down into the bottom near the part you turn and I was worried it would run out of the bottom entirely (none of them actually did).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s honestly better if you find a different/brand or website to order these from.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend. These are cheap and leaky.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this item again, the caps don&#x27;t stay on at all they fall right off</li>
            <li> DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. WASTED PRODUCT WITH THESE TUBES. THEY DON&#x27;T PUSH THE PRODUCT UP A ALL.</li>
            <li> So about 5-4 of the lids did not fit</li>
            <li> Love these for the price! Already went threw 400 and working on the next 300 now. The lids some times come off but for the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal</li>
            <li> Perfect for DIY Crayola Lipstick.</li>
            <li> The top comes loose and my lip balm melted all over my pocket</li>
            <li> Shipping and all went great, no complaints there, but the tubes are very thin and the tops do not fit tight enough. I doubt the tops will stay on the tubes in a purse. Upsets me because I needed these for a craft fair this weekend</li>
            <li> I love these tubes,  the cap fits snugly, so no worry of it coming off.  Received in a timely manner, and I felt the price was good.</li>
            <li> This product is just what it says, one hundred clear empty lip balm tubes. They work wonderfully for making your own lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caps appear loose, but hold tight. I have not had one slip off.</li>
            <li> These tubes are nice quality, the turn mechanism works well, caps fit nicely.  Tubes are packaged nicely with caps in a separate zip type bag so once open you can secure again.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Sturdy product, works functionally, but doesn&#x27;t fill the entire tube.  The screw mechanism sits about halfway down the tube in the fully retracted position, so that when you put your product in, it appears as if you only have half a tube.  I like the clear tubes to show off the product and see how much you have left, but this really detracts.  I won&#x27;t order again for that reason.  If it&#x27;s just for personal use, you are fine, but I sell and give mine away and I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;half a tube&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> These are great quality and I would have given them five stars buuuuut.... The listing has the incorrect diameter under the details:0( they did not fit in my Chapstick tube tray that is made to fit .67&amp;#34; diameter tubes...not cool</li>
            <li> Overall great product. Kid friendly (for at least five and up) I used these products to make crayon lipstick. Quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> These were just poor quality. The lids aren&#x27;t great, and the tubes themselves looked like they had been tossed around quite a bit with tiny little scratches. I only went for these because of the prime shipping, and I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> The package these were sent to me in was so dirty, I didn&#x27;t want to touch it. I opened it up, and the 100 empty lip balm containers were packed inside four separate mailing envelopes, each one of those was also as dirty as the main shipping envelope, and inside those, the lip balm containers themselves are completely coated in dirt and grime! I can&#x27;t use these!! I&#x27;m appalled!</li>
            <li> Best price I could find for the amount!</li>
            <li> These tubes are mediocre quality. Many had rough or uneven edges on the twist up end, meaning that if you try to use the last little bit of product at the end of the tube you will probably cut your lip!  They also do NOT come anywhere close to holding .15 oz as advertised.  The empty tubes weighed .14 oz, after filling to max capacity (and even bubbling a drop or two on top) the finished weight was .25 oz.  Meaning that these tubes will only produce a .11 oz tube at best.  If you label and sell these as I do these wont work.  I will have to use these as sample tubes now, and will be ordering from my usual supplier.  You get what you pay for is true in this case!!</li>
            <li> If you have labels to cover these then I guess they would be ok. Don&#x27;t buy them though if you want to keep them clear and don&#x27;t want to see the lip balm you make leak down to the bottom where it will never be able to be used.  I bought a different brand first and those worked perfectly and didn&#x27;t leak at all. I got these because of the higher quantity and fully regret it. Every single tube of the 20 I&#x27;ve filled so far have leaked to the bottom and have resulted in wasted lip balm and it looks pretty ugly. Which sucks when you are making lip balms to sell. I will not be purchasing these again. I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better quality</li>
            <li> Will order again as I refuse to pay the outrageous prices for commercial chap stick and making my own organic at home, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Good products good price!</li>
            <li> Great little tubes. The lids fit perfectly and are easy to fill. Very satisfied and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Exactlly as described.</li>
            <li> awesome! and arrived earlier than promised. I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> 105 (yes there were extra) tubes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;98 useable&lt;br /&gt;7 with cracked heads or tubes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cheap but a good deal&lt;br /&gt;Not excellent for a bis unless you&#x27;re cutting corners&lt;br /&gt;Some of the mechanisms stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> great tubes. Fit together nicely, turn easy and are tuff. I buy about 100 every month. my customers really like them.</li>
            <li> The caps on these don&#x27;t really fit properly and just kind of fall off.</li>
            <li> These are a great price, and I love that they are packaged by 10, so I don&#x27;t have to go digging around a big box to find the caps. The cap fits well, &amp; the turning mechanism is smooth. I don&#x27;t care for the noticeable seam on the inside, though it isn&#x27;t as obvious once the lip balm is poured- I&#x27;m just picky that way, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. What I do take issue with, is the fact that some of the lip balm leaked past the inside &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; and pooled at the bottom when I poured into some of the tubes (I hope that makes sense). It didn&#x27;t leak out completely, but it looks messy and is a waste of product. I&#x27;m still undecided if it&#x27;s enough of an issue to switch back to the significantly more expensive tube I had used previously.</li>
            <li> Recieved part of this from prime dept. They refunded for the missing pieces be a use they count not get more from the company. Some of the tubes leaked. I am not completely satisfied with these tubes.</li>
            <li> I will never buy lip balm again!  Do you have any idea how easy it is to make your own?!  And this company has 100 at such a great price!</li>
            <li> no problems, will re order!</li>
            <li> The lids do not stay on very well. These are not the type of Chapstick containers you can throw in your purse or pocket due to the fact the lids will pop off. I have had a few that won&#x27;t twist up after they are filled as well.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. Second time I&#x27;ve ordered them for my homemade EO&#x27;s chapsticks. Love them.</li>
            <li> Tubes worked for my chapsticks.  The lids snap on tightly, which is something I&#x27;ve had issues with before from other sellers.  The lids do, though, feel &#x27;thin&#x27;...almost too flexible.  We&#x27;ll see how the bottoms hold up.</li>
            <li> A little of the chap stick leaks through the stopper...but still great product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from this company. The tubes are poor quality, the lip balm leaks under the base so the end product looks messy and very unprofessional. It took three weeks to receive and it was only 73 tubes.</li>
            <li> perfect for my hand made lip balms will order more soon!</li>
            <li> Yes, a good price, but you get what you pay for. The tubes arrived Weeks after I placed the order, having been shipped from China. Some tubes were scratched / damaged, and they did not fit in my standard sized lip balm tube holder tray. I threw them all away, rather than paying for shipping to return them to China.</li>
            <li> These need work.  The caps do not stay on at all.  These are cheaply made.  I am giving it 3 stars because about half of them did stay on enough to give as gifts.  Quality control people.</li>
            <li> I made lipsticks with these and they work like a charm! and for a great prices!</li>
            <li> and cheap.  I make my own lip balm with no yukky toxic, smelly ingredients.  These tubes work perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to pour into these tubes so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  However, they are shorter then others that I have used and they don&#x27;t fit my label.  The caps do not fit tight.  They fall off.  They don&#x27;t have any measurements on their amazon page.  I can&#x27;t use them and it&#x27;s too late to return them.  Poor me!</li>
            <li> very clear to see product</li>
            <li> You would think that all lip balm tubes are created equal. That&#x27;s what I thought but I was sadly mistaken. I purchased these because I needed them fast and I could get them sooner with Prime shipping than it would take to get them from my usual supplier. But these are very poorly made. When pouring lip balm or solid perfume into the tube, some of the liquid always leaks around the bottom and gets into the space between the lip balm base and the base of the tube. I think the label I use hides most of the messiness but I have to use more liquid to fill it up since some is always drizzling out. My other problem is that standard lip balm labels are a bit too tall for these tubes. I have to cut the edge off before applying and that is a huge pain. Bottom line: you can do better than these.</li>
            <li> They leaked a little down into the turning mechanism on some tubes.  Other than that good product.</li>
            <li> Whoever makes these tubes must have made a bad batch around November 2013, because every seller (except this one) had reviews stating the caps didn&#x27;t fit! I was hoping this seller had a different source. Unfortunately, the caps WILL NOT stay on. Caps off another chapstick tube will fit nice and tight on these tubes, so clearly a problem with the caps themselves, not the tubes. Tubes are otherwise good quality and at a good price. Hoping a new batch comes in soon that doesn&#x27;t have this problem - I consider it dishonest to sell them as is! I was on a deadline for Christmas and had to use them anyways, with the caps taped down. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> PRO:  The pruduct was packed well and delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  I have purchased clear lip balm tubes from numerous businesses,  part of and not part of Amazon.  These tubes although are 0.15 ounce are wider than the typical tube.  Also, there are horizontal lines you can see in the plastic.  If we used clear labels these tubes would not look appealing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, but I had a few leak and some of the covers were off so they didn&#x27;t snap on.</li>
            <li> My daughters made homemade lipstick with crayons and coconut oil and these worked perfectly. Tops fit snug but aren&#x27;t impossible to open.</li>
            <li> poor quality, most caps dont fit the tubes properly, smaller then expected, will not order again</li>
            <li> This is horrible product! I would return this if I was not in desperate situation. the chapstick will not go down back in the tube nicely and leave some residue on the tube. The caps are loose although it has the  &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when you put it on. This tube also uses more product compared to the previous tubes that I used. The bag that the tubes came in seems &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; because there&#x27;s holes on the bag. My product also leaked slightly to the bottom of the tube (this makes my end product not professional). the cap and the tube are not flush when put together. It feels lopsided. All in all, this is not worth the money. I ordered from another seller which is shipping from China (still waiting for it to arrive) and I think it&#x27;s the same crap product. Look at the pics form other seller, they seem to be the same product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lip balm tubes in December, they took a month to arrive (from China).  During that month I saw reviews popping up stating the caps did not fit, so I worried.  However the shipment I got is perfect! They fill nicely, no leaking and the caps snap on tight.  WHEW!  Thanks for a nice product!</li>
            <li> Items are from China. Tubes don&#x27;t find standard size fill tray. Caps fall off. Don&#x27;t go back down after being twisted up. When I contacted customer service to see if others complained of the same issue, I was told to contact a professional! What??? The English is broken and difficult to understand as the seller is in China (which I found out when I received my package in Chinese!).</li>
            <li> If you make lip balms this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> took a very long time to get items, most of them the contents don&#x27;t stay in the tube, they leak, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Ok, this is the thing, they work, the caps fit, very well.  They are a bit shorter I think then some of the other tubes I&#x27;ve seen, just a little.  The quality is good, very nice.  BUT these are from China and I didn&#x27;t realize it, hence the longer wait time to get the product.  The product is great, but overall it&#x27;s an ethical question, if I&#x27;m buying organic products, but I&#x27;m buying containers that are made in a place that has little to no environmental regulations, it seems like a bit of an contradiction.  I&#x27;m giving it a four star because it&#x27;s a good product at a good price and it came sooner than it was suppose to, so thank you to the sender.</li>
            <li> Clean and broken into two packages of 50 so it&#x27;s easier to store.  Look forward to ordering more when I need more.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  The caps will not even stay on they are too lose.  Very cheaply made.  I will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> Tubes have nice tight fitting lids and shipping was good. the box for shipping was overly large, but I am very happy with product. I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I use these for my homemade lip balm.  They also make great gifts.  I have never had any problems with the tubes.</li>
            <li> I got the product fast and it was exactly what I needed. They work great for my homemade chapstick! Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I have bought a few batches of these now. Great pricing, awesome tubes. they hold a good amount of lip balm, are easy to open and close, and are sturdier than I thought they would be!</li>
            <li> Takes forever to get here but they work great!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. They are Nessy looking and leak when u pour ur chap stick into them it leaks out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly, however the twist moves very easily, works its way up all the way when carried in pocket. The fist few I used for my diy lip balms worked fine (minus the pocket thing), but the last handful of times I&#x27;ve used them I have had to fill the bottom with Beeswax to keep the balms from leaking out the bottom. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the tubes &amp; will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem With these. The only caveat is that labels are impossible to get to Stick on these</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size and easy to use for anyone looking to make their own chapstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described but the tubes are just a hair larger than the others I&amp;#34;ve ordered from different supplies. This makes it so that they do not fit in my tray that holds the tubes as I pour oils into them. We had to use a home made version that doesn&#x27;t fit as snug and its difficult to set the tubes and makes for a hassle pouring. If these tubes fit your tube holder then they would be just fine but it didn&#x27;t work out for us. Also the plastic feels a bit flimsier than other lip balm tubes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Since these are for wedding favors for a family member we made due but if I had to put this much time into ones I was selling for profit I would have returned them and purchased from a seller that supplied the size that fits my tube tray.</li>
            <li> I like the oval shape better but these are ok for the price</li>
            <li> I make homemade chapstick and these worked well.  Only 2 out of 100 leaked.  A cap was also missing.  But it got the job done.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the fit of the lids on these containers.  I would not buy this item again.  I have purchased similar containers that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works fine though the plastic seems a little thin.</li>
            <li> Caps do not fit good on tubes. Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Great price and well made product.</li>
            <li> These lip balm tubes were well packaged and shipped quickly. They were the best deal for us. We use these for our homemade lip balms and they are perfect! We will definitely order again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I would have loved these if they&#x27;d never miss an item on my orders. The material is sturdy and of good quality. Some are really cheap and thin. These are good but it&#x27;s my second time ordering with this seller and there&#x27;s always an item missing! The first time it was a tube and my second time it was a cap.</li>
            <li> These are not made in the USA. The packaging was all in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality! Used at a class and would defiantly repurchase</li>
