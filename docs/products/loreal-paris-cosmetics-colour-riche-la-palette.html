    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My wife is very happy having this product</li>
            <li>This is an excellent nude collection of shadows.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s on a VERY bright laptop screen.</li>
            <li>and I got very good results.</li>
            <li>but all of them look great-</li>
            <li>Great for Olive complexion skin.</li>
            <li>This is a versatile palette that I have been happy</li>
            <li>Great Product...</li>
            <li>putting my whining aside that this palette was almost too neutral, for a drug store palette, it is very nice.</li>
            <li>Tons of transition colors, and as you can see, they meld, colorwise, very nicely into one</li>
            <li>I think it would have been amazing if L&#x27;Oreal had named these colors!</li>
            <li>Good choice if you&#x27;re looking to try some shades in this color family (taupe/mauve/plum/dark brown) and don&#x27;t want to shell out for high-end stuff quite yet.  </li>
            <li>That said, there&#x27;s a good range of options in this - good bang for my buck, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and flattering and would work for most skin types.</li>
            <li>this product is great if you&#x27;re indecisive because it gives you a lot of complementary colors to choose from, and you can even blend them together to get more of a range than that.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use my own eye shadow brushes, but the applicator that comes with the set is of good quality for those who prefer to use it.  </li>
            <li>To give you a more accurate measure, I am fair, and the skin on my forearm is very fair.</li>
            <li>To give you a more accurate measure, I am fair, and the skin on my forearm is very fair.</li>
            <li>It goes amazing with my brown eyes</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice quality shadow.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, go on a bit darker than I would prefer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice shadow.</li>
            <li>This nude collection has a nice range of colors which gives me a lot of flexibility to play around with.</li>
            <li>Without using a primer, the colors all blend together and wear off and you won&#x27;t get the defined look that is so popular these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mostly liked the packaging...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a kind of &amp;#34;paint by number&amp;#34; showing you how to achieve these looks in four steps  </li>
            <li>, everything sparkly, shiny or glittery tends not to be your best friend, particularly around the eye area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a nice combination of matte and shimmer shadows (more shimmer than matte) that come in mostly warm tones.</li>
            <li>Stayed on nicely for most of the day.</li>
            <li>The Nude 1 has more golds and browns whereas Nude 2 has more rose, greys, plums, and mauves.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great palette for beginners or for mixing with higher end colors to achieve your desired looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the texture too powdery for very detailed work, even with primer.</li>
            <li>It is nicely packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For example, I was wearing a outfit with some grays in it, so chose a color that seemed gray on the palette, but it ended up looking more purple.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this pallet.</li>
            <li>I will venture into all the colors once I get over my love for the purple ones.</li>
            <li>I think this is best for a &amp;#34;daytime smokey&amp;#34; look for light to medium skin tones, or more natural looks if you have darker skin.</li>
            <li>Love this palette.</li>
            <li>I was glad,</li>
            <li>Despite my aging eye area, I was hoping for more oomph.</li>
            <li>They blend OK, too.</li>
            <li>love the color.</li>
            <li>and there were a lot more matte colors than shimmery ones which I prefer.</li>
            <li>and I mostly wear it to work and on the weekends but can still create some smokier effects with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Nude 1 palette of colors more than Nude 2.</li>
            <li>It still works well with my skin tone, but I would use this palette more for fall/winter because of the colors.</li>
            <li>I am sure the colors will be richer when using a primer, but I have not had a change to replenish my supply as of yet.</li>
            <li>I prefer the sponge end for better application.</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette are lovely and work well for me.  </li>
            <li>It would have added more of a &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; department/makeup store feel.</li>
            <li>The colors are so opaque, and i love the texture.</li>
            <li>The darker colors are very rich.</li>
            <li>By contrast, the deeper shades are all nicely pigmented, and some are even on the rich, buttery side that puts them within shouting distance of UD shadows.</li>
            <li>Because of my fair skin complexion, I always need to wear cool or neutral colors and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>If you want to do anything more detailed that that, well, you&#x27;re probably more skilled than I am, so it could turn out</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually more light pinkish.</li>
            <li>* More &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; available online</li>
            <li>Compared to Nude 1 which has two perfect middle blending tones (a warm one and a neutral one) that I just love, I definitely prefer the Nude 1 more :)</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re an over 40 like me, you&#x27;ll be fine with this palette.</li>
            <li>the half length mirror is great!</li>
            <li>This is a solid palette for everyday use, GREAT for the price, but too powdery to be awesome.</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>colors go on smooth and have lasted all day for me, even with my allergies.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow is smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>- the cheap ones fall apart in my make-up bag after some use  </li>
            <li>Not quite there, but still not bad at all for a $20 palette (that you can easily get on sale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>But overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a fantastic palette of colors that will end up being a good edition to my makeup kit.</li>
            <li>A variety of more natural looks can be obtained with this 10-color palette with a mixture of matte and more shiny colors.  </li>
            <li>I did not have any skin rash/irritation, but again my skin is not sensitive, so I am not the best judge to see if it suits sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic drug store palette, I can thoroughly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic drug store palette, I can thoroughly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>The product is good, especially for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li>I think the variety of colors in this palette is decent and will compliment most cool skin tones.</li>
            <li>go on pretty well - no dragging, no settling in fine lines (I did use a primer beforehand.)</li>
            <li>Applying it over my eye primer, it last all day :) Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly better on the lid, and it&#x27;s OK as an inner corner highlight.</li>
            <li>I debated returning it, but figured &#x27;what can happen with eyeshadow&#x27;, wiped them all off quickly, and went on my way.</li>
            <li>Most are very pigmented and go on beautifully, with a natural finish especially when used with eye shadow primer (I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance).</li>
            <li>I prefer a clean more natural look so the descriptions aren&#x27;t anything I would use, but may be helpful for others.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is very wearable, catches and reflects a bit of light but doesn&#x27;t give a metallic effect.</li>
            <li>So far I have my favorite colors (the purple ones)</li>
            <li>The one I have most issue with is the light vanilla color on the very left.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be fun experimenting with these range of shades for daytime and nighttime wear.</li>
            <li>Lovely colors with neutral to cool undertones, mostly matte, a few shimmers.</li>
            <li>the palette opens up completely flat which is nice to hold and</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>they are just right.</li>
            <li>In case this is helpful--I have light/medium Asian skin with neutral undertones and tend to look better in cool colors.</li>
            <li>- I mean the mirror is really really good - there is where brands like L&#x27;Oreal make the difference in each fine details.     </li>
            <li>Take note though that when they say &amp;#34;nude,&amp;#34; they really aren&#x27;t kidding!</li>
            <li>(Btw, points to L&#x27;Oreal for making a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palette that darker-skinned women could reasonably call nude!)</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>though, to try this L&#x27;Oreal palette, the first being that it was nudes, and</li>
            <li>Even the shimmeriest colors in this palette aren&#x27;t anything as glitzy as the most sedate Urban Decay shimmers.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be using a lot more of the lighter colors to get a proper effect, and they may not make it til the end of the day.</li>

            <li>(I think this palette definitely has more of a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tone to it than &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; so buy accordingly to your skin tone).</li>
            <li>I was expecting the leftmost color to be more of a pearly white</li>
            <li>Usually, a palette is completely warm or neutral or cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Nude 1 every day so far and prefer the two middle blending tones in the Nude 1 over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC).</li>

            <li>I did swatches for all ten colors, and the first one is so light that no matter how many times I dipped my finger into it, it simply doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>is of pretty high quality</li>
            <li>did try to get accurate color swatches, but the truth is, until you see any shadow up close, your monitor is going to fool you (ask Sephora for all the stuff I&#x27;ve sent back when it didn&#x27;t look at all like what the pictures showed it to be.)</li>

            <li>Same goes for brows - the eye shadow, applied lightly to trimmed eyebrows, works well to keep some means for expression on my face.  </li>
            <li>These colors are fabulous layered over Neutrogena&#x27;s Crease Proof Eyeshadow in Lasting Taupe (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Crease-Proof-Shadow-Lasting/dp/B00ADRHABW).</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t too powerful and loud</li>
            <li>The darker shadows last all day, but the light ones can be a PITA and tend to disappear when blending.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not there in real life, or maybe my eyeballs are just swatched out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will do a basic job as nicely as anything you&#x27;re likely to find at Walgreen&#x27;s.darker shadows last all day, but the light ones can be a PITA and tend to disappear when blending.</li>

            <li>it’s a very wearable every day palette</li>
            <li>I have very hooded eyes, and I have not have had any issues with creasing, even without a primer.</li>
            <li>But it might really bother others.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>It seems reasonably priced for the quality.</li>
            <li>It will do a basic job as nicely as anything you&#x27;re likely to find at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>What works best for me is a 2-shade look--say, a light base all over and a darker shade on the lid and/or crease.</li>
            <li>This palette offers a wide range of colors, so anyone should be able to find or blend the right color to enhance the eyes.</li>
            <li>I use this with a nyx eyeshadow primer and even though I live in hot, humid Hawaii, my eye makeup really lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a quality eye shadow collection of subtle shades which will look natural and appealing on most, if not all, eye colors.</li>
            <li>I can apply more for a smoky eye look or a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>Relatedly, the packaging is elegant and sturdy, and should last quite a while, too.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal always makes high quality products and this set is no exception.</li>
            <li>especially the light pink ones- numbers 1 and 8) and need to be reapplied occasionally or applied over and over again to reach desired pigment.</li>
            <li>10 highly pigmented shades curated to blend harmoniously  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a primer/shadow stick that is a very subtle shade on its own but makes a perfect base layer for these shadows--velvety and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wow! 10 shades to choose from and a brush in a mirrored compact!</li>
            <li>The shadows are very buttery and soft and it doesn&#x27;t get too powdery when you dip your brush in.</li>
            <li>Speaking of size, it is a pretty big palette--I think bigger than all the other popular nude palettes out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors in this palette are numbered 1 through 10 from left to right.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t particularly look that way in these swatches after several tries, so maybe it&#x27;s time to flush my camera and get something more HD.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t particularly look that way in these swatches after several tries, so maybe it&#x27;s time to flush my camera and get something more HD.</li>
            <li>But that light shade and the other one both tend to be a tad chalky.</li>
            <li>Six shades are matte and the other four shades have a light sheen.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see varying earth tones along with a few pinkish/purple shades since that makes my green eyes pop with those colors.</li>
            <li>The colors were a little more sheer than expected, but they are easily buildable.</li>
            <li>They go on a little lighter than they look, easily allowing me to create a natural look.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a wide array of darker hues and it was easy enough for her.</li>
            <li>only real issue I had was with the two highlight shades (the two lightest.)</li>
            <li>Red Carpet Ready, Sultry Smokey and Mauve Ombre.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that I had to really stick my nail in between the clasp to open the palette.</li>
            <li>But the &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; base colors are nice, and I do like that some of those are more shimmery.</li>
            <li>I do want to be clear, though- without a decent primer (I used Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion in Eden)</li>
            <li>This is a pretty compact kit - it is long, but compact -  ,will fit in small cosmetic/ladies bag.  </li>
            <li>I like that a few have a bit of sparkle for special occasion.</li>
            <li>It goes from light colors (left), goes to mediums, to dark, back to medium again.</li>
            <li>I actually was surprised with the quality of these shadows!</li>
            <li>Most of these shades work well for me, though some of them basically look the same as each other, so the palette probably could have been half the size.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like dust and there is barely any color</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so when she put this on there was a subtle hint of color where she wanted it since they aren&#x27;t bright.</li>
            <li>And yet, the combination you come up with can also have a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>The light colors are subtle and don&#x27;t provide a lot of coverage, just a hint of color/sparkle.</li>
            <li>One end is soft and decent for adding all over color and the angled sponge end is useful to blend out the corners for a dramatic look with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has made a creamy eye shadow palette with a decent mix of matte and shimmery pink, gray, and brown based colors</li>
            <li>I only use a few on the colors - the first and last 3 on the palette.</li>
            <li>For the price and quality, I believe that this is a decent mid range palette for those starting out and not wanting to spend over twice as much on other palettes that are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this pallet.</li>
            <li> I will venture into all the colors once I get over my love for the purple ones.</li>
            <li> I think this is best for a &amp;#34;daytime smokey&amp;#34; look for light to medium skin tones, or more natural looks if you have darker skin.</li>
            <li> Love this palette.</li>
            <li> I was glad,</li>
            <li> Despite my aging eye area, I was hoping for more oomph.</li>
            <li> They blend OK, too.</li>
            <li> love the color.</li>
            <li> and there were a lot more matte colors than shimmery ones which I prefer.</li>
            <li> and I mostly wear it to work and on the weekends but can still create some smokier effects with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Nude 1 palette of colors more than Nude 2.</li>
            <li> It still works well with my skin tone, but I would use this palette more for fall/winter because of the colors.</li>
            <li> I am sure the colors will be richer when using a primer, but I have not had a change to replenish my supply as of yet.</li>
            <li> I prefer the sponge end for better application.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette are lovely and work well for me.  </li>
            <li> It would have added more of a &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; department/makeup store feel.</li>
            <li> The colors are so opaque, and i love the texture.</li>
            <li> The darker colors are very rich.</li>
            <li> By contrast, the deeper shades are all nicely pigmented, and some are even on the rich, buttery side that puts them within shouting distance of UD shadows.</li>
            <li> Because of my fair skin complexion, I always need to wear cool or neutral colors and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> If you want to do anything more detailed that that, well, you&#x27;re probably more skilled than I am, so it could turn out</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually more light pinkish.</li>
            <li> * More &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; available online</li>
            <li> Compared to Nude 1 which has two perfect middle blending tones (a warm one and a neutral one) that I just love, I definitely prefer the Nude 1 more :)</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re an over 40 like me, you&#x27;ll be fine with this palette.</li>
            <li> the half length mirror is great!</li>
            <li> This is a solid palette for everyday use, GREAT for the price, but too powdery to be awesome.</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> colors go on smooth and have lasted all day for me, even with my allergies.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow is smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> - the cheap ones fall apart in my make-up bag after some use  </li>
            <li> Not quite there, but still not bad at all for a $20 palette (that you can easily get on sale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> But overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a fantastic palette of colors that will end up being a good edition to my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> A variety of more natural looks can be obtained with this 10-color palette with a mixture of matte and more shiny colors.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any skin rash/irritation, but again my skin is not sensitive, so I am not the best judge to see if it suits sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic drug store palette, I can thoroughly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic drug store palette, I can thoroughly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> The product is good, especially for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li> I think the variety of colors in this palette is decent and will compliment most cool skin tones.</li>
            <li> go on pretty well - no dragging, no settling in fine lines (I did use a primer beforehand.)</li>
            <li> Applying it over my eye primer, it last all day :) Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly better on the lid, and it&#x27;s OK as an inner corner highlight.</li>
            <li> I debated returning it, but figured &#x27;what can happen with eyeshadow&#x27;, wiped them all off quickly, and went on my way.</li>
            <li> Most are very pigmented and go on beautifully, with a natural finish especially when used with eye shadow primer (I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance).</li>
            <li> I prefer a clean more natural look so the descriptions aren&#x27;t anything I would use, but may be helpful for others.</li>
            <li> The shimmer is very wearable, catches and reflects a bit of light but doesn&#x27;t give a metallic effect.</li>
            <li> So far I have my favorite colors (the purple ones)</li>
            <li> The one I have most issue with is the light vanilla color on the very left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be fun experimenting with these range of shades for daytime and nighttime wear.</li>
            <li> Lovely colors with neutral to cool undertones, mostly matte, a few shimmers.</li>
            <li> the palette opens up completely flat which is nice to hold and</li>
            <li> all right</li>
            <li> they are just right.</li>
            <li> In case this is helpful--I have light/medium Asian skin with neutral undertones and tend to look better in cool colors.</li>
            <li> - I mean the mirror is really really good - there is where brands like L&#x27;Oreal make the difference in each fine details.     </li>
            <li> Take note though that when they say &amp;#34;nude,&amp;#34; they really aren&#x27;t kidding!</li>
            <li> (Btw, points to L&#x27;Oreal for making a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palette that darker-skinned women could reasonably call nude!)</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> though, to try this L&#x27;Oreal palette, the first being that it was nudes, and</li>
            <li> Even the shimmeriest colors in this palette aren&#x27;t anything as glitzy as the most sedate Urban Decay shimmers.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be using a lot more of the lighter colors to get a proper effect, and they may not make it til the end of the day.</li>

            <li> (I think this palette definitely has more of a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tone to it than &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; so buy accordingly to your skin tone).</li>
            <li> I was expecting the leftmost color to be more of a pearly white</li>
            <li> Usually, a palette is completely warm or neutral or cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nude 1 every day so far and prefer the two middle blending tones in the Nude 1 over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC).</li>

            <li> I did swatches for all ten colors, and the first one is so light that no matter how many times I dipped my finger into it, it simply doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> is of pretty high quality</li>
            <li> did try to get accurate color swatches, but the truth is, until you see any shadow up close, your monitor is going to fool you (ask Sephora for all the stuff I&#x27;ve sent back when it didn&#x27;t look at all like what the pictures showed it to be.)</li>

            <li> Same goes for brows - the eye shadow, applied lightly to trimmed eyebrows, works well to keep some means for expression on my face.  </li>
            <li> These colors are fabulous layered over Neutrogena&#x27;s Crease Proof Eyeshadow in Lasting Taupe (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Crease-Proof-Shadow-Lasting/dp/B00ADRHABW).</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t too powerful and loud</li>
            <li> The darker shadows last all day, but the light ones can be a PITA and tend to disappear when blending.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not there in real life, or maybe my eyeballs are just swatched out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will do a basic job as nicely as anything you&#x27;re likely to find at Walgreen&#x27;s.darker shadows last all day, but the light ones can be a PITA and tend to disappear when blending.</li>

            <li> it’s a very wearable every day palette</li>
            <li> I have very hooded eyes, and I have not have had any issues with creasing, even without a primer.</li>
            <li> But it might really bother others.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping</li>

            <li> What works best for me is a 2-shade look--say, a light base all over and a darker shade on the lid and/or crease.</li>
            <li> This palette offers a wide range of colors, so anyone should be able to find or blend the right color to enhance the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this with a nyx eyeshadow primer and even though I live in hot, humid Hawaii, my eye makeup really lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is a quality eye shadow collection of subtle shades which will look natural and appealing on most, if not all, eye colors.</li>
            <li> I can apply more for a smoky eye look or a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> Relatedly, the packaging is elegant and sturdy, and should last quite a while, too.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal always makes high quality products and this set is no exception.</li>
            <li> especially the light pink ones- numbers 1 and 8) and need to be reapplied occasionally or applied over and over again to reach desired pigment.</li>
            <li> 10 highly pigmented shades curated to blend harmoniously  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a primer/shadow stick that is a very subtle shade on its own but makes a perfect base layer for these shadows--velvety and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wow! 10 shades to choose from and a brush in a mirrored compact!</li>
            <li> The shadows are very buttery and soft and it doesn&#x27;t get too powdery when you dip your brush in.</li>
            <li> Speaking of size, it is a pretty big palette--I think bigger than all the other popular nude palettes out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors in this palette are numbered 1 through 10 from left to right.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t particularly look that way in these swatches after several tries, so maybe it&#x27;s time to flush my camera and get something more HD.</li>

            <li> But that light shade and the other one both tend to be a tad chalky.</li>
            <li> Six shades are matte and the other four shades have a light sheen.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see varying earth tones along with a few pinkish/purple shades since that makes my green eyes pop with those colors.</li>
            <li> The colors were a little more sheer than expected, but they are easily buildable.</li>
            <li> They go on a little lighter than they look, easily allowing me to create a natural look.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a wide array of darker hues and it was easy enough for her.</li>
            <li> only real issue I had was with the two highlight shades (the two lightest.)</li>
            <li> Red Carpet Ready, Sultry Smokey and Mauve Ombre.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that I had to really stick my nail in between the clasp to open the palette.</li>
            <li> But the &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; base colors are nice, and I do like that some of those are more shimmery.</li>
            <li> I do want to be clear, though- without a decent primer (I used Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion in Eden)</li>
            <li> This is a pretty compact kit - it is long, but compact -  ,will fit in small cosmetic/ladies bag.  </li>
            <li> I like that a few have a bit of sparkle for special occasion.</li>
            <li> It goes from light colors (left), goes to mediums, to dark, back to medium again.</li>
            <li> I actually was surprised with the quality of these shadows!</li>
            <li> Most of these shades work well for me, though some of them basically look the same as each other, so the palette probably could have been half the size.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like dust and there is barely any color</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so when she put this on there was a subtle hint of color where she wanted it since they aren&#x27;t bright.</li>
            <li> And yet, the combination you come up with can also have a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> The light colors are subtle and don&#x27;t provide a lot of coverage, just a hint of color/sparkle.</li>
            <li> One end is soft and decent for adding all over color and the angled sponge end is useful to blend out the corners for a dramatic look with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has made a creamy eye shadow palette with a decent mix of matte and shimmery pink, gray, and brown based colors</li>
            <li> I only use a few on the colors - the first and last 3 on the palette.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality, I believe that this is a decent mid range palette for those starting out and not wanting to spend over twice as much on other palettes that are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly eighty years old, and the usual eyeliner is beyond my abilities, so I just brush on dark brown or gray to give these old eyes some definition.  </li>
            <li> So far I used the dark shades</li>
            <li> * Eye-designer brush that is long with two tips: brush and sponge  * Sturdy case which should hold up well</li>
            <li> and I would rather just pull the two sides open like my other palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried one small angled liner brush with soft plastic bristles--the powder wouldn&#x27;t stay on it at all.</li>
            <li> The colors are darker than what I expected for a &#x27;nude&#x27; palette though.</li>
            <li> these colors are not as pigmented as expected (</li>
            <li> Of course, being a drugstore palette, the other end just has to have a sponge tip applicator.</li>
            <li> Of course, being a drugstore palette, the other end just has to have a sponge tip applicator.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain the minerals that make other shadows glitter.</li>
            <li> The rest are too dark.</li>
            <li> Unless the pans are extremely shallow, it should last me until the end times.</li>
            <li> The palette is missing a dark charcoal or black color in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is that these shadows are verrrry powdery and just a little patchy.</li>
            <li> I tend to get a little nervous around palettes that aren&#x27;t all matte.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it to include a very dark color for those of us who use very dark shadows as eyeliner, to blend out eyeliner, or to set eyeliner.</li>
            <li> For everyday use, these are well pigmented and deposit a lot of color.</li>
            <li> My only gripe was that when it came, the safety sticker was broken.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a little clumsy, like me, you MIGHT end up with some on your shirt, some on the sink, and a brown mess on your lids.</li>
            <li> But at least the brush end is useable, and I don&#x27;t recall ever having that experience with any drug store shadow implements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But at least the brush end is useable, and I don&#x27;t recall ever having that experience with any drug store shadow implements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can know how to apply shadow the way makeup artists know how  If you like to accent your eyes, but want the look to be subtle</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out because other eyeshadow palettes are very expensive and this had the colors I wanted</li>
            <li> /&gt;And you know, that disappointed me a little.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with the palette is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, during shipping, one of the colors burst all over everything</li>
            <li> brush isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> brush isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush that is included with this palette is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I think these colors can also be used as a base or blusher depending on the shade of one&#x27;s skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These colors by L&#x27;Oreal are all a shade of beige/brown and are meant to be applied as eye shadow.  Instructions for different types of looks come with the palette.  I think these colors can also be used as a base or blusher depending on the shade of one&#x27;s skin.  It is nicely packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal always makes high quality products and this set is no exception. Take note though that when they say &amp;#34;nude,&amp;#34; they really aren&#x27;t kidding! I found that all of these colors were very sheer. Also, maybe it&#x27;s just me or how I was using them, but with some of the colors, how they look on the palette is very different from how they look on my face. For example, I was wearing a outfit with some grays in it, so chose a color that seemed gray on the palette, but it ended up looking more purple. So it will take some experimenting to get used to how all the colors will work with my face. But the &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; base colors are nice, and I do like that some of those are more shimmery. Overall I think this is a fantastic palette of colors that will end up being a good edition to my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this pallet. I bought it after seeing a tutorial on you tube and she used this pallet. So far I have my favorite colors (the purple ones) but all of them look great- I will venture into all the colors once I get over my love for the purple ones. It goes amazing with my brown eyes and it&#x27;s a nice quality shadow. Applying it over my eye primer, it last all day :) Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> This is a pretty compact kit - it is long, but compact -  ,will fit in small cosmetic/ladies bag.  The mirror include in the box is of pretty high quality - I mean the mirror is really really good - there is where brands like L&#x27;Oreal make the difference in each fine details.     I did not have any skin rash/irritation, but again my skin is not sensitive, so I am not the best judge to see if it suits sensitive skin.  So far I used the dark shades and I got very good results.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, go on a bit darker than I would prefer.  I&#x27;m still trying to work on my application of this product to get the desired look that I want.</li>
            <li> I have begun to use eye shadow for almost everything - brows and eyeliner.  I&#x27;m nearly eighty years old, and the usual eyeliner is beyond my abilities, so I just brush on dark brown or gray to give these old eyes some definition.  Same goes for brows - the eye shadow, applied lightly to trimmed eyebrows, works well to keep some means for expression on my face.  This palette offers a wide range of colors, so anyone should be able to find or blend the right color to enhance the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a solid palette for everyday use, GREAT for the price, but too powdery to be awesome. Lovely colors with neutral to cool undertones, mostly matte, a few shimmers. I think this is best for a &amp;#34;daytime smokey&amp;#34; look for light to medium skin tones, or more natural looks if you have darker skin. (Btw, points to L&#x27;Oreal for making a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palette that darker-skinned women could reasonably call nude!) I got this on sale for $12, a steal. Good choice if you&#x27;re looking to try some shades in this color family (taupe/mauve/plum/dark brown) and don&#x27;t want to shell out for high-end stuff quite yet.  The biggest drawback is that these shadows are verrrry powdery and just a little patchy. If you&#x27;re a little clumsy, like me, you MIGHT end up with some on your shirt, some on the sink, and a brown mess on your lids. I&#x27;ve found the texture too powdery for very detailed work, even with primer. I tried one small angled liner brush with soft plastic bristles--the powder wouldn&#x27;t stay on it at all. What works best for me is a 2-shade look--say, a light base all over and a darker shade on the lid and/or crease. If you want to do anything more detailed that that, well, you&#x27;re probably more skilled than I am, so it could turn out all right ;-)  In case this is helpful--I have light/medium Asian skin with neutral undertones and tend to look better in cool colors. Most of these shades work well for me, though some of them basically look the same as each other, so the palette probably could have been half the size.  Speaking of size, it is a pretty big palette--I think bigger than all the other popular nude palettes out there. Definitely won&#x27;t be taking it anywhere if space is a concern. Unless the pans are extremely shallow, it should last me until the end times. Relatedly, the packaging is elegant and sturdy, and should last quite a while, too.  TIP: These colors are fabulous layered over Neutrogena&#x27;s Crease Proof Eyeshadow in Lasting Taupe (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Crease-Proof-Shadow-Lasting/dp/B00ADRHABW). It&#x27;s a primer/shadow stick that is a very subtle shade on its own but makes a perfect base layer for these shadows--velvety and easy to use. As a primer it prevents fallout and keeps the powder shadow in place all day.</li>
            <li> Love this palette. I was looking for nude color palette but I still wanted some options for pink/ burgundy/ purple. And this product met all my needs. The colors aren&#x27;t too powerful and loud they are just right. Great for Olive complexion skin. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tend to get a little nervous around palettes that aren&#x27;t all matte. That&#x27;s cause when you hit the big 4-0, everything sparkly, shiny or glittery tends not to be your best friend, particularly around the eye area. I was glad, though, to try this L&#x27;Oreal palette, the first being that it was nudes, and what harm can nudes do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My instincts were correct. Even the shimmeriest colors in this palette aren&#x27;t anything as glitzy as the most sedate Urban Decay shimmers. L&#x27;Oreal is a conservative company, and they&#x27;re not gonna go hog-wild and scare the horses with disco ball eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know, that disappointed me a little. Despite my aging eye area, I was hoping for more oomph. There&#x27;s not one color here that made me go &#x27;Oh my gawd! I can&#x27;t wear that!&#x27; If you&#x27;re an over 40 like me, you&#x27;ll be fine with this palette. In fact, it may not put you to sleep, but you&#x27;ll definitely bit a bit drowsy. Maybe we&#x27;re all just nuded out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So putting my whining aside that this palette was almost too neutral, for a drug store palette, it is very nice. You can smoky eye yourself into the next millennium. Tons of transition colors, and as you can see, they meld, colorwise, very nicely into one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue I had was with the two highlight shades (the two lightest.) I did swatches for all ten colors, and the first one is so light that no matter how many times I dipped my finger into it, it simply doesn&#x27;t show up. It&#x27;s slightly better on the lid, and it&#x27;s OK as an inner corner highlight. But that light shade and the other one both tend to be a tad chalky. By contrast, the deeper shades are all nicely pigmented, and some are even on the rich, buttery side that puts them within shouting distance of UD shadows. Not quite there, but still not bad at all for a $20 palette (that you can easily get on sale.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on pretty well - no dragging, no settling in fine lines (I did use a primer beforehand.) They blend OK, too. The darker shadows last all day, but the light ones can be a PITA and tend to disappear when blending. You&#x27;ll be using a lot more of the lighter colors to get a proper effect, and they may not make it til the end of the day. Just be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush isn&#x27;t bad either. Of course, being a drugstore palette, the other end just has to have a sponge tip applicator. But at least the brush end is useable, and I don&#x27;t recall ever having that experience with any drug store shadow implements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try to get accurate color swatches, but the truth is, until you see any shadow up close, your monitor is going to fool you (ask Sephora for all the stuff I&#x27;ve sent back when it didn&#x27;t look at all like what the pictures showed it to be.) To give you a more accurate measure, I am fair, and the skin on my forearm is very fair. It doesn&#x27;t particularly look that way in these swatches after several tries, so maybe it&#x27;s time to flush my camera and get something more HD. (And don&#x27;t ask me what that patch is on my forearm in one of the swatches. It&#x27;s not there in real life, or maybe my eyeballs are just swatched out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good, basic drug store palette, I can thoroughly recommend this one. You&#x27;re not going to be bowled over, but if you just need something that works, and you&#x27;re not a kid anymore, you don&#x27;t have to fear that it&#x27;s not an all-matte palette. It will do a basic job as nicely as anything you&#x27;re likely to find at Walgreen&#x27;s.darker shadows last all day, but the light ones can be a PITA and tend to disappear when blending.

            <li> I only use a few on the colors - the first and last 3 on the palette. The rest are too dark. I thought they were lighter. It&#x27;s nice shadow. It doesn&#x27;t contain the minerals that make other shadows glitter.</li>
            <li> love the color. smooth</li>
            <li> This nude collection has a nice range of colors which gives me a lot of flexibility to play around with. The colors are darker than what I expected for a &#x27;nude&#x27; palette though. I like that a few have a bit of sparkle for special occasion. For everyday use, these are well pigmented and deposit a lot of color.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy having this product</li>
            <li> A variety of more natural looks can be obtained with this 10-color palette with a mixture of matte and more shiny colors.  And yet, the combination you come up with can also have a more dramatic look.  A couple of examples on how to apply to get a couple of looks are provided on the back of the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors go on smooth and have lasted all day for me, even with my allergies.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out because other eyeshadow palettes are very expensive and this had the colors I wanted and there were a lot more matte colors than shimmery ones which I prefer.The shadows are very buttery and soft and it doesn&#x27;t get too powdery when you dip your brush in. I use this with a nyx eyeshadow primer and even though I live in hot, humid Hawaii, my eye makeup really lasts all day. This is now my go to palette.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nude collection of shadows. The colors are beautiful and flattering and would work for most skin types. For my skin color (medium beige/NC 25 or NC 30) it’s a very wearable every day palette and I mostly wear it to work and on the weekends but can still create some smokier effects with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice combination of matte and shimmer shadows (more shimmer than matte) that come in mostly warm tones. The shimmer is very wearable, catches and reflects a bit of light but doesn&#x27;t give a metallic effect. Usually, a palette is completely warm or neutral or cool. I like the mix and this one palette does almost everything from highlight, to medium blending, to shading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only a couple of issues with this pallet which I deducted a star for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush that comes with the palette is useless. I never bothered with it and threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shadows vary in pigmentation and texture. Most are very pigmented and go on beautifully, with a natural finish especially when used with eye shadow primer (I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance). The lighter shadows are powdery and not as pigmented. The one I have most issue with is the light vanilla color on the very left. It goes on like dust and there is barely any color payoff.&lt;br /&gt;3. The palette is missing a dark charcoal or black color in my opinion. It goes from light colors (left), goes to mediums, to dark, back to medium again. I would have preferred it to include a very dark color for those of us who use very dark shadows as eyeliner, to blend out eyeliner, or to set eyeliner. If you do this, you&#x27;re going to have to settle for a brown or greyish mauve color or use a separate shadow for that. For me, lacking that color makes the palette incomplete.&lt;br /&gt;4. I like the Nude 1 palette of colors more than Nude 2. The Nude 1 has more golds and browns whereas Nude 2 has more rose, greys, plums, and mauves. It still works well with my skin tone, but I would use this palette more for fall/winter because of the colors. Compared to Nude 1 which has two perfect middle blending tones (a warm one and a neutral one) that I just love, I definitely prefer the Nude 1 more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall this is a very enjoyable palette that is easy to use and easy on the wallet. I&#x27;ve used this only a couple time this week since it&#x27;s spring/summer where I&#x27;m at. I&#x27;ve been using the Nude 1 every day so far and prefer the two middle blending tones in the Nude 1 over anything I previously own (MUG and MAC). At this price, I don&#x27;t mind tossing one of these palettes into my gym bag for on the go.e of the colors.

            <li> The product is good, especially for a drugstore product. The colors were a little more sheer than expected, but they are easily buildable. I have very hooded eyes, and I have not have had any issues with creasing, even without a primer. I am sure the colors will be richer when using a primer, but I have not had a change to replenish my supply as of yet. My only gripe was that when it came, the safety sticker was broken. I debated returning it, but figured &#x27;what can happen with eyeshadow&#x27;, wiped them all off quickly, and went on my way. But it might really bother others.</li>
            <li> Wow! 10 shades to choose from and a brush in a mirrored compact! Six shades are matte and the other four shades have a light sheen. I was happy to see varying earth tones along with a few pinkish/purple shades since that makes my green eyes pop with those colors. The eye shadow is smooth to apply. I prefer the matte colors because of my age, but will use the sheen colors on occasion. The brush has a sponge end and a brush end. I prefer the sponge end for better application. The backside of the compact says there are 1001 ways to wear nude (eye shadow I assume), and leads you to try their &amp;#34;Makeup Genius App&amp;#34; It also shows (4) various looks: Glamour Undocore (?), Red Carpet Ready, Sultry Smokey and Mauve Ombre. I prefer a clean more natural look so the descriptions aren&#x27;t anything I would use, but may be helpful for others. Overall, recommended.</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancome eye shadow, so this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried L&#x27;Oreal eye shadow.  I found that this makeup wears well all day without leaving crease marks on my eyelids or fading.  The colors in this palette are lovely and work well for me.  Because of my fair skin complexion, I always need to wear cool or neutral colors and these fit the bill.  They go on a little lighter than they look, easily allowing me to create a natural look.  I can apply more for a smoky eye look or a more dramatic look.  I prefer to use my own eye shadow brushes, but the applicator that comes with the set is of good quality for those who prefer to use it.  This is a versatile palette that I have been happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have noticed that I now get crease marks on my eyelids with this eyeshadow after having worn it all day.  Not a deal breaker, but I just thought I&#x27;d throw it out there.</li>
            <li> I actually was surprised with the quality of these shadows! L&#x27;Oreal has made a creamy eye shadow palette with a decent mix of matte and shimmery pink, gray, and brown based colors (I think this palette definitely has more of a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tone to it than &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; so buy accordingly to your skin tone). I do want to be clear, though- without a decent primer (I used Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion in Eden) these colors are not as pigmented as expected (especially the light pink ones- numbers 1 and 8) and need to be reapplied occasionally or applied over and over again to reach desired pigment. Without using a primer, the colors all blend together and wear off and you won&#x27;t get the defined look that is so popular these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors in this palette are numbered 1 through 10 from left to right. I think it would have been amazing if L&#x27;Oreal had named these colors! It would have added more of a &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; department/makeup store feel. For the price and quality, I believe that this is a decent mid range palette for those starting out and not wanting to spend over twice as much on other palettes that are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that is included with this palette is not too bad. One end is soft and decent for adding all over color and the angled sponge end is useful to blend out the corners for a dramatic look with the darker shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly liked the packaging... the palette opens up completely flat which is nice to hold and the half length mirror is great! I didn&#x27;t like that I had to really stick my nail in between the clasp to open the palette. Doing this chips my nail polish and I would rather just pull the two sides open like my other palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great palette for beginners or for mixing with higher end colors to achieve your desired looks. I think the variety of colors in this palette is decent and will compliment most cool skin tones. Just start naming your colors, L&#x27;Oreal and you&#x27;ll be on your way!your way!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the leftmost color to be more of a pearly white but it&#x27;s actually more light pinkish. and that&#x27;s on a VERY bright laptop screen. That said, there&#x27;s a good range of options in this - good bang for my buck, in my opinion. this product is great if you&#x27;re indecisive because it gives you a lot of complementary colors to choose from, and you can even blend them together to get more of a range than that. The light colors are subtle and don&#x27;t provide a lot of coverage, just a hint of color/sparkle. The darker colors are very rich.</li>
            <li> The colors are so opaque, and i love the texture. It&#x27;s like a creamy powdery texture.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she likes the various colors. They go well with her skin. Unfortunately, during shipping, one of the colors burst all over everything so when we opened the package we had tan dust all over everything, so keep an eye on your packaging when it arrives. It comes with a wide array of darker hues and it was easy enough for her. She doesn&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so when she put this on there was a subtle hint of color where she wanted it since they aren&#x27;t bright. Stayed on nicely for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Great Product...Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> This is a quality eye shadow collection of subtle shades which will look natural and appealing on most, if not all, eye colors.
