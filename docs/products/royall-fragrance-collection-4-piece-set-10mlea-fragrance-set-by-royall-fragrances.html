            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-&amp;#62;Musk - The best out of the bunch and guess which one broke.</li>
            <li>They make great travel items and  they are a perfect &#x27;try&#x27; size.  </li>
            <li>Just as advertised and the service was great.</li>
            <li>Great sample sizes.</li>
            <li>Item shipped on time and in great shape.  </li>
            <li>great way to try these fragrances.</li>
            <li>Great size for trial.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Royal Lime was introduced to Brooks Brothers in 1960 to great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Lyme and Musk are very nice, timeless scents.  </li>
            <li>Loved them.</li>
            <li>I get to see which one smells good or what I think smells</li>
            <li>The fragrance selections were good.</li>
            <li>Love this company&#x27;s catalog!</li>
            <li>Plenty of nice smells in here.</li>
            <li>I wish this had the Mandarin in it, but the scents were nice.</li>
            <li>A nice woodsy scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a good way to sample these fine colognes but the price for what I got was steep.</li>
            <li>Delicious fragrance collection, classy bottles too.</li>
            <li>I really love the lime fragrance, very clean and nice, but I already knew I liked it.</li>
            <li>The Muske is a good musk smell, it just reminds me too much of my dad&#x27;s Jovan for Men to be wearable for me :-).</li>
            <li>I should have read the fine print re:</li>
            <li>The Amazon box smelled fantastic, though.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap soap.</li>
            <li>Very nice and different from todays variety of scents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, Royall has moved its production to the United States, and the product is now quite inferior to the original.  </li>
            <li>Each of the scents is so unique, yet all are pleasing.</li>
            <li>All of the scents are nice, simple fragrances with Royall Rugby smelling the most \\&quot;modern\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I will buy the full sizes</li>
            <li>Labels come off pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Company replaced quickly.  </li>
            <li>but luckily everything was ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this in the mail, and gotta say I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>I liked them all, especially the Lyme and Muske.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>so there is about a month&#x27;s worth of fragrances here.  </li>
            <li>These small bottles will make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>The vetiver was probably my least favorite, but it was still a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Starts out VERY lime, which mellows quickly.</li>
            <li>is exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of this cologne and variability of the fragrances, but these are extremely small bottles, guess I should have paid better attention to the ad.</li>
            <li>One bottle completely empty (evaporated) appears to be a manufacturing problem with the loose fitting top</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The only con is that not all of their fragrances are available or included.</li>
            <li>Like a very dated, inexpensive hygiene product from the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On closer inspection has a very exotic, complex profile that is undermined by too much alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a classic &amp;#34;old barbershop&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>Finishes like a cooler, calmer version of your classic spicy aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality of product is high, but overpriced for the quantity.</li>
            <li>- I think it is rated high though.</li>
            <li>Very robust and masculine.</li>
            <li>They actually have interesting scent profiles, but suffer from too much alcohol and not enough essential</li>
            <li>Expected at lweast one original fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Vetiver I classify as an older, mature scent that brings you back to the days of barber shops and straight razor shaves.  </li>
            <li>It did help me decide what to buy when I was ready to purchase the larger sizes.</li>
            <li>I think old man scent but get away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vetiver is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>Aromas did not seem as vibrant and catchy as when sampled at a local Brooks Brothers.</li>
            <li>With the rise in traditional barbering, and with it, the rediscovery of legacy toiletries companies like this should seize the opportunity to reinvigorate these classic brands.</li>
            <li>It seems that the only genuine Royall product left, actually originating in Bermuda, is in these assortments of tiny bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small package with a huge dividend.</li>
            <li>One bottle was only half full on arrival ....</li>
            <li>Barely usable.</li>
            <li>Glad it was one of the four not all of the four that was broken.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rugby is very woody, dark, even pungent.</li>
            <li>I had already tried the lime, but the other 3 were new to me.</li>

            <li> Based on some of the reviews, I was a little worried that one or more of the bottles would arrive broken</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to purchase other Royall products, especially the Vetiver and Rugby.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste this stuff by putting it on your clothing, as it won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> One bottle in the package was empty.</li>
            <li> Lots of sandalwood, traces of patchouli, bitter citus and balanced spiciness.</li>
            <li> One bottle was empty due to evaporization.</li>
            <li> I think my box had been sitting around for a long time as one of the green bottle necks had been partially dissolved creating a greenish cloudy quality to the liquid of one of the fragrances.</li>
            <li> Plus, a little goes a long way with cologne.</li>
            <li> The other three just didn&#x27;t appeal to me at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my bottle of Royall Rugby broke during shipment, which is the one I was really looking forward to using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-&amp;#62;Rugby - smells like a cheap polo (green bottle-reg) but not too bad.</li>
            <li> little bottles with heavy metal crown caps.</li>
            <li> The box it came in was dusty - which leads me to believe that it may have been in inventory a long time.</li>
            <li> I understand they were small</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d get a small sampler.</li>
            <li> Although the bottles are small, you get about 5 uses out of each one</li>
            <li> Kinda small for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes the bottles are small, but it&#x27;s a sampler...</li>
            <li> Lyme, Vetiver and Muske all seem to have a base that is a bit powdery and old fashioned smelling -- which is completely not a problem!</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, but I got at least five uses out of each one and it introduced me to a portion of the Royall line.</li>
            <li> I suspect that when these are gone, you&#x27;ll be stuck with the US-made stuff, which is NOT the same product, but is a cheapened, one-dimensional disappointment.</li>
            <li> but they r REALLY small!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to know with just one spritz, but you don&#x27;t want to buy a whole expensive bottle either.</li>
            <li> Some what expensive for the Volume you receive with this packaging</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive to buy them all.  </li>
            <li> I was so mad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just as advertised and the service was great. Thanks</li>
            <li> I think my box had been sitting around for a long time as one of the green bottle necks had been partially dissolved creating a greenish cloudy quality to the liquid of one of the fragrances. I really love the lime fragrance, very clean and nice, but I already knew I liked it. The other three just didn&#x27;t appeal to me at all. I&#x27;ll stick with the Royall Lyme &amp; Bay Rhum.</li>
            <li> Expected at lweast one original fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great sample sizes. Love this company&#x27;s catalog! Will order again</li>
            <li> Its not musky at all!! Talcum powder-like smell. Barely usable. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Plenty of nice smells in here. I had already tried the lime, but the other 3 were new to me. The vetiver was probably my least favorite, but it was still a nice smell.</li>
            <li> One bottle completely empty (evaporated) appears to be a manufacturing problem with the loose fitting top</li>
            <li> One bottle was only half full on arrival .... Company replaced quickly.  Quality of product is high, but overpriced for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I should have read the fine print re: the size of the bottles.  I understand they were small but they r REALLY small!  It is a good way to sample these fine colognes but the price for what I got was steep. Four 10ml/.29 oz btles for $31.59.  Item shipped on time and in great shape.  Will definitely buy from shipper if need be in the future.</li>
            <li> Small package with a huge dividend.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these sets of made-in-Bermuda Royall fragrances a couple of years ago.  The assortment I purchased was slightly different, containing the Bay Rhum, Lyme, Mandarin, and Muske varieties.  I liked them all, especially the Lyme and Muske.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Royall has moved its production to the United States, and the product is now quite inferior to the original.  It seems that the only genuine Royall product left, actually originating in Bermuda, is in these assortments of tiny bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is--get it while you can!  I suspect that when these are gone, you&#x27;ll be stuck with the US-made stuff, which is NOT the same product, but is a cheapened, one-dimensional disappointment.</li>
            <li> Loved them. great way to try these fragrances. I will buy the full sizes</li>
            <li> The box it came in was dusty - which leads me to believe that it may have been in inventory a long time. Aromas did not seem as vibrant and catchy as when sampled at a local Brooks Brothers. I&#x27;m just saying.</li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews, I was a little worried that one or more of the bottles would arrive broken but luckily everything was ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for travel.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Delicious fragrance collection, classy bottles too.</li>
            <li> Some what expensive for the Volume you receive with this packaging but you can decide which you will want to buy in the future.</li>
            <li> The only con is that not all of their fragrances are available or included. It did help me decide what to buy when I was ready to purchase the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> They make great travel items and  they are a perfect &#x27;try&#x27; size.  It&#x27;s impossible to know with just one spritz, but you don&#x27;t want to buy a whole expensive bottle either.</li>
            <li> ...  so I thought I&#x27;d get a small sampler. I wish this had the Mandarin in it, but the scents were nice. Great size for trial. Definitely worth the money. The order for me is: Vetiver, Lyme, Rugby, and Muske. The Muske is a good musk smell, it just reminds me too much of my dad&#x27;s Jovan for Men to be wearable for me :-).</li>
            <li> We stumbled across this brand and like it but it was too expensive to buy them all.  These small bottles will make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, but I got at least five uses out of each one and it introduced me to a portion of the Royall line. All of the scents are nice, simple fragrances with Royall Rugby smelling the most \\&quot;modern\\&quot;. Lyme, Vetiver and Muske all seem to have a base that is a bit powdery and old fashioned smelling -- which is completely not a problem!</li>
            <li> Although the bottles are small, you get about 5 uses out of each one so there is about a month&#x27;s worth of fragrances here.  This newer sampler includes Lyme, Musk, Vetiver, and Rugby.  I purchased because of the last two. The Lyme and Musk are very nice, timeless scents.  The Vetiver I classify as an older, mature scent that brings you back to the days of barber shops and straight razor shaves.  Very nice and different from todays variety of scents.  I really wanted to try the Rugby before purchasing a large bottle as I have been unable to find it for anywhere near the price of the other Royall products yet.  A nice woodsy scent.  Don&#x27;t waste this stuff by putting it on your clothing, as it won&#x27;t last very long.  It seems to work with your body heat to keep up the scent.  This is the same for all the Royall products here.  I am definitely going to purchase other Royall products, especially the Vetiver and Rugby.  I already use the Lyme during the summer.</li>
            <li> One bottle was empty due to evaporization.</li>
            <li> One bottle in the package was empty.</li>
            <li> Kinda small for the price. Great quality. Recommend it for travel or a stocking stuffer. Not too shabby at all</li>
            <li> I wanted these as samples. I get to see which one smells good or what I think smells good.&lt;br /&gt;One came broke. I was so mad. As soon as I opened the box I could smell it. Glad it was one of the four not all of the four that was broken. I had to wash them all off. Labels come off pretty easy. Here is my result of my smell test:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62;Velvetier ahh yuk - I think it is rated high though. I didn&#x27;t like it. I think old man scent but get away. *&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62;Musk - The best out of the bunch and guess which one broke. Could still smell the bottle though. Reminds me of an avon log cabin or english leather muske (eng. leath. musk -smells different and powdery like) ****&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62;Lyme - Does smell like lime. Smells like shaving cream. I smell that and think shaving cream smell. I like it. ***&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62;Rugby - smells like a cheap polo (green bottle-reg) but not too bad. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neat little bottles with heavy metal crown caps.</li>
            <li> Bottles are a lot smaller than you might  think.</li>
            <li> The containers were smaller than I anticipated. But , then again, I had no idea how big a &amp;#34;ml&amp;#34; is. The fragrance selections were good. Not all to my liking, but that&#x27;s what samplers are for.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail, and gotta say I was pretty excited. Each of the scents is so unique, yet all are pleasing. Yes the bottles are small, but it&#x27;s a sampler... Plus, a little goes a long way with cologne. Unfortunately my bottle of Royall Rugby broke during shipment, which is the one I was really looking forward to using. The Amazon box smelled fantastic, though.</li>
            <li> Terrific sampler package</li>
            <li> Simply put, these smell dated to any male under the age of 40. They actually have interesting scent profiles, but suffer from too much alcohol and not enough essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime is a classic &amp;#34;old barbershop&amp;#34; scent. Starts out VERY lime, which mellows quickly. Finishes like a cooler, calmer version of your classic spicy aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rugby is very woody, dark, even pungent. Lots of sandalwood, traces of patchouli, bitter citus and balanced spiciness. Very robust and masculine. Use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musk is exactly what you would expect. Some where between Obsession and Jovan Musk for men. On closer inspection has a very exotic, complex profile that is undermined by too much alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver is my least favorite. Smells like cheap soap. Like a very dated, inexpensive hygiene product from the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These product have a distinguished legacy. Royal Lime was introduced to Brooks Brothers in 1960 to great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scent have potential for a second life if the quality were tweaked to reflect the standard men have become accustomed to in there hygiene products. With the rise in traditional barbering, and with it, the rediscovery of legacy toiletries companies like this should seize the opportunity to reinvigorate these classic brands.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this cologne and variability of the fragrances, but these are extremely small bottles, guess I should have paid better attention to the ad. HA!</li>
