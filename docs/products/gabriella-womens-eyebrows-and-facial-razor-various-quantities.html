            <li>Safe way to remove unwanted hair from your face or bikini area!</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, and the scraping of the Gab razor irritates my skin even more than the epilator does!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>These work 10 times better than a razor!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best at removing little peach fuzz, and incredible at removing flaking skin!</li>
            <li>Really amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a miracle razor as I used to get my eyebrows threaded and my sideburns threaded and threading has amazing results</li>
            <li>Nice color selection.  </li>
            <li>Great facial razor for women at a great price!</li>
            <li>Might be effective for those who would use it for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Effective and well priced.</li>
            <li>For years, I have been doing my own at home waxing</li>
            <li>They are good but the edges top and bottom are not well covered it scratches me.</li>
            <li>These are a great deal and work wonderfully for removing facial hair for women.</li>
            <li>I like these because they also don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but do a great job and leave your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>(Although it isn&#x27;t an intended use also, they have come in handy when traveling when I don&#x27;t have a knife or scissors around</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product and it was shipped quickly!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and don&#x27;t cause irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li>Well I decided to try these razors, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, easy to use, I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all, and my skin GLOWS and is so smooth now!!  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks amazing and stays on so much better too.</li>
            <li>Save your money &amp; buy something more effective, like an epilator, for example.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have more of a point, but havent seen that anywhere.</li>
            <li>Easy to use product!</li>
            <li>Great product and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; product.</li>
            <li>I use these for my eyebrows and they&#x27;re very precise.</li>
            <li>Based on the large number of great reviews for this product I had high hopes that it would be the perfect solution to remove some of the fine hairs I have on my chin but</li>
            <li>These blades are amazingly precise!</li>
            <li>I have ordered them many times and have shared them with my daughter.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use them for my cheeks and chin, but even the first use proved amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I wanted to give these a try since they are more targeted towards women.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked like magic.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you know how to use these before you do</li>
            <li>totally love this razor -  </li>
            <li>It just does a better job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried most of the cream ( the leave my skin with a rush and burned) , depilatory, tweezing, waxing, threading, the spring &amp;#34;thingy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I LOVE it...</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>These one was the most durable razure I ever had</li>
            <li>So glad I found them at Amazon</li>
            <li>I think, with practice, I will like them much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Cute colors</li>
            <li>I love it even more than waxing.</li>
            <li>Short downward strokes works best.  </li>
            <li>My sister said it was ok.  </li>
            <li>I love these better than the ones at the beauty supply store...</li>
            <li>I like the Touch and Bro better.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is not an outstanding product but it works well.</li>
            <li>They work better and faster then what I had been using however</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheap bic razors from a dollar store do the job better, faster, and safer.</li>
            <li>I had seen it advertised and was so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>You can use them more than once</li>
            <li>Glad to get rid of my wax creams that don&#x27;t work as well as these wondderful razors.</li>
            <li>Threw them out, found better ones at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more and keeping them on-hand.</li>
            <li>I use this for the hair on my top lip -</li>
            <li>and I would not recommend for use as a substitute for dermaplaning unless you are already very familiar with the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and is easy and safe to use.  </li>
            <li>I love love love these razors - they are perfect for facial hair (and the insecurity that I&#x27;ve been struggling with has been solved) and they are a touch too big for eyebrows, but it works fairly well, and is a fine compromise for the quality of the blade and the shave I&#x27;ve been getting.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of that smooth skin exposed when the hair is gone.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to grab the handle .</li>
            <li>and I could have easily cut myself every time I used them.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t attempt this if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing because it is really easy to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>razor is easy to hold</li>
            <li>You can easily shave skin around eyebrows without cuts.</li>
            <li>Always be sure to clean them with rubbing alcohol after use on face area.</li>
            <li>They do the job just fine without irritation to my skin and without pulling the hairs.</li>
            <li>so I thought they would be fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already try it and it does work on peach fuzz and my fine blond hair on my face.</li>
            <li>I had that fine hair that liquid and powder stuck to.</li>
            <li>My hair is light in color and fine</li>
            <li>They pick up fine and course hair, doesn&#x27;t cut the skin and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Wonderful little razors.</li>
            <li>I love them so much!!</li>
            <li>Best little razor I have found anyway.</li>
            <li>Razors fit comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li>Great for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and lesson</li>
            <li>I bought these because everyone said they worked great, didn&#x27;t irritate the face, and didn&#x27;t make hair grow back like stubble.</li>
            <li>Fell apart immediately- cheap construction.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable running my Gillette across my cheeks and forehead, so these razors are perf.</li>
            <li>They are cheap too--no batteries--love that.</li>
            <li>And the price is fantastic plus you get 3.  </li>
            <li>Now I have perfect brows everyday</li>
            <li>but I prefer a smooth face for makeup application and product penetration.</li>
            <li>A dermatologist recommended these for that peach fuzz on the upper lip and they work great for that purpose.</li>
            <li>These also give you a nice fast solution that doesn&#x27;t leave you with the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li>Item is made of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Both are good brands, but I do find the GABRIELLA to be my top choice, simply because of its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>but I quickly realized how easy it is.</li>
            <li>This is something that is worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth it to try them out!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Tried these, because honestly they were too cheap not to, and they work better than the personal womans battery shavers.</li>
            <li>These razors are worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Great razor for that little fuzz or more</li>
            <li>works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>My razor performs the same functions more effectively except for eyebrows which I do not shave.  </li>
            <li>I use about every 3-4 weeks and love how not only does it take off the hair, but exfoliates my skin and my makeup goes on so nicely.</li>
            <li>It did take a couple of times using it to figure how to turn it at about a 45 degree angle to get the hair off cleanly.</li>
            <li>Work terrific, no harsh edges, great price!</li>
            <li>husband also uses this to clean up errant hairs in between his eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Just have to hold it at the right angle and it will do the job!</li>
            <li>I used it and loved it so much, it leaves your skin smooth and clear of hair.  </li>
            <li>It really does the trick of making you feel smooth!</li>
            <li>Does a good job removing facial hair in-between laser treatments.</li>
            <li>this is a super clean shave for eyebrows, chin, lip area</li>
            <li>SO glad I don&#x27;t need to put myself through so much pain to be hairless.</li>
            <li>Due between 12-18 Feb 15, received 14 Feb--very happy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, but it is really Sharp.</li>
            <li>love this product and it makes me feel better as a woman that I don&#x27;t have to be seen with facial hair.</li>
            <li>ordered  for my mom who&#x27;s  older and says  you get more hair on your face with age.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find the normal brand of razor I use domestically, so opted to try this one instead.</li>
            <li>Not the best only because the razors are too long for precision.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>Not sharp, so perfect for someone elderly who may not have steady hands, or a teen who is just learning to care for her brows.</li>
            <li>this seems to be truly nice easy fix - does not irritate skin, quick to use, will not leave cuts or burns; I was hesitant only at first move, but literally just second touch assured me this is save and easy to use and works like a charm -- and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Simply put, amazing.</li>
            <li>Once I got them, they were not as effective as others I have had before from different sellers.</li>
            <li>Honestly a razor will do the same job.</li>
            <li>to use and so worth it....</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a useful tool.  </li>
            <li>I will just be junking them since they aren&#x27;t worth the time/money to return ship, and won&#x27;t be letting this brand touch my skin again.  </li>
            <li>Mom liked it, but said she&#x27;d never buy since her regular razor works just as well.  </li>
            <li>I find that each razor is only good for 7-8 uses (probably more if you are only using it for your eyebrows).</li>
            <li>I use it for my eyebrows from time to time but it is more awkward to use perfectly on the brows.</li>
            <li>I also cut my own hair and have used them to shave my &amp;#34;side burns&amp;#34; and the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>I would say that these would work best if you&#x27;re looking to shave any other part of the face, like the upper lip, chin, unibrow area, or sideburns, but not for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Luckily I will never have to buy that product again thanks to this!</li>
            <li>I love using these to clean up stray hairs around the eyebrows and getting rid of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for removing the fine hair from your face.  </li>
            <li>I did more research on this razor and was pleasantly surprised to read the positive reviews from users</li>
            <li>I was hoping this could replace the epilator I use on my very fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>razors are very sharp which i loved</li>
            <li>But for the price and utility, overall, it is a good product and does the job WELL under a $50 visit to get professional dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li>It provided me a similar (but not as good) outcome as a professional job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and leave your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>but this one shaves my upper lip, sides of my face smooth, without leaving any &amp;#34;lady stubble&#x27;s&amp;#34;,  So much better than my older one.  </li>
            <li>Must repeat strokes many times and still does not cut properly.</li>
            <li>So much easier than waxing!</li>
            <li>I will use these on my toes because they are to rough for the face nice idea though.</li>
            <li>It was what I was looking for to try these for the first time</li>
            <li>I was also nervous about using this for the first time</li>
            <li>Be aware this is a sharp&lt;br</li>
            <li>These no matter how I used them, at correct angle, I tried many angles after initially trying it, I always got irritated skin from them.</li>
            <li>(and, I&#x27;m sure, any age who has facial hair or peach fuzz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I did expect them to last more that a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how gentle it is on my face!  </li>
            <li>Love these for facial dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li>Love these for shaving facial hair and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>These last a really long time and do a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit big for the small areas around the eyes, but it works great!</li>
            <li>I have used the first razor for 4shaves, about 2 weeks apart</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>and the hair does grow back darker and more stubbly...would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I gained so much knowledge from this book!</li>
            <li>Even applying more pressure when using this razor still didn&#x27;t remove the hairs as well as a regular disposable razor or tweezers would so these things went in the trash.</li>
            <li>Better left to the pros.</li>
            <li>One of them broke on first use.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it stated on the product</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>last hint: if your doing your face I have found it is more effective to use the razor when your face is on the drier (not right after you moisturize).</li>
            <li>You have to be careful in using it, but they are the greatest little tool to have in your beauty kit.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and did not leave a stubble or rough feeling after use.  </li>
            <li>It leaves My skin bare and smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>They are angled differenly and the razor is a different length than the other brand, these do not do a great job</li>
            <li>They stay sharp for along time and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It never occurred to me that there was such an easy way to get rid of the peach fuzz covering my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li>Overall though, as long as you are careful using them they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The slim design makes it easy to see what your doing, and it has something on the razor that makes it seem safer than a simple straight razor.</li>
            <li>I have mostly fine and some coarse hairs on my face and</li>
            <li>This really works to shave off that fine hair that I want to get rid of around my upper lip and chin.  </li>
            <li>the very front plastic part is very Sharpe and cuts me if I hold the blade against my skin straight.</li>
            <li>Fantastic razors, work very well on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not only does my face feel incredibly smooth afterwards</li>
            <li>and I really need to because some of my medication cause hair growth on women where you don&#x27;t want it, like on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>which, to be done properly, really has to be paid for . . .</li>
            <li>Very unsanitary</li>
            <li>and once you get the hang of it, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It took 5 minutes or so to get the hang of it, the angle you hold it, the light pressure exertion, but I finally got it and was amazed at the hair it took off.  </li>
            <li>I really like the one I have.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and I have the whole GiGi set up.</li>
            <li>Would I buy it again, absolutely and it arrived 2 weeks before estimated delivery.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these razors for anyone that wants to try out dermaplaning without spending too much money at a spa.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I will find out how to use it and you can&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li>Plus this way is really cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.  </li>
            <li>good little gadgets work as they should... not totally sharp but</li>
            <li>They are sharp and I love to shapen up by eyebrows with these.</li>
            <li>I needed to play around with the angle a little, but once I found the proper direction and angle, it&#x27;s highly successful.  </li>
            <li>These razors are perfect and I find it hard to actually accidentally cut myself with these razors which was an initial concern.</li>
            <li>Remove facial hair and the top layer of dead skin and reveal the soft smooth fresh new skin below.</li>
            <li>They are sharp not dull like so many others I have used hence the lack of pulling.</li>
            <li>and I did notice a lot of very fine hairs as well as dead skin being removed.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend using on your eyebrows, that&#x27;s a whole new skill.</li>
            <li>As we get older those pesky hairs pop up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any woman.</li>
            <li>Love these little guys.</li>
            <li>As a mature woman (in my 60&#x27;s) this has been a life-saver for me!!</li>
            <li>this one surprised me !!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and has cover to keep blade sharp.</li>
            <li>This razor is a sad imitation of Shiseido - catching on skin, leaving it very irritated and not getting rid of hair effectively.</li>
            <li>To make you feel like you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth, they turn it into a 30-40 minute facial.</li>
            <li>this razor works well for fine (and coarse) facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I knew these were not going to be fantastic due to the price</li>
            <li>These look exactly the same</li>
            <li>If you are looking for facial razors which I love to use, go with the other brand, Kai.</li>
            <li>However, I can sometimes get lazy and slack a bit on my once a week waxing, I LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li>to do that it required much more pressure against the skin and going over the same spot several times than it would just using a regular men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s disposable razor.</li>
            <li>The way you have to use them - against the hair growth- makes it hard to get the blade exactly where you want it for precise eyebrow work.  </li>
            <li>Desperate and with scheduled dermatologist appointment 2 month ahead I was looking for easy, cheap quick fix for facial hair for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Since my epilator broke, I&#x27;ve been using a gillette razor every once in a while for the peach fuzz on my face, and not only does the gillette work better than the Gabriella razors, the gillette seems safer and less abrasive.  </li>
            <li>it is super sharp</li>
            <li>I really like this little razor much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Each razor has a clear blade protector to protect the blade when not in use.  </li>
            <li>I was really scared to use this because I didn&#x27;t want to cut my face or my hair to grow back and end up looking like a bear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;blade--so, be gentle and use short strokes.</li>
            <li>But going to a medical esthetician can be very cost</li>
            <li>so far so</li>
            <li>Also, the end is scratchy and can damage sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t like the way the blade is; its just a little too sharp and doesn&#x27;t take the hair off even or close enough, I&#x27;m glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>At least these last for many cuts before they feel like the new Gabriella does.  </li>
            <li>Yea sure it removed the fuzz on my face, but I also have coarse black hairs that it doesn&#x27;t work on, it just irritated my face further then, and then I ended up growing face stubble all over my face.</li>
            <li>Using these on facial hair has left me feeling much better and less self-conscience.</li>
            <li>I tried using them to remove some fine hairs under my eyebrows, but found them too long to maneuver in that tight space.</li>
            <li>It literally takes out My facial hair in seconds and its not harsh on the skin!</li>
            <li>Pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>She said the Gab razor was good to just scrape the tiny hairs from her upper lip, but she wouldnt use it on her whole face because she&#x27;s afraid she&#x27;d cut herself.  </li>
            <li>I use these to trim my facial hair, and sometimes to clean up my eyebrows a little if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean up any small unsightly hairs.</li>
            <li>Too dull and cheap.</li>
            <li>Not long term solution, but quick enough that I can use it few times a week as needed without hurting my skin in any way or any pain.</li>
            <li>but I have found that it takes a while for the hair to grow back in and it DOES NOT come in coarse but just as soft as ever.</li>
            <li>Watch the very tip as it is extremely sharp and I have nicked myself several times.</li>
            <li>Very traumatizing, until I found these little babies...</li>
            <li>This 3-pack of razors come in cute pastel colors, and the blades on these are VERY sharp, so the shave is super close to the skin, but I find that using these for your eyebrows is almost impossible for me</li>

            <li> Cleans up your mug so you look better!</li>
            <li> Safe way to remove unwanted hair from your face or bikini area!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and the scraping of the Gab razor irritates my skin even more than the epilator does!  </li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> These work 10 times better than a razor!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best at removing little peach fuzz, and incredible at removing flaking skin!</li>
            <li> Really amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year</li>

            <li> Nice color selection.  </li>
            <li> Great facial razor for women at a great price!</li>
            <li> Might be effective for those who would use it for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Effective and well priced.</li>
            <li> For years, I have been doing my own at home waxing</li>
            <li> They are good but the edges top and bottom are not well covered it scratches me.</li>
            <li> These are a great deal and work wonderfully for removing facial hair for women.</li>
            <li> I like these because they also don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but do a great job and leave your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> (Although it isn&#x27;t an intended use also, they have come in handy when traveling when I don&#x27;t have a knife or scissors around</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and it was shipped quickly!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and don&#x27;t cause irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li> Well I decided to try these razors, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, easy to use, I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all, and my skin GLOWS and is so smooth now!!  </li>
            <li> My makeup looks amazing and stays on so much better too.</li>
            <li> Save your money &amp; buy something more effective, like an epilator, for example.</li>

            <li> Easy to use product!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> I use these for my eyebrows and they&#x27;re very precise.</li>
            <li> Based on the large number of great reviews for this product I had high hopes that it would be the perfect solution to remove some of the fine hairs I have on my chin but</li>
            <li> These blades are amazingly precise!</li>
            <li> I have ordered them many times and have shared them with my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use them for my cheeks and chin, but even the first use proved amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I wanted to give these a try since they are more targeted towards women.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked like magic.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you know how to use these before you do</li>
            <li> totally love this razor -  </li>
            <li> It just does a better job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried most of the cream ( the leave my skin with a rush and burned) , depilatory, tweezing, waxing, threading, the spring &amp;#34;thingy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I LOVE it...</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> These one was the most durable razure I ever had</li>
            <li> So glad I found them at Amazon</li>
            <li> I think, with practice, I will like them much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Cute colors</li>
            <li> I love it even more than waxing.</li>
            <li> Short downward strokes works best.  </li>
            <li> My sister said it was ok.  </li>
            <li> I love these better than the ones at the beauty supply store...</li>
            <li> I like the Touch and Bro better.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not an outstanding product but it works well.</li>
            <li> They work better and faster then what I had been using however</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheap bic razors from a dollar store do the job better, faster, and safer.</li>
            <li> I had seen it advertised and was so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> You can use them more than once</li>
            <li> Glad to get rid of my wax creams that don&#x27;t work as well as these wondderful razors.</li>
            <li> Threw them out, found better ones at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more and keeping them on-hand.</li>
            <li> I use this for the hair on my top lip -</li>
            <li> and I would not recommend for use as a substitute for dermaplaning unless you are already very familiar with the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and is easy and safe to use.  </li>
            <li> I love love love these razors - they are perfect for facial hair (and the insecurity that I&#x27;ve been struggling with has been solved) and they are a touch too big for eyebrows, but it works fairly well, and is a fine compromise for the quality of the blade and the shave I&#x27;ve been getting.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of that smooth skin exposed when the hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grab the handle .</li>
            <li> and I could have easily cut myself every time I used them.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t attempt this if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing because it is really easy to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> razor is easy to hold</li>
            <li> You can easily shave skin around eyebrows without cuts.</li>
            <li> Always be sure to clean them with rubbing alcohol after use on face area.</li>
            <li> They do the job just fine without irritation to my skin and without pulling the hairs.</li>
            <li> so I thought they would be fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already try it and it does work on peach fuzz and my fine blond hair on my face.</li>
            <li> I had that fine hair that liquid and powder stuck to.</li>
            <li> My hair is light in color and fine</li>
            <li> They pick up fine and course hair, doesn&#x27;t cut the skin and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little razors.</li>
            <li> I love them so much!!</li>
            <li> Best little razor I have found anyway.</li>
            <li> Razors fit comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and lesson</li>
            <li> I bought these because everyone said they worked great, didn&#x27;t irritate the face, and didn&#x27;t make hair grow back like stubble.</li>
            <li> Fell apart immediately- cheap construction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable running my Gillette across my cheeks and forehead, so these razors are perf.</li>
            <li> They are cheap too--no batteries--love that.</li>
            <li> And the price is fantastic plus you get 3.  </li>
            <li> Now I have perfect brows everyday</li>
            <li> but I prefer a smooth face for makeup application and product penetration.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended these for that peach fuzz on the upper lip and they work great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> These also give you a nice fast solution that doesn&#x27;t leave you with the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> Item is made of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> Both are good brands, but I do find the GABRIELLA to be my top choice, simply because of its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> but I quickly realized how easy it is.</li>
            <li> This is something that is worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth it to try them out!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Tried these, because honestly they were too cheap not to, and they work better than the personal womans battery shavers.</li>
            <li> These razors are worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great razor for that little fuzz or more</li>
            <li> works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> My razor performs the same functions more effectively except for eyebrows which I do not shave.  </li>
            <li> I use about every 3-4 weeks and love how not only does it take off the hair, but exfoliates my skin and my makeup goes on so nicely.</li>
            <li> It did take a couple of times using it to figure how to turn it at about a 45 degree angle to get the hair off cleanly.</li>
            <li> Work terrific, no harsh edges, great price!</li>
            <li> husband also uses this to clean up errant hairs in between his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Just have to hold it at the right angle and it will do the job!</li>
            <li> I used it and loved it so much, it leaves your skin smooth and clear of hair.  </li>
            <li> It really does the trick of making you feel smooth!</li>
            <li> Does a good job removing facial hair in-between laser treatments.</li>
            <li> this is a super clean shave for eyebrows, chin, lip area</li>
            <li> SO glad I don&#x27;t need to put myself through so much pain to be hairless.</li>
            <li> Due between 12-18 Feb 15, received 14 Feb--very happy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, but it is really Sharp.</li>
            <li> love this product and it makes me feel better as a woman that I don&#x27;t have to be seen with facial hair.</li>
            <li> ordered  for my mom who&#x27;s  older and says  you get more hair on your face with age.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find the normal brand of razor I use domestically, so opted to try this one instead.</li>
            <li> Not the best only because the razors are too long for precision.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Not sharp, so perfect for someone elderly who may not have steady hands, or a teen who is just learning to care for her brows.</li>
            <li> this seems to be truly nice easy fix - does not irritate skin, quick to use, will not leave cuts or burns; I was hesitant only at first move, but literally just second touch assured me this is save and easy to use and works like a charm -- and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Simply put, amazing.</li>
            <li> Once I got them, they were not as effective as others I have had before from different sellers.</li>
            <li> Honestly a razor will do the same job.</li>
            <li> to use and so worth it....</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a useful tool.  </li>
            <li> I will just be junking them since they aren&#x27;t worth the time/money to return ship, and won&#x27;t be letting this brand touch my skin again.  </li>
            <li> Mom liked it, but said she&#x27;d never buy since her regular razor works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I find that each razor is only good for 7-8 uses (probably more if you are only using it for your eyebrows).</li>
            <li> I use it for my eyebrows from time to time but it is more awkward to use perfectly on the brows.</li>
            <li> I also cut my own hair and have used them to shave my &amp;#34;side burns&amp;#34; and the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I would say that these would work best if you&#x27;re looking to shave any other part of the face, like the upper lip, chin, unibrow area, or sideburns, but not for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Luckily I will never have to buy that product again thanks to this!</li>
            <li> I love using these to clean up stray hairs around the eyebrows and getting rid of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for removing the fine hair from your face.  </li>
            <li> I did more research on this razor and was pleasantly surprised to read the positive reviews from users</li>
            <li> I was hoping this could replace the epilator I use on my very fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> razors are very sharp which i loved</li>
            <li> But for the price and utility, overall, it is a good product and does the job WELL under a $50 visit to get professional dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li> It provided me a similar (but not as good) outcome as a professional job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use and leave your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> but this one shaves my upper lip, sides of my face smooth, without leaving any &amp;#34;lady stubble&#x27;s&amp;#34;,  So much better than my older one.  </li>
            <li> Must repeat strokes many times and still does not cut properly.</li>
            <li> So much easier than waxing!</li>
            <li> I will use these on my toes because they are to rough for the face nice idea though.</li>
            <li> It was what I was looking for to try these for the first time</li>
            <li> I was also nervous about using this for the first time</li>
            <li> Be aware this is a sharp&lt;br</li>
            <li> These no matter how I used them, at correct angle, I tried many angles after initially trying it, I always got irritated skin from them.</li>
            <li> (and, I&#x27;m sure, any age who has facial hair or peach fuzz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I did expect them to last more that a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how gentle it is on my face!  </li>
            <li> Love these for facial dermaplaning.  </li>
            <li> Love these for shaving facial hair and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> These last a really long time and do a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big for the small areas around the eyes, but it works great!</li>
            <li> I have used the first razor for 4shaves, about 2 weeks apart</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> and the hair does grow back darker and more stubbly...would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I gained so much knowledge from this book!</li>
            <li> Even applying more pressure when using this razor still didn&#x27;t remove the hairs as well as a regular disposable razor or tweezers would so these things went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Better left to the pros.</li>
            <li> One of them broke on first use.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it stated on the product</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> last hint: if your doing your face I have found it is more effective to use the razor when your face is on the drier (not right after you moisturize).</li>
            <li> You have to be careful in using it, but they are the greatest little tool to have in your beauty kit.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and did not leave a stubble or rough feeling after use.  </li>
            <li> It leaves My skin bare and smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li> They are angled differenly and the razor is a different length than the other brand, these do not do a great job</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for along time and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It never occurred to me that there was such an easy way to get rid of the peach fuzz covering my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li> Overall though, as long as you are careful using them they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The slim design makes it easy to see what your doing, and it has something on the razor that makes it seem safer than a simple straight razor.</li>
            <li> I have mostly fine and some coarse hairs on my face and</li>
            <li> This really works to shave off that fine hair that I want to get rid of around my upper lip and chin.  </li>
            <li> the very front plastic part is very Sharpe and cuts me if I hold the blade against my skin straight.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razors, work very well on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not only does my face feel incredibly smooth afterwards</li>
            <li> and I really need to because some of my medication cause hair growth on women where you don&#x27;t want it, like on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which, to be done properly, really has to be paid for . . .</li>
            <li> Very unsanitary</li>
            <li> and once you get the hang of it, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It took 5 minutes or so to get the hang of it, the angle you hold it, the light pressure exertion, but I finally got it and was amazed at the hair it took off.  </li>
            <li> I really like the one I have.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and I have the whole GiGi set up.</li>
            <li> Would I buy it again, absolutely and it arrived 2 weeks before estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these razors for anyone that wants to try out dermaplaning without spending too much money at a spa.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I will find out how to use it and you can&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li> Plus this way is really cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.  </li>
            <li> good little gadgets work as they should... not totally sharp but</li>
            <li> They are sharp and I love to shapen up by eyebrows with these.</li>
            <li> I needed to play around with the angle a little, but once I found the proper direction and angle, it&#x27;s highly successful.  </li>
            <li> These razors are perfect and I find it hard to actually accidentally cut myself with these razors which was an initial concern.</li>
            <li> Remove facial hair and the top layer of dead skin and reveal the soft smooth fresh new skin below.</li>
            <li> They are sharp not dull like so many others I have used hence the lack of pulling.</li>
            <li> and I did notice a lot of very fine hairs as well as dead skin being removed.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend using on your eyebrows, that&#x27;s a whole new skill.</li>
            <li> As we get older those pesky hairs pop up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys.</li>
            <li> As a mature woman (in my 60&#x27;s) this has been a life-saver for me!!</li>
            <li> this one surprised me !!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and has cover to keep blade sharp.</li>
            <li> This razor is a sad imitation of Shiseido - catching on skin, leaving it very irritated and not getting rid of hair effectively.</li>
            <li> To make you feel like you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth, they turn it into a 30-40 minute facial.</li>
            <li> this razor works well for fine (and coarse) facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I knew these were not going to be fantastic due to the price</li>
            <li> These look exactly the same</li>
            <li> If you are looking for facial razors which I love to use, go with the other brand, Kai.</li>
            <li> However, I can sometimes get lazy and slack a bit on my once a week waxing, I LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li> to do that it required much more pressure against the skin and going over the same spot several times than it would just using a regular men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s disposable razor.</li>
            <li> The way you have to use them - against the hair growth- makes it hard to get the blade exactly where you want it for precise eyebrow work.  </li>
            <li> Desperate and with scheduled dermatologist appointment 2 month ahead I was looking for easy, cheap quick fix for facial hair for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Since my epilator broke, I&#x27;ve been using a gillette razor every once in a while for the peach fuzz on my face, and not only does the gillette work better than the Gabriella razors, the gillette seems safer and less abrasive.  </li>
            <li> it is super sharp</li>
            <li> I really like this little razor much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Each razor has a clear blade protector to protect the blade when not in use.  </li>
            <li> I was really scared to use this because I didn&#x27;t want to cut my face or my hair to grow back and end up looking like a bear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;blade--so, be gentle and use short strokes.</li>
            <li> But going to a medical esthetician can be very cost</li>
            <li> so far so</li>
            <li> Also, the end is scratchy and can damage sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like the way the blade is; its just a little too sharp and doesn&#x27;t take the hair off even or close enough, I&#x27;m glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> At least these last for many cuts before they feel like the new Gabriella does.  </li>
            <li> Yea sure it removed the fuzz on my face, but I also have coarse black hairs that it doesn&#x27;t work on, it just irritated my face further then, and then I ended up growing face stubble all over my face.</li>
            <li> Using these on facial hair has left me feeling much better and less self-conscience.</li>
            <li> I tried using them to remove some fine hairs under my eyebrows, but found them too long to maneuver in that tight space.</li>
            <li> It literally takes out My facial hair in seconds and its not harsh on the skin!</li>
            <li> Pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> She said the Gab razor was good to just scrape the tiny hairs from her upper lip, but she wouldnt use it on her whole face because she&#x27;s afraid she&#x27;d cut herself.  </li>
            <li> I use these to trim my facial hair, and sometimes to clean up my eyebrows a little if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean up any small unsightly hairs.</li>
            <li> Too dull and cheap.</li>
            <li> Not long term solution, but quick enough that I can use it few times a week as needed without hurting my skin in any way or any pain.</li>
            <li> but I have found that it takes a while for the hair to grow back in and it DOES NOT come in coarse but just as soft as ever.</li>
            <li> Watch the very tip as it is extremely sharp and I have nicked myself several times.</li>
            <li> Very traumatizing, until I found these little babies...</li>
            <li> This 3-pack of razors come in cute pastel colors, and the blades on these are VERY sharp, so the shave is super close to the skin, but I find that using these for your eyebrows is almost impossible for me</li>
            <li> razors seemed to be dull right out of the package</li>
            <li> Hard to get the right angle to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> it is NOT sharp and does NOT shave a single hair.</li>
            <li> It takes very little pressure on the peach fuzz and needs a little pressure for the fine hair.</li>
            <li> I mean, how different could they be, right?  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I&#x27;ve been wanting to make my face and forearms smoother.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, I wish o had discovered these razors long ago</li>
            <li> I have dry shaved my face without any irritation, and my skin improved dramatically after about the 3rd go.</li>
            <li> Just go slow when using them and pay attention to the more delicate places on your face.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the unwanted hair, much easier than waxing, it is less painful and gives a much more even surface to the face than what waxing does.</li>
            <li> I wish the blade was not quite as long as it is, 3/4 of the size would be optimal for eyebrow maintenance.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after I had previously used a facial razor that was a different brand.  </li>
            <li> I stopped going for expensive microderm, as this did a BETTER job, with less irritation.</li>
            <li> - the blade is just so long for that part of the face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of facial razors.  </li>
            <li> But as someone who was so nervous to use this on her face other than her eyebrows, I can assure you that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back thicker or tougher than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always thoroughly dry them as they will rust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful after, since your skin is a bit sensitive for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This arrived NOT new and NOT in the package.</li>
            <li> Not high tech</li>
            <li> I have to angle it slightly towards the back of the blade</li>
            <li> initially, they are VERY sharp, so be careful</li>
            <li> It is so handy to shave those little pesky facial hairs and much less painful than plucking.  </li>
            <li> I use them for shaving the eyebrow stubble that grows back (after i&#x27;ve shaped them with little scissors).</li>
            <li> Ran across these little razors looking for something else and ordered them specifically for the fuzz starting to show up on my face.</li>
            <li> It hurts like the dickens, but it&#x27;s better than dealing with the itchy, painful irritation that follows a dermaplaning routine.</li>
            <li> Shaving gave me too many painful and unsightly ingrown hairs on my face, and it left me with red razor burns on my delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful that they will cut your face if you don&#x27;t hold them in an angle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone else was reviewing, but what I received in the mail was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> they do not cut, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> This was to rough on my face.  </li>
            <li> The tip is longer than I had hoped for, which makes it harder to contour to my face.</li>
            <li> They are not so sharp that I have cut myself</li>
            <li> Ive tried the facial hair removing cremes in the past.</li>
            <li> No more plucking my upper lip...</li>
            <li> I use this about every other week</li>
            <li> Why would a company ship a sharp grooming instrument without being sealed for safety and cleanliness?</li>
            <li> (sorry, can&#x27;t think of the exact brand</li>
            <li> They just aren&#x27;t small enough to get into small areas without shaving off your entire eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after using a couple of other brands (ineffective ones)</li>
            <li> The blades are not overly sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors to try out dermaplaning at home after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> I use them on my eyebrows, trimming nose hair, and any other hair you want to shave.</li>
            <li> but I am very careful when using them.</li>
            <li> Feels VERY rough on skin &amp; causes redness.</li>
            <li> package instructions are very minimal</li>
            <li> Got to be very careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp but not super sharp, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know the rules in other states), an esthetician MUST be operating out of a physician&#x27;s office to perform dermaplaning because the blade is a surgical blade and VERY sharp.  </li>
            <li> They became too dull after the 3rd or 4th use.</li>
            <li> Not worth the pulling to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 months and have had zero issues with thick hairs growing back or cuts.  </li>
            <li> I sleep on the satin pillow case for about 2 days, while the sensitivity on my face calms down.</li>
            <li> These little razors took forever to get to me.</li>
            <li> I can understand if you want to use them for your eyebrows, but if it&#x27;s just a little peach fuzz I wouldn&#x27;t bother with them.</li>
            <li> but I still get a little razor burn with this brand.  </li>
            <li> little of my eyebrow is gone at the end.</li>
            <li> (i have cut myself a few times).</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and this tool gets a layer of dead skin that the paste doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> These razors are a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> These are disposable, but I use them a few times before I throw them away.</li>
            <li> you are a woman and have a slight mustache, buy them!</li>
            <li> I have a small amount of black medium hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve looked for an alternative to the painful and dread hot wax . . .</li>
            <li> Use this for your little whiskers!  </li>
            <li> What a difference this little razor makes!</li>
            <li> Got rid of all those tinny little hairs I could and couldn&#x27;t see!</li>
            <li> I have a small, finger-spray bottle that I fill with rubbing alcohol, to spray my face with (while holding my breathe), to sanitize my face after removing the peach fuzz and skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that cotton pillow cases will aggravate my skin since it&#x27;s overly delicate after removing so much dead skin.</li>
            <li> Go at about 40 degree angle, with small strokes.</li>
            <li> This is simply a fraudulent, useless product which is worthless!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator usually lasts about a year or two before it breaks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gone back to tweezers because I found these annoying to work with.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull after one or two uses.  </li>
            <li> I find them hard to use.</li>
            <li> This razor gets the job done but it is hard to master technique and not cut or scrape the skin.  </li>
            <li> These are too dull to cut without pulling.  </li>
            <li> but it hurts like crazy-- especially on the sideburns area.</li>
            <li> No more trips for waxing!</li>
            <li> mean they won&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li> You need to be careful because they are very sharp, and not being careful one time I was carrying one and took a nasty slice out of my thumb.</li>
            <li> The razor is not too sharp, like others I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> they seem to be very dull</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very sharp but have a protective wire over them, so I never end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> and did not want these and tried them but not good as razor at all waste of my money and did not order and then get two packages junk!!!!</li>
            <li> What I found was that working with these can be frustrating and tedious.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how badly I needed these little guys!</li>
            <li> which hurts sooo bad, but not no more....</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!!</li>
            <li> Gabriella Eyebrows &amp; facial razor is in a word AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Sadly I paid to have this product shipped separately from my Amazon order, and I&#x27;m Not about to pay shipping AGAIN to have this product returned. .  </li>
            <li> They are useless.  </li>
            <li> Wrong box</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Make one wrong move</li>
            <li> Sorry Gabriella, I tried yours and will either throw out or give them away.  </li>
            <li> I do not use it on eyebrows, I am too chicken, but do use it on the peach fuzz on neck and face.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using these correctly but they seem to be awkwardly shaped for brows.  </li>
            <li> These blades have a guard, it is almost impossible to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Nicked my forehead a bit once, but that was bad for from my end.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with these razors removing the annoying peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li> that it is so annoying .</li>
            <li> It was awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice color selection.  Packaged well.  Razors function as described.  Great for keeping my eyebrows shaped.  Easy to use.  Razors fit comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Only thing... the very front plastic part is very Sharpe and cuts me if I hold the blade against my skin straight. I have to angle it slightly towards the back of the blade so it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I want to give these as gifts! These blades are amazingly precise! I used the brow razors that you find at Target but these are a million times better! I keep one at home and one in my makeup case. I want to buy more as back-ups!</li>
            <li> Tried holding these every which way but couldn&#x27;t make. It work. Reviews were the reason I ordered but I had no luck 😢</li>
            <li> Wonderful little razors. They do the job just fine without irritation to my skin and without pulling the hairs.They are sharp not dull like so many others I have used hence the lack of pulling. They are not so sharp that I have cut myself but I am very careful when using them. I have ordered them many times and have shared them with my daughter. She loves them as well .</li>
            <li> These little razors took forever to get to me. Once I got them, they were not as effective as others I have had before from different sellers. Not impressed at all!!</li>
            <li> I like these razors. It&#x27;s sharp but not super sharp, just the way I like it. I use this to shape my brows. I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I love love love these razors - they are perfect for facial hair (and the insecurity that I&#x27;ve been struggling with has been solved) and they are a touch too big for eyebrows, but it works fairly well, and is a fine compromise for the quality of the blade and the shave I&#x27;ve been getting. I love them so much!!</li>
            <li> I did not realize how badly I needed these little guys! Ive tried the facial hair removing cremes in the past. Luckily I will never have to buy that product again thanks to this!</li>
            <li> Product works great as promised.</li>
            <li> Does not cut well at all. Must repeat strokes many times and still does not cut properly.</li>
            <li> Great facial razor for women at a great price!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy these again! I was hesitant to use them for my cheeks and chin, but even the first use proved amazing! So much easier than waxing!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I purchase. The razor is not too sharp, like others I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself. I get my shipment within 4 - 5 days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with these razors removing the annoying peach fuzz.  I highly recommend this item.  I have been using it for about 2 months and have had zero issues with thick hairs growing back or cuts.  Does a great job exfoliating as well.</li>
            <li> They where just ok&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> razors seemed to be dull right out of the package</li>
            <li> It literally takes out My facial hair in seconds and its not harsh on the skin! It leaves My skin bare and smooth and hairless. I love this product and I have had these for over a year now and it still works. Of the 3, I constantly still use 2 of them till today. This is something that is worth it!</li>
            <li> Use this for your little whiskers!  Cleans up your mug so you look better!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work...Dr. Oz suggested it</li>
            <li> Great! Highly recommend! Use them to shave face for reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys. They are sharp and I love to shapen up by eyebrows with these. I will be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> This item is nice, compact, useful and well-made, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> I was really scared to use this because I didn&#x27;t want to cut my face or my hair to grow back and end up looking like a bear. I used it and loved it so much, it leaves your skin smooth and clear of hair.  Just be careful after, since your skin is a bit sensitive for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and don&#x27;t cause irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I will use these on my toes because they are to rough for the face nice idea though. Don&#x27;t know until you try</li>
            <li> I saw a demo on You Tube and it works well to remove peach fuzz from a woman&#x27;s cheek area.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These did not work at all.</li>
            <li> My razor performs the same functions more effectively except for eyebrows which I do not shave.  Will not purchase again.  Might be effective for those who would use it for eyebrows.  To the question as to where they were made:  Made in China.</li>
            <li> Great for removing facial hair. Effective and well priced. These can be used multiple times to dermaplane your face and have safety ridges to ensure you don&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It was what I was looking for to try these for the first time and I really am happy with the results</li>
            <li> Fantastic razors, work very well on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and great price.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman and have a slight mustache, buy them!</li>
            <li> I use them for shaving the eyebrow stubble that grows back (after i&#x27;ve shaped them with little scissors). they&#x27;re perfect. initially, they are VERY sharp, so be careful (i have cut myself a few times). but they get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me at all! Too dull and cheap. I considered sharpening them in order to get them to work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for removing the fine hair from your face.  I needed to play around with the angle a little, but once I found the proper direction and angle, it&#x27;s highly successful.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wish they would stay sharper longer. However, they do a really great job all around! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Pretty sharp. Nicked my forehead a bit once, but that was bad for from my end. Just gotta practice until you&#x27;ve got the hang of it, then it glides over your skin. It&#x27;s the best at removing little peach fuzz, and incredible at removing flaking skin! I used them for dermaplaning, and my face feels AWESOME! I have a small, finger-spray bottle that I fill with rubbing alcohol, to spray my face with (while holding my breathe), to sanitize my face after removing the peach fuzz and skin. It hurts like the dickens, but it&#x27;s better than dealing with the itchy, painful irritation that follows a dermaplaning routine. I recommend you sleep on a satin (or silk) pillow case at night after you&#x27;ve used these razors if you did some dermaplaning. I&#x27;ve noticed that cotton pillow cases will aggravate my skin since it&#x27;s overly delicate after removing so much dead skin. I sleep on the satin pillow case for about 2 days, while the sensitivity on my face calms down.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle tool. Not only does my face feel incredibly smooth afterwards but it also got rid of all my peach fuzz. I&#x27;m part Italian so, yes I had plenty of it. It even took care of my upper lip and chin too. No more trips for waxing! I highly recommend this to any woman. Even if you don&#x27;t have the peach fuzz, this works wonders for exfoliation too. I have been using a microderm paste twice a week and this tool gets a layer of dead skin that the paste doesn&#x27;t get. My makeup looks amazing and stays on so much better too. I was also nervous about using this for the first time but I quickly realized how easy it is.</li>
            <li> These are great. Not sharp, so perfect for someone elderly who may not have steady hands, or a teen who is just learning to care for her brows. DO NOT use an upward motion like a man when they shave their face! Go at about 40 degree angle, with small strokes. Works perfect! I use it on my face and brows. I only have to do it on my brows once every couple weeks! I will def re-order!</li>
            <li> Lets face it. We all have hair that we do not want places. If its lip, face, arm, etc. This works great. Doesnt hurt, snag, or tug on the skin. Really amazing.</li>
            <li> I do like these razors. Just be careful that they will cut your face if you don&#x27;t hold them in an angle.</li>
            <li> It never occurred to me that there was such an easy way to get rid of the peach fuzz covering my cheeks and jawline. What a difference this little razor makes!</li>
            <li> Great product. No more plucking my upper lip...I use this about every other week and I&#x27;ve no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer. Thank you Dr. Oz for the suggestion. Be aware this is a sharp&lt;br /&gt;blade--so, be gentle and use short strokes.</li>
            <li> Gabriella Eyebrows &amp; facial razor is in a word AWFUL! Poorest razor I have ever used!  Sadly I paid to have this product shipped separately from my Amazon order, and I&#x27;m Not about to pay shipping AGAIN to have this product returned. .  Can&#x27;t believe I fell for the hype... Joke&#x27;s on me... Lady&#x27;s beware...This product is a joke!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give these a try since they are more targeted towards women. What I found was that working with these can be frustrating and tedious. Honestly a razor will do the same job. I can understand if you want to use them for your eyebrows, but if it&#x27;s just a little peach fuzz I wouldn&#x27;t bother with them.</li>
            <li> I bought these facial razors based on the glowing reviews they got.  I don&#x27;t know what everyone else was reviewing, but what I received in the mail was not what I expected. They are useless.  They don&#x27;t work on the face AT ALL.  You might as well be using nothing.  The only thing they did was irritate my skin.  They are cheap and lesson learned-you get what you pay for.  So if your looking to irritate your skin than these razors are the ones for you.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it&#x27;s worked like magic. Simply put, amazing.</li>
            <li> Saw this on TV and a model was saying she shaves her face. I never knew women could shave their face and I really need to because some of my medication cause hair growth on women where you don&#x27;t want it, like on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it makes me feel better as a woman that I don&#x27;t have to be seen with facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these because everyone said they worked great, didn&#x27;t irritate the face, and didn&#x27;t make hair grow back like stubble. Well I guess it depends on the person. These no matter how I used them, at correct angle, I tried many angles after initially trying it, I always got irritated skin from them. Yea sure it removed the fuzz on my face, but I also have coarse black hairs that it doesn&#x27;t work on, it just irritated my face further then, and then I ended up growing face stubble all over my face. It&#x27;s a &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by the Dr.oz show. this is a great product&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and so worth it....&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great. No demagogue on the skin. Easy to grab the handle . You should try it too!</li>
            <li> I purchased these after I had previously used a facial razor that was a different brand.  These look exactly the same so I thought they would be fine.  They are angled differenly and the razor is a different length than the other brand, these do not do a great job and I could have easily cut myself every time I used them.  They left bumps on my face that I do not get with their competitor.  If you are looking for facial razors which I love to use, go with the other brand, Kai.</li>
            <li> Does not remove even the softest &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; from face. Feels VERY rough on skin &amp; causes redness. This is simply a fraudulent, useless product which is worthless!&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT purchase!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these on my eyebrows, I use them on my face to remove the peach fuzz.  Make sure you know how to use these before you do so you do it correctly.  I watched Uppiebeads59 on Youtube prior to purchasing, because she shows you how to use these type of razors correctly.  I do not recommend using on your eyebrows, that&#x27;s a whole new skill.</li>
            <li> it is NOT sharp and does NOT shave a single hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am someone who has never gotten their eyebrows waxed or tweaked or any of that jazz. I use these to clean up any small unsightly hairs. They work great!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I&#x27;ve been wanting to make my face and forearms smoother. While being post menopausal (yes, this is a TMI moment) has helped (and hurt) the hair quality on my face and arms, I&#x27;ve looked for an alternative to the painful and dread hot wax . . . which, to be done properly, really has to be paid for . . . which i refuse to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally love this razor -  it does a great job exfoliating as well as removing unwanted hair from my face and arms. I will still go to my preferred salon for a yearly dermaplaining and facial (just to pamper myself but,  I can maintain this softness between salon visits!</li>
            <li> I received these razors unpackaged, unsealed, in a padded envelope. Will not go to the expense of returning but have already thrown them away. Why would a company ship a sharp grooming instrument without being sealed for safety and cleanliness? Very unsanitary and I wouldn&#x27;t consider even trying them!</li>
            <li> Watch the very tip as it is extremely sharp and I have nicked myself several times. But this is an AWESOME product that saves me $50 a trip for derma planing. Great way to keep hair fuzz gone. I use about every 3-4 weeks and love how not only does it take off the hair, but exfoliates my skin and my makeup goes on so nicely. Have given these out to girlfriends and will always use.</li>
            <li> Must! have clicked. Wrong box and did not want these and tried them but not good as razor at all waste of my money and did not order and then get two packages junk!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered the womens&#x27; &amp;#34;facial razor&amp;#34;.  OMG is this a gift for the post-menopausal face!  (and, I&#x27;m sure, any age who has facial hair or peach fuzz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my #1 brand.  It&#x27;s effective, easy to use, I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all, and my skin GLOWS and is so smooth now!!  Applying serums, creams, foundations is wonderful now because my skin is completely smooth and fresher looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the FROMM brand (from Sally Beauty).  Both are good brands, but I do find the GABRIELLA to be my top choice, simply because of its effectiveness.  It just does a better job of removing hair.  And what an inexpensive way to solve the problem!  So Gabriella is the brand I&#x27;m using and it&#x27;s top-notch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I also tried a brand (I think it started with a &amp;#34;c&amp;#34;??) from Target.  It was awful.  Wasn&#x27;t a useful tool.  I returned it.  (sorry, can&#x27;t think of the exact brand but it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve only seen at Target so I think it might be a house brand...)</li>
            <li> Like the cover over the blade of the razor part.  It really does the trick of making you feel smooth!</li>
            <li> This does the job!  I got this for getting rid of baby hairs and dead skin on my face and neck and it does it really well.  I wouldn&#x27;t attempt this if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing because it is really easy to cut yourself.  Oh the upside it is super sharp so it does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, worked like advertised!!!! I recommend this product to my friends. Safe way to remove unwanted hair from your face or bikini area!</li>
            <li> Desperate and with scheduled dermatologist appointment 2 month ahead I was looking for easy, cheap quick fix for facial hair for very sensitive skin. I tried most of the cream ( the leave my skin with a rush and burned) , depilatory, tweezing, waxing, threading, the spring &amp;#34;thingy&amp;#34; ( one can just check over the years my shopping list) this seems to be truly nice easy fix - does not irritate skin, quick to use, will not leave cuts or burns; I was hesitant only at first move, but literally just second touch assured me this is save and easy to use and works like a charm -- and leaves skin smooth. Not long term solution, but quick enough that I can use it few times a week as needed without hurting my skin in any way or any pain.</li>
            <li> Fell apart immediately- cheap construction. I knew these were not going to be fantastic due to the price but I did expect them to last more that a couple of minutes. Seller promised to stop selling these on Amazon but they are still selling them</li>
            <li> they do not cut, total waste of money. no I do not recommend them. they seem to be very dull</li>
            <li> Was searching online for a way to get rid of facial hair, doing research on the web. I came across an article where the writer has said that she used this brand of razor - yes, RAZOR, - to shave her facial hair off. I did more research on this razor and was pleasantly surprised to read the positive reviews from users so I figured that I would give it a try, also. I LOVE it...I&#x27;m amazed at how gentle it is on my face!  It did take a couple of times using it to figure how to turn it at about a 45 degree angle to get the hair off cleanly. The razor is great for trimming eyebrows, too. I did a dry-shave so I don&#x27;t know if anyone else would use any cream but I have found that it takes a while for the hair to grow back in and it DOES NOT come in coarse but just as soft as ever. As a mature woman (in my 60&#x27;s) this has been a life-saver for me!!</li>
            <li> This 3-pack of razors come in cute pastel colors, and the blades on these are VERY sharp, so the shave is super close to the skin, but I find that using these for your eyebrows is almost impossible for me - the blade is just so long for that part of the face! I would say that these would work best if you&#x27;re looking to shave any other part of the face, like the upper lip, chin, unibrow area, or sideburns, but not for eyebrows. They just aren&#x27;t small enough to get into small areas without shaving off your entire eyebrow.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had dermaplaning performed by your esthetician, do not expect the same results with this razor.  But for the price and utility, overall, it is a good product and does the job WELL under a $50 visit to get professional dermaplaning.  In California (I don&#x27;t know the rules in other states), an esthetician MUST be operating out of a physician&#x27;s office to perform dermaplaning because the blade is a surgical blade and VERY sharp.  But going to a medical esthetician can be very cost prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it, simulating the same strokes my esthetician uses and I did notice a lot of very fine hairs as well as dead skin being removed.  It provided me a similar (but not as good) outcome as a professional job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is easy to hold and once you get the hang of it, it works very well.  Each razor has a clear blade protector to protect the blade when not in use.  The blade also has safety guard so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you could slice your face!  :)  Good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package instructions are very minimal and I would not recommend for use as a substitute for dermaplaning unless you are already very familiar with the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and did not leave a stubble or rough feeling after use.  I am very happy that I found this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after using a couple of other brands (ineffective ones) this one surprised me !! It does a great job on the face!!  It took 5 minutes or so to get the hang of it, the angle you hold it, the light pressure exertion, but I finally got it and was amazed at the hair it took off.  I love the feeling of that smooth skin exposed when the hair is gone.  I do not use it on eyebrows, I am too chicken, but do use it on the peach fuzz on neck and face.</li>
            <li> As we get older those pesky hairs pop up. These razors are magnificent! Got rid of all those tinny little hairs I could and couldn&#x27;t see! Save me tons of time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a friend recommended it to me to use as a razor. It does not work as well as I thought  therefore I cannot recommend it</li>
            <li> good little gadgets work as they should... not totally sharp but that good cuz I don&#x27;t want cut skin</li>
            <li> Work terrific, no harsh edges, great price!</li>
            <li> These one was the most durable razure I ever had</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find the normal brand of razor I use domestically, so opted to try this one instead. I mean, how different could they be, right?  Wrong. This razor is a sad imitation of Shiseido - catching on skin, leaving it very irritated and not getting rid of hair effectively. I disliked it so much, I paid $30 for expedited international shipping to get my regular razor back ASAP. I will just be junking them since they aren&#x27;t worth the time/money to return ship, and won&#x27;t be letting this brand touch my skin again.  Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. That is all I know... she uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using these correctly but they seem to be awkwardly shaped for brows.  The way you have to use them - against the hair growth- makes it hard to get the blade exactly where you want it for precise eyebrow work.  I&#x27;ve actually gone back to tweezers because I found these annoying to work with.</li>
            <li> These are great. So glad I found them at Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> This is a really good razor .. but you have to be careful.  I really like the one I have.</li>
            <li> Great product very happy with the shipping time and the way the blades work. Easy to use, and has cover to keep blade sharp.</li>
            <li> YES&lt;br /&gt;I am a man, whatever. I still get peach fuzz. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable running my Gillette across my cheeks and forehead, so these razors are perf. Makes my skin look softer/smoother/clearer. Is it helping my acne? Idk. I think so. No? Yes? My acne is improving idk. Don&#x27;t rule it out. Idk. Works great haha.</li>
            <li> It works, but you have to hold it and use it just so to make it take the hair off. I think, with practice, I will like them much better. They are cheap too--no batteries--love that.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Will be repurchasing! Love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It might be user fault I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Ran across these little razors looking for something else and ordered them specifically for the fuzz starting to show up on my face. I did also start to use them to touch up my eyebrows in-between my threading appointments. They have worked well for both of the uses they are promoted for.</li>
            <li> Love these for facial dermaplaning.  For the do it yourself ladies who want to save a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Love these for shaving facial hair and eyebrows. They stay sharp for along time and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The razors are great but I still get a little razor burn with this brand.  Just go slow when using them and pay attention to the more delicate places on your face.</li>
            <li> Cute colors and they work well just as advertised! Only reason its not a 5 is because it made my chin break out...</li>
            <li> For years, I have been doing my own at home waxing and I have the whole GiGi set up. However, I can sometimes get lazy and slack a bit on my once a week waxing, I LOVE THESE. I just got them last week and I immediately used one on my entire face. I love it even more than waxing. It gets rid of all the unwanted hair, much easier than waxing, it is less painful and gives a much more even surface to the face than what waxing does. My makeup goes on wonderfully. Again, today was just the second day that I have used one of these, but so far so awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, a definite five stars for me.</li>
            <li> Delivery: Excellent.  Due between 12-18 Feb 15, received 14 Feb--very happy.  I&#x27;ve already try it and it does work on peach fuzz and my fine blond hair on my face. It takes very little pressure on the peach fuzz and needs a little pressure for the fine hair. Short downward strokes works best.  I also tried it on my legs and it worked as well.  I have a small amount of black medium hair on my legs.  This is a keeper product....</li>
            <li> This razor is great. Does a good job removing facial hair in-between laser treatments. Leaves skin smooth and soft. Never any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of facial razors.  The blades are dull after one or two uses.  These last a really long time and do a great job.</li>
            <li> These are the only items I use on my face.  I had never had facial hair until I turned 50ish...  Very traumatizing, until I found these little babies...</li>
            <li> I was hoping this could replace the epilator I use on my very fine facial hair. The epilator usually lasts about a year or two before it breaks or I drop it on my tile floor (emjoi optima is the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m about to buy my 5th one).  The Gabriella razors just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.  Since my epilator broke, I&#x27;ve been using a gillette razor every once in a while for the peach fuzz on my face, and not only does the gillette work better than the Gabriella razors, the gillette seems safer and less abrasive.  I have rosacea, and the scraping of the Gab razor irritates my skin even more than the epilator does!  I gave a Gab razor to my mom and sister.  Mom liked it, but said she&#x27;d never buy since her regular razor works just as well.  My sister said it was ok.  She&#x27;s too scared to use a regular razor on her face and too whimpy to use an epilator. She said the Gab razor was good to just scrape the tiny hairs from her upper lip, but she wouldnt use it on her whole face because she&#x27;s afraid she&#x27;d cut herself.  Hope this review is helpful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with facial hair.....and these razors are amazing! I have mostly fine and some coarse hairs on my face and these razors defanilty get the job done. They are so easy to use and leave your skin feeling so soft. I used to get my face threaded....which hurts sooo bad, but not no more.... at a fraction of the price and no pain I&#x27;m defanitly using these from now on. I would 100% recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big for the small areas around the eyes, but it works great! Just have to hold it at the right angle and it will do the job!</li>
            <li> I love these better than the ones at the beauty supply store... razors are very sharp which i loved</li>
            <li> These razors are a waste of money.  They do not work on your face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it.  I like the Touch and Bro better.  This was to rough on my face.  Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick. You can easily shave skin around eyebrows without cuts. The blades are not overly sharp.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for removal,of facial hair for me.  Maybe for someone else, but if facial hair&#x27;s a problem for you. This is definitely not a product that&#x27;s going to help. Save your money &amp; buy something more effective, like an epilator, for example.</li>
            <li> Not a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I use these to trim my facial hair, and sometimes to clean up my eyebrows a little if I&#x27;m in a hurry. I love them.</li>
            <li> They became too dull after the 3rd or 4th use.</li>
            <li> I find them hard to use. Hard to get the right angle to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and had been considering facial shaving for a while. I had that fine hair that liquid and powder stuck to. Well I decided to try these razors, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! I have dry shaved my face without any irritation, and my skin improved dramatically after about the 3rd go. Makeup went on like silk, people asked me what I did differently. I stopped going for expensive microderm, as this did a BETTER job, with less irritation. These blades have a guard, it is almost impossible to cut yourself. I have used the first razor for 4shaves, about 2 weeks apart and it still shaves great.My pores are smaller, I wish o had discovered these razors long ago</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by the packaging, or the fact that it is made in Korea and shipped from Hong Kong-this product is wonderful.  I had another shaver (battery operated) for years but this one shaves my upper lip, sides of my face smooth, without leaving any &amp;#34;lady stubble&#x27;s&amp;#34;,  So much better than my older one.  And the price is fantastic plus you get 3.  Would I buy it again, absolutely and it arrived 2 weeks before estimated delivery. Nancy</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors to try out dermaplaning at home after reading other reviews. These razors are perfect and I find it hard to actually accidentally cut myself with these razors which was an initial concern. I would recommend these razors for anyone that wants to try out dermaplaning without spending too much money at a spa.</li>
            <li> this razor works well for fine (and coarse) facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the razors are different colors so it is possible to use the same one until&lt;br /&gt;it becomes dull.&lt;br /&gt;this is not an outstanding product but it works well.</li>
            <li> This really works to shave off that fine hair that I want to get rid of around my upper lip and chin.  I was amazed at how well it got it all.</li>
            <li> Easy to use product! So much better than tweezing!!! Will use this from now on. Now I have perfect brows everyday and it is so effortless!</li>
            <li> I chose five stars because they work.  Price is reasonable.  Not high tech but they do the job.  I use it on my cheek, chin.  My hair is light in color and fine but I prefer a smooth face for makeup application and product penetration.</li>
            <li> They work better and faster then what I had been using however, I don&#x27;t like the way the blade is; its just a little too sharp and doesn&#x27;t take the hair off even or close enough, I&#x27;m glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> Just go for your shaver...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these recommended a lot, so I thought I&#x27;d grab &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap bic razors from a dollar store do the job better, faster, and safer. Make one wrong move and you cut yourself with these things. And I had to go over areas multiple times, which caused skin irritation. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It works great! and is easy and safe to use.  Wish I would have found this years ago.  My eyebrows look fab.</li>
            <li> Love using these, they are very good at removing hair.</li>
            <li> The tip is longer than I had hoped for, which makes it harder to contour to my face. Also, the end is scratchy and can damage sensitive skin. Still gets the job done, so three stars, but I won&#x27;t be ordering this brand again.</li>
            <li> I really like this little razor much more than I expected. It is so handy to shave those little pesky facial hairs and much less painful than plucking.  Also good to shave tops of toes and feet.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. I had seen it advertised and was so glad I found it. Smoother and easier to use.</li>
            <li> They are good but the edges top and bottom are not well covered it scratches me. Got to be very careful. I have a Sallys one and that one doesn&#x27;t do that. But can&#x27;t find them anywhere to buy those ones.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended these for that peach fuzz on the upper lip and they work great for that purpose. I tried using them to remove some fine hairs under my eyebrows, but found them too long to maneuver in that tight space. I&#x27;m going to look for something with a smaller blade for under the brows.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and I have been very happy with the results. I would definitely make this purchase again</li>
            <li> You can use them more than once and they are very effective without injury to my skin.</li>
            <li> Really! Ouch...and the hair does grow back darker and more stubbly...would not recommend.</li>
            <li> 2 -&amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34; up.</li>
            <li> I just love these, perfect for shaping the eyebrow, just like at the salon but cheaper.  Worth it to try them out!</li>
            <li> I gained so much knowledge from this book! I recommend it to anyone, especially students just getting out of college. This book will help you to become &amp;#34;noticed&amp;#34; and will set you apart from the crowd.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but it is really Sharp. I don&#x27;t know how to use it and just started to shave&lt;br /&gt;.a little of my eyebrow is gone at the end. I will find out how to use it and you can&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li> Just purchased and these do not work. I even tried on my arm, still doesn&#x27;t work. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Tried these, because honestly they were too cheap not to, and they work better than the personal womans battery shavers. The slim design makes it easy to see what your doing, and it has something on the razor that makes it seem safer than a simple straight razor. I didnt receive any nicks/cuts. It would be nice to have more of a point, but havent seen that anywhere. I&#x27;ll buy these in bulk now!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love using these to clean up stray hairs around the eyebrows and getting rid of facial hair.  You have to be careful in using it, but they are the greatest little tool to have in your beauty kit.</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them on my eyebrows, trimming nose hair, and any other hair you want to shave. These are disposable, but I use them a few times before I throw them away. Always be sure to clean them with rubbing alcohol after use on face area. Always thoroughly dry them as they will rust.&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp but have a protective wire over them, so I never end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and it was shipped quickly!! It was just like one I had bought before at Walmart. Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Based on the large number of great reviews for this product I had high hopes that it would be the perfect solution to remove some of the fine hairs I have on my chin but to do that it required much more pressure against the skin and going over the same spot several times than it would just using a regular men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s disposable razor. Even applying more pressure when using this razor still didn&#x27;t remove the hairs as well as a regular disposable razor or tweezers would so these things went in the trash.</li>
            <li> These razors didn&#x27;t work for me ... but that does&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t work for you.  Give them a try.  Shaving gave me too many painful and unsightly ingrown hairs on my face, and it left me with red razor burns on my delicate skin.  Not the look I was going for!  I&#x27;ll stick with plucking for now.</li>
            <li> These razors are worth every penny! They pick up fine and course hair, doesn&#x27;t cut the skin and leaves skin smooth. Hope Amazon keeps these razors on their site. Glad to get rid of my wax creams that don&#x27;t work as well as these wondderful razors.</li>
            <li> This razor gets the job done but it is hard to master technique and not cut or scrape the skin.  Better left to the pros.</li>
            <li> Not the best only because the razors are too long for precision.</li>
            <li> i have ordered these regularly over the last two years. works great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I use these for my eyebrows and they&#x27;re very precise. Great for shaping!</li>
            <li> Great product! Wish I would have found this sooner in life.</li>
            <li> I wish the blade was not quite as long as it is, 3/4 of the size would be optimal for eyebrow maintenance. I wish that the blade was sharper too to get a closer shave. Best little razor I have found anyway.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are too dull to cut without pulling.  I still like the &amp;#34;Touch N Brow&amp;#34;  the best.  I wish Touch N Brow would make them even a tad sharper.  At least these last for many cuts before they feel like the new Gabriella does.  Sorry Gabriella, I tried yours and will either throw out or give them away.  Not worth the pulling to me.</li>
            <li> Or use this on my face as well</li>
            <li> These are a great deal and work wonderfully for removing facial hair for women. You need to be careful because they are very sharp, and not being careful one time I was carrying one and took a nasty slice out of my thumb. Overall though, as long as you are careful using them they work wonderfully. I like these because they also don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but do a great job and leave your skin nice and smooth. Using these on facial hair has left me feeling much better and less self-conscience. These also give you a nice fast solution that doesn&#x27;t leave you with the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> Item is made of cheap plastic.  One of them broke on first use.  Threw them out, found better ones at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> this is a super clean shave for eyebrows, chin, lip area etc.  Just dont be too vigorous in shaving or else you will redden the skin.  I liked it a lot and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> ordered  for my mom who&#x27;s  older and says  you get more hair on your face with age. I used  it  on her  and  it shaved  so  great!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with  my purchase.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried, but should work</li>
            <li> They get the job done and don&#x27;t burn my skin.  I will order more.</li>
            <li> This arrived NOT new and NOT in the package. The caps were cracked, the blades had residue on them...Something that will be coming in contact with your skin should be packaged for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the Gabriella Razors.  I instead received the Twinkle.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> lousy...dull...will not buy again...scrapes the skin but doesn&#x27;t cut the hair without going over and over the skin causing abrasion</li>
            <li> These are awesome for getting the peach fuzz off your chin/sideburns (yes I am a woman). I find that each razor is only good for 7-8 uses (probably more if you are only using it for your eyebrows). I use it for my eyebrows from time to time but it is more awkward to use perfectly on the brows. But as someone who was so nervous to use this on her face other than her eyebrows, I can assure you that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back thicker or tougher than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle razor as I used to get my eyebrows threaded and my sideburns threaded and threading has amazing results but it hurts like crazy-- especially on the sideburns area. SO glad I don&#x27;t need to put myself through so much pain to be hairless. Plus this way is really cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses this to clean up errant hairs in between his eyebrows. I order 3 or 4 packs at a time and never travel without one. (Although it isn&#x27;t an intended use also, they have come in handy when traveling when I don&#x27;t have a knife or scissors around and i need to cut string it packaging on a toy for my kid or something)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last hint: if your doing your face I have found it is more effective to use the razor when your face is on the drier (not right after you moisturize).</li>
            <li> These are awesome for eyebrows!</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost you can give yourself the ultimate facial topper! Remove facial hair and the top layer of dead skin and reveal the soft smooth fresh new skin below. This is the perfect &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; exfoliant.........and it doesn&#x27;t cost $$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying $50 + a tip for dermaplaning to have my facial hair removed. To make you feel like you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth, they turn it into a 30-40 minute facial. So, aside from the money, I don&#x27;t like the time investment either. At my last one, I noted the tool she was using to remove the hair. It was these - or something like these. Got them yesterday and tried them out. Perfect. Perfect. I will be ordering more and keeping them on-hand.</li>
            <li> Great razor for that little fuzz or more that it is so annoying . It does exactly what it stated on the product</li>
            <li> this is the best and works very good and the blade is perfect,everyone should get it its worth the money and it came on time</li>
            <li> I use this for the hair on my top lip - I&#x27;ve only had to use this twice in a month.  I also cut my own hair and have used them to shave my &amp;#34;side burns&amp;#34; and the back of my neck.  These work 10 times better than a razor!  Fast shipping also.  Thanks again!</li>
