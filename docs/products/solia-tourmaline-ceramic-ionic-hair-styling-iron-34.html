            <li>Very nice flat iron.</li>
            <li>SOLIA MAKES A GREAT FLAT IRON THAT IS FOR ALL HAIR TYPES!!!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited-</li>
            <li>And the plates don&#x27;t swivel, so it&#x27;s pretty smooth,  but not as smooth as it could be.</li>
            <li>Great hot iron for short hair.</li>
            <li>It is every bit as good as my larger one</li>
            <li>It heat up really quickly and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>It was taking me more than twice the amount of time it normally takes to do my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a nice flat iron and this one is perfect!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SIZE BECAUSE I HAVE SHORT HAIR</li>
            <li>Gentle on my fine, nearly all gray hair.</li>
            <li>The reviews were mostly positive, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>It is fun, but for those occasions I want to look neat and professional</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and is shinier and perfectly straight after use.</li>
            <li>Its a real quality product.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good but not great.  </li>
            <li>Also the only unit that I could find in the 3/4&amp;#34; width in a full size straightener.</li>
            <li>Love this ionic flat iron, it does not dry my hair out!</li>
            <li>I was not familiar with the name brand,  but am very well pleased.  </li>
            <li>The Solia Toumatine Ceramic 3/4 inch flat iron ran true to temp settings and handled well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who has shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand, wish I would have bought sooner.</li>
            <li>I choose this flat iron because the 3/4\\&quot; size works much better with my short hair</li>
            <li>I know the flat iron got so hot and started meliting the wool protector pouch and the plastic on the iron.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got a defective product, but this thing only straightens a fraction of the 3/4&amp;#34; it&#x27;s capable of.</li>
            <li>Especially if you are concerned about getting your edges straight.</li>
            <li>I have used mine daily for a few years, still going strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this since i recently cut my hair very short and my current iron was 1 1/4&amp;#34; and too large.</li>
            <li>I bought a Solia flat iron in high school and 12 years later, it finally stopped working.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair that I keep relatively short cut.  </li>

            <li> This is my third Solia flat iron.  </li>
            <li> the plates only touch at the end of the flat</li>
            <li> Adjustable temp is a must when using flat irons, not everyones hair is the same.</li>
            <li> I had this flat iron for over a year and just recently I noticed the temperature was getting hotter when I was holding it.  </li>
            <li> Here are a couple articles I found that helped me decided on this flat iron:  </li>
            <li> I have had Chi and FHI flat irons and this one tops them all.  </li>
            <li> the curls last a long time.   </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t grip the flat iron to make the plates touch unless you want to burn your fingertips off...,</li>
            <li> I would purchase the larger size down the road when I grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a 1\\&quot; Chi flat iron, but the cord frayed and Farouk refused to honor their warranty.</li>
            <li> I just brought a pink one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I am African American with very thick hair and this iron leaves my hair silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> My larger flat iron is a very expensive brand</li>
            <li> Severely disappointed with the quality of Solia right now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off,  which is annoying.</li>

            <li> Great and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IRON.  IT GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT AND THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A PERSON OF COLOR. I LOVE THE SIZE BECAUSE I HAVE SHORT HAIR NOW JUST CUT OFF 3 INCHES.  BUT I KNOW WHEN I GROW MY HAIR BACK OUT IT WILL STILL BE THE PERFECT SIZE IRON.  ITS ALSO WONDERFUL THAT I CAN ADJUST THE HEAT BECAUSE SOME FLAT IRONS ARE JUST TOO HOT AND BREAK OFF MY HAIR.  SOLIA MAKES A GREAT FLAT IRON THAT IS FOR ALL HAIR TYPES!!!</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome! I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a nice flat iron and this one is perfect! Highly recommend for anyone who has shorter hair. The 3/4 &amp;#34; plates are perfect for getting those really really short pieces of haor underneath!</li>
            <li> Well im a Dude and it really works on my hair, pretty awesome Striaghtner guys!!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed.  It heat up really quickly and it does the job.  I would definitely buy this product in multiple sizes.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and my hair is wavy. It is fun, but for those occasions I want to look neat and professional I straighten my hair. I previously owned a 1\\&quot; Chi flat iron, but the cord frayed and Farouk refused to honor their warranty. I choose this flat iron because the 3/4\\&quot; size works much better with my short hair and it comes from a reputable company.

            <li> This is my third Solia flat iron.  I have a 1 1/4, 1 and 1/2 inch.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  I just brought a pink one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Love this ionic flat iron, it does not dry my hair out!</li>
            <li> I have had Chi and FHI flat irons and this one tops them all.  I am African American with very thick hair and this iron leaves my hair silky and shiny! It looks like I went to the salon and the size is perfect for my new short cut.  Also, what I love most is my hair does not frizz and I don&#x27;t get that burnt hair smell.  My hair looks healthy and shiny (I do use heat protectant) and I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day, the curls last a long time.   Highly recommend this brand, wish I would have bought sooner.</li>
            <li> I have the 1 inch styling iron. Purchased this one for my niece who had heard me rave about the quality of Solia. My hair feels healthier and is shinier and perfectly straight after use. I have used mine daily for a few years, still going strong. (I don&#x27;t wrap the cord around the iron, but keep the iron in its case. That will definitely extend the life of your cord.)</li>
            <li> I bought a Solia flat iron in high school and 12 years later, it finally stopped working. I bought this one as a replacement and I was so excited- until I used it. Maybe I got a defective product, but this thing only straightens a fraction of the 3/4&amp;#34; it&#x27;s capable of. It was taking me more than twice the amount of time it normally takes to do my hair. Upon further inspection, I figured out why-- the plates only touch at the end of the flat iron-- and you can&#x27;t grip the flat iron to make the plates touch unless you want to burn your fingertips off..., Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Severely disappointed with the quality of Solia right now.</li>
            <li> I bought this since i recently cut my hair very short and my current iron was 1 1/4&amp;#34; and too large. My larger flat iron is a very expensive brand and I didn&#x27;t want to spend 200 dollars on this one. The reviews were mostly positive, so I decided to try it. It is every bit as good as my larger one and it is so plates glide so smoothly through my hair! Some flat irons have plates that just don&#x27;t smooth the hair easily, but this one is very good! I would purchase the larger size down the road when I grow my hair out.😊</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic straightener.  I have thin, fine hair that I keep relatively short cut.  This works great with my hair.  I love the temperature control and the grip of the unit. I was not familiar with the name brand,  but am very well pleased.  Also the only unit that I could find in the 3/4&amp;#34; width in a full size straightener.</li>
            <li> Adjustable temp is a must when using flat irons, not everyones hair is the same. Id recommend this one for any men that have short hair and dont want something girly looking. Its a real quality product.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good but not great.  It doesn&#x27;t have auto shut off,  which is annoying. And the plates don&#x27;t swivel, so it&#x27;s pretty smooth,  but not as smooth as it could be.</li>
            <li> Great hot iron for short hair. I would recommend for everyone</li>
            <li> Great flat iron. Gentle on my fine, nearly all gray hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Very nice flat iron. The Solia Toumatine Ceramic 3/4 inch flat iron ran true to temp settings and handled well. Especially if you are concerned about getting your edges straight.</li>
            <li> I had this flat iron for over a year and just recently I noticed the temperature was getting hotter when I was holding it.  Next thing I know the flat iron got so hot and started meliting the wool protector pouch and the plastic on the iron.I noticed parts of my hair were fried.  I guess don&#x27;t trust it after one year because it overheated and damaged my hair. I am now wondering if it would of caused a house fire luckily I caught it in time!</li>
