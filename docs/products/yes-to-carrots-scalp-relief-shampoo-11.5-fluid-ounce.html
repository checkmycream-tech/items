            <li>not giving up just yet , it feels good smells good, but my problem is still there.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t perfect because it DOES contain a product that is in the SLS family but is not SLS, but it is fine to use once a week, and I purchased the conditioner and it makes a nice cowash.</li>
            <li>Considering the price difference I would say that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked carrots.</li>
            <li>Seems to be great for my hair leaving it shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for many moons for a good dandruff shampoo without as many yucky chemicals as head and shoulders.</li>

            <li>but I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li>thanfully, the smell is very light and doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li>Total win in our book!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I just dyed my hair, and i noticed that my color tends to get more brassy when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Sure I was highstrung and under a lot of stress.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried many products before this</li>
            <li>I Really love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>When I get stressed, I tend to scratch more.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this shampoo (and it&#x27;s accompanying conditioner) because it&#x27;s practically solved all my problems.  </li>
            <li>Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner are working superbly for me after two months of daily use and there is no damage</li>
            <li>OK - Carrots?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with itchy or irritated scalp most of my life (but no dandruff).  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo and the Scalp Relief Conditioner every day, and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The smell could be better.</li>
            <li>Good smell, leaves hair feeling clean and not overly drying, free of petroleum, no SLS,</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells pretty good, lathers, and doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and healthy looking even with color and a perm!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different anti dandruff shampoos and this one does a really great job.  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;s very happy with the results he&#x27;s getting and the fact that he&#x27;s being exposed to less toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Cleans my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>Fine shampoo,</li>
            <li>It feels very light, and has a citrusy, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Very soothing blend, love the tea tree oil perfect for my eczema and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I also tried this because a couple of people mentioned that it helps smooth the hair out.</li>
            <li>They no longer have dandruff flakes and their scalps are itch free as well.</li>
            <li>but this really does the trick and has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I may consider buying again if I cannot find another affordable sulfate free option, although I may just try adding tea tree oil to another shampoo product before I buy again.</li>
            <li>hair feels light and tingly, removes flakes and itchiness.</li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>But this particular formula has a kind of medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled that there&#x27;s an all natural alternative for T Gel!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful shampoo that gently strips all of the built up oils on my hair while soothing my previously dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>it really probly is a good shampoo, it smells good and feels good, but my dry scalp came back after just 5 days, so i wouldnt recommend this product for &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; control</li>
            <li>Work great on a dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling really clean and scalp tingly.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft and works much better on my scalp condition than most products.</li>
            <li>Scalp feels clean and not itchy at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of dandruff shampoo out there - natural and chemical ridden!</li>
            <li>Nothing really special about it from my use.</li>
            <li>the product looks used and the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>These have helped the breaking out on my scalp tremendously and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling coated and waxy.</li>
            <li>I chose it originally because I wanted a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many times that tea tree is a good answer to the itchy scalp, and the one I tried in the past also had peppermint which is a skin irritant, so I thought maybe I&#x27;d give the tea tree oil shampoos</li>
            <li>helped my itchy head after the first use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle...very pleased!</li>
            <li>I stopped using most strongly chemical shampoos several years ago.</li>
            <li>This was kind of my last resort as I was going over to a more natural products and just decided to try another.</li>
            <li>But I was at Target and saw this product, and it claimed success in something like 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>This shampoo has worked better to clear the build-up than any medicated shampoo specifically made for psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Yeah right I thought.</li>
            <li>oh that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>They are right.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other notes: my hair feels very clean and is pretty soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This has no perfume and has a small amount of tea tree oil along with a lot of great scalp nourishing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is my husbands second favorite scalp shampoo.</li>
            <li>His first being Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so shiny, smooth and felt so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This shampoo cured my itchy scalp - thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Smells better than the regular line of yes to carrots.</li>
            <li>I needed a product to control dandruff and purchased this product because it was sulfate free and consisted of mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>, it makes a nice, satisfying lather, no parabens, and my hair is shiny, silky and tangles are significantly decreased.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>But I have pretty normal hair, so it&#x27;s not difficult for me to find shampoos that work well for my hair, just need something to help my scalp.</li>
            <li>and it easily tangles at the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo, combined with the conditioner, alleviated my daughters dry scalp immediately.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair that gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, and it smells great, but my scalp is still itchy...  :-/</li>
            <li>I  had dry flaky scalp and now it is much better with the shampoo I would buy again</li>
            <li>I never write reviews because most products never really live up to their claims.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo my hair is clean, barely any dandruff, and NO ITCHING!</li>
            <li>and my husband always went back to the chemical filled ones - because he needed the relief.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.  </li>
            <li>Really works well to help my scalp from dryness.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t get rid of my intense scalp itch, which seems to be going away on</li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t do much to return moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>I try to rotate in a purple shampoo every week, but that doesn&#x27;t really help my scalp.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus it works very well on my daughters hair too.</li>
            <li>Dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t really help since I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It really smells like carrots</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>doesnt really tingle my scalp.  </li>
            <li>If you have folliculitis it does not seem to work very well,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo that would relieve my itchy flaky scalp, and this one is definitely not the solution.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an opinion on how well it works to other items in the same market, but it does work better than other sulfate free shampoos, and definitely better than shampoos with sulfates.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;ll never miss those other chemical filled shampoos again!</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil (or maybe some other ingredient) just irritates my scalp and makes it more itchy.</li>
            <li>It took only three days for me to see significant results.</li>
            <li>If you have ethnic hair that is a 3 or 4 in curl pattern, make sure to do a ore-poo (oil up your hair before shampooing ) to avoid your hair being stripped of its natural oils as this shampoo feels like a clarifying shampoo because it left my hair aqueaky clean to the point of being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Of recent I&#x27;ve been trying to be far more conscious of what we take in - both in eating and by the products we&#x27;re using at home.</li>
            <li>You get more in this bottle for quite a bit less in price.</li>
            <li>Trying mainly because it has no SLS detergent.</li>
            <li>I gave up after two uses and gave it to my husband (he&#x27;s not as particular as I am).</li>
            <li>Makes my long hair very soft, is affordable and made with good ingredients compared to a lot of other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also trying to switch to using more natural products, and T Gel has some pretty harsh</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So I did a little research and found there weren&#x27;t many at all.</li>
            <li>About a six months ago I developed a hormonal imbalance, and as a result my hair became very oily.</li>
            <li>His scalp skin looked normal, nothing visible to worry about, no allergies.</li>
            <li>Which is incredible because in the past the itching or the oily hair wouldnt let me last that long.</li>
            <li>So pretty much the same review for the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Love that it is 95% natural (although it does have a few nasties in there)</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft, and not a flake in sight!</li>
            <li>In fact, all I need is a little dry shampoo the next day and my hair still looks good.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft but does nothing for my dandruff and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to it and had itchy scalp but no dandruff.</li>
            <li>1-2 uses and no dandruff so far.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that it really didn&#x27;t seem to soothe my scalp</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a good-smelling, natural Shampoo then buy this.  </li>
            <li>I realize it isn&#x27;t all natural, but for me it worked: http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Minute-Moisturizer-Treatment/dp/B00FIZGN2Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_41?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422134138&amp;sr&#x3D;1-41&amp;keywords&#x3D;dandruff+head+and+shoulders.</li>
            <li>With sensitive skin, I appreciate the natural approach.</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, it has decreased the dandruff about 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Head was not less dry after consistent use.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, nor will it linger all day, just a subtle fresh aroma right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>recently tried an organic shampoo i found on amazon, worked the first day, and the next day the itching returned.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Dandruff shampoos, Sulfate free shampoos, expensive shampoos, cheap shampoos, for normal, oily, and dry hair.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil shampoos are really stinky and make my hair really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my dandruff and dries my hair out if I use as my regular daily shampoo.  </li>
            <li>had scalp issues and this seems to be only shampoo and cond brand that really helps.&lt;br /&gt;i think the tea tree is the key</li>
            <li>I generally like the Yes line of products.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s clearly getting relief from this product and I can say his flaky scalp hasn&#x27;t come back at all!</li>
            <li>After trying various dandruff shampoos (Head &amp; Shoulders, Clear Scalp, etc)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do get a small amount of dandruff, but i think thats normal since im taking two days between washing, its not there the first day though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried expensive salon brand tea tree shampoos, but nothing that I really liked or have stuck with.  </li>
            <li>It takes at least a day and half for it get greasy again, which is an amazing improvement over 2-3 hours before it gets too oily.</li>
            <li>When I first read the description I thought the product was a bit odd.</li>
            <li>It also helps my mild dandruff--I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very worried because using a shampoo like head and shoulders would pretty much mean getting several inches getting chopped off.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shampoo, and the Yes To... brand in general!</li>
            <li>My scalp was less itchy after the first use, and I&#x27;m seeing fewer flakes, and the slight yellowish tinge and large, scaly looking white flakes are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have some tea tree oil but enough to help but not dry.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s partially related to a new job where the air is very dry and partially related to another product</li>
            <li>In my findings, when you are suffering from dandruff, normally there is some other medical underlying problem going on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the conditioner on my scalp and roots on a few occasions and it washed out clean and my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now I like them even more!</li>
            <li> It is amazing, i wash my hair on Monday, and i dont have to wash it again until Thursday, so i can take two days off washing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own with unmedicated shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> nice tea tree shampoo</li>
            <li> my scalp was honestly healed in maybe 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo a lot.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked carrots.</li>
            <li> Seems to be great for my hair leaving it shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for many moons for a good dandruff shampoo without as many yucky chemicals as head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, love this brand!</li>
            <li> but this one by far works the best for me.</li>
            <li> but I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li> thanfully, the smell is very light and doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> Total win in our book!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I just dyed my hair, and i noticed that my color tends to get more brassy when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Sure I was highstrung and under a lot of stress.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried many products before this</li>
            <li> I Really love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> When I get stressed, I tend to scratch more.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I love this shampoo (and it&#x27;s accompanying conditioner) because it&#x27;s practically solved all my problems.  </li>
            <li> Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner are working superbly for me after two months of daily use and there is no damage</li>
            <li> OK - Carrots?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my favorite shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with itchy or irritated scalp most of my life (but no dandruff).  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and the Scalp Relief Conditioner every day, and I love them.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The smell could be better.</li>
            <li> Good smell, leaves hair feeling clean and not overly drying, free of petroleum, no SLS,</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells pretty good, lathers, and doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and healthy looking even with color and a perm!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different anti dandruff shampoos and this one does a really great job.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s very happy with the results he&#x27;s getting and the fact that he&#x27;s being exposed to less toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> Fine shampoo,</li>
            <li> It feels very light, and has a citrusy, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Very soothing blend, love the tea tree oil perfect for my eczema and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I also tried this because a couple of people mentioned that it helps smooth the hair out.</li>
            <li> They no longer have dandruff flakes and their scalps are itch free as well.</li>
            <li> but this really does the trick and has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I may consider buying again if I cannot find another affordable sulfate free option, although I may just try adding tea tree oil to another shampoo product before I buy again.</li>
            <li> hair feels light and tingly, removes flakes and itchiness.</li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> But this particular formula has a kind of medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled that there&#x27;s an all natural alternative for T Gel!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo that gently strips all of the built up oils on my hair while soothing my previously dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> it really probly is a good shampoo, it smells good and feels good, but my dry scalp came back after just 5 days, so i wouldnt recommend this product for &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; control</li>
            <li> Work great on a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling really clean and scalp tingly.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and works much better on my scalp condition than most products.</li>
            <li> Scalp feels clean and not itchy at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of dandruff shampoo out there - natural and chemical ridden!</li>
            <li> Nothing really special about it from my use.</li>
            <li> the product looks used and the bottle wasn&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li> These have helped the breaking out on my scalp tremendously and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling coated and waxy.</li>
            <li> I chose it originally because I wanted a more natural product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many times that tea tree is a good answer to the itchy scalp, and the one I tried in the past also had peppermint which is a skin irritant, so I thought maybe I&#x27;d give the tea tree oil shampoos</li>
            <li> helped my itchy head after the first use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle...very pleased!</li>
            <li> I stopped using most strongly chemical shampoos several years ago.</li>
            <li> This was kind of my last resort as I was going over to a more natural products and just decided to try another.</li>
            <li> But I was at Target and saw this product, and it claimed success in something like 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked better to clear the build-up than any medicated shampoo specifically made for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Yeah right I thought.</li>
            <li> oh that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> They are right.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other notes: my hair feels very clean and is pretty soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This has no perfume and has a small amount of tea tree oil along with a lot of great scalp nourishing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This is my husbands second favorite scalp shampoo.</li>
            <li> His first being Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so shiny, smooth and felt so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This shampoo cured my itchy scalp - thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Smells better than the regular line of yes to carrots.</li>
            <li> I needed a product to control dandruff and purchased this product because it was sulfate free and consisted of mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> , it makes a nice, satisfying lather, no parabens, and my hair is shiny, silky and tangles are significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> Her hair feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> But I have pretty normal hair, so it&#x27;s not difficult for me to find shampoos that work well for my hair, just need something to help my scalp.</li>
            <li> and it easily tangles at the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo, combined with the conditioner, alleviated my daughters dry scalp immediately.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, and it smells great, but my scalp is still itchy...  :-/</li>
            <li> I  had dry flaky scalp and now it is much better with the shampoo I would buy again</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because most products never really live up to their claims.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo my hair is clean, barely any dandruff, and NO ITCHING!</li>
            <li> and my husband always went back to the chemical filled ones - because he needed the relief.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.  </li>
            <li> Really works well to help my scalp from dryness.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get rid of my intense scalp itch, which seems to be going away on</li>
            <li> The conditioner didn&#x27;t do much to return moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li> I try to rotate in a purple shampoo every week, but that doesn&#x27;t really help my scalp.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus it works very well on my daughters hair too.</li>
            <li> Dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t really help since I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It really smells like carrots</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> doesnt really tingle my scalp.  </li>
            <li> If you have folliculitis it does not seem to work very well,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo that would relieve my itchy flaky scalp, and this one is definitely not the solution.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an opinion on how well it works to other items in the same market, but it does work better than other sulfate free shampoos, and definitely better than shampoos with sulfates.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;ll never miss those other chemical filled shampoos again!</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil (or maybe some other ingredient) just irritates my scalp and makes it more itchy.</li>
            <li> It took only three days for me to see significant results.</li>
            <li> If you have ethnic hair that is a 3 or 4 in curl pattern, make sure to do a ore-poo (oil up your hair before shampooing ) to avoid your hair being stripped of its natural oils as this shampoo feels like a clarifying shampoo because it left my hair aqueaky clean to the point of being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Of recent I&#x27;ve been trying to be far more conscious of what we take in - both in eating and by the products we&#x27;re using at home.</li>
            <li> You get more in this bottle for quite a bit less in price.</li>
            <li> Trying mainly because it has no SLS detergent.</li>
            <li> I gave up after two uses and gave it to my husband (he&#x27;s not as particular as I am).</li>
            <li> Makes my long hair very soft, is affordable and made with good ingredients compared to a lot of other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also trying to switch to using more natural products, and T Gel has some pretty harsh</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I did a little research and found there weren&#x27;t many at all.</li>
            <li> About a six months ago I developed a hormonal imbalance, and as a result my hair became very oily.</li>
            <li> His scalp skin looked normal, nothing visible to worry about, no allergies.</li>
            <li> Which is incredible because in the past the itching or the oily hair wouldnt let me last that long.</li>
            <li> So pretty much the same review for the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Love that it is 95% natural (although it does have a few nasties in there)</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft, and not a flake in sight!</li>
            <li> In fact, all I need is a little dry shampoo the next day and my hair still looks good.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft but does nothing for my dandruff and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to it and had itchy scalp but no dandruff.</li>
            <li> 1-2 uses and no dandruff so far.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that it really didn&#x27;t seem to soothe my scalp</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a good-smelling, natural Shampoo then buy this.  </li>
            <li> I realize it isn&#x27;t all natural, but for me it worked: http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Minute-Moisturizer-Treatment/dp/B00FIZGN2Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_41?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422134138&amp;sr&#x3D;1-41&amp;keywords&#x3D;dandruff+head+and+shoulders.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin, I appreciate the natural approach.</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own, it has decreased the dandruff about 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Head was not less dry after consistent use.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, nor will it linger all day, just a subtle fresh aroma right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> recently tried an organic shampoo i found on amazon, worked the first day, and the next day the itching returned.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff shampoos, Sulfate free shampoos, expensive shampoos, cheap shampoos, for normal, oily, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil shampoos are really stinky and make my hair really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my dandruff and dries my hair out if I use as my regular daily shampoo.  </li>
            <li> had scalp issues and this seems to be only shampoo and cond brand that really helps.&lt;br /&gt;i think the tea tree is the key</li>
            <li> I generally like the Yes line of products.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s clearly getting relief from this product and I can say his flaky scalp hasn&#x27;t come back at all!</li>
            <li> After trying various dandruff shampoos (Head &amp; Shoulders, Clear Scalp, etc)</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do get a small amount of dandruff, but i think thats normal since im taking two days between washing, its not there the first day though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive salon brand tea tree shampoos, but nothing that I really liked or have stuck with.  </li>
            <li> It takes at least a day and half for it get greasy again, which is an amazing improvement over 2-3 hours before it gets too oily.</li>
            <li> When I first read the description I thought the product was a bit odd.</li>
            <li> It also helps my mild dandruff--I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very worried because using a shampoo like head and shoulders would pretty much mean getting several inches getting chopped off.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo, and the Yes To... brand in general!</li>
            <li> My scalp was less itchy after the first use, and I&#x27;m seeing fewer flakes, and the slight yellowish tinge and large, scaly looking white flakes are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have some tea tree oil but enough to help but not dry.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s partially related to a new job where the air is very dry and partially related to another product</li>
            <li> In my findings, when you are suffering from dandruff, normally there is some other medical underlying problem going on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the conditioner on my scalp and roots on a few occasions and it washed out clean and my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down</li>
            <li> When you have light blonde hair, it&#x27;s really easy to see when it&#x27;s dirty and a lot of the time shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash out well or leaves it looking dull.</li>
            <li> It really smells like raw carrots</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo will last a very long time even with using a lot (per the directions) and the conditioner will last you even longer.</li>
            <li> I am a Yes to Carrots fan from long back.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been leaving the bottle lying flat on it&#x27;s side</li>
            <li> No matter what shampoo I used it always looked flat and greasy within hours of washing my hair.</li>
            <li> All of the other brands I&#x27;ve used worked but eventually would fail me after extended daily use by causing more oil, not getting the oil out or causing damage and frizz.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, my hair is soft and fluffy and has volume and it stays this way all day.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to my two problem areas, suds it up, and let it sit there for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually far more disappointed about my stained shower than about my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the shampoo without conditioner, but they leave my hair soft and only slightly weighed down (</li>
            <li> It was irritating almost right away</li>
            <li> do not use on a daily basis as I wash my hair every other day, but I do use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you keep using it!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, frizzy, and tends towards breakage and damage.</li>
            <li> For me, it did nothing for my dry flakey scalp.  </li>
            <li> i bought this at the recommendation of a friend that said it worked for her dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> When I got out of the shower yesterday and brushed my hair, it actually hurt and I saw that my scalp was even a little bit pink, so I&#x27;m done with this now.</li>
            <li> I tried the No poo method, dry and oily patched hair, still itching (tried for one month!).</li>
            <li> your hair also gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I think im just going to stick with Yes to carrots, the ingredients arent too bad, and it works, thats all that matters to me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried one other shampoo with tea tree oil, and had about the same results...</li>
            <li> My usual routine is to use a normal hair shampoo (usually use one from Burt&#x27;s Bees)</li>
            <li> I have now used a bottle and a half and it has not cleared up my itchy, dry scalp.</li>
            <li> now a month in he dumped the other shampoo in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Works well, not as drying as other products.</li>
            <li> By the way, I tried some other Shampoo/Conditioners in the Yes to Carrots line, and some of them did give me itching, or oily hair,</li>
            <li> My scalp improved, but any other parts of my skin (including my neck and ears)</li>
            <li> like all of the other</li>
            <li> Just the fact that there are NO parabens,  sulfates and other chemicals</li>
            <li> It cleaned like any other shampoo, but didn&#x27;t do anything for itchy/dandruff scalp.  </li>
            <li> We will continue to use it when we are out of other shampoo, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> and has not gone back to my previous problems in the past three years.</li>
            <li> have light-brown, fine hair which doesn&#x27;t hide oil or bad hair days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others that were supposed to give scalp relief with no success</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve wrestled with the oily scalp problem for at least two years, I&#x27;ve tried almost every shampoo specifically made for my condition (yes it&#x27;s definitely a condition!)</li>
            <li> Hurts the eyes when the lather runs down my face.</li>
            <li> But recently I&#x27;ve had some serious itchy scalp issues...</li>
            <li> I like it as much as my previous fancy pants products.</li>
            <li> Without getting on my soapbox or all &amp;#34;lecturey&amp;#34; about the crap that we come into contact with all the time I&#x27;ll say that this is a product that I can EASILY replace my hubby&#x27;s shampoo with</li>
            <li> It does smell a little like tea tree oil, but its not overpowering and the benefits outweigh the scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> It left my hair overly dry and smelled unfortunate.</li>
            <li> My sscalp tends to be abit itchy from taking hair growth vitamins and from heavy use of hair gels.</li>
            <li> Tea tree shampoos (dried out my hair, still itching).</li>
            <li> a few years ago my hair started falling out</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s turned into a mindless habit.</li>
            <li> n worse after an entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> To Carrots Scalp Relief Shampoo because it is one of the few shampoos that contain salicylic acid,</li>
            <li> but I have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of tea tree oil to the remaining volume of shampoo and that seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work it into a lather and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> To products that I&#x27;ve tried, so this was a big disappointment and probably why I stuck with it for so long.</li>
            <li> I also have very thick long, wavy hair</li>
            <li> It looks like this has worked for other reviewers, but if you&#x27;ve tried other tea tree oil shampoos in the past with poor results, I would recommend avoiding this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp, and dry ends, which means that some shampoos dry out my hair, or make me look like a greasy dirty mess.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the Scalp relief...</li>
            <li> No better</li>
            <li> no more flaking.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help, especially for the price I paid, but I was not impressed with it as a scalp relief shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Had some other unpleasant issues with some of their other products.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad as a general conditioner, so I&#x27;m not giving it a one-star rating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was shocked when this actually worked.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo touched broke out in a red, bumpy, itchy rash. :(</li>
            <li> I also get dandruff from some shampoos, and even worse is the ITCHING.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> A word comes to mind with this product: LAME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; with disastrous results, dry shampoo with equally horrifying results, I&#x27;ve purchased expensive salon-only brands and I&#x27;ve ordered weird brands off the internet</li>
            <li> the smell is not as bad as you would expect given the ingredients, it&#x27;s just not great.  </li>
            <li> It dryers you hair like crazy</li>
            <li> I have very bad scalp itching/scabbing, and the only thing that I have found that works to control it is T Gel, which is very expensive and smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> how well it works on bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> Well, my head is still itchy, but I guess it&#x27;s not as bad as it was.  </li>
            <li> so I was disappointed when I found no relief from itchiness after using it</li>
            <li> I doubt I will even use this, I am kinda grossed out :(</li>
            <li> We had a brutal winter here in the midwest!  </li>

            <li> Of recent I&#x27;ve been trying to be far more conscious of what we take in - both in eating and by the products we&#x27;re using at home. Without getting on my soapbox or all &amp;#34;lecturey&amp;#34; about the crap that we come into contact with all the time I&#x27;ll say that this is a product that I can EASILY replace my hubby&#x27;s shampoo with and he&#x27;ll never miss those other chemical filled shampoos again! I&#x27;ve tried others that were supposed to give scalp relief with no success and my husband always went back to the chemical filled ones - because he needed the relief. I got him to agree to another try and now a month in he dumped the other shampoo in the garbage. Yup, it&#x27;s a hit! He&#x27;s clearly getting relief from this product and I can say his flaky scalp hasn&#x27;t come back at all! Talking with him about it he&#x27;s very happy with the results he&#x27;s getting and the fact that he&#x27;s being exposed to less toxic chemicals. Total win in our book!</li>
            <li> helped my itchy head after the first use!</li>
            <li> did not help with flaking or red scalp</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo, its the only dandruff one he prefers.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft but does nothing for my dandruff and itchy scalp. I used it for 2 weeks with no improvement.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the Scalp relief... I did not work for me.  It dryers you hair like crazy so use ton of conditioner if you use it, unless you have oily hair I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I will not use it again. To be fair I think it smells good..</li>
            <li> It did relief my scalp itch but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.  I&#x27;ve used many different anti dandruff shampoos and this one does a really great job.  I chose it originally because I wanted a more natural product.  In my findings, when you are suffering from dandruff, normally there is some other medical underlying problem going on.  Just by changing my diet, that has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Work great on a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands second favorite scalp shampoo. Considering the price difference I would say that&#x27;s pretty impressive. His first being Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree. You get more in this bottle for quite a bit less in price. This brand is also not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t see improvement in scalp issues. The smell wasn&#x27;t especially good either. The search continues for a more non pharmaceutical shampoo that helps with itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> Trying mainly because it has no SLS detergent. I&#x27;m sensitive to it and had itchy scalp but no dandruff.</li>
            <li> Works well, not as drying as other products.</li>
            <li> Got rid of my dandruff. Love it</li>
            <li> Really works well to help my scalp from dryness.  It is almost like a conditioner for the scalp itself, relieving dryness and itch</li>
            <li> Everyone in our family loves this shampoo</li>
            <li> My husband have had an itchy scalp for a year. He was scratching his head so often that people could think that he had lice. His scalp skin looked normal, nothing visible to worry about, no allergies. We&#x27;ve tried lots of shampoos including Ketoconazole shampoos. Nothing worked. Until I&#x27;ve bought this one. It stopped itching. My husband uses it for a year already and everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo when I suspect that dandruff might start. 1-2 uses and no dandruff so far.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, love this brand!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my dandruff and dries my hair out if I use as my regular daily shampoo.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It left my hair overly dry and smelled unfortunate. I personally would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the regular Yes to Carrots shampoo though.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so shiny, smooth and felt so soft. Sadly, this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it didn&#x27;t get rid of my intense scalp itch, which seems to be going away on it&#x27;s own with unmedicated shampoo and conditioner. Neutrogena T-Gel didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical purchasing this product. I have very bad scalp itching/scabbing, and the only thing that I have found that works to control it is T Gel, which is very expensive and smells terrible. I&#x27;m also trying to switch to using more natural products, and T Gel has some pretty harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked when this actually worked. I used this for several days with no increase in itchiness. I have been using for several weeks now, and everything is still going well. I&#x27;m so thrilled that there&#x27;s an all natural alternative for T Gel!!</li>
            <li> Bought it. Tried it. It&#x27;s okay. If you have ethnic hair that is a 3 or 4 in curl pattern, make sure to do a ore-poo (oil up your hair before shampooing ) to avoid your hair being stripped of its natural oils as this shampoo feels like a clarifying shampoo because it left my hair aqueaky clean to the point of being dry and frizzy. The conditioner didn&#x27;t do much to return moisture to my hair. My scalp felt relief fora week though. My sscalp tends to be abit itchy from taking hair growth vitamins and from heavy use of hair gels. I also tried this because a couple of people mentioned that it helps smooth the hair out. I didn&#x27;t get this effect from this shampoo or the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, frizzy, and tends towards breakage and damage. I stopped using most strongly chemical shampoos several years ago. But recently I&#x27;ve had some serious itchy scalp issues... I think it&#x27;s partially related to a new job where the air is very dry and partially related to another product my hair didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very worried because using a shampoo like head and shoulders would pretty much mean getting several inches getting chopped off. This product isn&#x27;t perfect because it DOES contain a product that is in the SLS family but is not SLS, but it is fine to use once a week, and I purchased the conditioner and it makes a nice cowash. My scalp was less itchy after the first use, and I&#x27;m seeing fewer flakes, and the slight yellowish tinge and large, scaly looking white flakes are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a two pack, by the way.</li>
            <li> nice tea tree shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; dandruff shampoo, so I can&#x27;t give an opinion on how well it works to other items in the same market, but it does work better than other sulfate free shampoos, and definitely better than shampoos with sulfates. Now, here&#x27;s where i&#x27;m having an issue. I just dyed my hair, and i noticed that my color tends to get more brassy when using this shampoo. I try to rotate in a purple shampoo every week, but that doesn&#x27;t really help my scalp. I&#x27;ll probably look for another one until i figure out what to do with my dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for many moons for a good dandruff shampoo without as many yucky chemicals as head and shoulders. This fits the bill! Leaves my hair shiny and soft, and not a flake in sight!</li>
            <li> It has worked fairly well on my itchy flaky scalp. However, the itchiness remains. I have only used one shampoo before that truly eliminated the itchiness and the flakes of my scalp, but it is a prescription shampoo that costs about 40 dollars a 6 oz. so in perspective with the price this works well, if it does not get rid of the symptoms then go to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have an oily scalp, and dry ends, which means that some shampoos dry out my hair, or make me look like a greasy dirty mess. I also get dandruff from some shampoos, and even worse is the ITCHING. Every shampoo before has given me itching, some the same day, some the next, but always itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this shampoo my hair is clean, barely any dandruff, and NO ITCHING! It is amazing, i wash my hair on Monday, and i dont have to wash it again until Thursday, so i can take two days off washing. Which is incredible because in the past the itching or the oily hair wouldnt let me last that long. By thurday my hair is a bit oily but im trying to grow out my hair, so i ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do get a small amount of dandruff, but i think thats normal since im taking two days between washing, its not there the first day though. By the way, I tried some other Shampoo/Conditioners in the Yes to Carrots line, and some of them did give me itching, or oily hair, the best one for me was this scalp one. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried an organic shampoo i found on amazon, worked the first day, and the next day the itching returned. I think im just going to stick with Yes to carrots, the ingredients arent too bad, and it works, thats all that matters to me. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried:&lt;br /&gt; Tea tree shampoos (dried out my hair, still itching). I tried the No poo method, dry and oily patched hair, still itching (tried for one month!). Dandruff shampoos, Sulfate free shampoos, expensive shampoos, cheap shampoos, for normal, oily, and dry hair. Nothing else worked...</li>
            <li> I am a Yes to Carrots fan from long back. But this particular formula has a kind of medicinal smell. Still say Yes to Carrots - just NO to this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am used to paying the big bucks for salon products. ($60 for Purelogy!) a few years ago my hair started falling out (I was 30 at the time), my head was itchy, and the part I&#x27;ve had in my hair for 30 years started to hurt. Sure I was highstrung and under a lot of stress. Turns out I was also going through something called Topical Steroid Withdrawal also. But I was at Target and saw this product, and it claimed success in something like 2 weeks. Yeah right I thought. but hey 9 bucks. I&#x27;ve been using it since. it&#x27;s been three years. I like it as much as my previous fancy pants products. my scalp was honestly healed in maybe 2-3 weeks. and has not gone back to my previous problems in the past three years. I grew up suffering from eczema on my scalp and the topical steroid liquid was not helping anymore. I bought my dad the shampoo and conditioner for Father&#x27;s Day this year. Over Thanksgiving I asked him how his eczema/dandruff was on his scalp. His answer? oh that&#x27;s right. I guess it&#x27;s gone. My dad has had this scalp problem his ENTIRE life!! I love this stuff. the conditioner is great too. I use both. The smell is great. My fiance uses it and he has no scalp issues.</li>
            <li> We had a brutal winter here in the midwest!  This shampoo cured my itchy scalp - thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this shampoo, as well as the fact that it is not tested on animals.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, nor will it linger all day, just a subtle fresh aroma right out of the shower.  Cleans my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> My scalp improved, but any other parts of my skin (including my neck and ears) this shampoo touched broke out in a red, bumpy, itchy rash. :(</li>
            <li> This shampoo when combined with the conditioner is excellent.  I haven&#x27;t used it separately.  These products have greatly improved the condition of my hair and scalp.  I have Candida with itching and hair loss.  I&#x27;ve been using these products for three months.  My hair loss has virtually stopped.  My itching is only occasional.  My hair is soft, shiny and healthy looking even with color and a perm!!</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo a lot.  I had a squeaky scalp after just one wash. Never did a second did not need it.  Conditioner was good too</li>
            <li> I like this company so I was disappointed when I found no relief from itchiness after using it (and its companion shampoo) for several weeks. It wasn&#x27;t bad as a general conditioner, so I&#x27;m not giving it a one-star rating.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  I generally like the Yes line of products.  However, this did not help my hair situation.  I felt like my hair was being stripped or something.  I gave up after two uses and gave it to my husband (he&#x27;s not as particular as I am).</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo that gently strips all of the built up oils on my hair while soothing my previously dry and itchy scalp. I&#x27;d tried many products before this but this one by far works the best for me. As an added bonus it works very well on my daughters hair too. They no longer have dandruff flakes and their scalps are itch free as well.</li>
            <li> Very soothing blend, love the tea tree oil perfect for my eczema and dry scalp. I Really love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Love that it is 95% natural (although it does have a few nasties in there) Works great, smells AWESOME. Very fresh smelling. It really smells like raw carrots and I love that. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that it really didn&#x27;t seem to soothe my scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo that would relieve my itchy flaky scalp, and this one is definitely not the solution. The tea tree oil (or maybe some other ingredient) just irritates my scalp and makes it more itchy. When I got out of the shower yesterday and brushed my hair, it actually hurt and I saw that my scalp was even a little bit pink, so I&#x27;m done with this now. A few years ago I tried one other shampoo with tea tree oil, and had about the same results... I&#x27;ve read many times that tea tree is a good answer to the itchy scalp, and the one I tried in the past also had peppermint which is a skin irritant, so I thought maybe I&#x27;d give the tea tree oil shampoos another go (one without peppermint this time). I&#x27;ve been using it for the last month or two. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but I did use this with every wash, about 3 times/week. It was irritating almost right away, I just thought maybe it would change over time as the bottle says it helps in 7 days, but I haven&#x27;t seen a change. It looks like this has worked for other reviewers, but if you&#x27;ve tried other tea tree oil shampoos in the past with poor results, I would recommend avoiding this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the manufacturing stamp on the bottom of left a purple stain on the shelf in my shower that won&#x27;t come off!!! So I&#x27;ve been leaving the bottle lying flat on it&#x27;s side so it won&#x27;t stain again. I&#x27;m actually far more disappointed about my stained shower than about my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my hair looks great. But I have pretty normal hair, so it&#x27;s not difficult for me to find shampoos that work well for my hair, just need something to help my scalp. My usual routine is to use a normal hair shampoo (usually use one from Burt&#x27;s Bees) and then maybe once a week use Head &amp; Shoulders. Head &amp; Shoulders works the best for my scalp but my hair gets greasy when it&#x27;s all I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all of the other Yes To products that I&#x27;ve tried, so this was a big disappointment and probably why I stuck with it for so long.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because most products never really live up to their claims.  My scalp gets itchy and I scratch and it&#x27;s turned into a mindless habit. When I get stressed, I tend to scratch more.  Then I get acne on my scalp. Not good.  Dandruff shampoos don&#x27;t really help since I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive salon brand tea tree shampoos, but nothing that I really liked or have stuck with.  I also have very thick long, wavy hair and it easily tangles at the back of my neck.  I&#x27;m forever trying different conditioners and detanglers to try to resolve this issue.  Who knows - maybe those products contributed to my itchy scalp!  Anyway, I love this shampoo (and it&#x27;s accompanying conditioner) because it&#x27;s practically solved all my problems.  I don&#x27;t feel the tingle, but my scalp is definitely soothed.  It smells great, it makes a nice, satisfying lather, no parabens, and my hair is shiny, silky and tangles are significantly decreased. Plus its affordable!  Five stars in my book!</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a good-smelling, natural Shampoo then buy this.  For me, it did nothing for my dry flakey scalp.  No better n worse after an entire bottle.  I would up buying some of this, and after about 5 applications, am definitely seeing a change.  I realize it isn&#x27;t all natural, but for me it worked: http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Minute-Moisturizer-Treatment/dp/B00FIZGN2Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_41?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422134138&amp;sr&#x3D;1-41&amp;keywords&#x3D;dandruff+head+and+shoulders.</li>
            <li> had scalp issues and this seems to be only shampoo and cond brand that really helps.&lt;br /&gt;i think the tea tree is the key</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I find it helpful to alternate this with one of the coal tar shampoos, as a doctor once advised.</li>
            <li> This  has helped somewhat.  Hair feels good after shampooing.  Just the fact that there are NO parabens,  sulfates and other chemicals in there make it  a good buy for me.</li>
            <li> this shampoo, combined with the conditioner, alleviated my daughters dry scalp immediately. no more flaking. it is truly a great product.  the smell is not as bad as you would expect given the ingredients, it&#x27;s just not great.  thanfully, the smell is very light and doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Smells better than the regular line of yes to carrots. Seems to be great for my hair leaving it shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> The bottle was open and no seal on the bottom- the product looks used and the bottle wasn&#x27;t full. I doubt I will even use this, I am kinda grossed out :(</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling really clean and scalp tingly. I have dandruff but this really does the trick and has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> I use this as well as a scalpmaster shampoo brush to combat winter drying my scalp and causing flakes. It really smells like carrots but when you wash your hair with it the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering. Makes my long hair very soft, is affordable and made with good ingredients compared to a lot of other shampoos. I am a fan.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a shampoo to help control scalp blemishes and have been very impressed with this.  I still get them occasionally, but only occasionally and they seem to go away quicker.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle...very pleased!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve wrestled with the oily scalp problem for at least two years, I&#x27;ve tried almost every shampoo specifically made for my condition (yes it&#x27;s definitely a condition!) I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; with disastrous results, dry shampoo with equally horrifying results, I&#x27;ve purchased expensive salon-only brands and I&#x27;ve ordered weird brands off the internet but my search is finally over now that I&#x27;ve found Yes To Carrots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light-brown, fine hair which doesn&#x27;t hide oil or bad hair days so I needed a product that I could use daily. All of the other brands I&#x27;ve used worked but eventually would fail me after extended daily use by causing more oil, not getting the oil out or causing damage and frizz. Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner are working superbly for me after two months of daily use and there is no damage and it&#x27;s not drying out my scalp or roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the back of the bottle and it worked perfectly. I also use the matching conditioner but only mid-shaft to the ends. I&#x27;ve used the conditioner on my scalp and roots on a few occasions and it washed out clean and my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down, I just prefer to use it on my ends only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo will last a very long time even with using a lot (per the directions) and the conditioner will last you even longer. This brand has earned a customer for life with this shampoo/conditioner and I&#x27;m so grateful I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed about my oily scalp because it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t have one anymore!</li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots has the best product line! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Cleans you. Nothing really special about it from my use. Head was not less dry after consistent use. Must be me...</li>
            <li> I did not buy this shampoo from Amazon (I bought it at target) but I felt the need to review it. About a six months ago I developed a hormonal imbalance, and as a result my hair became very oily. My hair was so oily, my scalp was shiny in some places. No matter what shampoo I used it always looked flat and greasy within hours of washing my hair. I decided to try Yes To Carrots Scalp Relief Shampoo because it is one of the few shampoos that contain salicylic acid, and I could afford it. What a difference it has made! It is the only shampoo that gets rid of all the excess oil. After shampooing, my hair is soft and fluffy and has volume and it stays this way all day. In fact, all I need is a little dry shampoo the next day and my hair still looks good. It takes at least a day and half for it get greasy again, which is an amazing improvement over 2-3 hours before it gets too oily. I know it says its for &amp;#34;dry flakey scalp&amp;#34; but it works wonders for oily hair. It does smell a little like tea tree oil, but its not overpowering and the benefits outweigh the scent. Great shampoo!</li>
            <li> OK - Carrots? When I first read the description I thought the product was a bit odd. However, I have tried just about everything out there short of a prescription to get some relief from my itchy scalp. The tea tree oil shampoos are really stinky and make my hair really dry and brittle. The head and shoulders type cause me to get acne on my scalp. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical of this product. It says a week of use will help. OMG! They are right. It does have some tea tree oil but enough to help but not dry. As a side note - I specifically look for tea tree because it helps with the fungus that causes dandruff and also keeps away lice. Being winter at the moment means it is lice season at school. Two birds, one stone. Just ordered the conditioner. You definitely feel a tingle. It lathers nicely. I have well water.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp and have had tried every shampoo of every cost point out there (even prescription) and this has literally changed my life.  It took a week (just like the bottle said) and all of a sudden the flakes and itching were gone.  I have now used this, along with the conditioner, for almost a year.  I take it with me when I travel because even one or two days without it makes everything itchy again.  I know it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone as some reviewers have said-- but it&#x27;s worth trying.  For me, it could be what I use forever!</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that gets greasy easily. When you have light blonde hair, it&#x27;s really easy to see when it&#x27;s dirty and a lot of the time shampoo doesn&#x27;t wash out well or leaves it looking dull. This shampoo leaves my hair looking the brightest and cleanest I&#x27;ve ever seen. It also helps my mild dandruff--I&#x27;m not sure how well it works on bad dandruff. It also smells great. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of the yes to brand. With sensitive skin, I appreciate the natural approach. I was using a medicated shampoo before but when I found this is a store, I had to give it a try. It worked and now I use this and the matching conditioner. I buy them on Amazon but I have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have now used a bottle and a half and it has not cleared up my itchy, dry scalp. I will not buy it again. Had some other unpleasant issues with some of their other products.  I don&#x27;t recommend any of their products.</li>
            <li> I started reacting to every shampoo and conditioner and breaking out on my scalp. Not dandruff, but actual pimples. I tried lots of different things, but I think I was reacting to all the junk that&#x27;s in regular shampoos and conditioners. Then genius hit me. I wondered if there were any shampoos or conditioners with salicylic acid in them? After all, that&#x27;s what you use on your face when it breaks out, right? So I did a little research and found there weren&#x27;t many at all. Selsun Blue Naturals is the only one I could find that was sold in stores besides this. However, Selsun doesn&#x27;t have a conditioner so it was out. I took a chance and ordered these on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve since found a Target nearby that sells them. These have helped the breaking out on my scalp tremendously and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling coated and waxy. Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Well, my head is still itchy, but I guess it&#x27;s not as bad as it was.  I have used this now for 3 weeks.  I thought it would help, especially for the price I paid, but I was not impressed with it as a scalp relief shampoo.  My hair is soft, and it smells great, but my scalp is still itchy...  :-/</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo it does wonders for my scalp I  had dry flaky scalp and now it is much better with the shampoo I would buy again it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but all in all it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> it really probly is a good shampoo, it smells good and feels good, but my dry scalp came back after just 5 days, so i wouldnt recommend this product for &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; control</li>
            <li> Hurts the eyes when the lather runs down my face. Didn&#x27;t give relief in 7 days, as it says on the bottle. In fact I am almost done with the bottle and I still have flakes.</li>
            <li> I needed a product to control dandruff and purchased this product because it was sulfate free and consisted of mostly natural ingredients. On it&#x27;s own, it has decreased the dandruff about 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use on a daily basis as I wash my hair every other day, but I do use it every time I wash my hair. I apply it directly to my two problem areas, suds it up, and let it sit there for a few minutes. Then I rinse as I massage my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a couple months and didn&#x27;t achieve the results I desired (total elimination was the goal). I added a few drops of tea tree oil to the remaining volume of shampoo and that seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: my hair feels very clean and is pretty soft and shiny. The smell leaves a lot to be desired (even before adding the extra tea tree oil); however, the conditioner I use covers up the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may consider buying again if I cannot find another affordable sulfate free option, although I may just try adding tea tree oil to another shampoo product before I buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo at great price. Love that it&#x27;s natural and it doesn&#x27;t harm my hair with chemicals, definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works well with its conditioner.  I have been using them for quite while and will continue ordering when I run out.</li>
            <li> Pros: Good smell, leaves hair feeling clean and not overly drying, free of petroleum, no SLS, no Parabens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have suffered with itchy or irritated scalp most of my life (but no dandruff).  I am highly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes.  This has no perfume and has a small amount of tea tree oil along with a lot of great scalp nourishing ingredients.  My scalp does not itch anymore and I get compliments all the time on my shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and works much better on my scalp condition than most products.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for anyone that has scalp issues. Even happier now that it is part of the Subscribe and Save program!</li>
            <li> hair feels light and tingly, removes flakes and itchiness.</li>
            <li> Fine shampoo, but I stillhave a flaky scalp after using. Will continue to try others.</li>
            <li> Its shampoo.  It cleaned like any other shampoo, but didn&#x27;t do anything for itchy/dandruff scalp.  I tried it for the recommended 7 days, then gave it to my spouse, who tried it for about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve purchased several tea tree shampoos over the last few months to try, and this one is my least favorite.  We will continue to use it when we are out of other shampoo, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> i bought this at the recommendation of a friend that said it worked for her dry scalp.  it didn&#x27;t work for me - threw it away after using it religiously for three weeks with no improvement in my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Granddaughter, she loves it.  Her hair feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> A word comes to mind with this product: LAME. Back to Selsun Blue wich does the job and has moisturizers. With &amp;#34;Yes to carrots Scalp Relief&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t feel the product was working on my scalp whatsoever. That was my personal experience.....it could work for others.</li>
            <li> Son uses it for itchy scalp.  He loves it. It works as long as you keep using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of dandruff shampoo out there - natural and chemical ridden! This has been the only one that hasn&#x27;t stopped working for me and it&#x27;s been over a year of use. This was kind of my last resort as I was going over to a more natural products and just decided to try another. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it definitely made a difference in the dandruff and itching. Plus, it smells pretty good, lathers, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripping moisture from my hair or leaving my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> doesnt really tingle my scalp.  and sometimes makes it itchy.  but for the price and the way it leaves my hair, i will probably buy it again. Just not for scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> Im still hopeful that it will do its job. not giving up just yet , it feels good smells good, but my problem is still there. only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked carrots. Now I like them even more! After trying various dandruff shampoos (Head &amp; Shoulders, Clear Scalp, etc) this is the one that works! It took only three days for me to see significant results. And it smells great! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think it depends what condition you have if you get scalp relief with this product.  If you have folliculitis it does not seem to work very well,&lt;br /&gt;and your hair also gets very dry. So pretty much the same review for the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Best advice, talk to your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I have psoriasis on my scalp that causes itching, flaking, and build-up. This shampoo has worked better to clear the build-up than any medicated shampoo specifically made for psoriasis. I work it into a lather and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. It feels very light, and has a citrusy, fresh scent. I use this shampoo and the Scalp Relief Conditioner every day, and I love them. I&#x27;ve never used the shampoo without conditioner, but they leave my hair soft and only slightly weighed down (but I have very fine hair). I would definitely recommend this shampoo, and the Yes To... brand in general!</li>
            <li> Used to have lots of dandruff, but this shampoo has helped a lot.  Scalp feels clean and not itchy at all.  Love it.</li>
            <li> after one use I saw a difference in my scalp. I would recommend it to others.  The smell could be better.</li>
