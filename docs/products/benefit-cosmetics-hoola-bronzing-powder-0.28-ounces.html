            <li>The applicator is made well and goes on great and blends good too.</li>
            <li>awesome product!! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many and this is the best quality ever.</li>
            <li>Best bronzer, great for contour, original package.</li>
            <li>I use it as a contour shade and it&#x27;s perfect for my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>Packaging was sketchy (plastic bag) but product was good.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for contouring, It&#x27;s orange and unnatural looking on my fair NW13-15 skin.</li>
            <li>Though it has a good amount of powder.</li>
            <li>It is really good for contouring the nose and the hollows of the cheeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s A nice product even for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this bronzer!</li>
            <li>So when I love a product, I&#x27;ll talk about it!</li>
            <li>so I would suggest using your own powder brush to apply.</li>
            <li>I use it as a bronzer and as a warm color to blend into the crease of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Lmao</li>
            <li>And the product was brand new and sealed in excellent condition</li>
            <li>so its worth the price since it is of great quality.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin with a perfect golden look without look orange and you can just brush some on your cheek bones to give yourself a little color or in the summer I apply it all over my face for a perfect tan..</li>
            <li>Good product and very fast service!</li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>Best bronzer I&#x27;ve tried and use daily.</li>
            <li>Usually love this brand but find they skimp on quantity sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Make sure to tap or blow on brush before applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this bronzer for about 6 years now, I can&#x27;t find anything I like using more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>However, after finding this for a way more reduced price, the product has more appeal.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is just ok.</li>
            <li>and this brand requires more &amp;#34;smudging&amp;#34; to blend.</li>
            <li>Thought I would love this because of all the raves I&#x27;ve heard about it from everyone.</li>
            <li>love this as a blush for many years.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this.</li>
            <li>and this was one of the more recommended products.</li>
            <li>I love that it is matte because then you can use it for contouring without getting that shimmery look everywhere.</li>
            <li>Benefit is an outstanding brand</li>
            <li>i bought this in the benefit sey and it&#x27;s excellent for contouring and slimming your face, which is what i use it for, but i&#x27;m very fair and the bronzer a little too dark for my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>it is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is easily build able</li>
            <li>color is very natural and great for contouring.</li>
            <li>Love this color, I have used it before so it wasn&#x27;t a huge shock.</li>
            <li>The color of this bronzer is perfect, not too pink, not too orange.</li>
            <li>More orange than original.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this bronzer is perfect.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no shimmer, and it&#x27;s perfect to use when you are trying to achieve a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look vs a harsh contour (you can use to contour also).</li>
            <li>I love this product it came super fastüòç</li>
            <li>thought it was to light</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re glowing!&amp;#34; goes on smooth and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>It can go on light or you can build it up.</li>
            <li>I was worried this would be too dark, I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li>It will look pretty on most skin tones.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly let down after receiving this product.</li>
            <li>Benefit got it right when they made Hoola!</li>
            <li>I use a big brush&amp; apply it where I&#x27;d contour my cheeks&amp; on my forehead&amp; it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from Sephora countless times and  the one I received is nowhere as good as the ones I have purchased before.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to order the full size.  </li>
            <li>, I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer because it looks very natural and is a matte color.</li>
            <li>really pretty for bronzing or contouring!   </li>
            <li>I originally got this bronzer in a travel size but after the first time trying it</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s slightly fair w/ pink undertones)</li>
            <li>and it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>My friends who have darker skin than me always ask to borrow this when we&#x27;re getting ready and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite bronzer for the colder seasons.</li>
            <li>Nice product overall.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, the brash which it comes with makes it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too orange or yellow or red - just a genuine &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color that looks good on all skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I have a light orange Benefit blush that I&#x27;ve had for several years (I don&#x27;t wear orange that much) and this bronzer turned much more orange than the blush ever has.  </li>
            <li>It has really good pigmentation and just a little dab</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty as an all over bronzer color as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pricey if you compare to it&#x27;s size, but since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, though.  </li>
            <li>This is not the first bronzer I&#x27;ve tried either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and all with the same result.  </li>
            <li>I apply it lightly around the top of my forehead, under my cheek bones, along my jawline, and down the sides of my nose for contouring.</li>
            <li>I live far from Sephora and the price was better on amazon.</li>
            <li>I am on my second box of Hoola and the first lasted me YEARS!!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go out and buy this at Sephora when you can get the same item at a far more discounted price from this seller!</li>
            <li>other than that, nice bronzer.</li>
            <li>great, subtle bronzer.</li>
            <li>I used it a lot at first before getting the Real Techniques brushes and it did its job.</li>
            <li>It also normally has a distinct scent and this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>However, it would not be a good brush if you are looking to bronze all over your face as it is too small.</li>
            <li>I just use a large blush brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I was dissapointed by how much I paid versus what I received.</li>
            <li>However, my 3 star rating comes from the warmer months where after wearing the bronzer for not even an hour, my face becomes very oily..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other bronzers and this one tops them all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product is perfect for a contour that is natural and easy to blend, but since I have sensitive skin, it causes me to have minor break outs.</li>
            <li>and I only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Since I have discovered contouring my face, I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>&amp; I use them a ton, but once I got this, I found a new fav!</li>
            <li>Love the product but it was a LOT smaller than it was advertised on the site I could have gotten a bigger one at the store for cheaper.</li>
            <li>OK, this is an expensive bronzer, but I am really satisfied with the color.  </li>
            <li>High end or drugstore, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  </li>
            <li>I tend to just use a little on the top of my brush and once blended as a contour</li>
            <li>I guess I need to try this a few more times</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also comes in a small square so it easily fits into a purse!</li>
            <li>I decided to buy online primarily as a time saver but also partially due to the reduced cost.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason this one is nothing like what I normally buy,  no matter how much I put on you can barely see anything.  </li>
            <li>In the summer it just adds to the natural warmth of your face from the sun (I always use sunscreen of course!).</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>The bronzer itself was not anything special that any other bronzer could do.</li>
            <li>Like it, looks natural on the face</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>and then the bronzer was only at the very bottom of the box.</li>
            <li>it looks so natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I use several of their products, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>it looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>, I am a sucker for cute things.  </li>
            <li>Hoola is a great bronzer without giving that overly bronzed &#x27;fake&#x27; look!</li>
            <li>I do like the cool little brush that comes with it though.  </li>
            <li>Just brush a little on here and there and you have that pretty tanned look!</li>
            <li>barely use it.</li>
            <li>so apparently the wrapper was taken off before sent to me.</li>
            <li>I never use the little brush that it comes with, mainly because its cheap and all the little bristles fall</li>
            <li>It was a very unflattering dark orange.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to tell how much product is really in the box and how long it will last.</li>
            <li>I also really like the little box it comes in</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer!</li>
            <li> So when I love a product, I&#x27;ll talk about it!</li>
            <li> so I would suggest using your own powder brush to apply.</li>
            <li> I use it as a bronzer and as a warm color to blend into the crease of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Lmao</li>

            <li> it is ok.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer I&#x27;ve tried and use daily.</li>
            <li> Usually love this brand but find they skimp on quantity sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Make sure to tap or blow on brush before applying.</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> However, after finding this for a way more reduced price, the product has more appeal.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is just ok.</li>
            <li> and this brand requires more &amp;#34;smudging&amp;#34; to blend.</li>

            <li> I love that it is matte because then you can use it for contouring without getting that shimmery look everywhere.</li>
            <li> Benefit is an outstanding brand</li>
            <li> i bought this in the benefit sey and it&#x27;s excellent for contouring and slimming your face, which is what i use it for, but i&#x27;m very fair and the bronzer a little too dark for my very fair skin.</li>
            <li> it is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is easily build able</li>

            <li> Love this color, I have used it before so it wasn&#x27;t a huge shock.</li>
            <li> The color of this bronzer is perfect, not too pink, not too orange.</li>
            <li> More orange than original.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this bronzer is perfect.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no shimmer, and it&#x27;s perfect to use when you are trying to achieve a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look vs a harsh contour (you can use to contour also).</li>
            <li> I love this product it came super fastüòç</li>
            <li> thought it was to light</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re glowing!&amp;#34; goes on smooth and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> It can go on light or you can build it up.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be too dark, I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li> It will look pretty on most skin tones.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly let down after receiving this product.</li>
            <li> Benefit got it right when they made Hoola!</li>
            <li> I use a big brush&amp; apply it where I&#x27;d contour my cheeks&amp; on my forehead&amp; it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from Sephora countless times and  the one I received is nowhere as good as the ones I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to order the full size.  </li>
            <li> , I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer because it looks very natural and is a matte color.</li>
            <li> really pretty for bronzing or contouring!   </li>
            <li> I originally got this bronzer in a travel size but after the first time trying it</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slightly fair w/ pink undertones)</li>
            <li> and it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> My friends who have darker skin than me always ask to borrow this when we&#x27;re getting ready and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite bronzer for the colder seasons.</li>
            <li> Nice product overall.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, the brash which it comes with makes it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too orange or yellow or red - just a genuine &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color that looks good on all skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I have a light orange Benefit blush that I&#x27;ve had for several years (I don&#x27;t wear orange that much) and this bronzer turned much more orange than the blush ever has.  </li>
            <li> It has really good pigmentation and just a little dab</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty as an all over bronzer color as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really pricey if you compare to it&#x27;s size, but since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, though.  </li>
            <li> This is not the first bronzer I&#x27;ve tried either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and all with the same result.  </li>
            <li> I apply it lightly around the top of my forehead, under my cheek bones, along my jawline, and down the sides of my nose for contouring.</li>
            <li> I live far from Sephora and the price was better on amazon.</li>
            <li> I am on my second box of Hoola and the first lasted me YEARS!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go out and buy this at Sephora when you can get the same item at a far more discounted price from this seller!</li>
            <li> other than that, nice bronzer.</li>
            <li> great, subtle bronzer.</li>
            <li> I used it a lot at first before getting the Real Techniques brushes and it did its job.</li>
            <li> It also normally has a distinct scent and this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, it would not be a good brush if you are looking to bronze all over your face as it is too small.</li>
            <li> I just use a large blush brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed by how much I paid versus what I received.</li>
            <li> However, my 3 star rating comes from the warmer months where after wearing the bronzer for not even an hour, my face becomes very oily..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other bronzers and this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product is perfect for a contour that is natural and easy to blend, but since I have sensitive skin, it causes me to have minor break outs.</li>
            <li> and I only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Since I have discovered contouring my face, I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> &amp; I use them a ton, but once I got this, I found a new fav!</li>
            <li> Love the product but it was a LOT smaller than it was advertised on the site I could have gotten a bigger one at the store for cheaper.</li>
            <li> OK, this is an expensive bronzer, but I am really satisfied with the color.  </li>
            <li> High end or drugstore, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  </li>
            <li> I tend to just use a little on the top of my brush and once blended as a contour</li>
            <li> I guess I need to try this a few more times</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also comes in a small square so it easily fits into a purse!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy online primarily as a time saver but also partially due to the reduced cost.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason this one is nothing like what I normally buy,  no matter how much I put on you can barely see anything.  </li>
            <li> In the summer it just adds to the natural warmth of your face from the sun (I always use sunscreen of course!).</li>
            <li> It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> The bronzer itself was not anything special that any other bronzer could do.</li>
            <li> Like it, looks natural on the face</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> and then the bronzer was only at the very bottom of the box.</li>
            <li> it looks so natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I use several of their products, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> it looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> , I am a sucker for cute things.  </li>
            <li> Hoola is a great bronzer without giving that overly bronzed &#x27;fake&#x27; look!</li>
            <li> I do like the cool little brush that comes with it though.  </li>
            <li> Just brush a little on here and there and you have that pretty tanned look!</li>
            <li> barely use it.</li>
            <li> so apparently the wrapper was taken off before sent to me.</li>
            <li> I never use the little brush that it comes with, mainly because its cheap and all the little bristles fall</li>
            <li> It was a very unflattering dark orange.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to tell how much product is really in the box and how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I also really like the little box it comes in</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t get the concept of bronzer or maybe I really prefer brighter blush, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting, let&#x27;s say up to 8 hours (depending on temperature and skin type).</li>
            <li> Not only that, it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> Whereas normally have to be extra careful to only apply a small amount</li>
            <li> goes long way.</li>
            <li> , I use a fuller/fatter long handle brush to apply.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, I only wish that the pan was round vs the smaller square.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than some other bronzers but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It creates a natural allover glow and if you use it in the your crease of your eyes before you apply your usual eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I have medium/olive skin, in the winter I can get pretty pale for me, so I will maybe put a little on to give a slight glow or warmness.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled into buying this version just because of the price, it is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s too dark.  </li>
            <li> When I previously bought this product at Sephora, it costed around $40 per container.</li>
            <li> I typically buy it @</li>
            <li> On me it lasts a little over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> only CON of this product is the way it was shipped to me, It was poorly packaged and the bronzer had a scratch through it, as well as the little brush looked used.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> So bummed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It was as orange as a sunset after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it when I am ghostly pale and beach tan.</li>
            <li> The only negative aspect is the brush: the bristles are stiff and tough</li>
            <li> Small amount for the price.  </li>
            <li> in fact I had a couple small travel size hoola bronzers that I gave to a friend and a family member so they could try it out.</li>
            <li> Packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> and I hate that I even paid that much to begin with.</li>
            <li> Not a good deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my secret.</li>
            <li> every time when i use it, my friend will ask me what is wrong with my face</li>
            <li> This is a fake Hoola - do not buy.</li>
            <li> While the container does last for a while, $40 is just too outrageous of a price for a bronzer that is not even my holy grail item.</li>
            <li> I was advised to buy this product by a Sephora representative because it doesn&#x27;t give people that orange fake tan look- which it does not.</li>
            <li> It is FAKE.</li>
            <li> Just not this one, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> it makes my face look dirty.</li>
            <li> it looks dirty.</li>
            <li> and it can cause really bad streaking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got a neutral base</li>
            <li> brush is terrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and very fast service!</li>
            <li> it is ok. barely use it. i think it is not working on white skin. every time when i use it, my friend will ask me what is wrong with my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bronzer for years now and would never change. Compliments all skin tones. I&#x27;ve used it when I am ghostly pale and beach tan. Don&#x27;t care for the brush they include so I would suggest using your own powder brush to apply. A must try!</li>
            <li> thought it was to light but it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Love this!! I use it as a bronzer and as a warm color to blend into the crease of my eyes. It creates a natural allover glow and if you use it in the your crease of your eyes before you apply your usual eyeshadow it looks like you have blended your colors perfectly! Not only that, it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. I use it as an all over my face bronzer, and its matte which is awesome! I never use the little brush that it comes with, mainly because its cheap and all the little bristles fall off.&lt;br /&gt;My only CON of this product is the way it was shipped to me, It was poorly packaged and the bronzer had a scratch through it, as well as the little brush looked used.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the product but it was a LOT smaller than it was advertised on the site I could have gotten a bigger one at the store for cheaper. Not a good deal.</li>
            <li> Like it, looks natural on the face</li>
            <li> Benefit got it right when they made Hoola! Best bronzer I&#x27;ve tried and use daily. The applicator is made well and goes on great and blends good too.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it it makes my face look dirty.</li>
            <li> I love this product it came super fastüòç And the product was brand new and sealed in excellent condition</li>
            <li> This is a fake Hoola - do not buy. More orange than original. I&#x27;ve used Hoola for years and it&#x27;s never been packaged the way this one was. It also normally has a distinct scent and this one didn&#x27;t. So bummed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Since I have discovered contouring my face, I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Hoola is my go to facial bronzing powder.</li>
            <li> The color of this bronzer is perfect, not too pink, not too orange. Great for contouring. Perfect with one application.</li>
            <li> Received in great time....product great, pricey though. Usually love this brand but find they skimp on quantity sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Well see on this.&lt;br /&gt;The color is very natural and great for contouring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A nice product even for my fair skin.The reason I gave it 3 stars because it has Parabens and I only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer! I use it as a contour shade and it&#x27;s perfect for my light skin tone. It&#x27;s pretty as an all over bronzer color as well.</li>
            <li> Hoola is a great bronzer without giving that overly bronzed &#x27;fake&#x27; look! Just brush a little on here and there and you have that pretty tanned look! Make sure to tap or blow on brush before applying. I have medium/olive skin, in the winter I can get pretty pale for me, so I will maybe put a little on to give a slight glow or warmness. In the summer it just adds to the natural warmth of your face from the sun (I always use sunscreen of course!). I am on my second box of Hoola and the first lasted me YEARS!!! Overall. awesome product!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bronzer for about 6 years now, I can&#x27;t find anything I like using more. It leaves your skin with a perfect golden look without look orange and you can just brush some on your cheek bones to give yourself a little color or in the summer I apply it all over my face for a perfect tan.. A must have!</li>
            <li> I use Hoola as a contour and I love it. I live far from Sephora and the price was better on amazon. Great product. I&#x27;m a big fan of Benefit products.</li>
            <li> Packaging was sketchy (plastic bag) but product was good.</li>
            <li> When I previously bought this product at Sephora, it costed around $40 per container. While the container does last for a while, $40 is just too outrageous of a price for a bronzer that is not even my holy grail item. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product is perfect for a contour that is natural and easy to blend, but since I have sensitive skin, it causes me to have minor break outs. However, after finding this for a way more reduced price, the product has more appeal. If you&#x27;re a beginner at contouring, this bronzer will allow you to experiment for the results you desire. Don&#x27;t go out and buy this at Sephora when you can get the same item at a far more discounted price from this seller!</li>
            <li> Love this color, I have used it before so it wasn&#x27;t a huge shock.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEEE this bronzer ! Great for contouring and the brush that comes with it is pretty good too. Perfect color ! This bronzer gave my face life !! Lmao</li>
            <li> really pretty for bronzing or contouring!   great matte colour!   brush is terrible! use another one.. will repurchase</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, the brash which it comes with makes it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Natural. I wear it and people tell me &amp;#34;you look so tan, you&#x27;re glowing!&amp;#34; goes on smooth and is lightweight. Does not make me breakout. Hooray!</li>
            <li> great, subtle bronzer.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is just ok. Small amount for the price.  I have very fair skin and this brand requires more &amp;#34;smudging&amp;#34; to blend. I will go back to &amp;#34; It &amp;#34; brand bronzer.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best bronzer around.  I&#x27;ve tried soooo many and this is the best quality ever. Its matte which is great!</li>
            <li> Not the color for me....it looks dirty. I like MAC harmony blush instead. Thought I would love this because of all the raves I&#x27;ve heard about it from everyone.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great matte bronzer! Awesome for contouring!</li>
            <li> Product is great but it was sent to me in a ziplock bag -- so apparently the wrapper was taken off before sent to me. Didn&#x27;t look used -- but still. Unprofessional for the price.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed by how much I paid versus what I received. The bronzer box was palm size and then the bronzer was only at the very bottom of the box. The bronzer itself was not anything special that any other bronzer could do. I will not buy it again and I hate that I even paid that much to begin with.</li>
            <li> I would say that I &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; bronzers. So when I love a product, I&#x27;ll talk about it! I have the staple NARS Laguna, assorted MAC bronzers, The Balm Bahama Mama etc&amp; I use them a ton, but once I got this, I found a new fav! It&#x27;s great because (I have skin that&#x27;s slightly fair w/ pink undertones) it looks so natural on my skin. There&#x27;s no shimmer, and it&#x27;s perfect to use when you are trying to achieve a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look vs a harsh contour (you can use to contour also). I use a big brush&amp; apply it where I&#x27;d contour my cheeks&amp; on my forehead&amp; it&#x27;s gorgeous. It looks so natural! It will look pretty on most skin tones. On a side note, I only wish that the pan was round vs the smaller square. I&#x27;m not a fan of a lot of these &amp;#34;boxed&amp;#34; packages. I actually prefer if co&#x27;s sold their prods w/ just the tin, so you could stick it into a Zpalette etc. We&#x27;d save some $! I&#x27;ve been depotting all of my makeup&amp; putting them into cases--you save a ton of room!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer because it looks very natural and is a matte color. I apply it lightly around the top of my forehead, under my cheek bones, along my jawline, and down the sides of my nose for contouring. I was advised to buy this product by a Sephora representative because it doesn&#x27;t give people that orange fake tan look- which it does not. It is more expensive than some other bronzers but a little goes a long way so its worth the price since it is of great quality. The only negative aspect is the brush: the bristles are stiff and tough so I don&#x27;t use it. I just use a large blush brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> The Hoola bronzer, can also be used as contour. I loved it. It has really good pigmentation and just a little dab goes long way. It&#x27;s a really pricey if you compare to it&#x27;s size, but since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, it&#x27;s worth the money. It is long lasting, let&#x27;s say up to 8 hours (depending on temperature and skin type). On me it lasts a little over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly let down after receiving this product. It is FAKE. I have purchased this product from Sephora countless times and  the one I received is nowhere as good as the ones I have purchased before. Do not be fooled into buying this version just because of the price, it is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hoola for 10 years and it&#x27;s the best bronzer ever.  It&#x27;s matte so it doesn&#x27;t make your face all sparkly.  It&#x27;s also got a neutral base so it&#x27;s not too orange or yellow or red - just a genuine &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color that looks good on all skin tones.  One recommendation is to NOT use the brush it comes with.  It&#x27;s got really dense bristles that hold a lot of pigment, add that to the narrow shape and it can cause really bad streaking.  I suggest getting a semi-dense blush brush to apply this.  Other than that, this bronzer is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS!  I typically buy it @ my local Sephora store.  I decided to buy online primarily as a time saver but also partially due to the reduced cost.  For whatever reason this one is nothing like what I normally buy,  no matter how much I put on you can barely see anything.  Whereas normally have to be extra careful to only apply a small amount otherwise it&#x27;s too dark.  Made me wonder if this was a factory second or something...</li>
            <li> This bronzer turned orange on me.  I suspect it&#x27;s because I have oily skin, even though I use a mattifying toner and a mattifying primer.  It&#x27;s funny, though.  I&#x27;m not oily on my cheeks....hmm.  It was as orange as a sunset after a few hours.  I have a light orange Benefit blush that I&#x27;ve had for several years (I don&#x27;t wear orange that much) and this bronzer turned much more orange than the blush ever has.  It was a very unflattering dark orange.  This is not the first bronzer I&#x27;ve tried either.  I&#x27;ve tried many and all with the same result.  High end or drugstore, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  I do like the cool little brush that comes with it though.  I purchased mine at Ulta and had to return it.  Maybe I don&#x27;t get the concept of bronzer or maybe I really prefer brighter blush, I&#x27;m not sure.  I do like the Benefit line though and I use several of their products, which I really like.  Just not this one, unfortunately.  If you have oily skin, skip this product.</li>
            <li> On time delivery, and the bronzer provides a perfect summer kissed glow. It&#x27;s also comes in a small square so it easily fits into a purse!</li>
            <li> Love Benefit products!!!</li>
            <li> i bought this in the benefit sey and it&#x27;s excellent for contouring and slimming your face, which is what i use it for, but i&#x27;m very fair and the bronzer a little too dark for my very fair skin. other than that, nice bronzer.</li>
            <li> love this as a blush for many years. great seller and product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for contouring, It&#x27;s orange and unnatural looking on my fair NW13-15 skin. Packaging sucks. Though it has a good amount of powder.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this. I have very fair skin with redness underneath so I am always nervous about using bronzer in any shape or form. My friends however, convinced me to start contouring and this was one of the more recommended products. When I was at Sephora one day I decided to splurge and try this and it is definitely worth the money. It is a product that you can make it do whatever you want. It is easily build able which makes it great for all akin tones. I tend to just use a little on the top of my brush and once blended as a contour it looks completely natural. My friends who have darker skin than me always ask to borrow this when we&#x27;re getting ready and they love it as much as I do. It lasts all day and does not get oily with my oily skin. The brush that comes with it is pretty good. I used it a lot at first before getting the Real Techniques brushes and it did its job. It is really good for contouring the nose and the hollows of the cheeks. However, it would not be a good brush if you are looking to bronze all over your face as it is too small.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer, great for contour, original package. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be too dark, I am very fair skinned but this works great!</li>
            <li> This bronzer is the King of bronzer. I actually use it as my powder. It lasts for quite a while...nearly a year. The bronzer stays on all day....a touch up once a day can be beneficial too. Everyone thinks that I have this great, glowing skin. This stuff is my secret.</li>
            <li> I originally got this bronzer in a travel size but after the first time trying it I knew I had to order the full size.  This is a awesome matte bronzer that looks great on most skin types! I&#x27;ve tried so many other bronzers and this one tops them all. It can go on light or you can build it up. I love that it is matte because then you can use it for contouring without getting that shimmery look everywhere. Shimmery bronzers tend to make me look oily, so if you are anything like me, this is the bronzer for you! Benefit is an outstanding brand and they are not lacking when it comes to this bronzer! I would defiantly recommend this to anyone. in fact I had a couple small travel size hoola bronzers that I gave to a friend and a family member so they could try it out.</li>
            <li> Best matte bronzer, seems like product is never ending!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite bronzer for the colder seasons. However, my 3 star rating comes from the warmer months where after wearing the bronzer for not even an hour, my face becomes very oily..AND I do not have oily skin what so ever. I&#x27;m thinking that the bronzer contains something that doesn&#x27;t mesh well with my skin. Bottom line, i&#x27;m not a glittery bronzer type of girl. I want the sunkissed non orange look! And like I said before..this bronzer is perfect for me in the colder months.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I seen Jaclyn HIll uses this.... and it looks great on her. but for my skin tone.... I don&#x27;t know. I guess I need to try this a few more times and then we will see. I do like it. But I need to reapply. Nice product overall.</li>
            <li> OK, this is an expensive bronzer, but I am really satisfied with the color.  I also really like the little box it comes in, I am a sucker for cute things.  I don&#x27;t use the brush that comes with it, I use a fuller/fatter long handle brush to apply.  It is hard to tell how much product is really in the box and how long it will last.</li>
