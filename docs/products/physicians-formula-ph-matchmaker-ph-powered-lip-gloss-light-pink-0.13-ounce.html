            <li>I am super impressed by this item and have ordered this &amp;#34;Light Pink&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;version.</li>
            <li>The packaging is incredible with the built in light and mirror.</li>
            <li>Okay, I confess, I am a lip gloss junkie!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both shades and I love them both!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The word needs to get out about this amazing product</li>
            <li>Truly an amazing product that I pray will be produced for years to come -</li>
            <li>The brush makes for a nice even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks good and better moisture in our lips</li>
            <li>Still a nice lipgloss, though.</li>
            <li>This is by far, the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used becasue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, from Chanel to drugstore brands, hoping to find one that I could love.</li>
            <li>I love this lipgloss.</li>
            <li>I so love this lipgloss by Physicians Formula.</li>
            <li>this lipgloss is horible in many ways it does not make my lip shine</li>
            <li>make better ones.</li>
            <li>More words~~I know.</li>
            <li>I love that the color adjusts, and it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>Love the mirror and the light!  </li>
            <li>This works better than any lip stain I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I are all different skin tones and it looks GREAT on all of us!</li>
            <li>Physicians is also a great cruelty-free and natural company that I will continue to support :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a such a great color and very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love freaking people out when I turn the light on.  </li>
            <li>Makes your lips look plump and full!</li>
            <li>I really like this gloss, color very pretty, not too sticky, stays on fairly well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--It isn&#x27;t sticky, but rather, has a creamy, smooth consistency, which makes it glide on easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought The Phisicians Formula PH Matchmaker in Light Pink, and was delighted with so many things about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to all these great features, I have to mention that the container has a little mirror on one side, AND it LIGHTS UP, via a button in the top of the cap.</li>
            <li>in all, this is the only gloss I&#x27;ve ever loved, and the one I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters heist this every morning before school becuase even after the gloss goes away, the gorgeous color stays.</li>
            <li>Long lasting ( the best i&#x27;ve ever had) , Non drying.  </li>
            <li>I purchased mine at a local drug store but Amazon&#x27;s price is better even with shipping!</li>
            <li>The mirror on the tube is handy, but the little light that is supposed to be on the want doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>light pink color turned itself into a very pretty, light rosy shade on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a magic trick on your lips, and its different on everyone who uses it!</li>
            <li>My sister and I both put it on but it turned a different color on both of us--a color that matched our skin tone and looked stunning.</li>
            <li>Turns just a little pink, again, perfectly.</li>
            <li>Well, I always thought that makeup was supposed to be FUN, but this stuff takes it to new levels!</li>
            <li>You have to try this product at least once to see the effect it has with your own eyes!</li>
            <li>The glossy part stayed on for several hours, and even when it wore off, there was still some light rosy color on my lips, almost as though I&#x27;d started with a lip stain instead of a gloss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find much to like in this product.</li>
            <li>Colors were much too bright~~just</li>
            <li>While the color does develop after application, I really think they should be emphasizing how long-lasting the color is.</li>
            <li>Light and mirror are an extra</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable, and comparable to other drugstore brands, and downright cheap, compared to department store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This lip gloss last a long time and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I&#x27;m THAT old!</li>
            <li>I love the rosy color it gave to me, and I will definitely be using it again, probably trying other colors as well.</li>
            <li>lips felt soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best lip gloss ever, and I absolutely hate lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in light pink first, then got the regular pink (goes on a lot darker) for my darker lip stains.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old enough to remember when all women ever wore on their lips was lipstick.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to remember when all women ever wore on their lips was lipstick.  Lip gloss didn&#x27;t exist. (Yes, I&#x27;m THAT old! ;&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for decades, I&#x27;ve been dealing with the lip gloss \\&quot;craze\\&quot;, and hating it.  I&#x27;ve tried them all, from Chanel to drugstore brands, hoping to find one that I could love. Or that would at least live up to its claims. You know the claims: \\&quot;Moisturizes! Makes your lips look plump and full! Not sticky! Stays on for hours!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I never found a single lip gloss that lived up to those claims. Until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought The Phisicians Formula PH Matchmaker in Light Pink, and was delighted with so many things about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It has a brush applicator, rather than one of those little doe-foot sponge things, which I&#x27;ve always disliked. The brush makes for a nice even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It isn&#x27;t sticky, but rather, has a creamy, smooth consistency, which makes it glide on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--There is NO offensive smell, or taste. In fact, no smell or taste at all, that I could detect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The light pink color turned itself into a very pretty, light rosy shade on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It wears well. The glossy part stayed on for several hours, and even when it wore off, there was still some light rosy color on my lips, almost as though I&#x27;d started with a lip stain instead of a gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--My lips felt soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all these great features, I have to mention that the container has a little mirror on one side, AND it LIGHTS UP, via a button in the top of the cap. The price is also very reasonable, and comparable to other drugstore brands, and downright cheap, compared to department store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the only gloss I&#x27;ve ever loved, and the one I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love this lipgloss. It&#x27;s the perfect color</li>
            <li> Best lip gloss for grown-ups! Glides-on perfectly. Stays on perfectly. Turns just a little pink, again, perfectly. Even the construction of the tube with its mirror and light-perfect! It&#x27;s the best lip gloss ever, and I absolutely hate lip gloss. Why can&#x27;t they all get it this perfectly?</li>
            <li> I so love this lipgloss by Physicians Formula. Looks good and better moisture in our lips👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I&#x27;m asking Physicians Formula to PLEASE put PHmatchmaker Ph powerlid lipgloss back on Target or Walmart for customer convenience😉 and Do Not discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> this lipgloss is horible in many ways it does not make my lip shine and it is not colored its terrible when i got it i was so happy and then the disappointment came it was a disaster. make better ones.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find much to like in this product. Colors were much too bright~~just didn&#x27;t like it at all. More words~~I know.</li>
            <li> I really like this gloss, color very pretty, not too sticky, stays on fairly well. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good color.  Long lasting ( the best i&#x27;ve ever had) , Non drying.  These things are difficult if not impossible, to  find in just one lipstick.  I  sincerley hope you have not stopped making it!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss last a long time and is easy to apply. It puts a beautiful shine&lt;br /&gt;on the lips and doesn&#x27;t feather at all. I am super impressed by this item and have ordered this &amp;#34;Light Pink&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;version.</li>
            <li> Well, I always thought that makeup was supposed to be FUN, but this stuff takes it to new levels! It&#x27;s like a magic trick on your lips, and its different on everyone who uses it! I love the rosy color it gave to me, and I will definitely be using it again, probably trying other colors as well. You have to try this product at least once to see the effect it has with your own eyes!</li>

            <li> This product is amazing. My sister and I both put it on but it turned a different color on both of us--a color that matched our skin tone and looked stunning. Highly recommended. Physicians is also a great cruelty-free and natural company that I will continue to support :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this in light pink first, then got the regular pink (goes on a lot darker) for my darker lip stains.  Love the mirror and the light!  Great idea!</li>
            <li> While the color does develop after application, I really think they should be emphasizing how long-lasting the color is. Though the shine from the gloss had faded, my lips stayed tinted even after chatting on the phone and eating. This works better than any lip stain I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Okay, I confess, I am a lip gloss junkie! I&#x27;ve tried them all, and I mean ALL! This is by far, the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used becasue it&#x27;s not just a lip gloss but it&#x27;s also a lip stain! The word needs to get out about this amazing product so they do NOT discontinue it! It&#x27;s not sticky, no odor, no taste. The packaging is incredible with the built in light and mirror. I&#x27;ve tried both shades and I love them both! My teenage daughters heist this every morning before school becuase even after the gloss goes away, the gorgeous color stays. My daughters and I are all different skin tones and it looks GREAT on all of us! Truly an amazing product that I pray will be produced for years to come - I purchased mine at a local drug store but Amazon&#x27;s price is better even with shipping! Don&#x27;t hesitate to pruchase this - you WON&#x27;T be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while.  It&#x27;s a such a great color and very easy to apply.  I love freaking people out when I turn the light on.  It&#x27;s very handy and I love it!</li>
            <li> This gloss was awesome. I had got it for me but my daughter who is picky about color and type of gloss loved it. She kept it and the pH color changing is great. Light and mirror are an extra plus!  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girls as a stocking stuffer Christmas 2014. They loved the product a lot!</li>
