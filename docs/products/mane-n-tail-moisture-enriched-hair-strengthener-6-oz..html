            <li>, LOVE the smell - wish I could wear it as perfume.  </li>

            <li>I am using the Mane n&#x27; Tail shampoo (which REALLY works!!!!)</li>
            <li>this is pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Relaxed hair tends to get over-processed over time but this product keeps my hair healthy and STRONG.</li>

            <li>However, it&#x27;s made my hair smooth, so that I don&#x27;t get tangles, which keeps me from getting more damage.</li>
            <li>It makes relaxed hair extremely strong.</li>

            <li>The jam-like scent description is accurate.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also great for human hair.</li>

            <li>&#x27;n Tail Original Conditioner and the Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I use the Mane &#x27;n Tail Original Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo (original) for a body wash.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in much better shape, soft and frizz free</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair smell and feel so good.</li>
            <li>Works really good on my dry bleached hair!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with fine hair, particularly if it tends toward fluffy-soft.</li>
            <li>Over time, your hair will flourish if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li>Thank you sooo much!</li>
            <li>I admit that I&#x27;m normally aware of some hair shedding, but the rate seemed to accelerate with the Mane &#x27;n Tail so had to can it.</li>
            <li>I hope they keep this scent and this product exactly as it is.  </li>
            <li>Great if you have long hair and blow it straight, use flat iron, etc.</li>
            <li>I spritz it on my hair at night making sure that my ends are treated, then I either loosely pin curl or wrap my hair.</li>
            <li>Dont need a whole lot,  </li>
            <li>It really made a difference in the feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>It really helps protect the hair, and my hair is stronger, and healther than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>This stuff really smells to me.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair since using this product, but I will say it has too much fragrance.</li>
            <li>works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>All of the Mane&#x27; n Tail products work very well, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>had i known it would d absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I am sorta sensitive to smell, for example, if I go to Sephora and try sampling more than 4 different perfumes, I will get a headache and feel nauseous.</li>
            <li>Even though I have very fine hair - it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.  </li>
            <li>When I sprayed it on my hair after it was dry, it left it kind of crunchy and the smell was a bit much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old and my hair is white with fine texture.</li>
            <li>Aloe is farther down on the ingredient list, but it still works way better than this stuff.)</li>
            <li>It was happening too frequently for me to feel good about this product, and it was the only styling aid other than shampoo and conditioner that I used.</li>
            <li>I use this product along with the shampoo and conditioner main n tail herbal gro, before blow drying.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s for a horse main and tail</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This was much too heavy for my fine hair, and what&#x27;s this bonus?  </li>
            <li>(I do steer you toward buying the Aussie 3 minute miracle spray, but be aware they changed their formula recently.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to be watered down version of the original</li>
            <li>Have tried out other products in the past and try to stick with them for a good period of time in order to give them a chance to do their thing.</li>
            <li>right as you&#x27;re getting out of the shower and your hair is still wet, it will make your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>But if you are not too sensitive to smell, maybe you should give it a try.</li>
            <li>Initially I suspected an increase in hair loss/breakage (I couldn&#x27;t figure which) but thought it might be my imagination and gave it a few more days.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and this spray made my hair weighed down and staticky at the same time.</li>
            <li>I always let my hair air-dry and this product gives it a very silky feel when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>excelent ir real y helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li>But my hair looks super shiny when its done and blow dried.</li>
            <li>Nothing changed...I&#x27;d be walking around in short-sleeves and pretty regularly through the day would feel a tickle on an arm, look down, and see a hair laying there.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my hair when using this other than it made my hair greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just not sure if this is the right product.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m just not sure if this is the right product.</li>
            <li> I could not try out this product long enough to see the results because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Such a strange combination.</li>
            <li> I love my long hair, but I hate taking care of it, espescially when I want it straight.</li>
            <li> I have long, chemically treated damaged hair</li>
            <li> it is missing alot of its natural proteins.</li>
            <li> this product made my hair too wet for daily use.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years along with coconut oil for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thick straight hair</li>
            <li> It has helped give my hair volume and keep it from being so dry.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to spray on dry hair, even though it says you can on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair...</li>
            <li> Just like the Mane &#x27;n Tail shampoo and conditioner of this same line, it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> When item was received lid was loose on bottle and all product was in the package which had a hole in it.  </li>
            <li> Also do not be deceived by the picture you do not get an extra little bottle.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different other than my usual Aussie 3 minute miracle leave in conditioner, but I&#x27;ll be going back to that.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not noticeable if you spray it in wet hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly I damaged my hair this year with a bad curling iron (that had multiple heat settings, but was still to hot) and needed something to help smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> also, I&#x27;m not sure if it actually strengthens my hair or not.</li>
            <li> Had my hair like wire, still had to get a leave in conditioner for my hair only used it a few times, smells wired!</li>
            <li> This product cut down on time spent doing my hair after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> But i suggest you be very careful in using this product, because misuse can cause breakage.</li>
            <li> I find that this product was not worth the money, I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to if I wear my hair up to attempt to get some moisture and keep flyways down.</li>
            <li> I have noticed losing less hair when brushing</li>
            <li> I like it though I&#x27;m not super fond of the fragrance...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again due to the fragrance alone.</li>
            <li> This one I only used for a short period of time, about a week, and after that I used it on a few scattered occasions until I realized it was a bad product choice for me.</li>
            <li> Has a little oil in it and leaves my hair shiny!</li>
            <li> the only problem...it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I thought this product had gone bad, but when I read the other reviews, other people commented on the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I have a cowlick, I hate it, I spray on this product when my hair is wet and it stays in place all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works well or not, maybe I bought it for the wrong reason.</li>
            <li> But the first thing I noticed was the awful smell.</li>
            <li> you have weak or faling hair.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for my thin, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fix the damage, unfortunately, but nothing will.  </li>
            <li> it makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and my hair gets a crunchy feel (like hairspray) after I apply this.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AWFUL....</li>
            <li> It also has a really nasty smell which I couldn&#x27;t stand so in the garbage it went!!!</li>
            <li> the smell is awful, cannot use the product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this is pretty good stuff.  Dont need a whole lot,  But my hair looks super shiny when its done and blow dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using MnT conditioner for some time and picked up this product on a whim the last time I restocked. I was amazed to discover that it was an excellent defrizzing product for my  fine,soft, ultracurly hair. It does strengthen my hair in the sense that it reinforces it thereby reducing the absorbtion of humidity and minimizing shrinkage. I recommend this product for anyone with fine hair, particularly if it tends toward fluffy-soft.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this stuff after reading all of the great reviews but honestly, it didn&#x27;t wow me. I have long, chemically treated damaged hair so I must need a product with more oomph.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and my hair gets a crunchy feel (like hairspray) after I apply this. I have medium thick straight hair and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It was good, but now I do not need this product anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is very potent. It has alot of protein. It makes relaxed hair extremely strong. I really love this stuff. Hair is 80% protein, and relaxed hair of course it is missing alot of its natural proteins. This product put the protein back into the hair strand. But i suggest you be very careful in using this product, because misuse can cause breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and my hair is white with fine texture. I wanted to have younger feeling hair that was easier to manage. I love this product. It really made a difference in the feel and look of my hair. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AWFUL....like really gross and I use it bc I paid money for it but I don&#x27;t really see a difference. Also do not be deceived by the picture you do not get an extra little bottle. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this!!!!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make a different in my hair what so ever. It also has a really nasty smell which I couldn&#x27;t stand so in the garbage it went!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the shampoo and conditioner main n tail herbal gro, before blow drying. It really helps protect the hair, and my hair is stronger, and healther than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> This stuff really smells to me.  I can&#x27;t use it it makes me feel sick. Almost of a manure smell mixed with regular hair product smell. I&#x27;ve had much better leave in sprays before.</li>
            <li> My hair feels the same when I used it... the smell is awful, cannot use the product</li>
            <li> I have ordered all of the Mane &amp; Tale This is also one of my favorites awesome products Will be reordering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out a pixie cut so I will do just about anything to enhance my hair growth or whatever, but I swear this stuff has made my hair grow an inch in 3 weeks. I use it in my hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair smell and feel so good. My hair has felt longer and healthier since I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li> Works really good on my dry bleached hair! Has a little oil in it and leaves my hair shiny! Love it..</li>
            <li> I have bra strap length relaxed hair. This product works amazingly on my hair. Relaxed hair tends to get over-processed over time but this product keeps my hair healthy and STRONG. I spritz it on my hair at night making sure that my ends are treated, then I either loosely pin curl or wrap my hair. The next day I can literally see the difference! Over time, your hair will flourish if you use it consistently. Also, a little goes a long way...you don&#x27;t need too much. Thumbs up for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works well or not, maybe I bought it for the wrong reason. I have noticed losing less hair when brushing but I&#x27;m just not sure if this is the right product. The smell is not horrible, its something I can get passed.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I spray it at the end of my hair everynight before I wrap it or roller set it.  This product has eliminated my split ends problems.  My ends are healthy and my hair is not breaking.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s for a horse main and tail it&#x27;s also great for human hair. I have a cowlick, I hate it, I spray on this product when my hair is wet and it stays in place all day long.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells good and it works great on my hair.  It has helped give my hair volume and keep it from being so dry.</li>
            <li> I have bleach damaged asian hair which I am trying to grow out so I can chop off the damaged hair. I am using the Mane n&#x27; Tail shampoo (which REALLY works!!!!) and thought I should give this a try since it&#x27;s the same line. But the first thing I noticed was the awful smell. I thought this product had gone bad, but when I read the other reviews, other people commented on the smell as well. I am sorta sensitive to smell, for example, if I go to Sephora and try sampling more than 4 different perfumes, I will get a headache and feel nauseous. I could not try out this product long enough to see the results because of the smell. But if you are not too sensitive to smell, maybe you should give it a try. The shampoo definitely works, maybe this does too?</li>
            <li> This was much too heavy for my fine hair, and what&#x27;s this bonus?  Now that I am seeing the picture, I am realizing I never received a bonus product!</li>
            <li> I like it though I&#x27;m not super fond of the fragrance...the detangler has a much more pleasing fragrance. It detangles also, I&#x27;m not sure if it actually strengthens my hair or not. The fragrance deters me from using it as often as I do the detangler. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again due to the fragrance alone.</li>
            <li> Great product for a swimmer&#x27;s hair. The more strengthening the better to keep my daughter&#x27;s hair in the best condition.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair since using this product, but I will say it has too much fragrance. It&#x27;s very sweet. It doesn&#x27;t act as a detangler at all, which is fine.</li>
            <li> I just received this product about a week ago and have tried it out every night... I find that this product was not worth the money, I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Just like the Mane &#x27;n Tail shampoo and conditioner of this same line, it&#x27;s not worth the money. Also, I didn&#x27;t receive the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; as advertised. I just got the spray in conditioner. I threw it out with the garbage this morning. I wanted to try something different other than my usual Aussie 3 minute miracle leave in conditioner, but I&#x27;ll be going back to that. I have fine hair, and this spray made my hair weighed down and staticky at the same time. Such a strange combination. No thanks. (I do steer you toward buying the Aussie 3 minute miracle spray, but be aware they changed their formula recently. Aloe is farther down on the ingredient list, but it still works way better than this stuff.)</li>
            <li> Sadly I damaged my hair this year with a bad curling iron (that had multiple heat settings, but was still to hot) and needed something to help smooth my hair.  This product makes my hair smooth and shiny.  I am a scientist, with a background in both cellular biology and chemistry, so I understand hair structure and know what the chemicals on the ingredient list are.  In fact, I looked specifically for these ingredients based on published studies on Pubmed.  So I knew I would be getting a good product and I did.  It didn&#x27;t fix the damage, unfortunately, but nothing will.  However, it&#x27;s made my hair smooth, so that I don&#x27;t get tangles, which keeps me from getting more damage.</li>
            <li> Love this hair strengthener. It works wonders for my thin, frizzy hair. Thank you sooo much!</li>
            <li> I made this purchase based on the many positive reviews I found and because my hair breaks easily. Have tried out other products in the past and try to stick with them for a good period of time in order to give them a chance to do their thing. This one I only used for a short period of time, about a week, and after that I used it on a few scattered occasions until I realized it was a bad product choice for me. Initially I suspected an increase in hair loss/breakage (I couldn&#x27;t figure which) but thought it might be my imagination and gave it a few more days. Nothing changed...I&#x27;d be walking around in short-sleeves and pretty regularly through the day would feel a tickle on an arm, look down, and see a hair laying there. It was happening too frequently for me to feel good about this product, and it was the only styling aid other than shampoo and conditioner that I used. Even when I stopped using it regularly and started using it sporadically, the same thing was happening on the days that I used the product. I admit that I&#x27;m normally aware of some hair shedding, but the rate seemed to accelerate with the Mane &#x27;n Tail so had to can it.</li>
            <li> This along with the leave in cream, alternating each,&lt;br /&gt;was a blessing to me and anyone around that had to&lt;br /&gt;watch my hair thinning out.</li>
            <li> this product made my hair too wet for daily use. it was so-so. not sue if I would recommend to a friend .</li>
            <li> LOVE it. Makes my hair softer than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> This product is great. works very well on my hair. Packing was great with no leaking  while in the transport process</li>
            <li> All of the Mane&#x27; n Tail products work very well, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love Mane &#x27;n Tail Original Conditioner and the Shampoo.  I use the Conditioner to actually wash my hair - using the Conditioner Only method (google that) :0)  A couple of times a month I use the Mane &#x27;n Tail Original Shampoo.  I also use the shampoo (original) for a body wash.  Been using these for years along with coconut oil for my long hair.  This product however, adds extra oomph and shine and strength.  Even though I have very fine hair - it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.  I LOVE, LOVE the smell - wish I could wear it as perfume.  I hope they keep this scent and this product exactly as it is.  The jam-like scent description is accurate.  Depending on how I wear my hair - I will either use the conditioner as a hair dressing or, this Enriched Hair Strengthener.  GREAT products at affordable prices.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger since using this product and I hightly recommend it id you have weak or faling hair.</li>
            <li> It was a no hassle delivery. The spray smells amazing and does not leave your hair oily. I will be a return costumer.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner. If you spray it all over your hair (especially the ends) right as you&#x27;re getting out of the shower and your hair is still wet, it will make your hair very soft. I always let my hair air-dry and this product gives it a very silky feel when it&#x27;s dry. It does smell kind of strong but it&#x27;s not noticeable if you spray it in wet hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to spray on dry hair, even though it says you can on the bottle. When I sprayed it on my hair after it was dry, it left it kind of crunchy and the smell was a bit much.</li>
            <li> wOUld not spend money on this had i known it would d absolutely nothing. Its basically the same as spraying water to hair</li>
            <li> Had my hair like wire, still had to get a leave in conditioner for my hair only used it a few times, smells wired!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the free product that was suppose to come with item.</li>
            <li> My hair is in much better shape, soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my hair when using this other than it made my hair greasy and weighed down. This is my go-to if I wear my hair up to attempt to get some moisture and keep flyways down.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair... Not noticing any benefits</li>
            <li> Did not even get to try product. When item was received lid was loose on bottle and all product was in the package which had a hole in it.  Did not receive the bonus bottle either.</li>
            <li> No bonos attached to my package. But the moisture is excelent ir real y helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be watered down version of the original I did not like it and will pass next time</li>
            <li> I love all the Mane &#x27;n Tail products. Great if you have long hair and blow it straight, use flat iron, etc. I love my long hair, but I hate taking care of it, espescially when I want it straight. This product cut down on time spent doing my hair after 2 uses. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It a great product. It helps strengthen my hair and gives it great shine. the only problem...it has a weird smell.</li>
