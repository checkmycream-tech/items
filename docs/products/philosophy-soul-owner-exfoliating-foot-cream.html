            <li>Now that cannot be good.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Not too sure how this is formulated to exfoliate when you just can&#x27;t feel it doing just that!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I could have my own drugstore!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I do my own pedicures to save money and you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The cream also has a really nice spa like fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the scrub, it&#x27;s a nice way to supplement and extend the time between pedicures.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect easy-to-use product to have baby soft feet!!  </li>
            <li>By far one of the best foot creams out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years; it&#x27;s the most effective product I&#x27;ve found for exfoliation and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>If it is good, then it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I would say that Soul Owner is currently my favorite foot cream</li>
            <li>just so my feet are in better shape to begin with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this foot cream.</li>
            <li>rub a bit of this around your cuticles, and they go like magic, again, overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>For the price, I was hoping for a bit more (even though I knew the size I was ordering)</li>
            <li>BUT, it will work better than anything else.</li>
            <li>It did a much better job.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This has kept my feet in pretty good shape.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest lotion if you have extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li>my feet are very soft and look great.</li>
            <li>If you want a really, really good foot cream, go for the Aveda one as it smells luxurious, and makes my feet feel so very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I like this foot cream, it smells really good (very fresh and clean), and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Did a fabulous job over the summer.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My feet are super smooth- somewhat embarrassing to do &amp;</li>
            <li>feet look good for several hours.</li>
            <li>My pedicurist is always amazed by my nice, soft feet.</li>
            <li>It is also made with more natural ingredients than the Philosophy product, which alerts you to wash your hands after using!</li>
            <li>people might find the mint aroma ia bit strong, especially at night, but my husband loves it :)</li>
            <li>but this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for the size, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and I am almost through my first tube of it.</li>
            <li>Hot, I know.</li>
            <li>Cream does seem to soften my feet - not necessarily any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>If I had the money I&#x27;ve spent on foot creams for my super-dry and flaky feet---especially around the heels, where ashy is a nice word to use---</li>
            <li>This product really exfoliates!  </li>
            <li>When used consistently, it keeps my feet feeling softer and smoother for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect from philosophy.</li>
            <li>I would like to share my opinion that the product is not great, or even good!</li>
            <li>it hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing any good.</li>
            <li>However after putting on soul owner, puttin on some socks and going to sleep, I wake up with much softer feet.</li>
            <li>The smell is very invigorating.</li>
            <li>This foot cream is very watery and not all that moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>this is one foot cream that really does what it says</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>this product really, really works, and it literally makes a difference overnight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to buff my heels as much.</li>
            <li>After one or two applications, this makes my foot so much smoother and the cracks begin to heal.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I use other Philosophy products and love some and some, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I love this and per ounce it is less costly and easier for me to obtain.</li>
            <li>as I got older.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok though it is not a clean mint scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and it makes a difference after a few uses.</li>
            <li>My feet are chronically dry, and this is one of the only products that actually helps keep them soft and looking good.</li>
            <li>I do like this product, it goes on very creamy and instantly makes my feet, ankles and toes feel very silky soft!  </li>
            <li>The only positive thing it did for my feet was to leave them smelling like mint.</li>
            <li>Massaging the lotion into your feet every other night and this tube will be gone rather quickly.</li>
            <li>My feet are soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>truly makes your feet soft.  </li>
            <li>Use of this product has eliminated all callouses and now my feet are baby soft all the time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get any pressure to squirt it out of the real opening, so I have to squeeze it out of the hole.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not the same as going to the salon.</li>
            <li>I always return to this product, because it delivers just the right combination of exfoliation such that within a week, my ultra-dry or calloused feet are back in shape with softer and callous-free heels and skin.  </li>
            <li>Now this new tube seems to be using a different formula.</li>
            <li>I generally use it after my pumice stone when I finish with the shower.</li>
            <li>Apparently it used to be peppermint smelling.  </li>
            <li>Really smooths and softens the rough skin on my heels.</li>
            <li>The top seam that holds the product in the container busted on one half a few weeks after purchase.</li>
            <li>They are still not perfect (hence the 4 stars) but the cracked heels and rough patches are gone, the calluses are still there a little, but way better, and the toenails are WAY better.</li>
            <li>little scent, nice and thick.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell, but I certainly can&#x27;t believe it passed any product review!</li>
            <li> I used to have rough skin on my heels, balls of my feet, and big toe</li>
            <li> It softens my dry heels but doesn&#x27;t overpower me with a stinky scent.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or callouses, this works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of buying another tube of this product as it is not cheap, and you really get very little for your money, in fact, I was out in just a couple of weeks because i was trying to find those exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li> I have cracked heels, rough patches, some calluses and dry skin around my toenails.</li>
            <li> and my feet are rough and calloused again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used up my container of this cream that I&#x27;d bought a few years back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the ole PedEgg, as well as other files, creams and serums with not much luck for the effort.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also makes me want to try other philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple of times a week and supplement with Philosophy&#x27;s other foot cream in between.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews - it appears they may have changed the scent.  </li>
            <li> Even other people I spoke with who use this product rave about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but unless I get a pedicure where they rasp off the callouses, nothing works as well.</li>
            <li> I get very rough heels in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Overall a disappointing purchase, since I really like its hand cream.</li>
            <li> Once the rough skin is gone it takes less.</li>
            <li> Hardly does any exfoliating, none that one can notice, only a bit of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is a blue color, a bland odor, and the product has not exfoliated my feet in the least bit.</li>
            <li> half the tube is air.</li>
            <li> Even after a pedicure I walk around for a little</li>
            <li> Leave little to no residue after absorption.</li>
            <li> Probably flip, but a product this expensive shouldn&#x27;t be hucking empty financial moralism at its consumers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively expensive; the tube is not that big.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a miracle-worked on my cuticles, which get comments at every mani about how thick, tough and dry they are, even though I&#x27;m a devoted lotion</li>
            <li> Hard to believe it&#x27;s from Philosophy.  </li>
            <li> This softens all the hard spots in just a couple of applications.</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> That is: I hate the text on the packaging enough to dock a star.</li>
            <li> expensive.</li>
            <li> I might be using it wrong, but</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I just really hate the text on the packaging.</li>
            <li> But....the smell is just awful.  </li>
            <li> smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> 14.00 for a 3.3 ounce tube of cream is alot to pay. If it is good, then it is worth it. I would like to share my opinion that the product is not great, or even good! It reminds me of the freebie handlotion you receive in the hospital. It is a blue color, a bland odor, and the product has not exfoliated my feet in the least bit. Way over priced. If you want a really, really good foot cream, go for the Aveda one as it smells luxurious, and makes my feet feel so very smooth and soft. It is also made with more natural ingredients than the Philosophy product, which alerts you to wash your hands after using! Now that cannot be good. Save your money people and buy yourself something that makes you feel good!</li>
            <li> I would say that Soul Owner is currently my favorite foot cream and I am almost through my first tube of it. I wish I could give 4.5 stars. I have cracked heels, rough patches, some calluses and dry skin around my toenails. Hot, I know. I&#x27;ve tried the ole PedEgg, as well as other files, creams and serums with not much luck for the effort. Even after a pedicure I walk around for a little but and my feet are rough and calloused again. However after putting on soul owner, puttin on some socks and going to sleep, I wake up with much softer feet. They are still not perfect (hence the 4 stars) but the cracked heels and rough patches are gone, the calluses are still there a little, but way better, and the toenails are WAY better. I feel like I&#x27;d even want to use some the night before a pedicure (which I don&#x27;t get often) just so my feet are in better shape to begin with. It also makes me want to try other philosophy products.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! This stuff is amazing. After only two days of use, my feet, especially my cracked heels, look like I just got a pedi. My feet are soft and moisturized. The smell is very invigorating. I will never be without this product, again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not emolient for my liking.  The scent isn&#x27;t pleasant.  Prefer AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy..little scent, nice and thick.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is very watery and not all that moisturizing.  The scent is ok though it is not a clean mint scent.  Overall a disappointing purchase, since I really like its hand cream.</li>
            <li> this product is the only one i know of that truly makes your feet soft.  my local sephora does not carry it anymore so amazon it is.</li>
            <li> this is one foot cream that really does what it says&lt;br /&gt;i have used it for years,i am 48 and everytime i go for a pedicure&lt;br /&gt;they always tell me how great my feet are. this is all i use&lt;br /&gt;and my feet are very soft and look great. i would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to anyone.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best foot creams out there. I noticed a difference within a couple of weeks.   I use this a couple of times a week and supplement with Philosophy&#x27;s other foot cream in between.</li>
            <li> Cream does seem to soften my feet - not necessarily any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  But....the smell is just awful.  Hard to believe it&#x27;s from Philosophy.  Reading other reviews - it appears they may have changed the scent.  Apparently it used to be peppermint smelling.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell, but I certainly can&#x27;t believe it passed any product review!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Daily use has resulted in no callouses on my feet.  I highly recommend it! I used to have rough skin on my heels, balls of my feet, and big toe as I got older.  Use of this product has eliminated all callouses and now my feet are baby soft all the time.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this product. Would not purchase again. The only positive thing it did for my feet was to leave them smelling like mint.</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream. It softens my dry heels but doesn&#x27;t overpower me with a stinky scent. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If I had the money I&#x27;ve spent on foot creams for my super-dry and flaky feet---especially around the heels, where ashy is a nice word to use--- I could have my own drugstore!&lt;br /&gt;But this product really, really works, and it literally makes a difference overnight. I suspect it has to do with glycolic acid being the send ingredient. Whatever, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a miracle-worked on my cuticles, which get comments at every mani about how thick, tough and dry they are, even though I&#x27;m a devoted lotion user.&lt;br /&gt;Just rub a bit of this around your cuticles, and they go like magic, again, overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Some people might find the mint aroma ia bit strong, especially at night, but my husband loves it :)&lt;br /&gt;And I love this product, which works the best of any skin-care product I use for anything.</li>
            <li> This lotion is like magic-even though it smells funky.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest lotion if you have extremely dry feet.  This softens all the hard spots in just a couple of applications.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! This has kept my feet in pretty good shape. I don&#x27;t have to buff my heels as much. The smell is a bit medicinal, but fades almost as soon as product is spread. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This foot cream works amazing! Has a great scent, softens the skin, and lasts. The only downfall is the size. Massaging the lotion into your feet every other night and this tube will be gone rather quickly. For the price, I was hoping for a bit more (even though I knew the size I was ordering)</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful use it nightly on my feet</li>
            <li> feet look good for several hours. no permanent benefits. smells awful. expensive. half the tube is air.</li>
            <li> This product really exfoliates!  Did a fabulous job over the summer.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or callouses, this works. It&#x27;s relatively expensive; the tube is not that big. BUT, it will work better than anything else. I use a lot during winter, then put on my socks to let it absorb. Once the rough skin is gone it takes less. My feet are super smooth- somewhat embarrassing to do &amp;#34;a tell&amp;#34;-all about my feet but this product is worth the price. I do my own pedicures to save money and you can&#x27;t tell the difference. At least I don&#x27;t think so. LOL.</li>
            <li> The top seam that holds the product in the container busted on one half a few weeks after purchase. I can&#x27;t get any pressure to squirt it out of the real opening, so I have to squeeze it out of the hole.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not the same as going to the salon. I might be using it wrong, but it hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing any good.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for the size, but it&#x27;s worth it. The scent is refreshing and it makes a difference after a few uses. Leave little to no residue after absorption. Even other people I spoke with who use this product rave about it. I guess that somewhat justifies the price</li>
            <li> It did not do the job that it claims.  Exfoliating my wife&#x27;s feet, it didn&#x27;t happen.  I bought it for Christmas present cause she enjoys for me to message her feet and at the same time exfoliate her feet. Instead I went to Walgreens to purchase another brand which was on sale.  It did a much better job.</li>
            <li> I like this foot cream, it smells really good (very fresh and clean), and it works very well. Really smooths and softens the rough skin on my heels. It also has a cooling effect when applied. When used consistently, it keeps my feet feeling softer and smoother for a longer period of time. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years; it&#x27;s the most effective product I&#x27;ve found for exfoliation and moisturizing. My pedicurist is always amazed by my nice, soft feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used up my container of this cream that I&#x27;d bought a few years back. It worked well. Now this new tube seems to be using a different formula. Hardly does any exfoliating, none that one can notice, only a bit of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Could not take the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I often have to get fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I get very rough heels in the winter.  After one or two applications, this makes my foot so much smoother and the cracks begin to heal.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect easy-to-use product to have baby soft feet!!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I use other Philosophy products and love some and some, not so much.  I do like this product, it goes on very creamy and instantly makes my feet, ankles and toes feel very silky soft!  The cream also has a really nice spa like fragrance to it.  However, where are those exfoliating properties, I don&#x27;t see them nor do I feel them?  Not too sure how this is formulated to exfoliate when you just can&#x27;t feel it doing just that!  I&#x27;m not a fan of buying another tube of this product as it is not cheap, and you really get very little for your money, in fact, I was out in just a couple of weeks because i was trying to find those exfoliating properties. I plan to follow up on this, and I&#x27;ll let you know...</li>
            <li> I always return to this product, because it delivers just the right combination of exfoliation such that within a week, my ultra-dry or calloused feet are back in shape with softer and callous-free heels and skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, but unless I get a pedicure where they rasp off the callouses, nothing works as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years on my feet and elbows.  Used in conjunction with the scrub, it&#x27;s a nice way to supplement and extend the time between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I formerly purchased a salon brand. I love this and per ounce it is less costly and easier for me to obtain. My feet feel great after using this. I generally use it after my pumice stone when I finish with the shower.</li>
            <li> If You Are Having Any Problems With YourFeet Don&#x27;t Hesitate To Buy ThIs Product Immediate Results. My Friend Had Been Suggesting That I Try Soul Owner For Years, And Finally I Bought It, I&#x27;ll NEVER be Without It Again. Never!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great and leaves your feet smooth. Exactly what you would expect from philosophy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot. My feet are chronically dry, and this is one of the only products that actually helps keep them soft and looking good. I just really hate the text on the packaging. That is: I hate the text on the packaging enough to dock a star. Probably flip, but a product this expensive shouldn&#x27;t be hucking empty financial moralism at its consumers. I should probably just start decanting it into a different container and get over it.</li>
