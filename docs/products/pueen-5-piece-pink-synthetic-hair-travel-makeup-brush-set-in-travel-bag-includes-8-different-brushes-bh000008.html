            <li>I like it because it can fit in my purse!</li>
            <li>I love how compact these brushes are.</li>
            <li>may have to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and will definitely be ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the brushes and they way they work while applying my make up, but they smell like they have been soaked in a chemical....</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes for travel</li>
            <li>They are so soft and apply my make up beautifully.</li>
            <li>and they are good as new love them</li>
            <li>im a huge brush junkie, just got them</li>
            <li>These are the most soft and coolest brushes I own now.</li>
            <li>i am very unsatisfied!!!</li>
            <li>but pretty sure it will do the job.</li>
            <li>I really love the large angled brush.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a blending brush which is something I really looked for but for the price they are ok.</li>
            <li>This is an adorable and very affordable set of brushes that I now use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really nice and soft does not pick up a lot of product on brushes</li>
            <li>Other than that, happy customer.</li>
            <li>However, on my very first use the tip fell off of one of the brushes because it was not glued on well.</li>
            <li>They also arrived very fast, about a week before the scheduled delivery date!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re super cute and the bristles seemed very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly decent set of brushes, the powder brush could be a bit looser or more full to ensure a better coverage but overall for the price not bad.</li>
            <li>totally worth it because the brushes are aoft and do what they need to do</li>
            <li>The pink and white color is nice but they are stained easily and remains stained even after light washing.</li>
            <li>and I love how some are double sided.</li>
            <li>She says them being double ended is very good for traveling since it takes up less space.</li>
            <li>so I should be okay for at least being cute.</li>
            <li>I adore these brushes, they get 5 stars just for being pink, but they&#x27;re also super soft, easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a brush set that is inexpensive, I highly recommend this one (or others from this brand, they also have larger sets with more brushes)</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes, much nicer</li>
            <li>Even the cute pink color can&#x27;t redeem this brush set.</li>
            <li>They came extremely fast in the mail</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and I love the fact that they are double sided.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes but after having them and using them for a year now most have broken off had to hot glue them back on but</li>
            <li>They are soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I never used these because they were way too small for my need</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves a decent but the ferrules do not stay on the handles.  </li>
            <li>They are so soft and work really well for applying powder, contouring, blending, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them for  a hand full of times so far</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of brushes but compact enough for a medium size make-up case.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, and synthetic which is a must for me...</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t used them, but they seem to be well made and very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>they are very soft and apply the shadow well.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far no fall outs!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the brush heads frequently come off the wooden handle but its easy to glue them back on.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes.</li>
            <li>the plus side, the bristles on the brushes are soft and apply blusher and/or  </li>
            <li>But for this price the brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>cannot recommend this product in spite of the fact that the larger brushes (powder and blush) are of decent quality.</li>
            <li>Loved the brushes, very soft, the only thing wrong is that the metal heads fell off and I had to glue them in order to use them.</li>
            <li>She really likes them, especially the smaller brushes.</li>

            <li> I ordered the PUEEN 5 Piece Pink Synthetic Hair Travel Makeup Brush Set in PVC Bag to take on vacation.</li>
            <li> then I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> However they are pink</li>
            <li> They were not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> so im not sure how sturdy they are in the long run.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is three less brushes I have to make space for.</li>
            <li> When I received them half of them were falling apart</li>
            <li> I just wanted a little brush set for travel.</li>
            <li> the blending brush is a little stiff, but hopefully it will relax a little with time.</li>
            <li> I plan to wash them maybe this will take away the harsh smell.</li>
            <li> Small set...made for travel.</li>
            <li> The brushes are poorly pasted to the pink part.</li>
            <li> On the down side, the double-ended eye makeup brushes are poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> these brushes are not worth a penny they came apart very poor quality</li>
            <li> Some brushes came broken since I opened them and the rest broke eventually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it&#x27;s of a poor quality.  </li>

            <li> these brushes are not worth a penny they came apart very poor quality</li>
            <li> Cute! They are soft and pretty. I like it because it can fit in my purse!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves a decent but the ferrules do not stay on the handles.  I&#x27;ve tried gluing them on with several different adhesives but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, and synthetic which is a must for me... However, on my very first use the tip fell off of one of the brushes because it was not glued on well. To sum up: You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> When I received them half of them were falling apart and I had to fix them. They were not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the PUEEN 5 Piece Pink Synthetic Hair Travel Makeup Brush Set in PVC Bag to take on vacation. I haven&#x27;t taken a vacation since I received them so I haven&#x27;t used them, but they seem to be well made and very soft.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes. Applying and blending is simple with these brushes. I love how compact these brushes are. Great price too!</li>
            <li> im a huge brush junkie, just got them but i have used them and i like.  the blending brush is a little stiff, but hopefully it will relax a little with time.</li>
            <li> Small set...made for travel. Very soft bristles. It doesnt have a blending brush which is something I really looked for but for the price they are ok. If your a makeup guru then these are NOT the brushes for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly decent set of brushes, the powder brush could be a bit looser or more full to ensure a better coverage but overall for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my teenager. She really likes them, especially the smaller brushes. She says them being double ended is very good for traveling since it takes up less space.</li>
            <li> They fell apart when I got them but I re glued them on and they are good as new love them they are very soft and apply the shadow well. The blush brush I&#x27;m not too find of but the angled brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Some brushes came broken since I opened them and the rest broke eventually. The brushes are poorly pasted to the pink part.</li>
            <li> This is an adorable and very affordable set of brushes that I now use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I may have to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t buying top-quality brushes. I just wanted a little brush set for travel. But, I was still disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the bristles on the brushes are soft and apply blusher and/or  eye-shadow well. On the down side, the double-ended eye makeup brushes are poorly constructed. The second ferrule and brush were simply pushed onto the end of what was a single-ended brush. The second brush fell off after a couple of days on two of the three double-ended eye-shadow brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product in spite of the fact that the larger brushes (powder and blush) are of decent quality. Overall, the set is cheezy and not worth the money. Even the cute pink color can&#x27;t redeem this brush set.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I never used these because they were way too small for my need but they&#x27;re super cute and the bristles seemed very soft. Perfect as a gift though.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes, much nicer then I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I can not rate these yet as they are a stocking stuffer for Christmas. However they are pink so I should be okay for at least being cute.</li>
            <li> Really nice and soft does not pick up a lot of product on brushes thou but still happy withy product best for beginners</li>
            <li> Love these. They are so soft and apply my make up beautifully. Perfect travel set.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of brushes but compact enough for a medium size make-up case.  They measure about 6&amp;#34; in length and for the price, they have been great!!</li>
            <li> Forst day I had them they came apart</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for how inexpensive they are! They are so soft and work really well for applying powder, contouring, blending, etc. I was skeptical at first due to the fact that they were so cheap, but I&#x27;ve come to realize over the years that just because a product is cheap, doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it will be bad. These work almost as well as my more expensive brushes! I really love the large angled brush. I use it for contouring my cheeks and it works perfectly! If you&#x27;re looking for a brush set that is inexpensive, I highly recommend this one (or others from this brand, they also have larger sets with more brushes) Another plus is that the brushes don&#x27;t shed on your face while using them. I can&#x27;t stand when I&#x27;m applying my makeup and the bristles come off on my face. They also arrived very fast, about a week before the scheduled delivery date! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and will definitely be ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> These are the most soft and coolest brushes I own now. They came extremely fast in the mail and I love how some are double sided. Perfect for traveling. Wish it could&#x27;ve came with a foundation brush. Haven&#x27;t got a chance to use it yet but pretty sure it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes, very soft, the only thing wrong is that the metal heads fell off and I had to glue them in order to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it&#x27;s of a poor quality.  One of the brushes broke the same day I received it.</li>
            <li> 3 of the heads came of within a month. I have to keep gluing them back on. Otherwise the brushes are nice</li>
            <li> They are a waist of money once i received them they fell apart i am very unsatisfied!!! They are definitely not what i expected</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes but after having them and using them for a year now most have broken off had to hot glue them back on but totally worth it because the brushes are aoft and do what they need to do I would bug again</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so soft! They spread my makeup well and they are very cute :D must try&lt;br /&gt;So far no fall outs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them for  a hand full of times so far so im not sure how sturdy they are in the long run. But for this price the brushes are really soft. The pink and white color is nice but they are stained easily and remains stained even after light washing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great fit in your purse travel bag.  They are very soft. The color is terrific. . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the brushes and they way they work while applying my make up, but they smell like they have been soaked in a chemical....I plan to wash them maybe this will take away the harsh smell. Other than that, happy customer.</li>
            <li> These area great make up brushes. I purchase these to travel with when I am on vacation or a business trip.</li>
            <li> I adore these brushes, they get 5 stars just for being pink, but they&#x27;re also super soft, easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed. The only thing is that the brush heads frequently come off the wooden handle but its easy to glue them back on. I don&#x27;t need 20 brushes when these five can do everything I need.</li>
            <li> The best ever brush set I have</li>
            <li> Great value here I LOVE these brushes!</li>
