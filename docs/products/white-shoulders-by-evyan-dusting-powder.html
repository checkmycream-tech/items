            <li>The box is pretty and the puff soft.</li>
            <li>Classic  classic fragrance from years gone by.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old familiar friend and milder than current scents that overwhelm the senses.  </li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments even though it&#x27;s a very old brand.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The scent was slightly faint but still pleasant just as I remembered from years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>When I went looking for a box like it (for baby powder) in stores, people were like &amp;#34;that sounds really old fashioned,&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t know where to find something like it.</li>
            <li>It is fixed with several holes</li>
            <li>I can always rely on getting the powder and other White Shoulders products from Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> The best. If you have never used White Shoulders, you have deprived yourself.</li>

            <li> This was a gift for my mother-in-law. She loved it</li>
            <li> HAPPENED TO BE REMINDED BY MY YOUNGSTER DAUGHTER OF A BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE I USE SOMETIME  AGO..SHE ALSO REMEMBERED HOW YOU  COULD REMEMBER THE FRAGRANCE AND PRECEDED TO TELL ME IT&#x27;S  NAME.THAT IS WHAT LEAD ME TO  WHITE SHOULDERS AND DELIGHTED.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant and lingering.</li>
            <li> Easy to get and was so fast. Didn&#x27;t have to drive to find it and was boxed and perfect s.just like in retail store</li>

            <li> LOVE White Shoulders products.</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful bath powder.</li>
            <li> it was a great gift for my grandma the price was really really good, i would bye again for her</li>
            <li> A favorite fragrance of mine for years.  I like to layer my fragrances like body lotion, powder, and cologne.  I was happy to find the powder.  It feels so good in hot weather.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s an old familiar friend and milder than current scents that overwhelm the senses.  It&#x27;s soft and feminine. I love it!  I get lots of compliments even though it&#x27;s a very old brand.  Some things never go out of style.</li>
            <li> The scent was slightly faint but still pleasant just as I remembered from years ago.</li>
            <li> So, my mom had a container of this when I was little that she kept baby powder in after the White Shoulders was all used up, but I didn&#x27;t know that was where it came from- I just remembered the box. When I went looking for a box like it (for baby powder) in stores, people were like &amp;#34;that sounds really old fashioned,&amp;#34; but didn&#x27;t know where to find something like it. So, I took to the internets and found this and another perfumed body powder. But this one is definitely the one my mom had. I remember the gold lettering, and I even remember the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, so did I spend $13 on what is essentially the packaging? I kinda did. But I like the powder- I&#x27;ve been using it instead of deodorant on days when I&#x27;m just in the office and not moving around much. It is a little weird that I smell like my mom, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. I like my mom. When I run out I will probably just refill the container with baby powder like she does, but that won&#x27;t be for a while because there is a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Product was exellent. Shipping and handling very good.</li>
            <li> smells great and has the old-fashioned pick powder puff</li>
            <li> My wife is a White Shoulders girl, and it is hard to find the products locally.  I can always rely on getting the powder and other White Shoulders products from Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Even the powders sold at the 99 cents stores scored some point on that Powder. I can&#x27;t even describe the odor... I recommend Luna Mystique and/or Windsong, white Diamonds or Red Door.</li>
            <li> My mother, her sisters and cousins all wore this at one time or another! Wow! It&#x27;s something how the scent of something that you loved so long ago can take you right back and stir so many emotions and memories. If you&#x27;ve ever loved this fragrance, but somehow lost track of the product, you can now pick it up on Amazon at a reasonable price. I received this as a gift, and I was quite touched. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Have not had this powder in a long time. I use to use it all the time when I was younger.  When I saw it, I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely, just as I remember.  Perfect for the long hot summer evenings here in the south.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service</li>
            <li> Light, floral, not too sweet. Love it. Price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Classic  classic fragrance from years gone by. Soft feel makes you feel great. Thanks for making this available at great price.</li>
            <li> just like my mom had when I was a kid and I had when I was in college.</li>
            <li> Oh the smell of this is so yummy.  I had so many compliments when I use this powder.  It is fixed with several holes so you aren&#x27;t wasting it when it comes out on the deluxe puff that comes with it.  You have to have it.  For the price its absolutely fantastic.  I remember this growing up and even then it smelled the same.  Try it you will love it.</li>
