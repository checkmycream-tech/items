            <li>or if you&#x27;ve licked your lips)&lt;br /&gt;Bunny foot sponge applicator- would have liked a brush&lt;br</li>

            <li>This lip tint is quickly becoming my favorite!</li>
            <li>But if you want it to be super bright:</li>
            <li>The scent was also nice, not too strong, but fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it on my lips.</li>
            <li>I love it under foundation on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I just bought some for her...since she kept using mine! :)</li>
            <li>I love this tint.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different lip products and this is the best for naturalness and staying power.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip stain.</li>
            <li>I love this lip stain.</li>
            <li>and I love that this is so forgiving.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip stain that I have tried - I would definitely purchase it again -</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Did I mention I love this stuff???</li>
            <li>The color is really gorgeous when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color and kinda tastes good on my lips</li>
            <li>Love the name, love the product, perfect pink flush, stays on all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the easy purchase and shipping process.</li>
            <li>I love being able to wash my face and swipe on a fresh dash of color to my lips and cheeks...</li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am glad I did not pay full price for it, but got it in a beauty bag.</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample in my Ipsy bag subscription, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love this lip stain!&lt;br /&gt;I am able to have lips that look natural and use my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product as a lip stain.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It lasts and lasts and has a nice vibrant but natural-looking color to it.</li>
            <li>but this one is fun!</li>
            <li>The color payoff was great and lasted long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good color and it stays on pretty decently.</li>
            <li>My complexion is super pale, so the fact that the tint doesn’t go on super bright when I first put it on is great.</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency, and you can blend it easily without the typical streaks.  </li>
            <li>its kinda cool</li>
            <li>True, (cool toned?)</li>
            <li>I got one of these in an ipsy bag and purchased this one for a friend because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Perhaps using  a good exfoliant on my lips before would make it last longer?</li>
            <li>A+ Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I misplaced it afterward and was happy to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain that boldly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had quite the success as others have had based on the reading of their reviews</li>
            <li>It looks so much more natural than the powders or creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>not crazy about it as a cheek stain.</li>
            <li>but if you apply a lip balm first, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I cannot wear traditional lipsticks and this is a gorgeous color and has a decent longevity.  </li>
            <li>I have also purchased this product for different friends and family who all love it when I show it to them.</li>
            <li>Feels very silky and moisturizing on my lips!</li>
            <li>but personally that is a plus for me because it means if I want a more neutral look, just one coat will do whereas if I want a bolder lip I can keep building the color until its where I want it to be.</li>
            <li>but it stays on from one meal to the next just fine.</li>
            <li>Never would I have thought I would love a lip stain since my lips are always very dry</li>
            <li>Color shade can be lighter or darker depending on how soon and how much you blot your lips.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this product but got it as a sample from my IPSY bag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle has lasted me more than four months with daily use on my cheeks, occasionally on my lips.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing is that it does not dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 4 in one because you can have a sheer tint, or a super rosy tint.</li>
            <li>I know it says cheek stain, but this is super red and just not what I grab for when i want cheek</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lip stain.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants naturally pink/red lips.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying and gives off a sheer enough shine that you can use it to top off any red and darker lip colors without changing them.</li>
            <li>You have t apply a few coats to get a strong color</li>
            <li>I use it alone for a natural look or under some blush to up the ante.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s SO MUCH product in the bottle, it&#x27;ll last for two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It gives my lips a really pretty color and doesn&#x27;t dry them out at all.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first got it, but this stuff has become some of my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t think it is worth the money for what it is - it is absolutely not a long lasting color.</li>
            <li>off a little too quickly for my liking.</li>
            <li>It was cool toned, so it went well with my pale complexion.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky when wet</li>
            <li>The texture is very liquid, so you have to be very careful in how you apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty messy when it comes to applying gloss or stain to my lips</li>
            <li>The color is pretty too, even with my pale complexion.</li>
            <li>It provides natural, long lasting color.  </li>

            <li> It provides natural, long lasting color.  </li>
            <li> I was also skeptical because I am very fair-skinned and usually wear more peachy colors for blush and lips.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have only tried it as a lip stain, because the color seems to be too dark to work as a cheek stain.</li>
            <li> You may need to reapply after eating food (especially if it&#x27;s oily or greasy) but it does really last a long time.</li>
            <li> But it just doesn&#x27;t last that long (on my cheeks and lips).</li>
            <li> The color does not last very long however.</li>
            <li> and it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> And you can build it up, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes a while.</li>
            <li> : Slightly drying&lt;br /&gt;some dry time on the lips (will transfer if not completely dry</li>
            <li> This stuff is great as a base under lip gloss, or chapstick, or even lipstick!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long, and a little goes a long way!</li>

            <li> This lip tint is quickly becoming my favorite! My complexion is super pale, so the fact that the tint doesn’t go on super bright when I first put it on is great. But if you want it to be super bright: layer, layer, layer! I can layer it until it’s the perfect color! Honestly, this tint can and will work for everyone. I&#x27;m buying one for everyone I know for Christmas--talk about a perfect stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Received an empty box</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product through a subscription service (Ipsy). I had never tried a tint before but I now use it every day. I have also purchased this product for different friends and family who all love it when I show it to them. I&#x27;ve yet to see a product in stores that works as well as this tint does. I will be purchasing more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the easy purchase and shipping process.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m unable to wear lipstick/chapstick/lip gloss as it never fails to dry out my lips and leave them ugly and chapped. I got one of these in my Ipsy bag and fell in love so I ordered another! It gives my lips a really pretty color and doesn&#x27;t dry them out at all. It feels like there&#x27;s nothing there. I&#x27;ve never used it on my cheeks, but it is a perfect lip stain :)</li>
            <li> its a blush and a cheek stain all in one, which is great because if you think about it it&#x27;s 4 in one because you can have a sheer tint, or a super rosy tint. And one more thing it doesn&#x27;t spill I have tried it. its kinda cool&lt;br /&gt;for more information please visit  http://hoollyd.blogspot.com/2015/04/tint-and-sass-by-elisabeth-mott.html</li>
            <li> A+ Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Love this stuff. Truly! My roommate gave me a sample from her Burch Box or some such a few years ago and I fell in love! People always ask how am I NOT leaving lip prints on my coffee cup or their cheeks and my cheeks always look rosy. I use it alone for a natural look or under some blush to up the ante. THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!! DO IT.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t think it is worth the money for what it is - it is absolutely not a long lasting color. It claims to have a cherry smell, but it definitely does not (it is not an unpleasant smell, just not what it claims to be). The texture is very liquid, so you have to be very careful in how you apply it. It is very sticky when wet and it takes a while to dry. The taste is awful. The color is really gorgeous when you first put it on. And you can build it up, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes a while. The other nice thing is that it does not dry out your lips. The color does not last very long however. I applied two coats of it, and just sat around watching videos for a couple of hours, and the color is almost gone. So far, I have only tried it as a lip stain, because the color seems to be too dark to work as a cheek stain. All in all, I am glad I did not pay full price for it, but got it in a beauty bag.</li>
            <li> I love this. I love it on my lips. I love it under foundation on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t looooove the smell, but it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s SO MUCH product in the bottle, it&#x27;ll last for two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Lip stain in cherry red? You bet your sass! I am not traditionally a fan of lip stains because I find them drying but this one is fun! I know it says cheek stain, but this is super red and just not what I grab for when i want cheek color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: True, (cool toned?) red. My teeth looked great!&lt;br /&gt;Tastes like cherry&lt;br /&gt;Great color pay off for a stain and buildable&lt;br /&gt;Comes with applicator&lt;br /&gt;No spill design if it tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Slightly drying&lt;br /&gt;some dry time on the lips (will transfer if not completely dry or if you&#x27;ve licked your lips)&lt;br /&gt;Bunny foot sponge applicator- would have liked a brush&lt;br /&gt;Cheesy packaging. For the price, I would have liked something that didn&#x27;t remind me of a gentlemen&#x27;s club.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s extremely natural looking.  I love being able to wash my face and swipe on a fresh dash of color to my lips and cheeks... My Mom also loves it and I just bought some for her...since she kept using mine! :)</li>
            <li> I love this tint.  I cannot wear traditional lipsticks and this is a gorgeous color and has a decent longevity.  I haven&#x27;t had quite the success as others have had based on the reading of their reviews but it stays on from one meal to the next just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Never would I have thought I would love a lip stain since my lips are always very dry but if you apply a lip balm first, it&#x27;s not bad. Feels very silky and moisturizing on my lips! The color is pretty too, even with my pale complexion. I did not buy this here, however I did receive this in my ipsy bag and once I run out, I&#x27;ll know where to find it.</li>
            <li> I love this as a cheek color! It looks so much more natural than the powders or creams I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle has lasted me more than four months with daily use on my cheeks, occasionally on my lips. So glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample in my Ipsy bag subscription, and fell in love. I brought to my sister&#x27;s wedding for her to use since its the perfect natural berry lip color for us and she also loved it. Unfortunately I misplaced it afterward and was happy to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this! Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It provides natural, long lasting color.  It stays on until you eat a meal.  Color shade can be lighter or darker depending on how soon and how much you blot your lips.  This has become the lip color I use every day.  I have tried many different lip products and this is the best for naturalness and staying power.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color and kinda tastes good on my lips haha. But it just doesn&#x27;t last that long (on my cheeks and lips). It doesn&#x27;t stain that boldly. There&#x27;s other drugstore lipstain glosses/lipsticks that I&#x27;ve tried that literally STAIN and stay on forever. This doesn&#x27;t last. It is a nice pop of color though on your lips or cheeks and I just apply it a couple of times throughout the day on my lips.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first got it, but this stuff has become some of my favorite lip product. It lasts and lasts and has a nice vibrant but natural-looking color to it. You may need to reapply after eating food (especially if it&#x27;s oily or greasy) but it does really last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great as a base under lip gloss, or chapstick, or even lipstick! It lasts all day long, and a little goes a long way! I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to love the color, but it&#x27;s actually perfect. It&#x27;s not sticky or drying, and I now wear this almost every day! Must have!</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain!&lt;br /&gt;I am able to have lips that look natural and use my favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants naturally pink/red lips.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Neesie</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain. It&#x27;s a good color and it stays on pretty decently. I usually use it under Sugar tinted lip balm. I got one of these in an ipsy bag and purchased this one for a friend because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product as a lip stain. It isn&#x27;t drying and gives off a sheer enough shine that you can use it to top off any red and darker lip colors without changing them. I also like the fruity scent. I personally can&#x27;t use this as a cheek stain because I&#x27;m already very red in that area, but for anyone looking to liven up their cheeks this definitely works!</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain. Its almost like using actual cherry juice. I&#x27;m pretty messy when it comes to applying gloss or stain to my lips and I love that this is so forgiving. You have t apply a few coats to get a strong color but personally that is a plus for me because it means if I want a more neutral look, just one coat will do whereas if I want a bolder lip I can keep building the color until its where I want it to be. This is one of my go to lip stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Forgiving, build-able color&lt;br /&gt;great smell and taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;slightly sticky until it dries.&lt;br /&gt;wears off a little too quickly for my liking.</li>
            <li> Great as a lip stain. not crazy about it as a cheek stain. Didn&#x27;t really like this product but got it as a sample from my IPSY bag. Check out IPSY here: http://www.ipsy.com/r/4mxa?sid&#x3D;ipsypoints&amp;cid&#x3D;general</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It goes on smoothly. It is not greasy and it lasts forever! I have tried others, but this is now my go to. I won&#x27;t buy anything else. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great color (not reddish on me). Easy application. Not drying. Fruity smell. Sadly doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as descripted- I wore to a concert with some usual eating/drinking and I had to reapply the inner of my lips several times. Perhaps using  a good exfoliant on my lips before would make it last longer?</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this in my Ipsy bag last month. The color payoff was great and lasted long. It was cool toned, so it went well with my pale complexion. The scent was also nice, not too strong, but fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was that I lost the bottle! I&#x27;ve torn my house upside-down looking for it! The color was so perfect, I&#x27;ve decided to wear it on my wedding day, so here I am buying it on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip stain that I have tried - I would definitely purchase it again - I love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I also got it in the July ipsy bag.  I hesitated using it because of my horrible past with cheek stains.  I was very pleasantly surprised with this stuff.  It has a great consistency, and you can blend it easily without the typical streaks.  I was also skeptical because I am very fair-skinned and usually wear more peachy colors for blush and lips.  But this gives that I&#x27;ve-been-ice-skating-all-day flush that looks good on everyone.  I have combination dry/oily skin and it stayed on for hours.  Did I mention I love this stuff???</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST lip stain. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one has Tge best consistency and the color is perfect on fair skin tones. I highly recommend this lip stain.</li>
            <li> Love the name, love the product, perfect pink flush, stays on all day.</li>
