            <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>many times.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Premier Jour has been my favorite perfume for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I adore Nina Ricci :)</li>
            <li>and I love  the bottle.</li>

            <li>When it&#x27;s time to re-buy you could look forever in department store so make it easy and order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Premier Jour is a flowery sweet and elegant scent, comparable to the scent of honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and Amazon made the purchase process very easy and convenient (not to mention at a better price than I&#x27;ve paid for it before from perfume or department stores).  </li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s somewhere between fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>Fine, delicate, not too soft, wonderful!</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding this in the department stores and was pleased to find it on Amazon for a good price.  </li>
            <li>jours  is the only only I fill good with and have not been able to replace it with another one&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon had offered me the best value and the product had arrived in 6 business days (earlier than I expected).</li>
            <li>the price is  right</li>
            <li>it was just a paper bag with bubble wrap and the perfume was all hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the one from stores.</li>
            <li>I should say thanks to seller!</li>
            <li>This perfum is a very old one, nevertheless it&#x27;s always a classic!!!</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife and she was very happy with my choice. Good quality for a good price and timely delivered. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> it never came after going back and forth for 4 weeks, they said it got sent back... whatever.. I got the money back so it&#x27;s all good. I do not recommend this company</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume from department stores many times.&lt;br /&gt;But this one is not like that and it doesn&#x27;t last long it stay like an hour or so,&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the one from stores.Which makes me think it could be fake.</li>
            <li> I should say thanks to seller! Fast in a perfect condition and exactly what i expected! :) parfum is amazing, I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores and happy that Amazon still have it! :)</li>
            <li> I have purchases this fragrance several times over the past decade and I always get compliments on the fragrance. I will continue to purchase this fragrance. The smell is light, sweet but not too sweet. It&#x27;s not spicy, but it works year round. It&#x27;s not too heavy for the office. It&#x27;s perfect for dates b/c it&#x27;s not aggressive but there is enough aroma to make a presence.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years and was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore. A few people have doubted the authenticity of this perfume but the two bottles that I have ordered on Amazon look and smell like the real deal to me.</li>
            <li> Have been using premier jour since it came out. Was very very disappointed when Nina Ricci discontinued the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I was able to find this eau de toilette on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I only bought this to help me with my wife. So far it is smell well. Thank you. ! ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Perfume lasts for a long time it seems and this smells really good (a husband speaking). When it&#x27;s time to re-buy you could look forever in department store so make it easy and order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The package came as promised. The box was in good condition. Would recommend. This perfume is getting harder to find as it is quite old. As the old saying goes &amp;#34;old but gold,&amp;#34; this perfume smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Not the original, smells horrible.</li>
            <li> This perfum is a very old one, nevertheless it&#x27;s always a classic!!! It&#x27;s perfect, very elegant, floral, not too strong, but not too sweet...perfect for mee!!</li>
            <li> Though the scent is not brand new, I still like it very much, it&#x27;s somewhere between fresh and sweet. This time the price was awesome and I couldn&#x27;t pass it.</li>
            <li> Premier Jour has been my favorite perfume for over 10 years. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it in any perfume stores anymore, and that&#x27;s why I am thankful to find it online at a very good price. Premier Jour is a flowery sweet and elegant scent, comparable to the scent of honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a lady at a store and had to know what she was wearing. I purchased some and I love it!! Pretty fragrance, soft scent.</li>
            <li> Fine, delicate, not too soft, wonderful! The best of classic Nina Ricci.&lt;br /&gt;Not sweet at all, despite the pinkish-orange color.</li>

            <li> It is one of my favorite perfumes. Not so easy to find it lately. It lasts for 2-3 hours and I always get complements. Nice and light fragrance. Works for every day and evening for me :)</li>
            <li> I got this fragrance as a present years ago. I did not like it, I thought it smells like a stinky arm pit beneath the pleasant notes.But people would stop me to ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing all the time. It&#x27;s one of the fragrances that I repurchase repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this fragrance in six years.  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available.  I purchased one for my mother also. I love it!</li>
