            <li>I ordered this product for my wife and she loved it very much.  </li>
            <li>And best of all, it helps my young daughter care for her own hair on busy mornings when I just don&#x27;t have time to spare.</li>

            <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s Original Curly Pudding - 8 oz]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m excited to use this product</li>
            <li>Try the Super Slip Sudsy shampoo...</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge improvement in the moisture and softness of my hair after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and gets frizzy and dry very easy.</li>
            <li>So naturally my hair is in love with it.</li>
            <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s is pricey but the Rapid Recovery Treatment is worth it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made my curls smooth and super soft.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wheigh hair down, and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to fork over $50 right then</li>
            <li>Luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t really stick around after I rinse it out my hair</li>
            <li>Like the very much.</li>
            <li>My favorite deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>but I do put it in my hair on the weekend and let it stay in for at least an hour before washing it out and that works great.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t sit on top like some crummy, oily \\&quot;deep conditioners\\</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re really interested in using MJ&#x27;s products, I&#x27;d try the bundle they have online and this one as well.</li>
            <li>Although a bit pricey, I chose to make it my go to for deep conditioning, I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioning treatment...</li>
            <li>I am African American and have tightly coiled, wonderfully kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>Rapid Recovery really does reduce breakage and shedding making the hair stronger.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before, and really it seems to work.</li>
            <li>But once I began using this product it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>But MJ&#x27;s rapid recovery--I have not been able to mimic its results with other brands and I am defiantly buying the 16 oz.</li>
            <li>High Five.</li>
            <li>I love the scent (which isn&#x27;t heavy or floral or perfumy).</li>
            <li>in a few more months I will probably give it a five star rating</li>
            <li>Its creamy, smooth texture really sinks into the hair shaft and makes the hair silky and soft after washing it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my hair sooo soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Moisture added to natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>As a fairly new natural, I&#x27;ve been searching for a conditioner that will truly moisturizer my hair and last longer than two hours.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I barely had to comb it through at all.</li>
            <li>say try out the 2 oz jar before investing fifty bucks, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you find that you MUST have the bigger jar!</li>

            <li> The price is really the only complaint I have</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it, besides the price tag, is the smell - I can&#x27;t quite place what it smells like, but it honestly smells awful to me, to the point that I felt slightly nauseous after sniffing my hands, which is strange because I am usually not that sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even focus on the softness of my hair, because besides the gagging during the conditioning, I constantly had an upset stomach (due to the smell coming from my hair) during the day.</li>
            <li> product is my go to deep conditioner, hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning for a little over a year now, and so far this has been the only product that has stopped the excessive shedding and breaking of my hair.</li>
            <li> and there so I spent $10 on the 2 oz jar just to see if I would like it, and of course as soon as I put it on my hair</li>
            <li> For years and years I have tried the least expensive to the most expensive products available on the market only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It not only makes her hair incredibly easy to comb through and manage, but also gets out all but the worst knots.</li>
            <li> I was sad to see I&#x27;d used it all up within two washes and planned to order the bigger bottle as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair can tell the difference when it hasnt had a deep conditioner in at least 2 weeks!!!  </li>
            <li> Only one mentions a bad smell...</li>
            <li> This product is EXPENSIVE-</li>
            <li> I really hate leaving reviews like this, especially after doing my research, but I am wondering if I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> My hair can be crazy and uncontrollable.</li>
            <li> maybe mine went bad before it got  to me?</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Incredible! My hair can be crazy and uncontrollable. This conditioner has made my curls smooth and super soft.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Although this product is a bit on the costly side, I&#x27;ve yet to find anything else that works as well on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It not only makes her hair incredibly easy to comb through and manage, but also gets out all but the worst knots. And best of all, it helps my young daughter care for her own hair on busy mornings when I just don&#x27;t have time to spare.</li>
            <li> My favorite deep conditioner.  My hair feels really good after using it with my hair steamer.  I am African American and have tightly coiled, wonderfully kinky hair.  My hair looks just like a corkscrew.</li>
            <li> For years and years I have tried the least expensive to the most expensive products available on the market only to be disappointed.  Those days are over.  I have fine, thick, naturally wavy hair and it is the happiest it has been since childhood.  It is bouncy, shiny and I am no longer losing hair to breakage or knots that I have to cut out.  I don&#x27;t use extra heat as directed but I do put it in my hair on the weekend and let it stay in for at least an hour before washing it out and that works great.</li>
            <li> My fingers just slid through my hair like silk.  I barely had to comb it through at all. Smells good too.  Try the Super Slip Sudsy shampoo...it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I purchased the [[ASIN:B002SB5I92 Miss Jessie&#x27;s Rapid Recovery, 2 oz.]] around the holidays after seeing a link for the product online.&lt;br /&gt;When it finally arrived i tried it out immediately. LOVED IT.&lt;br /&gt;This product is my go to deep conditioner, hands down. I love the scent (which isn&#x27;t heavy or floral or perfumy). the smell reminds me of a good lip chap I once had. Its creamy, smooth texture really sinks into the hair shaft and makes the hair silky and soft after washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sit on top like some crummy, oily \\&quot;deep conditioners\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt; I was sad to see I&#x27;d used it all up within two washes and planned to order the bigger bottle as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea it was almost 50 damn dollars. period.&lt;br /&gt; The price is really the only complaint I have but if you&#x27;re really interested in using MJ&#x27;s products, I&#x27;d try the bundle they have online and this one as well. I also purchased [[ASIN:B001I2DME0 Miss Jessie&#x27;s Original Curly Pudding - 8 oz]] and [[ASIN:B006JRTQVM Miss Jessies Curly Buttercreme 8oz]] and was satisfied. Eh. That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt; But MJ&#x27;s rapid recovery--I have not been able to mimic its results with other brands and I am defiantly buying the 16 oz. soon.&lt;br /&gt;I will also purchase and try their products again--COME THE HOLIDAYS-- when they have their bogo/half price sells. That&#x27;s the best time to do so.</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love the Miss Jessie product....so i&#x27;m excited to use this product</li>
            <li> This product is EXPENSIVE- So naturally my hair is in love with it. It made my hair sooo soft and manageable. I wasn&#x27;t willing to fork over $50 right then and there so I spent $10 on the 2 oz jar just to see if I would like it, and of course as soon as I put it on my hair I could tell it was going to be a miracle worker. The only problem I have with it, besides the price tag, is the smell - I can&#x27;t quite place what it smells like, but it honestly smells awful to me, to the point that I felt slightly nauseous after sniffing my hands, which is strange because I am usually not that sensitive to smell. Luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t really stick around after I rinse it out my hair so I can deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say try out the 2 oz jar before investing fifty bucks, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you find that you MUST have the bigger jar!</li>
            <li> As a fairly new natural, I&#x27;ve been searching for a conditioner that will truly moisturizer my hair and last longer than two hours. This is great and has been the best I&#x27;ve tried thus far and I&#x27;ve tried many. Although a bit pricey, I chose to make it my go to for deep conditioning, I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff. Use it once a week &amp; it does the trick. Moisture added to natural curly hair. High Five.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this. The reviews are so awesome, however, I cannot stomach the smell. To be fair to the company, I am a sensitive sniffer. I couldn&#x27;t even focus on the softness of my hair, because besides the gagging during the conditioning, I constantly had an upset stomach (due to the smell coming from my hair) during the day. I had to go home at lunch and wash again to minimize the smell. I really hate leaving reviews like this, especially after doing my research, but I am wondering if I got a bad bottle? Only one mentions a bad smell...maybe mine went bad before it got  to me? Either way, it is just sitting there, not getting used, I have to send back.</li>
            <li> great for conditioner, and deep conditioning too. It doesn&#x27;t wheigh hair down, and it smells good too. My friends like it</li>
            <li> Greatttttttttt! Must have.</li>
            <li> Need to re-order this product hair is most manageable smell is wonderful</li>
            <li> My hair can tell the difference when it hasnt had a deep conditioner in at least 2 weeks!!!  Rapid Recovery really does reduce breakage and shedding making the hair stronger.</li>

            <li> I have used this product before, and really it seems to work. I am considering getting the shampoo. The smell is nice. in a few more months I will probably give it a five star rating</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge improvement in the moisture and softness of my hair after the first use. Miss Jessie&#x27;s is pricey but the Rapid Recovery Treatment is worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she loved it very much.  thats all that I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I used this on my son&#x27;s hair. I could actually run my fingers through his hair days later! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and gets frizzy and dry very easy. But once I began using this product it really made a difference. It totally defined my curls from root to tip. I use this product every week religiously. I recommend it to all my curly hair friends!</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioning treatment...it&#x27;s really one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite.  The best DT ever.</li>
            <li> Like the very much. Would recommend</li>
