            <li>it also works good on my bangs.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to manuever and the size is also great.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I have very healthy shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I have very healthy hair to begin with...</li>
            <li>A product that consistently works well at a resonable price make this an excellent value.</li>
            <li>I love this straightner!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and the shipping was free!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned it for more than 4 years now!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I still use this after so many years!</li>
            <li>This is a great hair straightener, and lightweight, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, simply magical!</li>
            <li>So i made a quick effort to return it to folica, which is an great website to buy irons at a good prices, and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I got great advice from my hair stylist and a good friend.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my biracial cousin to show her how amazing this product is (she is converted...</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was especially impressed with how straight the ends were.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is it the absolute best piece of equipment that straightens my hair?</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they say you are getting a good deal</li>
            <li>I have the \\&quot;not-enough-curly-nor-enough-straight\\&quot; kind of hair.  </li>
            <li>My kind of gadget.</li>
            <li>just looks healthier , also it doesnt fry my hair and stay straight for a loooong time :D</li>
            <li>Two of my friends own this iron and recommended it to me.   </li>
            <li>and they thought that would be ok, so that was good.</li>
            <li>it straightens my hair, does not cause static, is hot withint 10 seconds, makes my hair shiny, and best of all no hair damage!</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I see great results every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and plan on buying two more for my mom and sister!</li>
            <li>If you know what the best products are to use for your hair then this is good because it won&#x27;t ruin your hair the way some flat irons do.</li>
            <li>I started by using it on lower heat settings (250-300), but found that the iron is most effective between 350 and 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>iron is SOOO easy to use!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>It can easily damage connections inside of the iron! &lt;</li>
            <li>and it STILL works as great as it did the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I give this product 3 stars because it did work great at first...</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very smooth and.</li>
            <li>My hair is very smooth after using it and I can adjust the temperature</li>
            <li>No snagging, no pulling my hair, it is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I felt queasy buying a hair product for $88, but thought with all the great reviews on folica.com (complete with tons of amazing before and after shots submitted by happy clients) and a money-back guarantee it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>very hot!&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable temperature (I always stay up at 450 degrees because it works the best for straightening)&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up quick</li>
            <li>so I did some research (mostly on Amazon) and decided this was the one I wanted</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Also, I never have static issues.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work again since then.</li>
            <li>My conair wasn&#x27;t doing the trick any more</li>
            <li>I think this is way better than the Chi though based on my hair after straightening.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Every straightner that I used dries out my hair and then makes it frizzy on top of that.  </li>
            <li>*might* do better than the Solia, but you&#x27;d probably have to pay $200-$300 for them.  </li>
            <li>and then you can have it for many many more.</li>
            <li>Reliable and durable, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>This iron is fragile but most delicates are!!!!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a heat protection product to protect your hair from heat</li>
            <li>I was sure it was going to be a lost cause.</li>
            <li>how many times I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>The ceramic / tourmaline plates also help keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>This iron is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s long/thick hair in about 15 min.</li>
            <li>In short, I am very impressed by these straighteners.  </li>
            <li>At 180 it didn&#x27;t even feel like it was really on, more like after you&#x27;ve turned it off</li>
            <li>My biggest concern about buying the iron was making sure that it wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;fry&#x27; her waist length hair and that she would be able to use it without any help.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>I love to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>so you are able to use two hands,</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting a better straightner for a while</li>
            <li>they keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  &lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never needed to go to the top end of the range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people can use this more often, for example I blowdry and straighten my hair every day</li>
            <li>Its about a year that I gifted this to someone</li>
            <li>I am extremely glad that I did, because this is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>i was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome flat iron that works with all types of hair -</li>
            <li>The Solia is the best flat iron I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron they have ever owned!</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I been able to do my own hair at home without a professional and have it look good.   </li>
            <li>My mom loved this straightner so much too that I ended up buying her one for christmas!</li>
            <li>It still works just as good as the first day I received it.</li>
            <li>Easily the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, conditioner and a good leave in balm or conditioner especially made for heat straightening.</li>
            <li>When I was using the conair, I would have to go over it with my curling iron and the results would last, if I was lucky and the weather was perfect, two days.</li>
            <li>The consistant heat level is very impressive, as is the quick initial heating speed!</li>
            <li>No problems really, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>These heat up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, even on the hottest setting.</li>
            <li>This iron also heats up very, very quickly...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dull-looking and makes me think it&#x27;s going to fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I have bought  5 more of them as gifts for special people in my life.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats up super-quickly, and my wavy, dull hair comes out looking great - straight, but best of all, shiny!  </li>
            <li>Wow, this hair straightener is amazing!</li>
            <li>She uses it on a daily basis and it heats up beautifully and has yet to have any problems.</li>
            <li>Even then, it still heated up just fine, but the plastic had cracked so the plates didn&#x27;t quite come together anymore.</li>
            <li>with a normal straightner this is very damaging but the ceramic ones are incredible.</li>
            <li>The best way to make sure yours does not stop working is: do not leave the iron on for excessive amounts of time.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and healthy and it&#x27;s super shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not chemically processed with relaxers or texturizers and I wanted to enjoy the variety of having my hair straightened every once in a while.  </li>
            <li>Think of all the great hair days you&#x27;ll be missing out on because you&#x27;re sitting here reading this.iate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair &amp; is more able to iron the hair evenly.    </li>
            <li>It straightened without effort; was shiny, smooth and it lasted.  </li>
            <li>My unruley hair becomes silky smooth and shiny with my Solia.</li>
            <li>It works well without making my hair singed or frizzy, it glides through smoothly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned anything but cheap straightening irons</li>
            <li>and they said they would replace it free of charge.</li>
            <li>i bought it few years ago , and that was one of the best choices</li>
            <li>(It was the one that came with the free heat proof pouch, however.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great to have the option to have it on a low temp.</li>
            <li>Paired with the Chi silk infusion product, I have smooth and shiny hair again.  </li>
            <li>Cheap irons tend to fry hair and pull it out or break it.</li>
            <li>seemed to always do; it glides smoothly, and the size allows me to get close to the scalp without burning myself.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, I really appreciate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair &amp; is more able to iron the hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought this particular brand before, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Loved it...got hot pretty quick and does not snagg on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I liked that the straightener had a temp dial and didn&#x27;t expect t have to use it on high all the time, but I do.</li>
            <li>]with the [..]off special and free shipping.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>so I had it originally on 450</li>
            <li>so yes, I am pretty satisfied with how it works.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have had friends who were able to get their first Chi replaced but the company refused to replace the replacement once that one died.</li>
            <li>original review was written in 2010, after owning this for 2 years.</li>
            <li>What was taking 1-hour or more to straighten takes now a REAL 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>Ok, don&#x27;t touch the ceramic plate because I promise it is HOT.  </li>
            <li>in all this straightener is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>An iron that is capable of making damaged dry hair feel like silk, is worthy of more than 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous straighteners but this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>I have not used them on damp hair, so I cannot make a claim about that, but on dry hair they work great.  </li>
            <li>I section my hair and get it super smooth and shiny with this iron.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay, but, when I decided that I wanted to straighten my hair more regularly, I thought an upgrade might help me do the job more quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and gets hot enough to straighten hair very effectively.</li>
            <li>I bought this and it worked great for about a year then some how the plates became loose and would not stay in...</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, great straightener, but don&#x27;t expect to get completely smooth hair without a straightening balm or mousse or other heat styling product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been able to straighten it without too much hassle but</li>
            <li>I heard good things about the Solia irons and decided to try something different.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and stays hot.  </li>
            <li>I decided this was a fair price for a flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up super quick.</li>
            <li>Still heats up quickly, evenly, and does the job.</li>
            <li>My item was shipped fairly quickly and arrived as described in an acceptable amount of time, so no complaints there.      </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others. :)</li>
            <li>If there is a better model, I&#x27;m not interested in finding it, unless it maybe gives me a nice shave too.    </li>
            <li>I used to own a cheap metal flat iron and decided I needed an upgrade.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is left in an area where it can cool off easily.</li>
            <li>It worked fine the first couple of days, my hair was silky smooth, pretty straight, and it glided smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too hot!  </li>
            <li>Look closely--the pretty, pink-haired stylist uses a Solia on her clients!</li>
            <li>The iron is ready to use within 30 secs and you can adjust the heat between 140F to 450F!!  </li>
            <li>Think of all the great hair days you&#x27;ll be missing out on because you&#x27;re sitting here reading this.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product if you have very curly hair like me.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to straighten than with a cheap straightener.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tear, leaves your hair smooth and straight just like they do in the salon.  </li>
            <li>With my Solia, my hair is straight, light, and shiny</li>
            <li>I &#x27;ve used this a few times and Im happy the way my curls come out.</li>
            <li>my hair was incredibly straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>But honestly...I think even if it is on the heavy side, it works great</li>
            <li>this are good cheap products if you don&#x27;t want to waste alot of money on hair care products.</li>
            <li>It does curl hair though, with only one flip of the wrist which is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Tourmaline-Ceramic plates really do make your hair softer, shinier, and overall more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>If you are worried about the cost, DON&#x27;T be; it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>They were well worth the money.</li>
            <li>i also looooooove that you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to warm up, there&#x27;s instant heat!</li>
            <li>I still think it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and it has a temperature control so you can control how hot it get.</li>
            <li>Okay, so i had wanted a new straightener to place my remington wet to straight, which i knew was really damaging my hair even with heat protectant, and saw the solia for a good price on folica (67.99 after discount with a free pouch) and with rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 6 months now and all I can say is that it&#x27;s truely amazing.    </li>
            <li>I had my hesitations about spending so much on a flat iron, but I had an iron that I had paid about $40.00 for at a discount store, and the difference between the two is amazing.  </li>
            <li>After 4 years my Solia flat iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li>And if it&#x27;s humid out I might as well not use it because my hair just curls right up no matter</li>
            <li>But the grip is just the right size and texture and weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this straight iron a four star review, because as a straight iron it works great, however, the advertisement claims frizz free hair, which is not exactly true.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a significant other, and she tried it out, and she looked amazing,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and definitely adds some shine.</li>
            <li>As far as performance: it gets very hot and glides smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asian with naturally wavy hair, and after using this iron for a year instead of a cheap one my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li>This way you can crank up the heat when you have a good heat guard to spray over it, and you can turn the heat down for the times you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The thing that I found the most significant about this iron is its ability to turn dry damaged hair into silk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Indian and have slightly wavy hair that&#x27;s to my shoulder blades - that said, this is an awesome flat iron!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used my Solia about 5 times since I purchased it a few weeks ago, but I am so impressed with it.</li>
            <li>and it does the job quickly and efficiently and my hair stays straight until I wash it again.  </li>
            <li>A great alternative to more expensive irons.</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight without the dried-out, split-end results.  </li>
            <li>Previous to purchasing this item, I did a fair amount of research.</li>
            <li>Biggest complaint is that instead of being able to leave it on 180 and get nice results like the first use, I had to turn it up to between 250 and 320.  </li>
            <li>i recieved it very fast too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with this flat iron, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>I have hardly ever colored it and always took great care of it.</li>
            <li>As long as some kind of product is used on my hair (I prefer argan oil, my hair stayed straight even on a rainy day.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>(i did a hair test &amp; realized it was too hot...</li>
            <li>you are like me constantly checking reviews, doing price comparisons, conducting more research...</li>
            <li>If you are like me constantly checking reviews, doing price comparisons, conducting more research...</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter as a gift, she used this daily for about 45 minutes or more each day &amp; it lasted over a year.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I got my first results.    </li>
            <li>I had the Chi for many years before, which finally gave up on me, so my comparison is to that product.  </li>
            <li>The straightener got so hot that the plates started sliding off (the inside plastic was melting from the heat).</li>
            <li>This iron makes my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Simply put, for the money you will not find a better flat-iron.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like was the plasticky area around the temperature adjust, makes it seem more toy-ish.</li>
            <li>I tried everything and the iron never got hot.</li>
            <li>They have the varying temperature so you can choose how much heat you supply to your hair, which is useful to prevent damage.  </li>
            <li>They work, and they work really, really well!  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like this iron because i feel like it never gets hot.</li>
            <li>Works well enough that we can get out of the house in the mornings without the &#x27;hair fights&#x27;!:)</li>
            <li>I love it, but I will only buy something if it is legit, and mine was legit.</li>
            <li>With this iron it took about an hour, and I didnt even blow it out first.</li>
            <li>great for when you&#x27;re running late.    </li>
            <li>I however left before the product arrived, but was still pleased with the promptness.</li>
            <li>I loved my hair iron but after a few months the ceramic plates started to come off.</li>
            <li>it also worked on my damp hair which is good because it will save time not having to blow dry my hair completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaning toward really liking the Remington Shine Therapy right now.  </li>
            <li>Learning which temperature is right for your hair is a bit of a process (if you see your hair smoking...definitely too high!)</li>
            <li>(Beware of anything by Advanced Beauty Solutions - they are scamming people with their true ceramic pro flat iron!)</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase the same iron on their site with a flat iron pouch and stand for a few dollars less than Amazon (I rarely find better deals elsewhere, so that was an impressive find).</li>
            <li>If this one ever does break, I&#x27;ll gladly by another Solia flat</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>The second time I was a bit more daring &amp; wanted that sleek straight look</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair like with my old conair, and the results are far better.</li>
            <li>I doubt any flat iron can make you 100% invincible to high humidity, but this flat iron does a great job.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth, straight, and so far, no damage (thanks to the adjustable heat)</li>
            <li>What I like about it is the fact you have the option of really knowing &amp; choosing how hot you want it.  </li>
            <li>I bought  this solia 2 weeks ago, it works amazing, not only straight my hair also leave it soft...</li>
            <li>I adore this flat iron: it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it is lightweight and easy to handle, travels well, and gets HOT.</li>
            <li>The temp-adjust works great and while blue plates may scare off the average Chi customer, this thing easily outperforms a Chi at the same price.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a temperature control so that she can decide how hot it needs to be depending on how curly her hair is and how straight she wants it on any given day.  </li>
            <li>and i need to go over certain parts of my hair four or five times.</li>
            <li>Even though you may think a more expensive one is better, this is not always true.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick and curly hair, yet  this iron was able to easily make my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>She has very thick &amp; wavy hair, this worked great &amp; made her hair silky &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>When this happened I ordered the exact same straightener right away!</li>
            <li>keeping it straight and frizz free was a totally different story.  </li>
            <li>I really like this iron because it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair when you pull it through</li>
            <li>and I like it straight</li>
            <li>Shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li>Personally, I use the Fructis Smoothing Milk, and I get that silky smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li>It really does not damage my hair as does the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to run it through my hair multiple times, like how I had to with the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>I even used it in Houston (humidity capital of the US) and my hair was similarly straight and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The real results come once I leave the house.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it out in the humidity (the real test).  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>This product is  highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I am very amazed with this product.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Im placing an order today to buy a sedu, which my friend recommended, it made her hair silky and pin straight, and did not snag her hair.</li>
            <li>so this one is a real treat.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very wavy and stubborn when I try to change it.</li>
            <li>, she thanks me for this iron evey time she uses it, so</li>
            <li>She really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is always very efficient with the items we order from them.</li>
            <li>A friend knew how much I adored this, but didn&#x27;t want to drop the cash, and got it for me as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plug it in and it is ready to go in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and maintains it&#x27;s heat while I use it.  </li>
            <li>Mine worked really, really well... until its circuits cooked themselves.</li>
            <li>I like that you can set the temperature so if you can select as much heat as you need to get the job done, depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li>I originally tried it on a really low setting (I think like 175) and</li>
            <li>but this one is different and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>and this is wayyyyy better than any other.</li>
            <li>(looks good on me and I get tons of compliments), but have had a hard time fixing my hair with my new time constraints as a mom.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight all day even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it heats up, I turn it on, and 45 seconds later it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot and straightens my hair easily, even when it&#x27;s wild and curly from sleeping with it wet.  </li>
            <li>None of them really got my hair as pin straight as I wanted, and I have straight hair to begin with, though it tends to have a wave especially when I first wake up.  </li>
            <li>It still works the same and gets just as hot as the day I first bought it.</li>
            <li>As I let it cool down, I tried to make the plates set where they were supposed to be in the rare chance that it still would work.</li>
            <li>recommend this iron but not for daily use, because applying any kind of heat (iron, blow dryer, rollers, hot comb) to any type of hair everyday will cause damage.  </li>
            <li>Its a good flat iron, but I don&#x27;t think its worth the money because you can get the same desired look for less money.  </li>
            <li>You certainly can use it to curl your hair, although I am not very good at it yet, but I am more concerned with getting my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted one that was high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommened it to everyone.</li>
            <li>When high school hit I bought a solia.</li>
            <li>I just use a thermal protection spray so that my hair is not damaged by the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>But this flat iron has outlasted pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve ever owned; and I don&#x27;t even baby it!</li>
            <li>Finally after reading many reviews on a salon product website, I ordered this Solia flat iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These irons can go for as little as $25 or so, and on up to about $150 and more.</li>
            <li>My only regret- buying the cheap flat iron first.  </li>
            <li>I have had this straightener for a little more than 2 years.  </li>
            <li>As far as the iron goes it works very well.  </li>
            <li>i found that this straightner had all great reviews and also was not TOO expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments, and I love that it lasts 2-3 days if I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally a bit wavy</li>
            <li>Solid product worth every cent.</li>
            <li>take note that this iron WILL work if you plug it in a wall sucket equiped with a RESET like the ones normally installed in the bathroom since this appliance is equiped with one you might have to press the reset button on the iron for it to work.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very thick, very wavy hair and with this iron, it only take me 10 minutes to perfectly straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend flat ironing clean slightly damp or dry hair in small sections that are already detangled &amp; heat protected with some spray or serum to achieve the best results.  </li>
            <li>The solia heats up in under a minute, glides through my hair without pulling at all, and quickly straightens my hair (not that much quicker than my old one, but it never took very long).  </li>
            <li>I am still shocked by how much more quickly and easily I can straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is so worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I live in Kansas</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that Chi flat irons tend to break and/or become less effective after a no. of months and that you can&#x27;t regulate heat as well with the Sedu.</li>
            <li>I now believe all my friends who have told me that you really need to use a GOOD, QUALITY flat iron if you want results without serious damage to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the 1 year warranty covers it, I really like it but am very irritated I have to send it back to the company!</li>
            <li>As described (very well) in the \\&quot;features\\&quot; section here at Amazon.com, the Solia combines ceramic with tourmaline, a gem that creates six times more negative ions than ceramic alone.</li>
            <li>Extra curly, thick hair will conform to the new straight look your stylist gave you, and there&#x27;s a beautiful sheen due to the hairs&#x27; alignment.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how the \\&quot;patented Dynamic Alignment System®\\&quot; works; I do know that the iron glides easily and without pain through short and long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>heats up fast, cools down quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been dropped maybe 300 times, left on for entire weekends, had makeup and drinks spilled on it, been yanked by the cord, on too many airplane and car trips to count, and just overall banged out around.</li>
            <li>Well it was a big hit with her, she loves the ceramic plates that do a much better job than the other irons she tried.  </li>
            <li>(The only time I had that problem was with a heat spray whose first ingredient was alcohol.)  </li>
            <li>An hour later I had straight hair!  </li>
            <li>Most other straighteners  have an area you can put your fingers on the open end</li>
            <li>I love the small plate size because I can roll the hair around the edge of the iron and get it to curl</li>
            <li>This iron does straighten a lot faster and easier than my old conair, and it does last til I wash my hair again (or it rains and gets wet), but I still get the fluff strands all over, and my hair has been splitting a lot more quickly now while using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is so over processed that the ends of my hair no longer lay down smooth.  </li>
            <li>, you put the dial on your desired temperature &amp; in next thing you know the light goes from a solid red (heating up) to flashing (ready).  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap &amp; old (10+ years) flat iron that finally fell to it&#x27;s death on the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often, so I can&#x27;t comment on if it is more or less damaging, but I will say that I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair being dry at all after using this.</li>
            <li>My stylist told me that the cheap irons lose their ability to get hot after a period of time and when you have thick hair with curls, you need max heat.</li>
            <li>and it only takes one pass to get your hair completely straight.</li>
            <li>oh WOW.  </li>
            <li>and now they stay straight all night and even the next day.  </li>
            <li>It not only straightens it, it really does repair it.</li>
            <li>this one advertised is BY FAR</li>
            <li>and this one keeps my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it look dried out.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener a couple of years ago and it it the only straightener that truly straightened my hair (I have naturally very curly hair).</li>
            <li>My hair felt \\&quot;baked\\&quot; and dried out with the cheap iron.</li>
            <li>] iron and I was completely dissapointed..</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so silk and soft it</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Since then I used it every night before school and when I wake up the next morning my hair was still straight.</li>
            <li>i use it to do soft waves on my hair.</li>
            <li>received my iron on Tuesday evening and 1 hour later my hair was straight.  </li>
            <li>I received the Solia for Christmas, and have had a complete 180 degree experience from the cheapie.  </li>
            <li>so i frequently do.</li>
            <li>Luckily I unplugged it in time before it completely melted or burned the place down.</li>
            <li>The outside of the straightener heats up pretty much the same as the plates on the inside which means the only place to hold it is on the handle.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up and cools down quickly.</li>
            <li>I had to keep the iron up at the highest level to get any kind of results, and I have fine, dry hair and could tell it was already starting to dull and break due to the iron.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a very high-quality flat iron, so I always used my curling iron to straighten my hair before.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much shinier and softer after I straighten it than it was when I was using my curling iron or my cheaper flat iron.</li>
            <li>Often I even forget to turn it off, and it will sit on the sink all day like Little Caesars, hot &amp; ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I have previously owned a CHI an InStyler and cheap irons such as revlon.</li>
            <li>I have somewhere between straight and wavy long hair</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight and shiny all day long.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many flat irons in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American with a nice grade of thick medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized it was time for an upgrade because it was just not hot enough.</li>
            <li>I sent it back, and within 4 days my new iron came.</li>
            <li>on dry winter days is my hair naturally straight.  </li>
            <li>Im Black with medium fine African American grade of hair.  </li>
            <li>do forward one MAJOR caution.</li>
            <li>The first lasted for about 9 months and the other (which didn&#x27;t come on this morning &amp; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m online searching for another one)</li>
            <li>but i wish i read into other reviews first.</li>
            <li>Not only was this flat iron a very reasonable price, but it came with some extra bells and whistles that it&#x27;s competitors didn&#x27;t: temperature contol, pressure-sensitive plates, etc.  </li>
            <li>not sure if this was just one of those times where you get a \\&quot;bad apple\\&quot; from what is normally a good product, but I sure as hell didn&#x27;t buy a second one to find out.</li>
            <li>than just a hair straightener, the lightweight Solia can give you flips, curves (both towards your face and away), and generally shape your hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided it was time to upgrade from drug-store straighteners to something professional grade.  </li>
            <li>It feels very silky when I&#x27;m done, and because it has a wide range of heat selection, you can put it on a lower heat for bangs so that you don&#x27;t damage them.</li>
            <li>This iron doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair by stripping it of oil like other products, with the ceramic and tourmaline plates, The Solia flat iron seals the moisture into your hair and uses the heat to create a silky, fresh out of the salon, look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on Amazon but felt that the longevity this straightener has given me was worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the Solia is 1.5lbs, which can tire you hands easily when you are styling your hair.</li>
            <li>I usually blow dry my mid-back length hair with a dryer, since that&#x27;s pretty fast, but I can be kind of careless about it because I follow up with this iron.  </li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron b/c I have decided to go completely natural.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron takes about 20seconds to heat up, so it does not waste your time to unplug and have to reheat.</li>
            <li>So if your think of switching to a new flat iron, I would definitely recommend this one!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my not completely dry hair and it never burns.  </li>
            <li>I hope to post another review (or an update) in a few months to let you know whether I&#x27;ve had any of the strange malfunctions that other irons sometimes have. :)</li>
            <li>People who have dry and damaged hair should not use this product as frequently!</li>
            <li>In middle school I had very oily hair that later turned very dry..</li>
            <li>With my Solia Flat Iron, It now only takes me 15 to 20 minutes to completely straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I recently got my hair cut and pulled the old flat iron out of the closet.</li>
            <li>It also heats up nicely so I don&#x27;t waste any time waiting around for it to get hot.</li>
            <li>Some of the expensive ones broke easily and the companies customer service sucked!</li>
            <li>Usually, its curly and frizzy (high humidity) or wavy (normal humidity).  </li>
            <li>This iron works very well on frizzy hair, and the ceramic plates prevent your hair from getting stuck on the iron, which happened to me before with previous irons.</li>

            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not lying, it still works great in 2013.</li>
            <li> But if you thinks this alone will make your hair great, well it won&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> it also works good on my bangs.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to manuever and the size is also great.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I have very healthy shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I have very healthy hair to begin with...</li>
            <li> A product that consistently works well at a resonable price make this an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner!  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and the shipping was free!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it for more than 4 years now!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I still use this after so many years!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straightener, and lightweight, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, simply magical!</li>
            <li> So i made a quick effort to return it to folica, which is an great website to buy irons at a good prices, and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I got great advice from my hair stylist and a good friend.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my biracial cousin to show her how amazing this product is (she is converted...</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was especially impressed with how straight the ends were.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it the absolute best piece of equipment that straightens my hair?</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they say you are getting a good deal</li>
            <li> I have the \\&quot;not-enough-curly-nor-enough-straight\\&quot; kind of hair.  </li>
            <li> My kind of gadget.</li>
            <li> just looks healthier , also it doesnt fry my hair and stay straight for a loooong time :D</li>
            <li> Two of my friends own this iron and recommended it to me.   </li>
            <li> and they thought that would be ok, so that was good.</li>
            <li> it straightens my hair, does not cause static, is hot withint 10 seconds, makes my hair shiny, and best of all no hair damage!</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I see great results every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and plan on buying two more for my mom and sister!</li>
            <li> If you know what the best products are to use for your hair then this is good because it won&#x27;t ruin your hair the way some flat irons do.</li>
            <li> I started by using it on lower heat settings (250-300), but found that the iron is most effective between 350 and 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> iron is SOOO easy to use!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It can easily damage connections inside of the iron! &lt;</li>
            <li> and it STILL works as great as it did the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars because it did work great at first...</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very smooth and.</li>
            <li> My hair is very smooth after using it and I can adjust the temperature</li>
            <li> No snagging, no pulling my hair, it is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I felt queasy buying a hair product for $88, but thought with all the great reviews on folica.com (complete with tons of amazing before and after shots submitted by happy clients) and a money-back guarantee it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> very hot!&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable temperature (I always stay up at 450 degrees because it works the best for straightening)&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up quick</li>
            <li> so I did some research (mostly on Amazon) and decided this was the one I wanted</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Also, I never have static issues.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work again since then.</li>
            <li> My conair wasn&#x27;t doing the trick any more</li>
            <li> I think this is way better than the Chi though based on my hair after straightening.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Every straightner that I used dries out my hair and then makes it frizzy on top of that.  </li>
            <li> *might* do better than the Solia, but you&#x27;d probably have to pay $200-$300 for them.  </li>
            <li> and then you can have it for many many more.</li>
            <li> Reliable and durable, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This iron is fragile but most delicates are!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a heat protection product to protect your hair from heat</li>
            <li> I was sure it was going to be a lost cause.</li>
            <li> how many times I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> The ceramic / tourmaline plates also help keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This iron is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s long/thick hair in about 15 min.</li>
            <li> In short, I am very impressed by these straighteners.  </li>
            <li> At 180 it didn&#x27;t even feel like it was really on, more like after you&#x27;ve turned it off</li>
            <li> My biggest concern about buying the iron was making sure that it wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;fry&#x27; her waist length hair and that she would be able to use it without any help.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> I love to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> so you are able to use two hands,</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a better straightner for a while</li>
            <li> they keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  &lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never needed to go to the top end of the range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people can use this more often, for example I blowdry and straighten my hair every day</li>
            <li> Its about a year that I gifted this to someone</li>
            <li> I am extremely glad that I did, because this is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> i was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome flat iron that works with all types of hair -</li>
            <li> The Solia is the best flat iron I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> Best flat iron they have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I been able to do my own hair at home without a professional and have it look good.   </li>
            <li> My mom loved this straightner so much too that I ended up buying her one for christmas!</li>
            <li> It still works just as good as the first day I received it.</li>
            <li> Easily the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, conditioner and a good leave in balm or conditioner especially made for heat straightening.</li>
            <li> When I was using the conair, I would have to go over it with my curling iron and the results would last, if I was lucky and the weather was perfect, two days.</li>
            <li> The consistant heat level is very impressive, as is the quick initial heating speed!</li>
            <li> No problems really, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> These heat up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, even on the hottest setting.</li>
            <li> This iron also heats up very, very quickly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dull-looking and makes me think it&#x27;s going to fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I have bought  5 more of them as gifts for special people in my life.  </li>
            <li> This iron heats up super-quickly, and my wavy, dull hair comes out looking great - straight, but best of all, shiny!  </li>
            <li> Wow, this hair straightener is amazing!</li>
            <li> She uses it on a daily basis and it heats up beautifully and has yet to have any problems.</li>
            <li> Even then, it still heated up just fine, but the plastic had cracked so the plates didn&#x27;t quite come together anymore.</li>
            <li> with a normal straightner this is very damaging but the ceramic ones are incredible.</li>
            <li> The best way to make sure yours does not stop working is: do not leave the iron on for excessive amounts of time.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and healthy and it&#x27;s super shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not chemically processed with relaxers or texturizers and I wanted to enjoy the variety of having my hair straightened every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> Think of all the great hair days you&#x27;ll be missing out on because you&#x27;re sitting here reading this.iate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair &amp; is more able to iron the hair evenly.    </li>
            <li> It straightened without effort; was shiny, smooth and it lasted.  </li>
            <li> My unruley hair becomes silky smooth and shiny with my Solia.</li>
            <li> It works well without making my hair singed or frizzy, it glides through smoothly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned anything but cheap straightening irons</li>
            <li> and they said they would replace it free of charge.</li>
            <li> i bought it few years ago , and that was one of the best choices</li>
            <li> (It was the one that came with the free heat proof pouch, however.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great to have the option to have it on a low temp.</li>
            <li> Paired with the Chi silk infusion product, I have smooth and shiny hair again.  </li>
            <li> Cheap irons tend to fry hair and pull it out or break it.</li>
            <li> seemed to always do; it glides smoothly, and the size allows me to get close to the scalp without burning myself.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, I really appreciate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair &amp; is more able to iron the hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this particular brand before, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Loved it...got hot pretty quick and does not snagg on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I liked that the straightener had a temp dial and didn&#x27;t expect t have to use it on high all the time, but I do.</li>
            <li> ]with the [..]off special and free shipping.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I had it originally on 450</li>
            <li> so yes, I am pretty satisfied with how it works.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have had friends who were able to get their first Chi replaced but the company refused to replace the replacement once that one died.</li>
            <li> original review was written in 2010, after owning this for 2 years.</li>
            <li> What was taking 1-hour or more to straighten takes now a REAL 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Ok, don&#x27;t touch the ceramic plate because I promise it is HOT.  </li>
            <li> in all this straightener is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> An iron that is capable of making damaged dry hair feel like silk, is worthy of more than 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous straighteners but this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> I have not used them on damp hair, so I cannot make a claim about that, but on dry hair they work great.  </li>
            <li> I section my hair and get it super smooth and shiny with this iron.  </li>
            <li> It worked okay, but, when I decided that I wanted to straighten my hair more regularly, I thought an upgrade might help me do the job more quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and gets hot enough to straighten hair very effectively.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it worked great for about a year then some how the plates became loose and would not stay in...</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, great straightener, but don&#x27;t expect to get completely smooth hair without a straightening balm or mousse or other heat styling product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to straighten it without too much hassle but</li>
            <li> I heard good things about the Solia irons and decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and stays hot.  </li>
            <li> I decided this was a fair price for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats up super quick.</li>
            <li> Still heats up quickly, evenly, and does the job.</li>
            <li> My item was shipped fairly quickly and arrived as described in an acceptable amount of time, so no complaints there.      </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others. :)</li>
            <li> If there is a better model, I&#x27;m not interested in finding it, unless it maybe gives me a nice shave too.    </li>
            <li> I used to own a cheap metal flat iron and decided I needed an upgrade.</li>
            <li> Make sure it is left in an area where it can cool off easily.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first couple of days, my hair was silky smooth, pretty straight, and it glided smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too hot!  </li>
            <li> Look closely--the pretty, pink-haired stylist uses a Solia on her clients!</li>
            <li> The iron is ready to use within 30 secs and you can adjust the heat between 140F to 450F!!  </li>
            <li> Think of all the great hair days you&#x27;ll be missing out on because you&#x27;re sitting here reading this.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product if you have very curly hair like me.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to straighten than with a cheap straightener.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tear, leaves your hair smooth and straight just like they do in the salon.  </li>
            <li> With my Solia, my hair is straight, light, and shiny</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve used this a few times and Im happy the way my curls come out.</li>
            <li> my hair was incredibly straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> But honestly...I think even if it is on the heavy side, it works great</li>
            <li> this are good cheap products if you don&#x27;t want to waste alot of money on hair care products.</li>
            <li> It does curl hair though, with only one flip of the wrist which is amazing.</li>
            <li> The Tourmaline-Ceramic plates really do make your hair softer, shinier, and overall more healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> Well worth</li>
            <li> If you are worried about the cost, DON&#x27;T be; it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> They were well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i also looooooove that you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to warm up, there&#x27;s instant heat!</li>
            <li> I still think it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and it has a temperature control so you can control how hot it get.</li>
            <li> Okay, so i had wanted a new straightener to place my remington wet to straight, which i knew was really damaging my hair even with heat protectant, and saw the solia for a good price on folica (67.99 after discount with a free pouch) and with rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 6 months now and all I can say is that it&#x27;s truely amazing.    </li>
            <li> I had my hesitations about spending so much on a flat iron, but I had an iron that I had paid about $40.00 for at a discount store, and the difference between the two is amazing.  </li>
            <li> After 4 years my Solia flat iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li> And if it&#x27;s humid out I might as well not use it because my hair just curls right up no matter</li>
            <li> But the grip is just the right size and texture and weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this straight iron a four star review, because as a straight iron it works great, however, the advertisement claims frizz free hair, which is not exactly true.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a significant other, and she tried it out, and she looked amazing,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and definitely adds some shine.</li>
            <li> As far as performance: it gets very hot and glides smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian with naturally wavy hair, and after using this iron for a year instead of a cheap one my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li> This way you can crank up the heat when you have a good heat guard to spray over it, and you can turn the heat down for the times you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The thing that I found the most significant about this iron is its ability to turn dry damaged hair into silk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Indian and have slightly wavy hair that&#x27;s to my shoulder blades - that said, this is an awesome flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used my Solia about 5 times since I purchased it a few weeks ago, but I am so impressed with it.</li>
            <li> and it does the job quickly and efficiently and my hair stays straight until I wash it again.  </li>
            <li> A great alternative to more expensive irons.</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight without the dried-out, split-end results.  </li>
            <li> Previous to purchasing this item, I did a fair amount of research.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is that instead of being able to leave it on 180 and get nice results like the first use, I had to turn it up to between 250 and 320.  </li>
            <li> i recieved it very fast too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this flat iron, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> I have hardly ever colored it and always took great care of it.</li>
            <li> As long as some kind of product is used on my hair (I prefer argan oil, my hair stayed straight even on a rainy day.</li>
            <li> and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> (i did a hair test &amp; realized it was too hot...</li>
            <li> you are like me constantly checking reviews, doing price comparisons, conducting more research...</li>
            <li> If you are like me constantly checking reviews, doing price comparisons, conducting more research...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a gift, she used this daily for about 45 minutes or more each day &amp; it lasted over a year.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I got my first results.    </li>
            <li> I had the Chi for many years before, which finally gave up on me, so my comparison is to that product.  </li>
            <li> The straightener got so hot that the plates started sliding off (the inside plastic was melting from the heat).</li>
            <li> This iron makes my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Simply put, for the money you will not find a better flat-iron.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like was the plasticky area around the temperature adjust, makes it seem more toy-ish.</li>
            <li> I tried everything and the iron never got hot.</li>
            <li> They have the varying temperature so you can choose how much heat you supply to your hair, which is useful to prevent damage.  </li>
            <li> They work, and they work really, really well!  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this iron because i feel like it never gets hot.</li>
            <li> Works well enough that we can get out of the house in the mornings without the &#x27;hair fights&#x27;!:)</li>
            <li> I love it, but I will only buy something if it is legit, and mine was legit.</li>
            <li> With this iron it took about an hour, and I didnt even blow it out first.</li>
            <li> great for when you&#x27;re running late.    </li>
            <li> I however left before the product arrived, but was still pleased with the promptness.</li>
            <li> I loved my hair iron but after a few months the ceramic plates started to come off.</li>
            <li> it also worked on my damp hair which is good because it will save time not having to blow dry my hair completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaning toward really liking the Remington Shine Therapy right now.  </li>
            <li> Learning which temperature is right for your hair is a bit of a process (if you see your hair smoking...definitely too high!)</li>
            <li> (Beware of anything by Advanced Beauty Solutions - they are scamming people with their true ceramic pro flat iron!)</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase the same iron on their site with a flat iron pouch and stand for a few dollars less than Amazon (I rarely find better deals elsewhere, so that was an impressive find).</li>
            <li> If this one ever does break, I&#x27;ll gladly by another Solia flat</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> The second time I was a bit more daring &amp; wanted that sleek straight look</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair like with my old conair, and the results are far better.</li>
            <li> I doubt any flat iron can make you 100% invincible to high humidity, but this flat iron does a great job.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth, straight, and so far, no damage (thanks to the adjustable heat)</li>
            <li> What I like about it is the fact you have the option of really knowing &amp; choosing how hot you want it.  </li>
            <li> I bought  this solia 2 weeks ago, it works amazing, not only straight my hair also leave it soft...</li>
            <li> I adore this flat iron: it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it is lightweight and easy to handle, travels well, and gets HOT.</li>
            <li> The temp-adjust works great and while blue plates may scare off the average Chi customer, this thing easily outperforms a Chi at the same price.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a temperature control so that she can decide how hot it needs to be depending on how curly her hair is and how straight she wants it on any given day.  </li>
            <li> and i need to go over certain parts of my hair four or five times.</li>
            <li> Even though you may think a more expensive one is better, this is not always true.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair, yet  this iron was able to easily make my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li> She has very thick &amp; wavy hair, this worked great &amp; made her hair silky &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> When this happened I ordered the exact same straightener right away!</li>
            <li> keeping it straight and frizz free was a totally different story.  </li>
            <li> I really like this iron because it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair when you pull it through</li>
            <li> and I like it straight</li>
            <li> Shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> Personally, I use the Fructis Smoothing Milk, and I get that silky smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li> It really does not damage my hair as does the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to run it through my hair multiple times, like how I had to with the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> I even used it in Houston (humidity capital of the US) and my hair was similarly straight and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The real results come once I leave the house.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it out in the humidity (the real test).  </li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> This product is  highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am very amazed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Im placing an order today to buy a sedu, which my friend recommended, it made her hair silky and pin straight, and did not snag her hair.</li>
            <li> so this one is a real treat.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very wavy and stubborn when I try to change it.</li>
            <li> , she thanks me for this iron evey time she uses it, so</li>
            <li> She really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is always very efficient with the items we order from them.</li>
            <li> A friend knew how much I adored this, but didn&#x27;t want to drop the cash, and got it for me as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plug it in and it is ready to go in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and maintains it&#x27;s heat while I use it.  </li>
            <li> Mine worked really, really well... until its circuits cooked themselves.</li>
            <li> I like that you can set the temperature so if you can select as much heat as you need to get the job done, depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li> I originally tried it on a really low setting (I think like 175) and</li>
            <li> but this one is different and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> and this is wayyyyy better than any other.</li>
            <li> (looks good on me and I get tons of compliments), but have had a hard time fixing my hair with my new time constraints as a mom.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight all day even in high humidity.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it heats up, I turn it on, and 45 seconds later it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot and straightens my hair easily, even when it&#x27;s wild and curly from sleeping with it wet.  </li>
            <li> None of them really got my hair as pin straight as I wanted, and I have straight hair to begin with, though it tends to have a wave especially when I first wake up.  </li>
            <li> It still works the same and gets just as hot as the day I first bought it.</li>
            <li> As I let it cool down, I tried to make the plates set where they were supposed to be in the rare chance that it still would work.</li>
            <li> recommend this iron but not for daily use, because applying any kind of heat (iron, blow dryer, rollers, hot comb) to any type of hair everyday will cause damage.  </li>
            <li> Its a good flat iron, but I don&#x27;t think its worth the money because you can get the same desired look for less money.  </li>
            <li> You certainly can use it to curl your hair, although I am not very good at it yet, but I am more concerned with getting my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted one that was high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommened it to everyone.</li>
            <li> When high school hit I bought a solia.</li>
            <li> I just use a thermal protection spray so that my hair is not damaged by the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> But this flat iron has outlasted pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve ever owned; and I don&#x27;t even baby it!</li>
            <li> Finally after reading many reviews on a salon product website, I ordered this Solia flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These irons can go for as little as $25 or so, and on up to about $150 and more.</li>
            <li> My only regret- buying the cheap flat iron first.  </li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for a little more than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> As far as the iron goes it works very well.  </li>
            <li> i found that this straightner had all great reviews and also was not TOO expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments, and I love that it lasts 2-3 days if I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally a bit wavy</li>
            <li> Solid product worth every cent.</li>
            <li> take note that this iron WILL work if you plug it in a wall sucket equiped with a RESET like the ones normally installed in the bathroom since this appliance is equiped with one you might have to press the reset button on the iron for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick, very wavy hair and with this iron, it only take me 10 minutes to perfectly straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend flat ironing clean slightly damp or dry hair in small sections that are already detangled &amp; heat protected with some spray or serum to achieve the best results.  </li>
            <li> The solia heats up in under a minute, glides through my hair without pulling at all, and quickly straightens my hair (not that much quicker than my old one, but it never took very long).  </li>
            <li> I am still shocked by how much more quickly and easily I can straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is so worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I live in Kansas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that Chi flat irons tend to break and/or become less effective after a no. of months and that you can&#x27;t regulate heat as well with the Sedu.</li>
            <li> I now believe all my friends who have told me that you really need to use a GOOD, QUALITY flat iron if you want results without serious damage to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the 1 year warranty covers it, I really like it but am very irritated I have to send it back to the company!</li>
            <li> As described (very well) in the \\&quot;features\\&quot; section here at Amazon.com, the Solia combines ceramic with tourmaline, a gem that creates six times more negative ions than ceramic alone.</li>
            <li> Extra curly, thick hair will conform to the new straight look your stylist gave you, and there&#x27;s a beautiful sheen due to the hairs&#x27; alignment.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how the \\&quot;patented Dynamic Alignment System®\\&quot; works; I do know that the iron glides easily and without pain through short and long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> heats up fast, cools down quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been dropped maybe 300 times, left on for entire weekends, had makeup and drinks spilled on it, been yanked by the cord, on too many airplane and car trips to count, and just overall banged out around.</li>
            <li> Well it was a big hit with her, she loves the ceramic plates that do a much better job than the other irons she tried.  </li>
            <li> (The only time I had that problem was with a heat spray whose first ingredient was alcohol.)  </li>
            <li> An hour later I had straight hair!  </li>
            <li> Most other straighteners  have an area you can put your fingers on the open end</li>
            <li> I love the small plate size because I can roll the hair around the edge of the iron and get it to curl</li>
            <li> This iron does straighten a lot faster and easier than my old conair, and it does last til I wash my hair again (or it rains and gets wet), but I still get the fluff strands all over, and my hair has been splitting a lot more quickly now while using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is so over processed that the ends of my hair no longer lay down smooth.  </li>
            <li> , you put the dial on your desired temperature &amp; in next thing you know the light goes from a solid red (heating up) to flashing (ready).  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap &amp; old (10+ years) flat iron that finally fell to it&#x27;s death on the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often, so I can&#x27;t comment on if it is more or less damaging, but I will say that I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair being dry at all after using this.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me that the cheap irons lose their ability to get hot after a period of time and when you have thick hair with curls, you need max heat.</li>
            <li> and it only takes one pass to get your hair completely straight.</li>
            <li> oh WOW.  </li>
            <li> and now they stay straight all night and even the next day.  </li>
            <li> It not only straightens it, it really does repair it.</li>
            <li> this one advertised is BY FAR</li>
            <li> and this one keeps my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it look dried out.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a couple of years ago and it it the only straightener that truly straightened my hair (I have naturally very curly hair).</li>
            <li> My hair felt \\&quot;baked\\&quot; and dried out with the cheap iron.</li>
            <li> ] iron and I was completely dissapointed..</li>
            <li> it makes my hair so silk and soft it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Since then I used it every night before school and when I wake up the next morning my hair was still straight.</li>
            <li> i use it to do soft waves on my hair.</li>
            <li> received my iron on Tuesday evening and 1 hour later my hair was straight.  </li>
            <li> I received the Solia for Christmas, and have had a complete 180 degree experience from the cheapie.  </li>
            <li> so i frequently do.</li>
            <li> Luckily I unplugged it in time before it completely melted or burned the place down.</li>
            <li> The outside of the straightener heats up pretty much the same as the plates on the inside which means the only place to hold it is on the handle.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up and cools down quickly.</li>
            <li> I had to keep the iron up at the highest level to get any kind of results, and I have fine, dry hair and could tell it was already starting to dull and break due to the iron.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a very high-quality flat iron, so I always used my curling iron to straighten my hair before.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much shinier and softer after I straighten it than it was when I was using my curling iron or my cheaper flat iron.</li>
            <li> Often I even forget to turn it off, and it will sit on the sink all day like Little Caesars, hot &amp; ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I have previously owned a CHI an InStyler and cheap irons such as revlon.</li>
            <li> I have somewhere between straight and wavy long hair</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight and shiny all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many flat irons in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American with a nice grade of thick medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized it was time for an upgrade because it was just not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I sent it back, and within 4 days my new iron came.</li>
            <li> on dry winter days is my hair naturally straight.  </li>
            <li> Im Black with medium fine African American grade of hair.  </li>
            <li> do forward one MAJOR caution.</li>
            <li> The first lasted for about 9 months and the other (which didn&#x27;t come on this morning &amp; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m online searching for another one)</li>
            <li> but i wish i read into other reviews first.</li>
            <li> Not only was this flat iron a very reasonable price, but it came with some extra bells and whistles that it&#x27;s competitors didn&#x27;t: temperature contol, pressure-sensitive plates, etc.  </li>
            <li> not sure if this was just one of those times where you get a \\&quot;bad apple\\&quot; from what is normally a good product, but I sure as hell didn&#x27;t buy a second one to find out.</li>
            <li> than just a hair straightener, the lightweight Solia can give you flips, curves (both towards your face and away), and generally shape your hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided it was time to upgrade from drug-store straighteners to something professional grade.  </li>
            <li> It feels very silky when I&#x27;m done, and because it has a wide range of heat selection, you can put it on a lower heat for bangs so that you don&#x27;t damage them.</li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair by stripping it of oil like other products, with the ceramic and tourmaline plates, The Solia flat iron seals the moisture into your hair and uses the heat to create a silky, fresh out of the salon, look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on Amazon but felt that the longevity this straightener has given me was worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the Solia is 1.5lbs, which can tire you hands easily when you are styling your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually blow dry my mid-back length hair with a dryer, since that&#x27;s pretty fast, but I can be kind of careless about it because I follow up with this iron.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron b/c I have decided to go completely natural.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron takes about 20seconds to heat up, so it does not waste your time to unplug and have to reheat.</li>
            <li> So if your think of switching to a new flat iron, I would definitely recommend this one!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my not completely dry hair and it never burns.  </li>
            <li> I hope to post another review (or an update) in a few months to let you know whether I&#x27;ve had any of the strange malfunctions that other irons sometimes have. :)</li>
            <li> People who have dry and damaged hair should not use this product as frequently!</li>
            <li> In middle school I had very oily hair that later turned very dry..</li>
            <li> With my Solia Flat Iron, It now only takes me 15 to 20 minutes to completely straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut and pulled the old flat iron out of the closet.</li>
            <li> It also heats up nicely so I don&#x27;t waste any time waiting around for it to get hot.</li>
            <li> Some of the expensive ones broke easily and the companies customer service sucked!</li>
            <li> Usually, its curly and frizzy (high humidity) or wavy (normal humidity).  </li>
            <li> This iron works very well on frizzy hair, and the ceramic plates prevent your hair from getting stuck on the iron, which happened to me before with previous irons.</li>
            <li> I have thick and kinky hair and have never had much success taming it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the previous reviews which convinced me to try it!</li>
            <li> I had been using a flat iron that I purchased several years ago to straighten my hair only occasionally.</li>
            <li> a little hot on the outside, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> This is my second flat iron, a replacement to a conair 3/4 $15 dollar iron.</li>
            <li> The only negative aspect is the outside (black) shell, which appears to made of cheap material.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars is I was a little suprised at how high I had to turn up the temperature so that this would straighten my hair in one pass.</li>
            <li> considering how much I have spent on other irons and products, this is a bargain!  </li>
            <li> I also have curled my hair with this flat iron</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted a ceramic flat iron</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on flat irons and eventually settled on this one.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on flat irons before deciding the Solia</li>
            <li> about this Solia flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought my solia tourmaline ceramic ion flat iron july 2009.</li>
            <li> I used to relax my hair to get it straigt, but I stopped doing so, sometime before I bought my flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are flat irons out there that</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron when I moved in to the dorm as a freshman in college.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over 2 years</li>
            <li> Would you drop your flat screen TV and expect it not to break???</li>
            <li> I bought this Solia Tourmaline Ceramic flat iron after going through 3 cheaper, Target/CVS, Conair, POS&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> After doing tons of shopping around I came across the Solia Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> i loooooooooove this product i had about 6 flat irons over the years including a chi</li>
            <li> I had ordered my Solia flat iron and when it came, it did not work.</li>
            <li> That fact cleary comes about as soon as you try this flat iron.</li>
            <li> On a website of flat iron reviews, this iron was rated number 2.</li>
            <li> However, I do wonder if that&#x27;s just the nature of flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have just started straightening my wavy hair this year, and bought a cheapie flat iron at Target to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through my share of flat irons.  </li>
            <li> It is the lightest flat iron I have ever held.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and yet can work through it quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> it gave my hair the appearance of a blown out afro because I was afraid of my hair not being able to revert back to its curly state.  </li>
            <li> It completely straightens my hair in less than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> It does work on damp hair, but I only use it on dry hair because the sizzling still makes me cringe.</li>
            <li> With other flat irons, my hair would suddenly poof once i walked outside.    </li>
            <li> Shipper was efficient and the flat iron arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I head future buyers to beware of buying a flat iron from unknown sources on ebay or amazon or any of the like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about durability and whatnot, but it appeared high in quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron to anyone looking to create that salon styled look everyday!</li>
            <li> i still wished i could purchase the 200 dollar ones because i thought they&#x27;d be so amazing, but supprisingly some of them go bad reviews.</li>
            <li> And if you carefully read the 3 star or lower reviews, you&#x27;ll see that these people dislike the iron because of personal mistakes like dropping the iron and expecting it not to break.</li>
            <li> Her hair is much finer, although still thick with type 3 hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair is only a midly wavey at the bottom and other then that it&#x27;s pretty thin, on th ick at the ends.</li>
            <li> I just put in some leave-in conditioner, gloss cream, blow-dried it (cause I dont totally trust the wet to dry feature).</li>
            <li> All through high school I would use some type of straightener from Walmart, and even if I hardly used them, they&#x27;d always stop working around the one year mark.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I can just freshen it up with the iron, no need to dry my hair out by washing and blow drying every single day.  </li>
            <li> Usually I wash, condition, and dry my hair with rollers for an hour followed by another half hour of blow drying to get it straight.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like other flat irons have.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like other flat irons</li>
            <li> Some were very cheap and some were ridiculously expensive, however, no matter the cost, I was never satisfied.  </li>
            <li> For those reviews who claimed thattheir Solia broke down in only a couple of months</li>
            <li> At this price point, I was thinking the Solia would cut my styling time in half, but no such luck.  </li>
            <li> Ive had this less than a year and cant even use it because it snags and pulls several hairs every time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet hair yet, but it says you can use it on dry or damp hair.</li>
            <li> The difference is that it takes 5 minutes to straighten all of my long thick hair compared to the 20 minutes I spent with my old iron.  </li>
            <li> and it is very hard to get straight.  </li>
            <li> It heated up in less than 3 minutes, then fixed my hair in less than 5!</li>
            <li> I works well on my hair which is very thick and wavy, though soft and not at all coarse.  </li>
            <li> When this one finally goes bad I will definitely be buying this exact one again!</li>
            <li> The Chi wasn&#x27;t bad, but to me, this is way better.</li>
            <li> My hair generally takes style well, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for \\&quot;problem\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this nearly daily for over two years, my hair is still undamaged (at least to the naked eye).</li>
            <li> the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I just use it for a few seconds every day and it makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> The iron works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have used this everyday for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> While it does straighten my hair with minimal damage (escpially compared to a lot of straighteners that I&#x27;ve used) it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I wished it would.</li>
            <li> My only worry now is the complaints I&#x27;ve read from others that their irons broke after just a few months.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser managed to convince me that the money would be well spent after using some fancy salon straighteners on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have bought a few other irons with metal plates and larger plates, butane or electrical, but nothing compares to this iron.  </li>
            <li> The Solia is the hair iron that the three bears would have chosen: Neither too hot or too cold, too cheap or too expensive, it&#x27;s a product</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron in the mail a few days ago and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> I dropped it one time, and the round cap over the hinge mechanism broke off, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I can get my hair just as straight and in about the same time using my much less expensive Conair.</li>
            <li> The curls stay in long with a little hair spray.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t open wide enough for the blind straightening I have to do at the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that the typically life expectancy for a straightner is 1-3 years for an everyday user such as my self.</li>
            <li> Buy this iron and you won&#x27;t be sorry  ;)</li>
            <li> It looked pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I needed something of quality, but not top of the line, so I chose this as a middle ground.</li>
            <li> My other iron used to get caught and rip out strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it almost every other day.</li>
            <li> I read other comments about the iron not working:  </li>
            <li> and so it sometimes gets damaged by the extreme heat of other straighteners.</li>
            <li> money well spent!</li>
            <li> it goes up to 420 degrees, i believe, but i feel like the plates are never hot</li>
            <li> In the past she was always disatisfied with lesser quality items and placed this Solia iron on her wish list.</li>
            <li> have tried the cheap walmart bought irons and the very expensive irons.</li>
            <li> Usually my arm are killing me when I&#x27;m only 1/3 way through my hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> I was so disgusted because I spent a good amount of money</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and curly and I&#x27;ve had numerous flat irons to tame it.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get my flat iron</li>
            <li> I have purchased two Solia flat irons in the past two years and both of them just stopped working.</li>
            <li> i have wavy, dry, thick hair that goes about half way down my back and chest.</li>
            <li> It makes me very impatient with drugstore flat irons and curlers.  </li>
            <li> Trust me not worth the price cut.....</li>
            <li> I have used it, at least one person (usually 2-3) has looked surprised and complimented me on my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cooling down.      </li>
            <li> If you are sick of spending your money on cheap hair straighteners that don&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li> Maybe its defective, but I feel like a product of this quality shouldnt fall apart in less than a year.</li>
            <li> I have significantly less frizz/flyaway hair than I used to, too.   </li>
            <li> Unlike the chi that I previously owned, this iron has an adjustable heat setting switch that goes from 140 - 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> I had never encountered this problem before, even with my previous[..</li>
            <li> my parents freaked out when i told them the price still, so i offered to pay half</li>
            <li> , I wish the cord would swivel because it can become a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to fear drizzle and humidity and rain or going to sleep and waking up with a mess on my head.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also impossible to get right down to the roots of the hair because the plates are so close to the edge of the straightener that I end up burning my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little while now</li>
            <li> Snagged hair a little.  </li>
            <li> If I come in contact with a little rain and get frizzy, I just touch up with the iron.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over the same section of hair (typically, 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick) at least 2 or 3 times in order to get the desired look.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed for the price and expected a lot more because it was rated so god online.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner almost 5 years ago and have used it almost everyday since.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, as some others have stated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s slightly wet, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> the thing is, since i have such boring hair one of my only options is to wear it straight</li>
            <li> the solia ceramic flat iron was everything i expected it to be !!!!!!</li>
            <li> so I could make my flat thin hair look like others in my peer group (volume and curl).  </li>
            <li> From mane to tame in around 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and hesitant to spend that much but,</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for the past 7 years</li>
            <li> In the past I have used my $20 Babyliss steam shot straighteners, and they worked, but nothing fancy.  </li>
            <li> Failed me on the second USE.  </li>
            <li> The process usually takes two hours at the salon and I never even attempt to do it at home.  </li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair as usual, then put some John Frieda Frizz Ease in it and divided it into five sections.  </li>
            <li> Those before and after pictures you see on TV pale in comparison to these results!</li>
            <li> The Chi ones seem to crap out rather soon and are more expensive.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me over 2 hours to blow it out (by myself, so I hardly ever do it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because it realy did get my hair straight</li>
            <li> will fall apart if u drop it on a hard floor.</li>
            <li> The Solia hair irons make my hair dull and don&#x27;t seal the ends like the FHI irons seem to do.</li>
            <li> I am african-american woman with naturally thick, dense, coily, kinky, curly type 4 hair.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I mean this thing goes up to 450 in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li> i mean come on,</li>
            <li> Very sad there are such crappy products out there.  </li>
            <li> I have heard some reviews where the Solia has stopped working within a few months of purchase, unfortunately, this is common with any electronical device.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the inability of the flat iron, or if my hair is just impossible.</li>
            <li> However, I was always frustrated that I could never do the same with it that they could, until now.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t blow dry them they are fluffy and I hate this.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s naturally thick and curly) and it still does the job well!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this thing is tough.</li>
            <li> and she has very thick hair</li>
            <li> and very very thick hair).</li>
            <li> I would wake up every morning and spend an hour straightening my hair and getting poor results.</li>
            <li> I can even put it in a ponytail without having that annoying kink in the back afterwards.  </li>
            <li> thought I destroyed it when I took it to another country and didn&#x27;t realize that my power convertor was broken.</li>
            <li> All my friends have gotten the straightner because it had a dramatic effect of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I also hate curling my hair due to the time it takes.  </li>
            <li> needless to say I had to buy another straightner.</li>
            <li> Conditioners and expensive shampoos do not help.</li>
            <li> About a week ago a stepped on it and it broke which is all my fault and nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about product but read the reviews and tried it out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending close to $100 (it was on sale for $88) on a hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> Before it I had tried every drugstore/department store cheap-o brand as well as an expensive chi model.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair</li>
            <li> The others I looked where the chi and sedu but were very expensive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t drying out so bad.</li>
            <li> The speed of the delivery shocked me.</li>
            <li> At my expense, of course :(    </li>
            <li> This has to be the biggest piece of crap I ever bought..</li>
            <li> and this is the biggest piece of crap I ever bought.</li>
            <li> It  lasted 2 months before the crap wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li> I hate that.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that the warranty does not apply if you buy it from amazone.</li>
            <li> seriously head for the hills and buy another product!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> THE WORST......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worst than the ones you get at Target.</li>
            <li> i would never recommend this iron to someone i hated!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This iron works very well on frizzy hair, and the ceramic plates prevent your hair from getting stuck on the iron, which happened to me before with previous irons. I started by using it on lower heat settings (250-300), but found that the iron is most effective between 350 and 400 degrees. As long as some kind of product is used on my hair (I prefer argan oil, my hair stayed straight even on a rainy day.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener in 2004. It worked great and continued working perfectly until I stepped on it this summer. Even then, it still heated up just fine, but the plastic had cracked so the plates didn&#x27;t quite come together anymore. I&#x27;ve been borrowing my friend&#x27;s since, but miss my Solia and will buy another.</li>
            <li> Its a good flat iron, but I don&#x27;t think its worth the money because you can get the same desired look for less money.  I have somewhere between straight and wavy long hair and it still takes quite awhile to fully straighten my hair using this Solia.  I have to go over the same section of hair (typically, 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick) at least 2 or 3 times in order to get the desired look.  At this price point, I was thinking the Solia would cut my styling time in half, but no such luck.  I can get my hair just as straight and in about the same time using my much less expensive Conair.</li>
            <li> This thing worked \\&quot;okay\\&quot; for the time it was around, which was all of 3 months. Now it won&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get my flat iron so I could make my flat thin hair look like others in my peer group (volume and curl).  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the inability of the flat iron, or if my hair is just impossible.</li>
            <li> I loved my hair iron but after a few months the ceramic plates started to come off. Ive had this less than a year and cant even use it because it snags and pulls several hairs every time. OUCH!!! Maybe its defective, but I feel like a product of this quality shouldnt fall apart in less than a year. I only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Loved it...got hot pretty quick and does not snagg on my hair.  No problems really, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron in the mail a few days ago and have been using it since. The Tourmaline-Ceramic plates really do make your hair softer, shinier, and overall more healthy looking. I have beach wavy hair and it straightens it in one pass. I also have curled my hair with this flat iron and it works pretty well. The curls stay in long with a little hair spray. The temperature settings go from 140 - 450 degrees, so it will work well for all hair types. I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet hair yet, but it says you can use it on dry or damp hair. I really like this iron because it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair when you pull it through and it only takes one pass to get your hair completely straight. It also has the swivel cord so that you can style your hair without the cord getting tangled and in the way.</li>
            <li> I adore this flat iron: it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it is lightweight and easy to handle, travels well, and gets HOT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used my Solia about 5 times since I purchased it a few weeks ago, but I am so impressed with it. I didn&#x27;t have a very high-quality flat iron, so I always used my curling iron to straighten my hair before. I decided I wanted a ceramic flat iron and I wanted one that was high quality so I did some research (mostly on Amazon) and decided this was the one I wanted and I was not disappointed. My hair is so much shinier and softer after I straighten it than it was when I was using my curling iron or my cheaper flat iron. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments, and I love that it lasts 2-3 days if I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair. I have significantly less frizz/flyaway hair than I used to, too.   I noticed the Solia was shipping from Folica and visited their site before ordering. I was able to purchase the same iron on their site with a flat iron pouch and stand for a few dollars less than Amazon (I rarely find better deals elsewhere, so that was an impressive find). I hope to post another review (or an update) in a few months to let you know whether I&#x27;ve had any of the strange malfunctions that other irons sometimes have. :)</li>
            <li> I had been using a flat iron that I purchased several years ago to straighten my hair only occasionally. It worked okay, but, when I decided that I wanted to straighten my hair more regularly, I thought an upgrade might help me do the job more quickly. I did a lot of research on flat irons and eventually settled on this one. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and I absolutely love it. I am still shocked by how much more quickly and easily I can straighten my hair. The iron heats up and cools down quickly. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. Most importantly, I see great results every time I use it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Well to start with I have to tell you about my hair.  I am african-american woman with naturally thick, dense, coily, kinky, curly type 4 hair.  My hair is not chemically processed with relaxers or texturizers and I wanted to enjoy the variety of having my hair straightened every once in a while.  I did a lot of research on flat irons before deciding the Solia may be the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about this Solia flat iron...I am truly impressed.  What I like about it is the fact you have the option of really knowing &amp; choosing how hot you want it.  I mean this thing goes up to 450 in a matter of seconds.  You plug it in, you put the dial on your desired temperature &amp; in next thing you know the light goes from a solid red (heating up) to flashing (ready).  I recommend flat ironing clean slightly damp or dry hair in small sections that are already detangled &amp; heat protected with some spray or serum to achieve the best results.  I originally tried it on a really low setting (I think like 175) and it gave my hair the appearance of a blown out afro because I was afraid of my hair not being able to revert back to its curly state.  The second time I was a bit more daring &amp; wanted that sleek straight look so I had it originally on 450 (i did a hair test &amp; realized it was too hot...i learned my hair likes it around 370) &amp; it came out beautiful.  I was especially impressed with how straight the ends were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ranted &amp; raved about this thing to all my friends &amp; family like some cult member.  I even used it on my biracial cousin to show her how amazing this product is (she is converted...my mission is working) whose hair is nothing like mine.  Her hair is much finer, although still thick with type 3 hair.  She especially loved that she can create gorgeous curls like a curling iron with it.  Ironically, she can handle 400+ heat.  Who knew right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say there are any negatives, I wish the cord would swivel because it can become a tangled mess.  On the plus side, I really appreciate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair &amp; is more able to iron the hair evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me constantly checking reviews, doing price comparisons, conducting more research...just do it &amp; buy it already.  Think of all the great hair days you&#x27;ll be missing out on because you&#x27;re sitting here reading this.iate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair &amp; is more able to iron the hair evenly.

            <li> I have had one of these for the past 7 years and I have bought  5 more of them as gifts for special people in my life.  Everyone thinks they are great.  My hair is wavy and I like it straight and it does the job quickly and efficiently and my hair stays straight until I wash it again.  Also, I never have static issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a gift, she used this daily for about 45 minutes or more each day &amp; it lasted over a year. She has very thick &amp; wavy hair, this worked great &amp; made her hair silky &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> My name is graciel and I&#x27;m of latin american and african descend. I bought my solia tourmaline ceramic ion flat iron july 2009. Since then I&#x27;ve used it almost twice every week. I didn&#x27;t use it every day.It is a fantastic product if you have very curly hair like me. I used to relax my hair to get it straigt, but I stopped doing so, sometime before I bought my flat iron. It did a great job, until a couple of weeks a go I accidentally dropped it while I was straigtning my hair. It immediately turned of. After a while I could turn it back on without a problem. Then after a week or so it just turned of while I was using it and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work again since then. I&#x27;m so disappointed because it realy did get my hair straight and I only had it for 5 months. The worst part is that the warranty does not apply if you buy it from amazone.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron b/c I have decided to go completely natural.  Im Black with medium fine African American grade of hair.  My conair wasn&#x27;t doing the trick any more so I up graded, an oh WOW.  This iron is the best.  It straightened without effort; was shiny, smooth and it lasted.  I recommend this iron the stylist and anyone else who needs excellent results.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it worked great for about a year then some how the plates became loose and would not stay in...needless to say I had to buy another straightner. However, I have noticed that the typically life expectancy for a straightner is 1-3 years for an everyday user such as my self. So I feel that this straightner did its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a significant other, and she tried it out, and she looked amazing, so yes, I am pretty satisfied with how it works. I&#x27;m not sure about durability and whatnot, but it appeared high in quality. Shipping was also fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner almost 5 years ago and have used it almost everyday since. and it STILL works as great as it did the first time i used it. I still can&#x27;t believe it still works.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very smooth and. staight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 6 months now and all I can say is that it&#x27;s truely amazing.    My hair is extremely thick and curly and I&#x27;ve had numerous flat irons to tame it. I would wake up every morning and spend an hour straightening my hair and getting poor results. I live in Kansas so there is a lot of humidity in the summer. With other flat irons, my hair would suddenly poof once i walked outside.    With my Solia Flat Iron, It now only takes me 15 to 20 minutes to completely straighten my hair. My unruley hair becomes silky smooth and shiny with my Solia. I was amazed when I got my first results.    Even 6 months later I am still amazed with my Solia.  It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like other flat irons have.    Definitely a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the 1 year warranty covers it, I really like it but am very irritated I have to send it back to the company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Indian and have slightly wavy hair that&#x27;s to my shoulder blades - that said, this is an awesome flat iron!  I had the Chi for many years before, which finally gave up on me, so my comparison is to that product.  With this iron, I can straighten my hair in about 10 min versus about 12 min with my Chi.  I think this is way better than the Chi though based on my hair after straightening.  My hair feels smooth and healthy and it&#x27;s super shiny.  The Chi wasn&#x27;t bad, but to me, this is way better.</li>
            <li> The Solia is the hair iron that the three bears would have chosen: Neither too hot or too cold, too cheap or too expensive, it&#x27;s a product that&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These irons can go for as little as $25 or so, and on up to about $150 and more. The cheaper irons can damage your hair, and the more expensive ones can put holes in your hair.  As described (very well) in the \\&quot;features\\&quot; section here at Amazon.com, the Solia combines ceramic with tourmaline, a gem that creates six times more negative ions than ceramic alone. These ions, combined with the heat (which the user can \\&quot;dial\\&quot; to a temperature between 140 and 450 degrees Fahrenheit) give you the capability to change the direction and texture of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than just a hair straightener, the lightweight Solia can give you flips, curves (both towards your face and away), and generally shape your hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up quickly.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how the \\&quot;patented Dynamic Alignment System®\\&quot; works; I do know that the iron glides easily and without pain through short and long curly hair.  Extra curly, thick hair will conform to the new straight look your stylist gave you, and there&#x27;s a beautiful sheen due to the hairs&#x27; alignment.  It comes with an instruction booklet; I&#x27;d also recommend the product&#x27;s website at folica.com.  A product that consistently works well at a resonable price make this an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this straight iron a four star review, because as a straight iron it works great, however, the advertisement claims frizz free hair, which is not exactly true. This iron does straighten a lot faster and easier than my old conair, and it does last til I wash my hair again (or it rains and gets wet), but I still get the fluff strands all over, and my hair has been splitting a lot more quickly now while using this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, great straightener, but don&#x27;t expect to get completely smooth hair without a straightening balm or mousse or other heat styling product. Personally, I use the Fructis Smoothing Milk, and I get that silky smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li> This iron works as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, as some others have stated. A great alternative to more expensive irons.</li>
            <li> Just made this purchase about a month ago. It&#x27;s the best straightener I&#x27;ve purchased. It really does not damage my hair as does the cheaper brands. I would highly recommend this product to others. :)</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to straighten than with a cheap straightener.  Doesn&#x27;t tear, leaves your hair smooth and straight just like they do in the salon.  It is amazing.  I have been having issues with my unmanageable hair for years and have always felt great after the salon straightened it. However, I was always frustrated that I could never do the same with it that they could, until now.  I love it.  Its great! Worth the money spent.  Its the perfect width for medium length hair and bangs.  Heats up super quick.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner!  I have very difficult hair and it is very hard to get straight.  Every straightner that I used dries out my hair and then makes it frizzy on top of that.  Not this one!  My hair is very smooth after using it and I can adjust the temperature so it&#x27;s not too hot!  My hair is just below my sholders and it only takes 10-15 minutes to straightner it.  I don&#x27;t have to wait for the iron to heat up again and I don&#x27;t have to run it through my hair multiple times, like how I had to with the cheap ones.  My mom loved this straightner so much too that I ended up buying her one for christmas!</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for over 4 years. It still works just as good as the first day I received it. I know people who have went through 3 or 4 straightener in the time I have had my Solia. I would recommend this product to anyway with think wavy hair like mine. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I felt queasy buying a hair product for $88, but thought with all the great reviews on folica.com (complete with tons of amazing before and after shots submitted by happy clients) and a money-back guarantee it would be worth a try.  I was very happy with the result.  My hair is super straight without the dried-out, split-end results.  I just use it for a few seconds every day and it makes a big difference.  I even used it in Houston (humidity capital of the US) and my hair was similarly straight and manageable.  Well worth the investment - beats having to try every gel and leave-in conditioner out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this flat iron, especially for the money.  It gets hot and straightens my hair easily, even when it&#x27;s wild and curly from sleeping with it wet.  I dropped it one time, and the round cap over the hinge mechanism broke off, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the flat iron.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently decided it was time to upgrade from drug-store straighteners to something professional grade.  After doing a lot of research, I went with the Solia, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!  Not only was this flat iron a very reasonable price, but it came with some extra bells and whistles that it&#x27;s competitors didn&#x27;t: temperature contol, pressure-sensitive plates, etc.  My hair is normally a bit wavy and there&#x27;s a lot of it.  I&#x27;ve always been able to straighten it without too much hassle but keeping it straight and frizz free was a totally different story.  The solia heats up in under a minute, glides through my hair without pulling at all, and quickly straightens my hair (not that much quicker than my old one, but it never took very long).  The real results come once I leave the house.  My locks used to curl up on me by the time I reached my destination and now they stay straight all night and even the next day.  I can even put it in a ponytail without having that annoying kink in the back afterwards.  I&#x27;ve had three people in the last couple of weeks ask me what was different about me.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it out in the humidity (the real test).  Easily the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of friends&#x27; irons.)  My hair is silky smooth, straight, and so far, no damage (thanks to the adjustable heat) Buy this iron and you won&#x27;t be sorry  ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Solia since the summer of 2006.  *Every time* I have used it, at least one person (usually 2-3) has looked surprised and complimented me on my hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only on dry winter days is my hair naturally straight.  Usually, its curly and frizzy (high humidity) or wavy (normal humidity).  My hair is medium-thick and shoulder-length. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Solia gets my hair s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t and I don&#x27;t get frizzy when I use it.  I doubt any flat iron can make you 100% invincible to high humidity, but this flat iron does a great job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use it 1-2 times a week when I&#x27;m up at college and have no split ends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are flat irons out there that *might* do better than the Solia, but you&#x27;d probably have to pay $200-$300 for them.  I&#x27;ve heard that Chi flat irons tend to break and/or become less effective after a no. of months and that you can&#x27;t regulate heat as well with the Sedu. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PS--Ever seen the makeover show, \\&quot;Ten Years Younger\\&quot;?  Look closely--the pretty, pink-haired stylist uses a Solia on her clients!</li>
            <li> Wow, this hair straightener is amazing! I was thrift store shopping one day last year and came across it. It looked pretty expensive so I searched it on my phone and turns out it was selling for $75-$125. (I got it for $10 by the way!!!) So I went to try it out and my hair straightens PERFECTLY without getting frizzy! I have really curly hair so I always have problems with straighteners but this one is different and is well worth the price! When this one finally goes bad I will definitely be buying this exact one again! If you are sick of spending your money on cheap hair straighteners that don&#x27;t work....buy this one!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron when I moved in to the dorm as a freshman in college. I needed something of quality, but not top of the line, so I chose this as a middle ground. I am very glad I did. 5 years later I am out of college and still use this! Is it the absolute best piece of equipment that straightens my hair? Maybe not. But this flat iron has outlasted pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve ever owned; and I don&#x27;t even baby it! It&#x27;s been dropped maybe 300 times, left on for entire weekends, had makeup and drinks spilled on it, been yanked by the cord, on too many airplane and car trips to count, and just overall banged out around. Let me tell you, this thing is tough. It works as well as it did when I got it. Still heats up quickly, evenly, and does the job. I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on Amazon but felt that the longevity this straightener has given me was worth the trouble. Get this guy, it will pay for itself in a year and then you can have it for many many more. As far as performance: it gets very hot and glides smooth. I have frizzy, wavy hair and it doesn&#x27;t ever catch or pull on it. From mane to tame in around 10 minutes. It is the best buy for a straightener that I&#x27;ve seen. Reliable and durable, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner over 6 years ago. It still works the same and gets just as hot as the day I first bought it. All my friends have gotten the straightner because it had a dramatic effect of my hair. It not only straightens it, it really does repair it. I have never seen my hair so shinny and silky before. PLEASE get his straightner. I HIGHLY recommened it to everyone. It is great. I will be buying these for my Christmas gifts this year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over 2 years and I LOVE IT! It was worth every penny! It works well without making my hair singed or frizzy, it glides through smoothly and I can still use the second setting on my hair (it&#x27;s naturally thick and curly) and it still does the job well!</li>
            <li> This is my second flat iron, a replacement to a conair 3/4 $15 dollar iron. If you are worried about the cost, DON&#x27;T be; it&#x27;s worth it. My hair has never looked better, and the best part is that it lasts until I wash my hair again. I no longer have to fear drizzle and humidity and rain or going to sleep and waking up with a mess on my head. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair like with my old conair, and the results are far better. There is no fuzziness to my hair when I&#x27;m finished and all it takes is one swipe. When I was using the conair, I would have to go over it with my curling iron and the results would last, if I was lucky and the weather was perfect, two days. And my ends would also looked fried. With my Solia, my hair is straight, light, and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t frizz or fuzz up. And my ends have yet to looked fried while using the Solia. ^_^ My hair also looks healthier than it ever has before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas 6 months ago. She uses it on a daily basis and it heats up beautifully and has yet to have any problems. When I shopped around for straighteners this one had some of the highest reviews, best reliability and price. The Chi ones seem to crap out rather soon and are more expensive. I have had friends who were able to get their first Chi replaced but the company refused to replace the replacement once that one died.</li>
            <li> I bought  this solia 2 weeks ago, it works amazing, not only straight my hair also leave it soft...i love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straightener, and lightweight, easy to use. This product is  highly recommended! We Love IT!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is so over processed that the ends of my hair no longer lay down smooth.  Conditioners and expensive shampoos do not help. This product has helped solve the problem.  The iron works as expected.  Shipper was efficient and the flat iron arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> An iron that is capable of making damaged dry hair feel like silk, is worthy of more than 5 stars!!!! Unlike the chi that I previously owned, this iron has an adjustable heat setting switch that goes from 140 - 450 degrees. This way you can crank up the heat when you have a good heat guard to spray over it, and you can turn the heat down for the times you don&#x27;t. The thing that I found the most significant about this iron is its ability to turn dry damaged hair into silk. Those before and after pictures you see on TV pale in comparison to these results! This iron doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair by stripping it of oil like other products, with the ceramic and tourmaline plates, The Solia flat iron seals the moisture into your hair and uses the heat to create a silky, fresh out of the salon, look. I am very amazed with this product. It was well worth the money!!!! And if you carefully read the 3 star or lower reviews, you&#x27;ll see that these people dislike the iron because of personal mistakes like dropping the iron and expecting it not to break. Would you drop your flat screen TV and expect it not to break??? I didn&#x27;t think so. This iron is fragile but most delicates are!!!!! So if your think of switching to a new flat iron, I would definitely recommend this one!!!!!!  P.S  I have previously owned a CHI an InStyler and cheap irons such as revlon. This is the best one I ever had. The results will blow you away, I just had to use it once to become a believer.  P.P.S  I would also buy this from amazon because I recieved the product in two days!!!!! and the shipping was free!!</li>
            <li> This has to be the biggest piece of crap I ever bought.. Pardon my french but I&#x27;ve been doing the Brazilian hair straighening for YEARS and this is the biggest piece of crap I ever bought. It  lasted 2 months before the crap wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  It is  WAY over priced...seriously head for the hills and buy another product!!!!!!  I tried calling them and they had nothing to say nor would they replace the one I bought.  DO NOT BUY IT...TRUST ME......Very sad there are such crappy products out there.  Try the one with the commercial. I can&#x27;t remember the name but I have four irons and the one on the ifommerial is awesome (no I do not work for them) this one advertised is BY FAR THE WORST......I love the fact that they say you are getting a good deal and there is a price cut..Trust me not worth the price cut.....It&#x27;s worst than the ones you get at Target.</li>
            <li> I bought this Solia Tourmaline Ceramic flat iron after going through 3 cheaper, Target/CVS, Conair, POS&#x27;.  I was initially recommended to the CHI brand by a friend, but after doing a bunch of online research I came upon this model.  That was back in the end on 2004.    I have used this everyday for the last 5 years. Sometimes both my Wife and myself will use it.  Often I even forget to turn it off, and it will sit on the sink all day like Little Caesars, hot &amp; ready to go.  If there is a better model, I&#x27;m not interested in finding it, unless it maybe gives me a nice shave too.    Just for the sheer durability and dependability, I give it 5 stars.    Great investment.  Solid product worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut and pulled the old flat iron out of the closet. I quickly realized it was time for an upgrade because it was just not hot enough. After doing tons of shopping around I came across the Solia Flat Iron. I read all of the reviews and decided to take a chance on it. I am extremely glad that I did, because this is the best flat iron I have ever used. I have extremely thick and curly hair, yet  this iron was able to easily make my hair pin straight. My other iron used to get caught and rip out strands of my hair. The Solia runs through my hair like butter! I highly recommend this iron to anyone looking to create that salon styled look everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little while now and it works great. I used to own a cheap metal flat iron and decided I needed an upgrade. I have very frizzy hair and this one keeps my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it look dried out. If this one ever does break, I&#x27;ll gladly by another Solia flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 5/2013**&lt;br /&gt;My original review was written in 2010, after owning this for 2 years. It&#x27;s now been 5 years and it still works great. I&#x27;ve used it almost every other day. Just make sure you use a heat protection product to protect your hair from heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story to show you how resilient this straightener is:&lt;br /&gt;I thought I destroyed it when I took it to another country and didn&#x27;t realize that my power convertor was broken. The straightener got so hot that the plates started sliding off (the inside plastic was melting from the heat). Luckily I unplugged it in time before it completely melted or burned the place down. As I let it cool down, I tried to make the plates set where they were supposed to be in the rare chance that it still would work. I was sure it was going to be a lost cause. That happened in 2011, 2 years ago. I&#x27;m not lying, it still works great in 2013. I will definitely stick with Solia.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is wonderful.  I have the \\&quot;not-enough-curly-nor-enough-straight\\&quot; kind of hair.  If I don&#x27;t blow dry them they are fluffy and I hate this.  This iron works like a charm.  I have bought a few other irons with metal plates and larger plates, butane or electrical, but nothing compares to this iron.  What was taking 1-hour or more to straighten takes now a REAL 10 minutes!  The iron is ready to use within 30 secs and you can adjust the heat between 140F to 450F!!  Ok, don&#x27;t touch the ceramic plate because I promise it is HOT.  I can easily recommend this product.  ONE WARNING:  I read other comments about the iron not working:  take note that this iron WILL work if you plug it in a wall sucket equiped with a RESET like the ones normally installed in the bathroom since this appliance is equiped with one you might have to press the reset button on the iron for it to work. I don&#x27;t know anything about electricity but I have noticed this myself when I tried to use it on such sockets. P.S.  Still love my iron after 4 years and still works great!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a couple of years ago and it it the only straightener that truly straightened my hair (I have naturally very curly hair). About a week ago a stepped on it and it broke which is all my fault and nothing wrong with the product. When this happened I ordered the exact same straightener right away!</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews for this straightener seem to act like it&#x27;s a miracle worker. But it&#x27;s not. While it does straighten my hair with minimal damage (escpially compared to a lot of straighteners that I&#x27;ve used) it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I wished it would. I have shoulder length, thick and wavy hair and it takes me over an hour to straighten, over and over again. That&#x27;s when it&#x27;s dry. It doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s slightly wet, at least not for me. And if it&#x27;s humid out I might as well not use it because my hair just curls right up no matter how many times I straighten my hair. I guess this product really is best when used with good products. If you know what the best products are to use for your hair then this is good because it won&#x27;t ruin your hair the way some flat irons do. But if you thinks this alone will make your hair great, well it won&#x27;t. Eeven when I have it on the highest setting it still doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair the way I want it to. My hair still waves and eventually frizzes up. So just a word of caution for anybody wanting to buy this, you have got to also have a good straightening program going on. Good shampoo, conditioner and a good leave in balm or conditioner especially made for heat straightening.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with how shiny and silky this iron made my hair look and feel. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. It is definitely now part of my daily hair routine.</li>
            <li> My item was shipped fairly quickly and arrived as described in an acceptable amount of time, so no complaints there.      The iron works great - I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it heats up, I turn it on, and 45 seconds later it&#x27;s ready to go.  I works well on my hair which is very thick and wavy, though soft and not at all coarse.  My hair generally takes style well, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for \\&quot;problem\\&quot; hair.  My only worry now is the complaints I&#x27;ve read from others that their irons broke after just a few months.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is so worth the money.  I had my hesitations about spending so much on a flat iron, but I had an iron that I had paid about $40.00 for at a discount store, and the difference between the two is amazing.  My hair felt \\&quot;baked\\&quot; and dried out with the cheap iron. This iron makes my hair smooth and soft.  My only regret- buying the cheap flat iron first.  If you are wavering on purchasing this iron because of the price, DO IT! You will not be disapointed, and your hair will look spectacular!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this particular brand before, but I&#x27;m glad I did! The adjustable heat setting makes a big difference. My hair is pretty fine and so it sometimes gets damaged by the extreme heat of other straighteners. I&#x27;ve been keeping it about 325 degrees and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t drying out so bad. The ceramic / tourmaline plates also help keep my hair healthy. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so i had wanted a new straightener to place my remington wet to straight, which i knew was really damaging my hair even with heat protectant, and saw the solia for a good price on folica (67.99 after discount with a free pouch) and with rave reviews. It worked fine the first couple of days, my hair was silky smooth, pretty straight, and it glided smoothly through my hair. But after about the 3rd day it started snagging my hair? I had never encountered this problem before, even with my previous[..] iron and I was completely dissapointed..i mean come on, im paying about[..]for it on sale!! So i made a quick effort to return it to folica, which is an great website to buy irons at a good prices, and have had no problems. Im placing an order today to buy a sedu, which my friend recommended, it made her hair silky and pin straight, and did not snag her hair. It only will cost me[..]with the [..]off special and free shipping. I give this product 3 stars because it did work great at first...i am thinking mine may have been defective, but i am not going to take that chance.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!! it is perfect! I&#x27;ve owned it for more than 4 years now! it straightens my hair, does not cause static, is hot withint 10 seconds, makes my hair shiny, and best of all no hair damage! I&#x27;ve tried numerous straighteners but this is by far the best!! money well spent!</li>
            <li> Have fried my hair by perming then straightening within 2 weeks. Was skeptical about product but read the reviews and tried it out. This product is amazing, simply magical! It heated up in less than 3 minutes, then fixed my hair in less than 5! My kind of gadget. Thanks for the previous reviews which convinced me to try it! Hope this one convinces someone in need of help as I was!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  I have thick and kinky hair and have never had much success taming it.  I also hate curling my hair due to the time it takes.  This wonderful iron straightens my hair and removes the frizz and kinks, and I can curl the bottom with one motion.  I even use it on my not completely dry hair and it never burns.  I was very skeptical and hesitant to spend that much but, considering how much I have spent on other irons and products, this is a bargain!  I am recommending it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> the solia ceramic flat iron was everything i expected it to be !!!!!! i loooooooooove this product i had about 6 flat irons over the years including a chi and this is wayyyyy better than any other. it makes my hair so silk and soft it just looks healthier , also it doesnt fry my hair and stay straight for a loooong time :D</li>
            <li> Simply put, for the money you will not find a better flat-iron. The temp-adjust works great and while blue plates may scare off the average Chi customer, this thing easily outperforms a Chi at the same price. The only thing I don&#x27;t like was the plasticky area around the temperature adjust, makes it seem more toy-ish. But the grip is just the right size and texture and weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned anything but cheap straightening irons so this one is a real treat. It heats up very quickly and stays hot.  My hair is always shiny when I am finished.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I had ordered my Solia flat iron and when it came, it did not work. I tried everything and the iron never got hot. I was so disgusted because I spent a good amount of money and I got nothing out of it. So I called up customer service and they said they would replace it free of charge. I sent it back, and within 4 days my new iron came. My hair is naturally very wavy and stubborn when I try to change it. This iron is fabulous! It completely straightens my hair in less than 8 minutes. It feels very silky when I&#x27;m done, and because it has a wide range of heat selection, you can put it on a lower heat for bangs so that you don&#x27;t damage them. Even though you may think a more expensive one is better, this is not always true. That fact cleary comes about as soon as you try this flat iron. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Previous to purchasing this item, I did a fair amount of research. On a website of flat iron reviews, this iron was rated number 2. I purchased it because of the damp/dry functionality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The iron is SOOO easy to use! I&#x27;m able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s long/thick hair in about 15 min. The consistant heat level is very impressive, as is the quick initial heating speed! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do forward one MAJOR caution. As the iron can be used on damp hair, be careful in placing the iron near the scalp, as the release of steam may burst back toward the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two Solia flat irons in the past two years and both of them just stopped working. The first lasted for about 9 months and the other (which didn&#x27;t come on this morning &amp; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m online searching for another one) I think I&#x27;ve had for about 1 year. I didn&#x27;t drop them or abuse them in any way and I was very happy with the straightening quality, but I&#x27;ll not purchase another Solia again. However, I do wonder if that&#x27;s just the nature of flat irons. I guess I&#x27;ll find out after trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year since I purchased this Solia hair straightener from Folica through Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and without any hassle.    I was skeptical about spending close to $100 (it was on sale for $88) on a hair straightener.  In the past I have used my $20 Babyliss steam shot straighteners, and they worked, but nothing fancy.  My hairdresser managed to convince me that the money would be well spent after using some fancy salon straighteners on my hair.  After trying this Solia out myself, I was sold.  These heat up very quickly.  They have the varying temperature so you can choose how much heat you supply to your hair, which is useful to prevent damage.  I have not used them on damp hair, so I cannot make a claim about that, but on dry hair they work great.  You certainly can use it to curl your hair, although I am not very good at it yet, but I am more concerned with getting my hair straight.  I use them 5-6 times a week, and have not had any problems.    In short, I am very impressed by these straighteners.  They work, and they work really, really well!  They were well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Failed me on the second USE.  Snagged hair a little.  Biggest complaint is that instead of being able to leave it on 180 and get nice results like the first use, I had to turn it up to between 250 and 320.  At 180 it didn&#x27;t even feel like it was really on, more like after you&#x27;ve turned it off and it&#x27;s cooling down.      It also doesn&#x27;t open wide enough for the blind straightening I have to do at the back of my head.  But that may have just taken some getting used to.    I&#x27;m leaning toward really liking the Remington Shine Therapy right now.  Still up in the air.    I&#x27;m shipping the Solia back to Folica tomorrow for refund--no replacement, no repair.  At my expense, of course :(    Ideally, I won&#x27;t have to escalate with my credit card issuer.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome flat iron that works with all types of hair - my mom and I both have one and she has very thick hair and I have very thin hair. My hair tends to be frizzy and have a lot of fly-aways, but this straightener smooths hair without the need of any products. While using this, my hair doesn&#x27;t go frizzy in rainy or humid weather either. It heats up very quickly, even on the hottest setting. Great product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> i bought it few years ago , and that was one of the best choices</li>
            <li> i have wavy, dry, thick hair that goes about half way down my back and chest. i bought this iron because of it&#x27;s awesome review on [...] but i wish i read into other reviews first. i don&#x27;t like this iron because i feel like it never gets hot. it goes up to 420 degrees, i believe, but i feel like the plates are never hot and i need to go over certain parts of my hair four or five times. also, in a couple hours my hair starts to get wavy again. i would never recommend this iron to someone i hated! but.. the iron makes AWESOME barrel curls, which is why i give it three stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter.  My biggest concern about buying the iron was making sure that it wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;fry&#x27; her waist length hair and that she would be able to use it without any help.  No problem with either.  I like that it has a temperature control so that she can decide how hot it needs to be depending on how curly her hair is and how straight she wants it on any given day.  Works well enough that we can get out of the house in the mornings without the &#x27;hair fights&#x27;!:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron for my wife as one of her Birthday presents. In the past she was always disatisfied with lesser quality items and placed this Solia iron on her wish list. Well it was a big hit with her, she loves the ceramic plates that do a much better job than the other irons she tried.  From a husbands point of view it was a hit with my wife, she thanks me for this iron evey time she uses it, so it&#x27;s a win-win senerio all around. You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a quality, well made product that should last for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have owned my Solia for over 4 years. In middle school I had very oily hair that later turned very dry..like a pile of hay and all i could do was tie it up. When high school hit I bought a solia. I&#x27;m asian with naturally wavy hair, and after using this iron for a year instead of a cheap one my hair felt amazing. Since then I used it every night before school and when I wake up the next morning my hair was still straight. For those reviews who claimed thattheir Solia broke down in only a couple of months I head future buyers to beware of buying a flat iron from unknown sources on ebay or amazon or any of the like. Unless it came from Solia.com there is always a chance it is a counterfit. I am using my same solia from 4 years ago, going on 5 and of course I have dropped it but only on carpet not tiled floors or anything because anything assembled together will fall apart if u drop it on a hard floor. the only thing that fell apart are the logos on the side. I love it, but I will only buy something if it is legit, and mine was legit.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener off of amazon almost a year ago. (It was the one that came with the free heat proof pouch, however. Same straightener though.)  I have to say I LOVE this thing. The biggest difference that stood out to me between my Solia and my Conair was that the Solia doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. You know how the cheaper ones, you&#x27;ll run them through your hair and it&#x27;ll snag? I hate that. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often, so I can&#x27;t comment on if it is more or less damaging, but I will say that I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair being dry at all after using this. (The only time I had that problem was with a heat spray whose first ingredient was alcohol.)  All through high school I would use some type of straightener from Walmart, and even if I hardly used them, they&#x27;d always stop working around the one year mark. Not this one! It&#x27;s still going strong. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and definitely adds some shine.</li>
            <li> My daughter received the Solia straightener for Christmas.  She really enjoys using it.  She likes the fact that she can control the heat settings.  Amazon is always very efficient with the items we order from them.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews on different web sites before purchasing this. I decided this was a fair price for a flat iron. It has both the Tourmaline and ceramic Ion technology that I wanted to protect my hair. The others I looked where the chi and sedu but were very expensive. I &#x27;ve used this a few times and Im happy the way my curls come out. i use it to do soft waves on my hair. Heats up quickly and it has a temperature control so you can control how hot it get. Im happy with it.</li>
            <li> After 4 years my Solia flat iron is amazing.  It is sleek, attractive, and works like a charm. Heats up very quickly and gets hot enough to straighten hair very effectively. It makes me very impatient with drugstore flat irons and curlers.  I have very thick hair and yet can work through it quite quickly.  I recently figured out how to make curls with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets very hot!&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable temperature (I always stay up at 450 degrees because it works the best for straightening)&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up quick&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek and Attractive&lt;br /&gt;-Straighten, curl, or otherwise style&lt;br /&gt;-Durable&lt;br /&gt;-Cord connection to body of straightener swivels so your cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets a little hot on the outside, but that&#x27;s to be expected... just don&#x27;t leave your hands in the middle of the barrel for too long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this straightener is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> As far as the iron goes it works very well.  I am Hispanic and chemically straighten my hair every six months.  Usually I wash, condition, and dry my hair with rollers for an hour followed by another half hour of blow drying to get it straight.  The process usually takes two hours at the salon and I never even attempt to do it at home.  Two of my friends own this iron and recommended it to me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I received my iron on Tuesday evening and 1 hour later my hair was straight.  I washed and conditioned my hair as usual, then put some John Frieda Frizz Ease in it and divided it into five sections.  I used my blow dryer only to get the excess water out of my hair.  Then I divided each section into three and went through each section with the iron.  An hour later I had straight hair!  Never in my life have I been able to do my own hair at home without a professional and have it look good.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this iron but not for daily use, because applying any kind of heat (iron, blow dryer, rollers, hot comb) to any type of hair everyday will cause damage.  I have used it twice since I received it, once a week is enough for me. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly, thick hair. It usually takes me over 2 hours to blow it out (by myself, so I hardly ever do it). With this iron it took about an hour, and I didnt even blow it out first. I just put in some leave-in conditioner, gloss cream, blow-dried it (cause I dont totally trust the wet to dry feature). And then I ran the iron through. Its the BEST iron I&#x27;ve ever had, and I hope it lasts a long,long time.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for a little more than 2 years.  Before it I had tried every drugstore/department store cheap-o brand as well as an expensive chi model.  None of them really got my hair as pin straight as I wanted, and I have straight hair to begin with, though it tends to have a wave especially when I first wake up.  Finally after reading many reviews on a salon product website, I ordered this Solia flat iron.  The great thing about this iron, is that you can set the temperature.  Learning which temperature is right for your hair is a bit of a process (if you see your hair smoking...definitely too high!) but it&#x27;s great to have the option to have it on a low temp. and minimize the risk of damage to your hair.  This iron also heats up very, very quickly...great for when you&#x27;re running late.    Of course, pairing any iron with a thermal (heat) protection spray would be optimal. After using this nearly daily for over two years, my hair is still undamaged (at least to the naked eye). I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have just started straightening my wavy hair this year, and bought a cheapie flat iron at Target to try it out.  BIG MISTAKE.  I had to keep the iron up at the highest level to get any kind of results, and I have fine, dry hair and could tell it was already starting to dull and break due to the iron.  I received the Solia for Christmas, and have had a complete 180 degree experience from the cheapie.  This iron heats up super-quickly, and my wavy, dull hair comes out looking great - straight, but best of all, shiny!  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I now believe all my friends who have told me that you really need to use a GOOD, QUALITY flat iron if you want results without serious damage to your hair.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair.  I love to straighten my hair (looks good on me and I get tons of compliments), but have had a hard time fixing my hair with my new time constraints as a mom.  I had a cheap &amp; old (10+ years) flat iron that finally fell to it&#x27;s death on the bathroom floor.  Lucky for me, I got great advice from my hair stylist and a good friend.  They encouraged me to invest in a ceramic iron.  After reading reviews, I decided on this Solia ceramic &amp; tourmaline iron.  Paired with the Chi silk infusion product, I have smooth and shiny hair again.  The difference is that it takes 5 minutes to straighten all of my long thick hair compared to the 20 minutes I spent with my old iron.  My stylist told me that the cheap irons lose their ability to get hot after a period of time and when you have thick hair with curls, you need max heat.</li>
            <li> I tried this straightener twice and do not like it at all!! I liked that the straightener had a temp dial and didn&#x27;t expect t have to use it on high all the time, but I do. The outside of the straightener heats up pretty much the same as the plates on the inside which means the only place to hold it is on the handle. Most other straighteners  have an area you can put your fingers on the open end so you are able to use two hands, this one you can&#x27;t with out being burned. It is also impossible to get right down to the roots of the hair because the plates are so close to the edge of the straightener that I end up burning my head. I am very disappointed for the price and expected a lot more because it was rated so god online.</li>
            <li> this is a great product! heats up fast, cools down quick. i&#x27;ve had it for 5 years and it still works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. I only have to do one pass on each section of hair. My hair is straight all day even in high humidity. No snagging, no pulling my hair, it is very smooth. The reason for 4 stars is I was a little suprised at how high I had to turn up the temperature so that this would straighten my hair in one pass. I have very fine, shoulder length hair. I just use a thermal protection spray so that my hair is not damaged by the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a better straightner for a while and so i decided to start looking. my hair is only a midly wavey at the bottom and other then that it&#x27;s pretty thin, on th ick at the ends. the thing is, since i have such boring hair one of my only options is to wear it straight so i frequently do. with a normal straightner this is very damaging but the ceramic ones are incredible. they keep your hair healthy. so this is what i had heard and why i had wanted on. i didn&#x27;t need anything so super-duper. i still wished i could purchase the 200 dollar ones because i thought they&#x27;d be so amazing, but supprisingly some of them go bad reviews. i found that this straightner had all great reviews and also was not TOO expensive. my parents freaked out when i told them the price still, so i offered to pay half and they thought that would be ok, so that was good. i was very excited to get it. i recieved it very fast too. i immediatly tried it out and was amazed by the results. my hair was incredibly straight, smooth, and shiny. it only took me about ten minutes. it is very easy to manuever and the size is also great. my hair is about three inches below my shoulders so i thought that it might take longer to straighten but it didn&#x27;t. it also works good on my bangs. i also looooooove that you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to warm up, there&#x27;s instant heat! it also worked on my damp hair which is good because it will save time not having to blow dry my hair completely. all in all i think this was a nessacary purchase and i would reccomend it to anyone. &#x3D;)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;hope this helped.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair with a dryer for years.  Someone in a salon used this on me and I was stunned at the silky results.  The price turned me off, but then again, I have NEVER gotten results like this with the $20 regular iron from the department store.  A friend knew how much I adored this, but didn&#x27;t want to drop the cash, and got it for me as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has now become an indispensible part of my hair regimen.  I usually blow dry my mid-back length hair with a dryer, since that&#x27;s pretty fast, but I can be kind of careless about it because I follow up with this iron.  I section my hair and get it super smooth and shiny with this iron.  I love the small plate size because I can roll the hair around the edge of the iron and get it to curl under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my hair going for days.  I can just freshen it up with the iron, no need to dry my hair out by washing and blow drying every single day.  If I come in contact with a little rain and get frizzy, I just touch up with the iron.  I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no heat-up required with this.  I plug it in and it is ready to go in a matter of seconds.  The variable heat settings are great.  I use a lower one and I&#x27;ve never needed to go to the top end of the range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who takes pains to straighten their hair.  You&#x27;ll wonder how you lived without this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many flat irons in the past. (Beware of anything by Advanced Beauty Solutions - they are scamming people with their true ceramic pro flat iron!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried the cheap walmart bought irons and the very expensive irons. Cheap irons tend to fry hair and pull it out or break it. Some of the expensive ones broke easily and the companies customer service sucked! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I recieved my Solia within a week of ordering, everything looked just as it should and it works great! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; My only complaint is that the Solia is 1.5lbs, which can tire you hands easily when you are styling your hair. But honestly...I think even if it is on the heavy side, it works great and I would purchase it all over again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I have heard some reviews where the Solia has stopped working within a few months of purchase, unfortunately, this is common with any electronical device. The best way to make sure yours does not stop working is: do not leave the iron on for excessive amounts of time. Anytime you are done with the iron, turn it off and unplug it. Make sure it is left in an area where it can cool off easily. This flat iron takes about 20seconds to heat up, so it does not waste your time to unplug and have to reheat. &lt;br /&gt; Also, try to never drop or bang your ceramic iron around. It can easily damage connections inside of the iron! &lt;br /&gt;  Keep all of your purchase information and the box that it comes in with the address of the company. As soon as you see any faults call them immediately and demand for it to be addressed! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When using this product, you need to use heat protection products. Some people can use this more often, for example I blowdry and straighten my hair every day and I have very healthy shiny hair. I have very healthy hair to begin with... I have hardly ever colored it and always took great care of it. People who have dry and damaged hair should not use this product as frequently! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I use therma silk products - leave in conditioners that protect against heat styling and I also use Tressumae (sp?) this are good cheap products if you don&#x27;t want to waste alot of money on hair care products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I also use moisterizing conditioners and shampoos. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have gone through my share of flat irons.  Some were very cheap and some were ridiculously expensive, however, no matter the cost, I was never satisfied.  The Solia is the best flat iron I have ever owned!  I have very long, very thick, very wavy hair and with this iron, it only take me 10 minutes to perfectly straighten my hair.  It heats up fast and maintains it&#x27;s heat while I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like other flat irons seemed to always do; it glides smoothly, and the size allows me to get close to the scalp without burning myself.  My hair stays straight and shiny all day long.  I absolutely love it and plan on buying two more for my mom and sister!</li>
            <li> Mine worked really, really well... until its circuits cooked themselves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this was just one of those times where you get a \\&quot;bad apple\\&quot; from what is normally a good product, but I sure as hell didn&#x27;t buy a second one to find out.</li>
            <li> I have been using FHI Heat irons for a couple of years now. FHI Heat irons seal my ends and make my hair supershiny and sleek. The compliments never end when I use these. I&#x27;m an African American with a nice grade of thick medium length hair. People think it&#x27;s a wig sometimes after I straighten it.    I heard good things about the Solia irons and decided to try something different. The Solia hair irons make my hair dull and don&#x27;t seal the ends like the FHI irons seem to do. They make my hair look unfinished. My ends look frayed and raggedy and the shine isn&#x27;t there. I am returning this product asap.</li>
            <li> The speed of the delivery shocked me. I ordered it before going on vacation and figured it would arrive when I arrived back home, but it arrived the day I left, which was two days after I ordered it. and I used standard shipping! I however left before the product arrived, but was still pleased with the promptness. The product is great. It is the lightest flat iron I have ever held. Usually my arm are killing me when I&#x27;m only 1/3 way through my hair (I have a lot of hair. and very very thick hair). It also heats up nicely so I don&#x27;t waste any time waiting around for it to get hot. I like the different heat settings so my hair doesn&#x27;t get fried. It does work on damp hair, but I only use it on dry hair because the sizzling still makes me cringe. The swivel cord is great; I never have to get tangled up again! I&#x27;m still working towards getting those perfect curls. It does curl hair though, with only one flip of the wrist which is amazing. The only negative aspect is the outside (black) shell, which appears to made of cheap material. It&#x27;s dull-looking and makes me think it&#x27;s going to fall apart easily. I still think it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I still use this after so many years! Great product! Absolutely no complaints! I would purchase it as a gift as well!</li>
            <li> This unit works well! Best flat iron they have ever owned! Its about a year that I gifted this to someone and they still use it daily!</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now and still working perfectly. I like that you can set the temperature so if you can select as much heat as you need to get the job done, depending on your hair type.</li>
