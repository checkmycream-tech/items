            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seemed to me that it was more of a root lifter than anything else, but I discontinued using because it caused my scalp to break out.</li>
            <li>love nexxus.</li>
            <li>but I will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li>Tried many alter ego ,Salerm but this stuff is the truth if u have dandruff thinning hair</li>
            <li>The scalp cream smelled awesome and was easy to apply when hair was wet.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this shampoo, my thinning hair was becoming more visible.  </li>
            <li>I always use shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different shampoos for thinning hair and to be honest, I haven&#x27;t liked ANY of them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self is worth it.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I switched back to ole&#x27; faithful, Pantene, and hair is shiny again and looks more full.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>After which I hope to see some positive results.</li>
            <li>But this really seems to&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>or so I noticed that I am not loosing so much hair like I was.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked greasy by the end of the day and the tangles were just too much to deal.</li>
            <li>made my hair very greasy</li>

            <li>This product is great and actually growing the thin areas of my hair.</li>
            <li>a product designed to help the scalp and hair does the exact opposite for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s took early to notice any new growth but the shampoo</li>
            <li>I have not noticed anything thus far</li>
            <li>knocked the fallout back considerably.</li>
            <li>But since he started using this, he barely sheds at all.  </li>

            <li> I tried this a few times and can&#x27;t really judge it on long term.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, my hair was left dry and crunchy feeling.  </li>
            <li> After a few months I realized my scalp was itchy and irritated and my dermatologist noticed I have contact dermatitis (red blistery patches on my skin).</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel harsh and dry</li>
            <li> and I have seen less hair when shampooing.</li>

            <li> and I had so much trouble that I never used it again.</li>
            <li> this leave in stuff did not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is growing faster though..will have to wait a little longer.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable that</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, processed and breakage</li>
            <li> Not happy with them selling a 2for1 as 2 items!!!!</li>
            <li> And the scalp treatment just makes hair oily &amp; dirty feeling to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have been desperate to find something that would help stabilize the fallout I am going through</li>
            <li> I had to use leave in conditioner for it to not cause my hair to break when I combed it, even with the conditioner, my hair was not shiny and had a terrible texture.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product... Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Not happy with them selling a 2for1 as 2 items!!!! Like shampoo, but it  has not improved my hair at all. And the scalp treatment just makes hair oily &amp; dirty feeling to the touch. Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been desperate to find something that would help stabilize the fallout I am going through right now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just stress, or something with my health. Runs in my family too. But this really seems to&lt;br /&gt;have knocked the fallout back considerably.</li>
            <li> Nice pair to see if it works for you. It did for me, and now I&#x27;m buying the larger bottles. If your hair is thinning/receding, give Nexxus a try as one of your first-lines of defense.</li>
            <li> This product is great and actually growing the thin areas of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see results of this product after 2 weeks of use.  I have not noticed anything thus far but I remain hopeful.  Given more time I hope this will give the results I have been looking for.  I dislike the fact that the shampoo does not lather up,  makes my hair feel harsh and dry but I will continue to use this product until it depletes. After which I hope to see some positive results.</li>
            <li> NEXXUS BIOTIN SHAMPOO AND SCALP CREME COMBO SET IS HELPING MY THINNING HAIR. MY EDGES ARE FILLING IN SO NICELY ON MY SCALP. I USED THIS YEARS AGO AND I WAS LOOKING FOR IT IN THE STORES AND THEY HAD IMITATIONS. I LOVE THE SMELL OF THE SHAMPOO AND CREME AND THE RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALMARINE THE REDEEMED</li>
            <li> Works well.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo.  It soothes my scalp whenever it feels irritated.  It is drying so I do a deep condition and oil treatment afterward.</li>
            <li> I like the scalp mask and I have seen less hair when shampooing. It is too soon to see any type of growth but hopeful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have thinning around the hair line and this seems to be bringing the fuzz back.</li>
            <li> I always use shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate free. Everyone pushes biotin for hair so I tried it. End result my hair was so tangled and I had so much trouble that I never used it again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a while and seemed to have great results. After a few months I realized my scalp was itchy and irritated and my dermatologist noticed I have contact dermatitis (red blistery patches on my skin). I then did research and realized these two products have propylene glycol and EDTA in them....both which are well known irritants to the skin. Unbelievable that a product designed to help the scalp and hair does the exact opposite for me. Never buying this again.</li>
            <li> I began using the product and after a week or so I noticed that I am not loosing so much hair like I was.  I believe the product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this shampoo, my thinning hair was becoming more visible.  I&#x27;ve tried several different shampoos for thinning hair and to be honest, I haven&#x27;t liked ANY of them.  With this shampoo, my hair was left dry and crunchy feeling.

The scalp cream smelled awesome and was easy to apply when hair was wet.  It seemed to me that it was more of a root lifter than anything else, but I discontinued using because it caused my scalp to break out. I switched back to ole&#x27; faithful, Pantene, and hair is shiny again and looks more full.</li>
            <li> My hair feels sooo healthy, never felt like this before! I wash my hair every week with it and it looks great!  love nexxus.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times and can&#x27;t really judge it on long term. It makes my hair a tangled mess. And conditioner is a MUST for me .. this leave in stuff did not fit the bill. My hair looked greasy by the end of the day and the tangles were just too much to deal. I have thick hair, processed and breakage is an issue now that i have hypothyroid. I might use it every so often just to kill off the bottle but I will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to hair, nice softness and shine too.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and my hair seems fuller. Nexus makes a great line of products. It&#x27;s took early to notice any new growth but the shampoo it&#x27;s self is worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff totally works.  My hubs takes medicine that causes him to shed hair at a faster rate.  But since he started using this, he barely sheds at all.  Totally user friendly, and shipped fast, too.  Just do it.</li>
            <li> made my hair very greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and scalp creme for 6 weeks, I have not seen any improvements on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Tried many alter ego ,Salerm but this stuff is the truth if u have dandruff thinning hair</li>
            <li> Only the shampoo was delivered,disappointed</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely softer and more manageable. Not sure if it is growing faster though..will have to wait a little longer.</li>
