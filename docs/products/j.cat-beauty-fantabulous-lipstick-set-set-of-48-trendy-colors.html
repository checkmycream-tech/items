            <li>They really are beautiful.</li>
            <li>These lipsticks go on very smooth and creamy with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy to pick out the color, which is nice because there&#x27;s so many in this</li>

            <li>I saw way more Pros</li>
            <li>.. love the color they have</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see this as a problem since there&#x27;s so many in the set</li>
            <li>I put mine in a square make up case with a flip top lid</li>
            <li>i really w enjoyed the variety I received for the price.</li>
            <li>but I like how most of them look.</li>
            <li>This is a really good set up lipstick if you want some variety and fun.</li>
            <li>I did love the variety of colors, which is why I gave 2 stars, but I still am returning this.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be much better lipstick than I thought it might be.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>and there is plenty of product for many uses as well.</li>
            <li>They end up smashing into the top of the lid or around the edges.</li>
            <li>And then I can&#x27;t put it on without ruining it more.</li>
            <li>If you have a lipstick brush that might be more beneficial but i haven&#x27;t gotten one yet.</li>
            <li>Love the lipsticks..</li>
            <li>The colors, for the most part, are true to what they look like and they have a heavenly cake batter sort of smell as well, which is amazing compared to</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t fond of the colors with glitter in them but all the others were a pretty good formula.</li>
            <li>Some are more pigmented than others but they have all gone on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>The nudes are absolutely gorgeous, the variety is amazing, none were doubled by mistake, and only one broke.</li>
            <li>Easy To Break</li>
            <li>All the lipsticks go one nice, cover well, last awhile, and feel good not waxy or anything like that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine) and</li>
            <li>and they went on so smooth.</li>
            <li>and they go on smooth..</li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting it to feel and apply really cheap-</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I got the whole set because there were colors in each pack I liked.</li>
            <li>Great selection of colors and they last when applied!!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the good quality of the lipsticks because I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the J Cat brand.</li>
            <li>I opened all of them immediately to check for any damage or melting (I love in a hot climate)</li>
            <li>All the other lipsticks were in perfect condition and in place in the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great set for anyone wanting a big variety of lipstick shades to choose from and wants a quality matte lipstick</li>
            <li>For the price the quality is great and they don&#x27;t dry the lips.</li>
            <li>I never would have tried if I had had to pay full price</li>
            <li>These lipsticks worked good the only thing i found</li>
            <li>I am very well enjoying this product</li>
            <li>The variety of shades is very good - everything from bright and deep reds to pale pinks and corals, and everything in between.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great set for anyone wanting a big variety of lipstick shades to choose from and wants a quality matte lipstick too.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Colors and quantity are very pretty, and I have used it as gift giving.  </li>
            <li>These colors aren&#x27;t kid dress up colors; they are sophisticated normal lipstick colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I high recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing about these lipsticks are that they break and twist so easily, but it&#x27;s so cheap that maybe the make up packaging is cheap too..</li>
            <li>Some colors are more pigmented than others but that also gives you a chance to play with different mixtures to fine an infinite number of color combinations.</li>
            <li>But it was a fun purchase for me.</li>
            <li>honestly, I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used up a lipstick all the way to the end.</li>
            <li>Again, it was $1.00 per lipstick so its worth it.</li>
            <li>There are far more colors I like than colors I dislike.</li>
            <li>Definitly worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for anyone who likes to use a variety of lipstick shades and try out new colors without the price of a single lipstick.</li>
            <li>In hindsight I probably should have just ordered the 5 lipsticks I did like and spent more money because I most likely will give most of these away.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s been the perfect way to store them, especially because the clear center on the tubes makes finding the desired shade pretty fast and easy to</li>
            <li>I bought this set because I wanted to experiment with a lot of different colors, hoping I&#x27;d find something more exciting than the lipstick color I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased it from kolorize me, and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I would not push the tube up unless you really have to!</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors and the product came on time with no problems</li>
            <li>Beautiful long lasting pigments I absolutely adore them.</li>
            <li>personally* think its worth it!!</li>
            <li>The colors are really attractive - there is a wide range of shimmer or matte or creamy, in lots of different fashionable shades.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole set in order to experiment with different shades since there are so many.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even some unique colors such as a shimmery golden tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and feels much nicer than what I&#x27;ve been using up to now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that I really like this</li>
            <li>Shipping was so unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li>I wish they have more of a darker color, reddish than pink.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much pressure to put it on.</li>
            <li>These were better than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>only 2 I don&#x27;t like and my 7 year old daughter is gladly taking them off my hands for her play makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Some will be blended with others to make a less &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; shade, but overall good variety.</li>
            <li>These are BRAND new ladies!</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying a new one every day!  </li>
            <li>What I particularly like is, I&#x27;m finding that colors</li>
            <li>so many different shades to suit different clients</li>
            <li>With these new colors, I&#x27;ve only tried eight so far, but I think it&#x27;s worth it from just the first eight...</li>
            <li>A huge variety of colors, some I didnt like, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>I was looking for new colors to experiment with without breaking the bank</li>
            <li>None of the lipsticks were damaged and were new in the boxes (6 to a box).</li>
            <li>Received 6 of one exact same color.</li>
            <li>The colors are great as well, there are only a few odd colors.</li>
            <li>Be warned, a large majority of these are ones you will never wear, but some come out different than you think.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors are a little harder for me to apply but they are still nice.</li>
            <li>Fixing it took maybe 20 seconds, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s just not a problem.</li>
            <li>the only thing is they break easily-so be gentle.</li>
            <li>I have tried 8 so far and</li>
            <li>So far 50% of the lipsticks have detached inside their tubes.</li>
            <li>Each lipstick tube is full sized, however the lipstick inside is about half the size.</li>
            <li>Decent lipsticks but actual stick is a bit shorter than some drugstore name brands.</li>
            <li>but generally i like the texture you can wear it matte or add a gloss to it</li>
            <li>I wish ALL lipstick tubes were made this way so that the  shade color is clear visible and it&#x27;s the actual lipstick instead of a color sticker at the end of a tube.</li>
            <li>I will give you a big warning though, because one of the 1st ingredients is bees wax, they are really soft.</li>
            <li>So no complaints about the size (just be aware that they&#x27;re half sized sticks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>lipstick tube is clear in the middle so that the actual lipstick shows through.</li>

            <li> The colors are really attractive - there is a wide range of shimmer or matte or creamy, in lots of different fashionable shades.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole set in order to experiment with different shades since there are so many.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even some unique colors such as a shimmery golden tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and feels much nicer than what I&#x27;ve been using up to now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that I really like this</li>
            <li> Shipping was so unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li> I wish they have more of a darker color, reddish than pink.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much pressure to put it on.</li>
            <li> These were better than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> only 2 I don&#x27;t like and my 7 year old daughter is gladly taking them off my hands for her play makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Some will be blended with others to make a less &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; shade, but overall good variety.</li>
            <li> These are BRAND new ladies!</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying a new one every day!  </li>
            <li> What I particularly like is, I&#x27;m finding that colors</li>
            <li> so many different shades to suit different clients</li>
            <li> With these new colors, I&#x27;ve only tried eight so far, but I think it&#x27;s worth it from just the first eight...</li>
            <li> A huge variety of colors, some I didnt like, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new colors to experiment with without breaking the bank</li>
            <li> None of the lipsticks were damaged and were new in the boxes (6 to a box).</li>
            <li> Received 6 of one exact same color.</li>
            <li> The colors are great as well, there are only a few odd colors.</li>
            <li> Be warned, a large majority of these are ones you will never wear, but some come out different than you think.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are a little harder for me to apply but they are still nice.</li>
            <li> Fixing it took maybe 20 seconds, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s just not a problem.</li>
            <li> the only thing is they break easily-so be gentle.</li>
            <li> I have tried 8 so far and</li>
            <li> So far 50% of the lipsticks have detached inside their tubes.</li>
            <li> Each lipstick tube is full sized, however the lipstick inside is about half the size.</li>
            <li> Decent lipsticks but actual stick is a bit shorter than some drugstore name brands.</li>
            <li> but generally i like the texture you can wear it matte or add a gloss to it</li>
            <li> I wish ALL lipstick tubes were made this way so that the  shade color is clear visible and it&#x27;s the actual lipstick instead of a color sticker at the end of a tube.</li>
            <li> I will give you a big warning though, because one of the 1st ingredients is bees wax, they are really soft.</li>
            <li> So no complaints about the size (just be aware that they&#x27;re half sized sticks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> lipstick tube is clear in the middle so that the actual lipstick shows through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t last long at all,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this item because usually u get what u pay for but this is beyond high quality.</li>
            <li> I would have rather spent 40 bucks on only 2 colors somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry your lips out</li>
            <li> All I did was push it gently back down into the ground holder, but now it looks all messed up.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks came in white boxes of 6, the shipping box was packed tight with protection wraps.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the lipsticks keep breaking away on the inside of the tube which is super frustrating.</li>
            <li> some were a little soft at the bottom which caused a few to crack off</li>
            <li> but I still use it ,you have to be careful not to push the lipstick</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of doing that with a red, I pushed the tube up half way, pressed it to my lips to apply, and snap!</li>
            <li> The colors are not as thick as I would like and does not last that long.</li>
            <li> other lipstick smells.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were broken when delivered - which I expected, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> There are several nude colors I won&#x27;t do but only 2 wear broken</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> one complaint is that, while other reviewers here describe them as arriving in little cardboard box packs, mine all came just loose in a padded shipping bag, which was then inside the Amazon box.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the lids crack and break, making a mess out of everything</li>
            <li> I was a little too forceful while applying a couple times and broke 2 of them.</li>
            <li> I went a little over board</li>
            <li> I expected cheap lipstick for the price, but they aren&#x27;t bad!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a drawback, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s not important to me.  </li>
            <li> Only one came broken</li>
            <li> I have all of the really expensive brands but u can only buy 1 or 2 at a time when they are $30 each.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: The lipsticks are packaged in six small lightweight cardboard boxes that are wrapped together with plastic packaging wrap.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I just received this package of lipstick and, because I read about the problems some other reviewers have had, I went through them one-by-one, checked to see if they were broken, and laid them out by number to check for duplicates.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for cheap product and horrible pay off.</li>
            <li> I would bet that the few broken lipsticks I had were damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> After tapping the tube slightly the lipstick fell down into the base of the tube and stayed put.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER they are a bit tough to push up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s something frustrating of shipping.</li>
            <li> Some of them were broken and didn&#x27;t have the names on them.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lipstick is poor.  </li>
            <li> Out of the 48 that I received, three of the lipsticks themselves were broken, none of the plastic lipstick tubes were broken, and I had no duplicates.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very chalky and not creamy, it&#x27;s the worst</li>
            <li> and I had to pry it down so that it re-attached to the base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two of the lipsticks were separated from the base of the tube and slightly stuck up in the cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> But having to throw away 4 out of 44 isn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the quality!  </li>
            <li> But very bad break</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Horrible do not</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than I expected:) I am very happy happy happy:)</li>
            <li> I like the product but the lids crack and break, making a mess out of everything</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I wanted to experiment with a lot of different colors, hoping I&#x27;d find something more exciting than the lipstick color I&#x27;ve been using for years. With these new colors, I&#x27;ve only tried eight so far, but I think it&#x27;s worth it from just the first eight...and I&#x27;ve got 40 more to go!  What I particularly like is, I&#x27;m finding that colors I never would have tried if I had had to pay full price are actually surprisingly pleasing. I&#x27;m going to wear each of these colors lots. Also, something else worth mentioning, the &amp;#34;lip feel&amp;#34; is delightful.  It&#x27;s creamy and feels much nicer than what I&#x27;ve been using up to now.  I fully expect to be buying only J. cat lipsticks from now on, not just cause of the colors, but also because how they feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And BTW, I don&#x27;t know anybody at J. cat.  It&#x27;s just that I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a drawback, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s not important to me.  One of the colors I tried had the lipstick itself  stuck to the cap of the lipstick and I had to pry it down so that it re-attached to the base. Fixing it took maybe 20 seconds, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s just not a problem.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get 48 lipsticks and I got 32 lip glosses instead. I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> These lipsticks worked good the only thing i found some were a little soft at the bottom which caused a few to crack off but generally i like the texture you can wear it matte or add a gloss to it,i would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Colors and quantity are very pretty, and I have used it as gift giving.  Most of the colors are for more light-skinned or peach complexions.  But it was a fun purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this item because usually u get what u pay for but this is beyond high quality. I have all of the really expensive brands but u can only buy 1 or 2 at a time when they are $30 each. These blew them out if the water!!! When I tried one my lips felt so moisturized and they went on so smooth. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. I know what the ladies on my family will be getting for Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> These products are awesome!! Some of the colors were broken when delivered - which I expected, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. But having to throw away 4 out of 44 isn&#x27;t bad at all! Plus, there are so many colors you won&#x27;t even care. The colors, for the most part, are true to what they look like and they have a heavenly cake batter sort of smell as well, which is amazing compared to other lipstick smells. I am very well enjoying this product and I high recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I am SO happy I made the splurge to buy these lipsticks!! I took my time and read the comments on here, and watched youtube reviews on the company J.cat. I saw way more Pros then Cons to I decided to buy this. I *personally* think its worth it!! The lipsticks came in white boxes of 6, the shipping box was packed tight with protection wraps. I opened all of them immediately to check for any damage or melting (I love in a hot climate) Thankfully ALL the lipstick was in perfect shape. None were melted, stuck to the ceiling, or even had cracked cases. These are BRAND new ladies! I will give you a big warning though, because one of the 1st ingredients is bees wax, they are really soft. I would not push the tube up unless you really have to! I made the mistake of doing that with a red, I pushed the tube up half way, pressed it to my lips to apply, and snap! The lipstick broke off the holder. All I did was push it gently back down into the ground holder, but now it looks all messed up. So just be GENTLE apply them and your good! Btw they are also very smooth and pigmented on the lips!! They really are beautiful. I went out one night and ate appetizers, drank drinks and milk shakes, and I only had to reapply the lip stick ONCE!! It was amazing. This company forever has my business for being cruelty free and making great products!!! :)</li>
            <li> colors were to similar lipsticks would break when applied. You get what you pay for cheap product and horrible pay off. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> just got muhh lipstick package they were packed all in one package.. love the color they have and they go on smooth.. none of mine where damaged or stuck in the cap and i got all 48 of them</li>
            <li> Came in several smaller boxes, 2 boxes of the same colors.</li>
            <li> so many different shades to suit different clients</li>
            <li> This is a great set for anyone who likes to use a variety of lipstick shades and try out new colors without the price of a single lipstick. The variety of shades is very good - everything from bright and deep reds to pale pinks and corals, and everything in between. There&#x27;s even some unique colors such as a shimmery golden tone. Each lipstick tube is full sized, however the lipstick inside is about half the size. I didn&#x27;t see this as a problem since there&#x27;s so many in the set (so for the price it&#x27;s fine) and honestly, I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used up a lipstick all the way to the end. So no complaints about the size (just be aware that they&#x27;re half sized sticks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each lipstick tube is clear in the middle so that the actual lipstick shows through. I wish ALL lipstick tubes were made this way so that the  shade color is clear visible and it&#x27;s the actual lipstick instead of a color sticker at the end of a tube. This makes it so easy to pick out the color, which is nice because there&#x27;s so many in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick itself is very good quality, which for the price I was happily surprised. These lipsticks go on very smooth and creamy with a matte finish. Good staying power too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The lipsticks are packaged in six small lightweight cardboard boxes that are wrapped together with plastic packaging wrap.&lt;br /&gt;Once opened up you&#x27;ll need something to keep these in - the photo might give the impression that these come with some sort of display stand, which the set does not. I put mine in a square make up case with a flip top lid and that&#x27;s been the perfect way to store them, especially because the clear center on the tubes makes finding the desired shade pretty fast and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the lipsticks were separated from the base of the tube and slightly stuck up in the cap. After tapping the tube slightly the lipstick fell down into the base of the tube and stayed put. All the other lipsticks were in perfect condition and in place in the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great set for anyone wanting a big variety of lipstick shades to choose from and wants a quality matte lipstick too.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.ition and in place in the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great set for anyone wanting a big variety of lipstick shades to choose from and wants a quality matte lipstick too.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors. Surprisingly moisturizing as well. For the price I was expecting it to feel and apply really cheap-you know that &#x27;cakey&#x27; look. the only thing is they break easily-so be gentle. I was a little too forceful while applying a couple times and broke 2 of them.</li>
            <li> i really w enjoyed the variety I received for the price. I have not had the chance to try on all of the colors yet but I like how most of them look. Some are more pigmented than others but they have all gone on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I went a little over board and when I saw I could get all these lipsticks for about $1.00 each I just bought it. A huge variety of colors, some I didnt like, but that is to be expected. In hindsight I probably should have just ordered the 5 lipsticks I did like and spent more money because I most likely will give most of these away. Decent lipsticks but actual stick is a bit shorter than some drugstore name brands. Again, it was $1.00 per lipstick so its worth it.</li>
            <li> many many colours! they are great love all those colors I will buy them again (if some day they run away)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t last long at all,</li>
            <li> This is a really good set up lipstick if you want some variety and fun. There are several nude colors I won&#x27;t do but only 2 wear broken and I got a prompt adjustment to my order. Product and customer service were great!</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors and the product came on time with no problems I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Horrible do not but this</li>
            <li> Shipping was so unbelievably fast. I love all the colors!! The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing about these lipsticks are that they break and twist so easily, but it&#x27;s so cheap that maybe the make up packaging is cheap too.. These five stars are well deserved.</li>
            <li> Very good. But very bad break I&#x27;ve shipping 12-love and that&#x27;s something frustrating of shipping.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick.  Color stays on for quite a while.  It goes on smooth and creamy.  Great variety.  Arrived quickly.  All the lipsticks come in a bag, there is no stand or anything for organizing.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and nice xmas gift I distributed amongst my friends..and family and Myself</li>
            <li> I received my lipstick on time. Some of them were broken and didn&#x27;t have the names on them. The colors are not as thick as I would like and does not last that long. You basically get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I wish they have more of a darker color, reddish than pink.</li>
            <li> Received 6 of one exact same color.I had to return it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lipstick is poor.  I would have rather spent 40 bucks on only 2 colors somewhere else.  Disappointed!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I only received 36 instead of 48 lipsticks.  They were liquid and not the same lipsticks shown in the picture.  The lipsticks were also not sealed, so there&#x27;s no way to tell if they&#x27;ve been used before.  I did love the variety of colors, which is why I gave 2 stars, but I still am returning this.</li>
            <li> I got the whole set because there were colors in each pack I liked. There are far more colors I like than colors I dislike. Only one came broken but I still use it ,you have to be careful not to push the lipstick all the up and you don&#x27;t need much pressure to put it on. All the lipsticks go one nice, cover well, last awhile, and feel good not waxy or anything like that. I&#x27;d get this again and recommend it to anyone looking for a variety or lipstick colors.</li>
            <li> I just received this package of lipstick and, because I read about the problems some other reviewers have had, I went through them one-by-one, checked to see if they were broken, and laid them out by number to check for duplicates. Out of the 48 that I received, three of the lipsticks themselves were broken, none of the plastic lipstick tubes were broken, and I had no duplicates. The colors are really attractive - there is a wide range of shimmer or matte or creamy, in lots of different fashionable shades. These colors aren&#x27;t kid dress up colors; they are sophisticated normal lipstick colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that, while other reviewers here describe them as arriving in little cardboard box packs, mine all came just loose in a padded shipping bag, which was then inside the Amazon box. I would bet that the few broken lipsticks I had were damaged in transit. I do wish they had been a bit more mindfully packaged, but honestly, for the price, I can&#x27;t complain. This turned out to be much better lipstick than I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> I have this really big obsession with lipstick so when I saw these I had to snatch them up. These were better than I expected them to be. This lipstick goes on really smoothly especially the darker colors. The lighter colors are a little harder for me to apply but they are still nice. They don&#x27;t dry your lips out in fact they actually made my lips feel softer and prettier. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> They are all sooooo pigmented, creamy, and wonderful! The nudes are absolutely gorgeous, the variety is amazing, none were doubled by mistake, and only one broke. HOWEVER they are a bit tough to push up but that&#x27;s my only complaint and I can get over it! There are only about 4 or 5 I don&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> I bought the whole set in order to experiment with different shades since there are so many. I have tried 8 so far and only 2 I don&#x27;t like and my 7 year old daughter is gladly taking them off my hands for her play makeup collection. The quality of the lipstick is good and you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought but I love it</li>
            <li> Lots of different colors.  Some will be blended with others to make a less &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; shade, but overall good variety.</li>
            <li> Got it to sell, customers loved it</li>
            <li> this lipstick is phenomenal the pigment and shades of this brand is great and for a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!!!!! Perfects!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product about 2 days after placing my order with the amazon prime trial. I was surprised at the good quality of the lipsticks because I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the J Cat brand. Of course not all the lipsticks worked with my skin tone buy overall I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors and they last when applied!!!</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price.  I was shocked at the quality!  It is quite nice.  I expected cheap lipstick for the price, but they aren&#x27;t bad!  I was looking for new colors to experiment with without breaking the bank and this is a blast!  I look forward to trying a new one every day!  Be warned, a large majority of these are ones you will never wear, but some come out different than you think.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting to experiment with different colors without breaking the bank this is the way to go. For the price the quality is great and they don&#x27;t dry the lips. Some colors are more pigmented than others but that also gives you a chance to play with different mixtures to fine an infinite number of color combinations. I wasn&#x27;t fond of the colors with glitter in them but all the others were a pretty good formula. This is perfect for the makeup beginner to build their collection and there is plenty of product for many uses as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are great. Beautiful long lasting pigments I absolutely adore them. The only complaint I have is that the lipsticks keep breaking away on the inside of the tube which is super frustrating. They end up smashing into the top of the lid or around the edges. And then I can&#x27;t put it on without ruining it more. If you have a lipstick brush that might be more beneficial but i haven&#x27;t gotten one yet. So far 50% of the lipsticks have detached inside their tubes. Ones I haven&#x27;t even used yet. I&#x27;m quite disappointed. I still gave them 4 stars because the colors themselves are amazing.</li>
            <li> Easy To Break But Over All LoveIt 💕</li>
            <li> Good price for all the colors provided thank you</li>
            <li> This set is great! I purchased it from kolorize me, and the shipping was very fast. None of the lipsticks were damaged and were new in the boxes (6 to a box). The colors are great as well, there are only a few odd colors. Definitly worth the money.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very chalky and not creamy, it&#x27;s the worst and I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Love the lipsticks..it comes n all sorts of colors and its amazing!</li>
