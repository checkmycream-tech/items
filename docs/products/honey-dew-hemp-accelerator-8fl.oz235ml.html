            <li>I do not tan very easily at all.  </li>

            <li>The lotion rubs in easy  and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a light scent, it smells like honeydew!</li>

            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Worked OK for Tanning, no bronzers so</li>
            <li>I ended up liking this stuff better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this brand Supre.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell also.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Lotion smells like melons and leaves no nasty after tan odor.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is so overwhelming</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this ever again, even if it was on sale again...or even free!</li>
            <li>melon/fruity scent, once do e tanning there is no nasty smell</li>
            <li>Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes of tanning it has soaked in nicely so that I&#x27;m not sliding all around the tanning bed which is so important .</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t a bronzer and just an accelerator.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found this online</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a cucumber melon scent though.</li>
            <li>but it was not anything very significant.</li>
            <li>Its the best value for the money and works as good as, if not better, than the 60$ bottles.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of sweet melons you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Good smell, gives and gives you decent color!</li>
            <li>But now it is a nice golden brown</li>
            <li>maximizer is too much for my skin because I&#x27;m so fair. .</li>
            <li>it does smell good, however i didn&#x27;t really like the smell after you&#x27;d laid in the tanning bed..</li>
            <li>Good smelling, moisturizing, and most importantly, produces a nice tan in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to apply.</li>
            <li>the lotion works well and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easy.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I have had a few tanning lotions before, but this is hands down the best smelling lotion at the best price!</li>
            <li>, a light honey dew smell.</li>
            <li>Have not burned and have a light tan after 4 uses  </li>
            <li>Cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li>And it smells absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>buy it, you;ll love it ;)</li>
            <li>I will go back to what I used before, this is nothing more than a nice smelling moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Great for a boost with your other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I did see a difference in color immediately, but it also went away just as quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to tanning products.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m taking the extra steps to make sure my skin is in great shape such as drinking lots of water</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten good of a tan in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and this gives the best color in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li>Def worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li>She is very fair and usually doesn&#x27;t tan fast.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly as described,  came extremely fast and even had a free sample of another tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I got this lotion on discount when my tanning salon closed and have since then found a new place and have become an experienced tanner.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning a little over a month as with any good tanning product your skin needs a great moisturizer this is a lotion and is thick not watery</li>
            <li>but when I was using this stuff I saw results with the first use.</li>
            <li>With 1 use I can see a lil bit of color, which is a plus, but the real test will be if it continues  to darken my skin!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to other fair skinned people!</li>
            <li>smells good tho, like green apple jolly ranchers</li>
            <li>As with anything else too much lotion can cause breakouts so go with what is right for you .</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order this again.</li>
            <li>So I tried to buy it again, this time making absolute certain</li>
            <li>but I have yet to see any real use in it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>but I really like the smell</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in color for me.</li>
            <li>My friend used this at the pool and it seemed to really darken her tan in one use.  </li>
            <li>ALso, I got it really fast.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite accelerator I have ever used, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent lotion besides those negatives.</li>
            <li>I dont go to a tanning bed i lay out on my back porch and the very first time i used it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t tan well</li>
            <li>and I apply body lotion twice a day because tanning can make you very dry skinned if not taken properly care of and watch your soaps just make sure they aren&#x27;t drying either .</li>
            <li>It helped my tan a great deal after just one use, I did have a light base color.</li>
            <li>It works better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used that cost $60!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really getting dark now and noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Just a warning to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because it was such a low price</li>
            <li>it gives me SUPER DARK results in a very short time, without bronzers that i have to worry about streaking or washing away!!</li>
            <li>Not sure there is anything out there that really makes that much of a difference when tanning.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because the price was very low</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I did not say anything because I thought I bought the wrong item on my own error.</li>
            <li>Besides that I got to use this yesterday in the bed, and I noticed I was able to use very little as this lotion is very thick and applies easily,  once in the tanning bed iwas not all slippery like other lotions have made me feel.</li>
            <li>I started out using it my first few times ever stepping foot in a tanning bed ever...</li>
            <li>I didnt have high hopes for this one since I loathe the other SUPRE products.</li>

            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t a bronzer and just an accelerator.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I found this online</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a cucumber melon scent though.</li>
            <li> but it was not anything very significant.</li>
            <li> Its the best value for the money and works as good as, if not better, than the 60$ bottles.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of sweet melons you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li> Good smell, gives and gives you decent color!</li>
            <li> But now it is a nice golden brown</li>
            <li> maximizer is too much for my skin because I&#x27;m so fair. .</li>
            <li> it does smell good, however i didn&#x27;t really like the smell after you&#x27;d laid in the tanning bed..</li>
            <li> Good smelling, moisturizing, and most importantly, produces a nice tan in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to apply.</li>
            <li> the lotion works well and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easy.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I have had a few tanning lotions before, but this is hands down the best smelling lotion at the best price!</li>
            <li> , a light honey dew smell.</li>
            <li> Have not burned and have a light tan after 4 uses  </li>
            <li> Cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> And it smells absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> buy it, you;ll love it ;)</li>
            <li> I will go back to what I used before, this is nothing more than a nice smelling moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Great for a boost with your other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I did see a difference in color immediately, but it also went away just as quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to tanning products.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m taking the extra steps to make sure my skin is in great shape such as drinking lots of water</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten good of a tan in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and this gives the best color in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li> Def worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> She is very fair and usually doesn&#x27;t tan fast.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly as described,  came extremely fast and even had a free sample of another tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion on discount when my tanning salon closed and have since then found a new place and have become an experienced tanner.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning a little over a month as with any good tanning product your skin needs a great moisturizer this is a lotion and is thick not watery</li>
            <li> but when I was using this stuff I saw results with the first use.</li>
            <li> With 1 use I can see a lil bit of color, which is a plus, but the real test will be if it continues  to darken my skin!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to other fair skinned people!</li>
            <li> smells good tho, like green apple jolly ranchers</li>
            <li> As with anything else too much lotion can cause breakouts so go with what is right for you .</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order this again.</li>
            <li> So I tried to buy it again, this time making absolute certain</li>
            <li> but I have yet to see any real use in it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> but I really like the smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in color for me.</li>
            <li> My friend used this at the pool and it seemed to really darken her tan in one use.  </li>
            <li> ALso, I got it really fast.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite accelerator I have ever used, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent lotion besides those negatives.</li>
            <li> I dont go to a tanning bed i lay out on my back porch and the very first time i used it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t tan well</li>
            <li> and I apply body lotion twice a day because tanning can make you very dry skinned if not taken properly care of and watch your soaps just make sure they aren&#x27;t drying either .</li>
            <li> It helped my tan a great deal after just one use, I did have a light base color.</li>
            <li> It works better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used that cost $60!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting dark now and noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Just a warning to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because it was such a low price</li>
            <li> it gives me SUPER DARK results in a very short time, without bronzers that i have to worry about streaking or washing away!!</li>
            <li> Not sure there is anything out there that really makes that much of a difference when tanning.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because the price was very low</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I did not say anything because I thought I bought the wrong item on my own error.</li>
            <li> Besides that I got to use this yesterday in the bed, and I noticed I was able to use very little as this lotion is very thick and applies easily,  once in the tanning bed iwas not all slippery like other lotions have made me feel.</li>
            <li> I started out using it my first few times ever stepping foot in a tanning bed ever...</li>
            <li> I didnt have high hopes for this one since I loathe the other SUPRE products.</li>
            <li> I am pale and hard to tan, but i noticed color within in 1 use of the lotion, it smells great and the lotion is thick..</li>
            <li> Great even tan, and in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i have used all kinds of lotions, tingles and bronzers, some cheap, some super expensive, and yet i always keep stocked up on this!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it did much for color though, and the ATO was a burnt smell not overbearing but not very pleasant either.</li>
            <li> but I believe I developed an allergy to it after a few uses</li>
            <li> The lotion goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I had to tan my pale Irish self before moving to FL and used this on ly legs only.  </li>
            <li> Legs are harder to tan thatn the rest of the body which is why I give it a 3</li>
            <li> I use it with other pro Tan products as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tan accelerators and never broke out.</li>
            <li> I switch every other session with this and the Jwoww bronzer.</li>
            <li> i started getting dark.</li>
            <li> Plus I get really dark in just 3 days of laying in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I heard this lotion got people really dark...</li>
            <li> It got me a little dark</li>
            <li> I had tried some products in the past but didn&#x27;t like the smell of other products and didn&#x27;t feel that they worked all that well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many Lotions and hated them all.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and worry about burning.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results and lately I just mix it with sizzle so the results aren&#x27;t as harsh.</li>
            <li> The price is wonderfull.. cant say anything negative</li>
            <li> At least it isn&#x27;t working in that capacity for me.</li>
            <li> The color it gave me was unimpressive, fake smell, and i thought it felt a little sticky when applied.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Forget the expensive tanning salon brands ...</li>
            <li> However the lotion failed to help boost my tanning abilities.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I smelled HORRIBLE when I got out of the bed and it also left my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> It smelled awful, dried my skin out and gave me this weird bumpy rash.</li>
            <li> I never have to worry about crazy lines if I miss a spot.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I found the lotion and tried it out, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this for me off of Amazon, shipping was very SLOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> so I can use it after a base tan I can use it, but still an inconvenience</li>
            <li> I already had a base tan, so it may be that I just haven&#x27;t noticed any additional tanning.  </li>
            <li> so when tanning I need to start with an accelerator for a base tan.</li>
            <li> It smelled very bad once applied to my skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product smells good in the bottle but did not mix well with my body chemistry. It smelled very bad once applied to my skin. I had a friend try it to see if it was just me, but she had the same issue.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a light scent, it smells like honeydew! I feel that it is a good accelerator, and a great price!</li>
            <li> This has been the best lotion I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds and this gives the best color in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li> I use this product every once in a while just to break the routine of bronzing. It is an ok product but I have yet to see any real use in it. It smells good though.</li>
            <li> Good smell, gives and gives you decent color!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It helped my tan a great deal after just one use, I did have a light base color. But now it is a nice golden brown and I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty smell. I almost feel like it smells better after my tanning session, a light honey dew smell. Would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to tanning products. I had tried some products in the past but didn&#x27;t like the smell of other products and didn&#x27;t feel that they worked all that well. When I had tried this one, it was amazing. You can literally lay out for about 30 min, and I feel like you get the results of being outside all day. I like that the accelerator is just white, so it doesn&#x27;t stain your hands or body. The smell is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. This is hands down my favorite accelerator I have ever used, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this tanning lotion! It is amazing! Heaven in a bottle. It works great for enhancing tanning. I normally don&#x27;t tan well but when I was using this stuff I saw results with the first use. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> The picture and description say this product is an ACCELERATOR. I bought it once before and got a MAXIMIZER. I did not say anything because I thought I bought the wrong item on my own error. So I tried to buy it again, this time making absolute certain I was getting an accelerator. Got the product and again was a MAXIMIZER. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper on Amazon than they sell in the tanning salons and it works wonderfully. Great even tan, and in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from Sunless Deals, about a month ago. It has a wonderful smell, very smooth, and leaves your skin extremely smooth. I can&#x27;t say it did much for color though, and the ATO was a burnt smell not overbearing but not very pleasant either. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS AMAZING!  Worked OK for Tanning, no bronzers so a great entry tanning product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have transitioned to using this as a lotion instead of a tanning lotion because I need the bronzers for the tanning salon but I really like the smell so it is now in my morning lotion routine.  If you like the smell of sweet melons you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled nice and worked well to compliment my tanning bed results. Good stuff. I was surprised because the price was very low and I only got it to use while I was waiting for some back-order lotion. I ended up liking this stuff better.</li>
            <li> this smells so good!  I got this as a gift for a friend and she loves this.  The price was great and she wanted something that would help her tan without all of those bronzers.  she is so happy for this product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I have pale skin and worry about burning. Have not burned and have a light tan after 4 uses  I use this lotion when I tan before going to work and there is no after tan odor.</li>
            <li> i have used all kinds of lotions, tingles and bronzers, some cheap, some super expensive, and yet i always keep stocked up on this!! it gives me SUPER DARK results in a very short time, without bronzers that i have to worry about streaking or washing away!! the smell it light and lovely, and it&#x27;s just a brilliant product! buy it, you;ll love it ;)</li>
            <li> I am pale and hard to tan, but i noticed color within in 1 use of the lotion, it smells great and the lotion is thick.. The price is wonderfull.. cant say anything negative</li>
            <li> I love this brand Supre.  Last summer I used the Grape Escape and the summer before I used another of their products.  They are all great.  Good smelling, moisturizing, and most importantly, produces a nice tan in a short amount of time.  Buy this one!  Its the best value for the money and works as good as, if not better, than the 60$ bottles.</li>
            <li> The item says an accelerator but the description actually says maximizer so please read before buying. .a maximizer is too much for my skin because I&#x27;m so fair. . I&#x27;m keeping it so I can use it after a base tan I can use it, but still an inconvenience</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten good of a tan in a long time.  Love the smell also.  I use it with other pro Tan products as well.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I just started tanning and this has been an amazing beginner&#x27;s lotion! It smells great and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I had to tan my pale Irish self before moving to FL and used this on ly legs only.  Have to say I didn&#x27;t notice any great tanning.  Legs are harder to tan thatn the rest of the body which is why I give it a 3 so maybe the rest of your body will do good with this.  It did smell great and was a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Lotion smells like melons and leaves no nasty after tan odor.  I noticed that I got a nice tan using this lotiona nd I do not tan very easily at all.  I am fair skinned with freckles.  Loved this proiduct would definately buy again.  Same product sells at my salon for 35$</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Forget the expensive tanning salon brands ... this stuff works just as well!</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive but very effective product. Gives a nice even, natural looking tan. Smells great. I will certainly order this again.</li>
            <li> I have had a few tanning lotions before, but this is hands down the best smelling lotion at the best price! Doesn&#x27;t give an immediate bronze, but the lack of that stinky after smells makes up for it!</li>
            <li> Not sure there is anything out there that really makes that much of a difference when tanning. I have reached a plateau with indoor tanning and tried this to see if it could help, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I do like the fragrance and it does leave my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I dont go to a tanning bed i lay out on my back porch and the very first time i used it i started getting dark. It would probably do great in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells delicious but I believe I developed an allergy to it after a few uses so I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described,  came extremely fast and even had a free sample of another tanning lotion. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed. I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in color for me. The smell of this is so overwhelming I got nauseous and almost vomited. I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I broke out in hives everywhere I put this so don&#x27;t believe it when people say hemp is not an allergen. I&#x27;ve used other tan accelerators and never broke out. No blame to the seller though. Just a warning to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great accelerator with a nice sweet smell</li>
            <li> My friend used this at the pool and it seemed to really darken her tan in one use.  She is very fair and usually doesn&#x27;t tan fast.  She bought the bottle from Amazon, so I thought I would give it a try.  I did not notice the same effect after my purchase.  I have used it at the pool 3-4X&#x27;s this summer.  I already had a base tan, so it may be that I just haven&#x27;t noticed any additional tanning.  However, it is very moisturizing and smells wonderful!!  Def worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion on discount when my tanning salon closed and have since then found a new place and have become an experienced tanner. When I found the lotion and tried it out, I was disappointed. All I can say is, good thing it was a discount buy. I have not seen any results and lately I just mix it with sizzle so the results aren&#x27;t as harsh. The lotion smells good and doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it...but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this ever again, even if it was on sale again...or even free!</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome! But is it an accelerator? I don&#x27;t think so. At least it isn&#x27;t working in that capacity for me. I will go back to what I used before, this is nothing more than a nice smelling moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this for me off of Amazon, shipping was very SLOW!!!  Took over 10 days to get here! Besides that I got to use this yesterday in the bed, and I noticed I was able to use very little as this lotion is very thick and applies easily,  once in the tanning bed iwas not all slippery like other lotions have made me feel. Thhe smell is great going on, melon/fruity scent, once do e tanning there is no nasty smell but you cant smell the lotion fruity smell either! With 1 use I can see a lil bit of color, which is a plus, but the real test will be if it continues  to darken my skin!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, leaves my skin looking healthy with a nice shine/glow, not greasy</li>
            <li> Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;Skin so soft😀</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many Lotions and hated them all. I didnt have high hopes for this one since I loathe the other SUPRE products. But I tried this lotion and saw great results. It smells nice, and doesnt leave me feeling greasy. It is also easy to apply. ALso, I got it really fast.</li>
            <li> Makes a beautiful tan and smells wonderful. Have seen it cheaper at salon prices, but will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because it was such a low price but because of the good reviews, I decided to give it a try. It works better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used that cost $60!!! Very satisfied and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best tanning accelerator that I have ever used! I keep my tan forever while using this product! Plus I get really dark in just 3 days of laying in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning a little over a month as with any good tanning product your skin needs a great moisturizer this is a lotion and is thick not watery and it doesn&#x27;t feel like your applying grease to your skin . After 20 minutes of tanning it has soaked in nicely so that I&#x27;m not sliding all around the tanning bed which is so important . Some say this is a beginner tanning lotion but I think it can be used on any level . I&#x27;m amazingly a couple of shades darker but I&#x27;m taking the extra steps to make sure my skin is in great shape such as drinking lots of water and I apply body lotion twice a day because tanning can make you very dry skinned if not taken properly care of and watch your soaps just make sure they aren&#x27;t drying either . As with anything else too much lotion can cause breakouts so go with what is right for you .</li>
            <li> This smells amazing!!! My tan is building great. I love that it isn&#x27;t a bronzer and just an accelerator. I never have to worry about crazy lines if I miss a spot. It also leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  Great product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I did see a difference in color immediately, but it also went away just as quickly.  I like the Smell.</li>
            <li> The color it gave me was unimpressive, fake smell, and i thought it felt a little sticky when applied. No good.</li>
            <li> Its awesome! Smells so good, you just wanna lick yourself. Very nice. Really good tan too. Would recommend it for your momma.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I started out using it my first few times ever stepping foot in a tanning bed ever...but then after a while I had to move on to something else because it stopped giving me results. It smells sweet and wonderful even after you tan. Definitely recommend to other fair skinned people!</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft. Smell is nice, but is mildly overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Smells soooooo good! I am fair skinned so when tanning I need to start with an accelerator for a base tan. LOVE THIS ONE! I love that it is made with hemp! (The after lotion I purchased is also hemp.) So good for the skin! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> the scent is nice I love honey dew!!! However the lotion failed to help boost my tanning abilities. I was the same color getting out of the bed that I was going in. The lotion rubs in easy  and smells nice. Also no after tan smell.</li>
            <li> I buy the product for my wife, she is very happy with it. She loves how it smells and makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> Worked well for me, a guy. Doesn&#x27;t smell like a girl. Isn&#x27;t oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great! Only used it once so far but I was happy with it. Highly recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li> Cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> I have to pay twice the amount for this at my tanning salon so I&#x27;m glad I found this online</li>
            <li> Smells AWESOME!!! Works great.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I heard this lotion got people really dark...wasn&#x27;t the case for me. smells good tho, like green apple jolly ranchers</li>
            <li> A good beginner lotion that does not contain bronzers. Does not leave a smell. The lotion goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Okay, I tried this because I kept hearing about how great hemp tanning lotion is. Well, not so great for this girl! It smelled awful, dried my skin out and gave me this weird bumpy rash. Needless to say, didn&#x27;t like it. Won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great for a boost with your other tanning lotion. I switch every other session with this and the Jwoww bronzer. I&#x27;m really getting dark now and noticed a difference after the first use. I&#x27;m a beige skin tone but have a deep brown tan now. For the price it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> i found that i need to purchase my lotion here on amazon otherwise i get hosed.  the lotion works well and goes on easily.  it does smell good, however i didn&#x27;t really like the smell after you&#x27;d laid in the tanning bed.. i&#x27;d buy it again, though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easy. I&#x27;ve used this inside and out and it works for both. I noticed a difference in one tan. And it smells absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> It smells good when you put it on, it&#x27;s more of a cucumber melon scent though. I smelled HORRIBLE when I got out of the bed and it also left my skin greasy. It got me a little dark but it was not anything very significant. It&#x27;s a decent lotion besides those negatives. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
