            <li>My favorite color pallet !</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying NYX and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I love the colors!</li>
            <li>Its beautiful and the colors are rich, matte.</li>
            <li>it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>nice colors.  </li>
            <li>excellent product, responsible for, recommended</li>
            <li>Took me awhile to grow warm to this palette.  </li>
            <li>its kind of cakey.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the colors are nice</li>
            <li>Nice sparkle to the lighter ones.</li>
            <li>These are really nice eye shadows.</li>
            <li>It comes with an applicator, but I use all of my own brushes.</li>
            <li>but for nyx im sure it will be fair</li>
            <li>But the colors are nice, I just have to apply a generous amount to get the shade that I want as a WOF.</li>
            <li>Nice workable eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are definitely better palettes out there, but this is good quality for the expense.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are nicely pigmented and I didn&#x27;t notice any fall out.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an excellent product!</li>
            <li>I loved ... :)</li>
            <li>And i though ok this may be good.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package the product was wrapped up really good took some scissors to get the bubble wrap off:)</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>, this is a great palette for day time and a clean, neutral look.</li>
            <li>They blend so easy and look good on all skin types</li>
            <li>This product is great for the a first eyeshadow collection, or from someone who wants a great collection of neutral colors!  </li>
            <li>My first look at this product i loved it!</li>
            <li>This palette works so amazing, it has mostly matte shadows, plus one with chunky glitter, and one that is shimmery.</li>
            <li>In the picture they look much more warm.</li>
            <li>Im more of a &#x27;neutral color&#x27; kind of girl</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, and the colors come in a range of really useful shades.</li>
            <li>I have tried most drugstore lines, as well as a couple of department store eyeshadows and this one is by far the best to me.  </li>
            <li>With the use of primer, you can get a great look with these colors, and the price is very reasonable for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons</li>
            <li>Very consumer friendly and the perfect set to switch up from day to a night look.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and it came very quickly!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is great and perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li>The package came quickly, and had good packaging.</li>
            <li>Easy and nice results.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation for the darker colors is good, but I&#x27;m not super impressed with the lighter ones.  </li>
            <li>u have to apply so many layers for it to say up</li>
            <li>and i buy most of my things from amazon.</li>
            <li>i will be buying more of these after i run out, its a must have now.</li>
            <li>Now if you use a primer with this eye shadow it looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the more muted tones that go well with red hair and hazel eyes</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments after incorporating this into my routine vs. the two-swipe plan I had been doing.</li>
            <li>You do want to buy better brushes.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Yay! :)</li>
            <li>but I wish that it was more pigmented, it lacks in that department.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll surely buy more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently decided that matte is the quality I like which makes this palette ALMOST perfect.  </li>
            <li>Love this palette...</li>
            <li>I love that the colors are matte</li>
            <li>Def a must buy. :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this eye Shadow.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This pallete is okay..</li>
            <li>This palette is just OK.</li>
            <li>I like to wear more shimmery colors, and most of these are matte, which makes them stand out</li>
            <li>Love  these colors.  </li>
            <li>and she loves it.... :)</li>
            <li>I love this brand, but this pallette was too light!</li>
            <li>I guess the quad itself is convenient but for better quality I&#x27;d rather just find matching colors from my Bh Cosmetics palette and use those.</li>
            <li>I have plenty of nyx products that I love.</li>
            <li>Ok so i bought this because ive needed some stuff to try out a pallet of any type .</li>
            <li>Theyre ok.</li>
            <li>You could do better ladies:)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>Love the colors but not so pigmented</li>
            <li>Beautiful natural color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The colors look lovely in the pan, but when applied, they don&#x27;t even have enough pigment to show up on my skin, and I am very very fair.</li>
            <li>The darkest brown is a good shade but the others are much too light!</li>
            <li>I would not normally have any reason to review this product, except I am that compelled to tell you IT IS WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>But very very cool toned.</li>
            <li>Arrived before expected, very happy.</li>
            <li>the colors are great because they&#x27;re natural and don&#x27;t make you look like you have crayon all over your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the colors because they are light, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything great as far as color payoff goes (even while using a primer)</li>
            <li>I thought the pigmentation could be better for the light colors.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>Items came fast but it does not show up good</li>
            <li>I was running out of my favorite light tan and needed some new good neutrals.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quick.</li>
            <li>The color pay off sucked and it easily came off.</li>
            <li>The colors seem really vibrant and good looking.</li>
            <li>This pallete is incredible and such an amazing price, the colors are highly pigmented and as a mua i use them on all my clients!</li>
            <li>The product arrived fine and everything, but it just isnt pigmented.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in one piece!</li>
            <li>I love it very much!</li>
            <li>Awesome little eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>I was super excited for this palette because I love neutral eye shadows and could see myself getting a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li>They look great and last all day.</li>
            <li>Overall great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>All the colors go very well together and blend nicely.</li>
            <li>The palette arrived on time and in secure packaging.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but they dont really show on your eyes unless you use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly with no flaking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who wants the warm look for that budget</li>
            <li>I really love NYX, and overall I think this is a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can I just say I am not disappointed, the pigmentations on these are terrific and the wear is great.</li>
            <li>I want to give it 4 stars because I was so EXCITED to get it</li>
            <li>Nice vivid colors that apply to my eye area smoothly without eye primer</li>
            <li>Pigmentation is great, and the range of colors between light and dark is perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>This shadow palette is perfect for casual days and is amazing quality.</li>
            <li>Also smooth, blendable and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li>First the shimmery white color is beautiful but chalky.</li>
            <li>The light colors are only good for blending as they have no..NO color pay off and</li>
            <li>Some colors have more pigmentation than others, and that makes it hard to blend anything to be honest, however the shimmery gold was amazing, and the light brow.</li>
            <li>They are really blendable and I absoloutely love this product</li>
            <li>If you want a bold look then don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>cute light colors for a natural look</li>
            <li>I use shadow brushes and felt that they ran out really quick.</li>
            <li>Very much I recommend to get!</li>
            <li>It works good.&amp;#34; If she is happy it is one less thing for her to complain to me about.</li>
            <li>Hard to find palettes of nice colors like this, love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the natural colors of this palette.</li>
            <li>great for a natural make up look which i wear everyday:)</li>
            <li>I love that it says natural</li>
            <li>This is one that I&#x27;m just not crazy about.</li>
            <li>Yes they are affordable but I don&#x27;t feel like I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Love the soft colors.</li>
            <li>very nice makeup palette for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Washes right off when needed.</li>
            <li>The last dark shade is what i use to perfect my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are pretty.</li>
            <li>But the case broke the first day.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Put that on your eyelid first.</li>
            <li>Overall, its okay,</li>
            <li>Let me point out that in comparison, I prefer the Urban Decay Palette because the colors are more neutral and easier to blend.</li>
            <li>The color palate is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Purchased order from BeFlurt and received two days sooner than expected delivery date which was a nice added surprise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really starting to love NYX products</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but they are not very pigmented, so you have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>I love nyx products and prices, so I&#x27;m definitely not trying to bash the company.</li>
            <li>These will work with many different things which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>Love all the colors especially the 3 darker shades.</li>
            <li>They stay on pretty well with a primer.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use this palette, but when I got it, the colors barely showed up and didn&#x27;t have much pigmentation.</li>
            <li>The colors that are in there are a pinkish color, sparkly gold, light light pink (</li>
            <li>I loved this pallet but there is very little in each one.</li>
            <li>palette, but the taupe/brown/tan colors are pretty much nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Comes with a large dual sided applicator and was delivered 2 days after ordering.</li>
            <li>They are very natural after blending, just right for work.</li>
            <li>This little palette is wonderful for everyday.</li>
            <li>they just don&#x27;t really adhere well</li>
            <li>Very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking, like the name implies.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>Really like these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, she loves it.</li>
            <li>Also, the colors are much darker than they look.</li>
            <li>Blends very well.</li>
            <li>very pigmented.</li>
            <li>but I definitely expected better from the brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quality and</li>
            <li>but I still really like it and would recommend it to you</li>
            <li>because they really are, i think i can play a lot with these.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really needed a neutral palette.</li>
            <li>The price and quality at high level!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough to trial and error yourself.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>They also blend really well.</li>
            <li>please dont buy this expecting much.</li>
            <li>I really like these colors.  </li>
            <li>I use the furthest color on the left as a highlight and the other 3 colors are good for lid coverage or blending.</li>
            <li>Requires a little extra in order for some of the lighter colors to show, but on my fair skin it&#x27;s still quite nice with just a few strokes.</li>
            <li>I like NYX Cosmetics Natural Eye Shadow Palette TNS01  very much.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this palette, but was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li>Which is the orange looking color in the picture!), light brown, golden brown, and then the darkest color looks a bit black, but has a brownish tint to it.</li>
            <li>But the actually eye shadow itself seems kind of cheap and dull.</li>
            <li>I would say that the lighter colors show up better if you put an eye primer down.</li>
            <li>My new fave!</li>
            <li>I would said there&#x27;s a decent amount of makeup per pot.</li>
            <li>the colors weren&#x27;t vibrant pigments if that makes since but with a bit of primer they work well.</li>
            <li>But I wish they would figure out a way to include a decent application brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice palette, but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>, they kind of chunk up in the pallet and they are very pale compared to what they look like.</li>
            <li>Very sheer colors, but still very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best but isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li>But when I opened nothing was broken and it was all good.</li>
            <li>I only use the two shades on the right.  </li>
            <li>Not super pigmented, but easy to build up.</li>
            <li>Very sheer and light even above primer .</li>
            <li>they look very natural.  </li>
            <li>With the proper primer, this palette can give some higher end brands a run for their money.</li>
            <li>Yes I want a natural look, but I still need pigmentation!</li>
            <li>my only fear was that this product would be broken or old but it looks nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, cruelty free and delivered to my doorstep.  </li>
            <li>The color right before the darkest brown isn&#x27;t a brown, it&#x27;s definitely more of a dark taupe that makes my green eyes pop.</li>
            <li>I typically where brown eyeshadows and was excited to try these colors.</li>
            <li>so i keep it natural with a no make up make up look and these eyeshadows do the job for me.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that the eye shadow is very powdery so when i apply it, it goes everywhere</li>
            <li>Just what I needed some natural and neutral looking tones.</li>
            <li>but if you want it to look natural and add a tint to your eyes then buy it.</li>
            <li>After all it is called natural for a reason.</li>
            <li>The shadows are really pigmented, even though when I swatched them they looked really sheer.</li>
            <li>much brightness a bit dusty but ok for the price</li>
            <li>I think if you wanna know more you should watch youtubers reviewing it to kno what i mean.</li>
            <li>The darkest color is not black.</li>
            <li>In this palette the colors aren&#x27;t coordinated as well, there is high shimmer shadows next to matte shadows etc.</li>
            <li>expected the colors to be mostly neutral, but one is slightly green in color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: the consistency is a bit powdery, and there is definitely a major fall-out hazard trying to use these.  </li>
            <li>The colors are barely pigmented.</li>
            <li>read online that this palette was similar to Urban Decay&#x27;s Basics Palette, which is gorgeous and expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not a reflection of other nyx products generally because i have their glam shadow  and a few lip items and love them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this when I realized how long I had been using my Urban Decay Naked Palette and thought I should buy a new set of \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; shadows.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this when doing other people makeup.</li>
            <li>The only one I have anything even remotely negative to say is the white gold glitter, it goes on a bit thin for my liking but is easily build able when wet</li>

            <li> My favorite color pallet !</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying NYX and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the colors!</li>
            <li> Its beautiful and the colors are rich, matte.</li>
            <li> it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> nice colors.  </li>
            <li> excellent product, responsible for, recommended</li>
            <li> Took me awhile to grow warm to this palette.  </li>
            <li> its kind of cakey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the colors are nice</li>
            <li> Nice sparkle to the lighter ones.</li>
            <li> These are really nice eye shadows.</li>
            <li> It comes with an applicator, but I use all of my own brushes.</li>
            <li> but for nyx im sure it will be fair</li>
            <li> But the colors are nice, I just have to apply a generous amount to get the shade that I want as a WOF.</li>
            <li> Nice workable eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are definitely better palettes out there, but this is good quality for the expense.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are nicely pigmented and I didn&#x27;t notice any fall out.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I loved ... :)</li>
            <li> And i though ok this may be good.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the product was wrapped up really good took some scissors to get the bubble wrap off:)</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> , this is a great palette for day time and a clean, neutral look.</li>
            <li> They blend so easy and look good on all skin types</li>
            <li> This product is great for the a first eyeshadow collection, or from someone who wants a great collection of neutral colors!  </li>
            <li> My first look at this product i loved it!</li>
            <li> This palette works so amazing, it has mostly matte shadows, plus one with chunky glitter, and one that is shimmery.</li>
            <li> In the picture they look much more warm.</li>
            <li> Im more of a &#x27;neutral color&#x27; kind of girl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, and the colors come in a range of really useful shades.</li>
            <li> I have tried most drugstore lines, as well as a couple of department store eyeshadows and this one is by far the best to me.  </li>
            <li> With the use of primer, you can get a great look with these colors, and the price is very reasonable for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons</li>
            <li> Very consumer friendly and the perfect set to switch up from day to a night look.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it came very quickly!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is great and perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li> The package came quickly, and had good packaging.</li>
            <li> Easy and nice results.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation for the darker colors is good, but I&#x27;m not super impressed with the lighter ones.  </li>
            <li> u have to apply so many layers for it to say up</li>
            <li> and i buy most of my things from amazon.</li>
            <li> i will be buying more of these after i run out, its a must have now.</li>
            <li> Now if you use a primer with this eye shadow it looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the more muted tones that go well with red hair and hazel eyes</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments after incorporating this into my routine vs. the two-swipe plan I had been doing.</li>
            <li> You do want to buy better brushes.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Yay! :)</li>
            <li> but I wish that it was more pigmented, it lacks in that department.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll surely buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided that matte is the quality I like which makes this palette ALMOST perfect.  </li>
            <li> Love this palette...</li>
            <li> I love that the colors are matte</li>
            <li> Def a must buy. :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this eye Shadow.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This pallete is okay..</li>
            <li> This palette is just OK.</li>
            <li> I like to wear more shimmery colors, and most of these are matte, which makes them stand out</li>
            <li> Love  these colors.  </li>
            <li> and she loves it.... :)</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but this pallette was too light!</li>
            <li> I guess the quad itself is convenient but for better quality I&#x27;d rather just find matching colors from my Bh Cosmetics palette and use those.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of nyx products that I love.</li>
            <li> Ok so i bought this because ive needed some stuff to try out a pallet of any type .</li>
            <li> Theyre ok.</li>
            <li> You could do better ladies:)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> Love the colors but not so pigmented</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The colors look lovely in the pan, but when applied, they don&#x27;t even have enough pigment to show up on my skin, and I am very very fair.</li>
            <li> The darkest brown is a good shade but the others are much too light!</li>
            <li> I would not normally have any reason to review this product, except I am that compelled to tell you IT IS WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> But very very cool toned.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected, very happy.</li>
            <li> the colors are great because they&#x27;re natural and don&#x27;t make you look like you have crayon all over your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the colors because they are light, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything great as far as color payoff goes (even while using a primer)</li>
            <li> I thought the pigmentation could be better for the light colors.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> Items came fast but it does not show up good</li>
            <li> I was running out of my favorite light tan and needed some new good neutrals.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quick.</li>
            <li> The color pay off sucked and it easily came off.</li>
            <li> The colors seem really vibrant and good looking.</li>
            <li> This pallete is incredible and such an amazing price, the colors are highly pigmented and as a mua i use them on all my clients!</li>
            <li> The product arrived fine and everything, but it just isnt pigmented.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in one piece!</li>
            <li> I love it very much!</li>
            <li> Awesome little eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this palette because I love neutral eye shadows and could see myself getting a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> They look great and last all day.</li>
            <li> Overall great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> All the colors go very well together and blend nicely.</li>
            <li> The palette arrived on time and in secure packaging.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but they dont really show on your eyes unless you use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly with no flaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who wants the warm look for that budget</li>
            <li> I really love NYX, and overall I think this is a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can I just say I am not disappointed, the pigmentations on these are terrific and the wear is great.</li>
            <li> I want to give it 4 stars because I was so EXCITED to get it</li>
            <li> Nice vivid colors that apply to my eye area smoothly without eye primer</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is great, and the range of colors between light and dark is perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> This shadow palette is perfect for casual days and is amazing quality.</li>
            <li> Also smooth, blendable and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> First the shimmery white color is beautiful but chalky.</li>
            <li> The light colors are only good for blending as they have no..NO color pay off and</li>
            <li> Some colors have more pigmentation than others, and that makes it hard to blend anything to be honest, however the shimmery gold was amazing, and the light brow.</li>
            <li> They are really blendable and I absoloutely love this product</li>
            <li> If you want a bold look then don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> cute light colors for a natural look</li>
            <li> I use shadow brushes and felt that they ran out really quick.</li>
            <li> Very much I recommend to get!</li>
            <li> It works good.&amp;#34; If she is happy it is one less thing for her to complain to me about.</li>
            <li> Hard to find palettes of nice colors like this, love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the natural colors of this palette.</li>
            <li> great for a natural make up look which i wear everyday:)</li>
            <li> I love that it says natural</li>
            <li> This is one that I&#x27;m just not crazy about.</li>
            <li> Yes they are affordable but I don&#x27;t feel like I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Love the soft colors.</li>
            <li> very nice makeup palette for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Washes right off when needed.</li>
            <li> The last dark shade is what i use to perfect my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are pretty.</li>
            <li> But the case broke the first day.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Put that on your eyelid first.</li>
            <li> Overall, its okay,</li>
            <li> Let me point out that in comparison, I prefer the Urban Decay Palette because the colors are more neutral and easier to blend.</li>
            <li> The color palate is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Purchased order from BeFlurt and received two days sooner than expected delivery date which was a nice added surprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really starting to love NYX products</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but they are not very pigmented, so you have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I love nyx products and prices, so I&#x27;m definitely not trying to bash the company.</li>
            <li> These will work with many different things which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> Love all the colors especially the 3 darker shades.</li>
            <li> They stay on pretty well with a primer.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this palette, but when I got it, the colors barely showed up and didn&#x27;t have much pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The colors that are in there are a pinkish color, sparkly gold, light light pink (</li>
            <li> I loved this pallet but there is very little in each one.</li>
            <li> palette, but the taupe/brown/tan colors are pretty much nonexistent.</li>
            <li> Comes with a large dual sided applicator and was delivered 2 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> They are very natural after blending, just right for work.</li>
            <li> This little palette is wonderful for everyday.</li>
            <li> they just don&#x27;t really adhere well</li>
            <li> Very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking, like the name implies.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> Really like these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Also, the colors are much darker than they look.</li>
            <li> Blends very well.</li>
            <li> very pigmented.</li>
            <li> but I definitely expected better from the brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quality and</li>
            <li> but I still really like it and would recommend it to you</li>
            <li> because they really are, i think i can play a lot with these.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really needed a neutral palette.</li>
            <li> The price and quality at high level!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough to trial and error yourself.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> They also blend really well.</li>
            <li> please dont buy this expecting much.</li>
            <li> I really like these colors.  </li>
            <li> I use the furthest color on the left as a highlight and the other 3 colors are good for lid coverage or blending.</li>
            <li> Requires a little extra in order for some of the lighter colors to show, but on my fair skin it&#x27;s still quite nice with just a few strokes.</li>
            <li> I like NYX Cosmetics Natural Eye Shadow Palette TNS01  very much.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this palette, but was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li> Which is the orange looking color in the picture!), light brown, golden brown, and then the darkest color looks a bit black, but has a brownish tint to it.</li>
            <li> But the actually eye shadow itself seems kind of cheap and dull.</li>
            <li> I would say that the lighter colors show up better if you put an eye primer down.</li>
            <li> My new fave!</li>
            <li> I would said there&#x27;s a decent amount of makeup per pot.</li>
            <li> the colors weren&#x27;t vibrant pigments if that makes since but with a bit of primer they work well.</li>
            <li> But I wish they would figure out a way to include a decent application brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice palette, but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> , they kind of chunk up in the pallet and they are very pale compared to what they look like.</li>
            <li> Very sheer colors, but still very pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> But when I opened nothing was broken and it was all good.</li>
            <li> I only use the two shades on the right.  </li>
            <li> Not super pigmented, but easy to build up.</li>
            <li> Very sheer and light even above primer .</li>
            <li> they look very natural.  </li>
            <li> With the proper primer, this palette can give some higher end brands a run for their money.</li>
            <li> Yes I want a natural look, but I still need pigmentation!</li>
            <li> my only fear was that this product would be broken or old but it looks nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, cruelty free and delivered to my doorstep.  </li>
            <li> The color right before the darkest brown isn&#x27;t a brown, it&#x27;s definitely more of a dark taupe that makes my green eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I typically where brown eyeshadows and was excited to try these colors.</li>
            <li> so i keep it natural with a no make up make up look and these eyeshadows do the job for me.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the eye shadow is very powdery so when i apply it, it goes everywhere</li>
            <li> Just what I needed some natural and neutral looking tones.</li>
            <li> but if you want it to look natural and add a tint to your eyes then buy it.</li>
            <li> After all it is called natural for a reason.</li>
            <li> The shadows are really pigmented, even though when I swatched them they looked really sheer.</li>
            <li> much brightness a bit dusty but ok for the price</li>
            <li> I think if you wanna know more you should watch youtubers reviewing it to kno what i mean.</li>
            <li> The darkest color is not black.</li>
            <li> In this palette the colors aren&#x27;t coordinated as well, there is high shimmer shadows next to matte shadows etc.</li>
            <li> expected the colors to be mostly neutral, but one is slightly green in color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : the consistency is a bit powdery, and there is definitely a major fall-out hazard trying to use these.  </li>
            <li> The colors are barely pigmented.</li>
            <li> read online that this palette was similar to Urban Decay&#x27;s Basics Palette, which is gorgeous and expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a reflection of other nyx products generally because i have their glam shadow  and a few lip items and love them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I realized how long I had been using my Urban Decay Naked Palette and thought I should buy a new set of \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; shadows.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this when doing other people makeup.</li>
            <li> The only one I have anything even remotely negative to say is the white gold glitter, it goes on a bit thin for my liking but is easily build able when wet</li>
            <li> The shadows don&#x27;t feel excessively powdery and they last pretty long on me.</li>
            <li> Now that the case is broken, I waste more of the shadow because it&#x27;s crumbling and falling all over makeup bag</li>
            <li> It was slightly smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Its a grey.</li>
            <li> Even with daily use, I still haven&#x27;t made a dent in the amount of product I have - continues to looks brand new and hardly used, so</li>
            <li> i bought it and had to turn around and buy an other nudes pallet from a different manufacturer, going to send this one to my niece who likes to do monster makeup.</li>
            <li> There second color over on the left is a little shimmery, but not distracting.</li>
            <li> I got curious about it after seeing a Pinterest tutorial for smoky eyes.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, not chalky or gritty.  </li>
            <li> what I expected; I just use it to catch any stray eye makeup and prevent smudging of eyeliner</li>
            <li> The shadows are not very pigmented at all.</li>
            <li> Compact with just the right colors at a price that won&#x27;t make me feel guilty if I decide to toss it in a couple of months in favor of something else.</li>
            <li> I needed something natural and subtle.</li>
            <li> The pigment is dull, it barely shows up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paired some of these colors with other eyeshadows as well</li>
            <li> other than that i like all the colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pretty iridescent shimmer to it or anything.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented!</li>
            <li> small enough to slip into my purse or make up bag.</li>
            <li> The other plus, is it is a fraction of the price of other department store collections, and woks just as well!</li>
            <li> The two dark shades are matt.</li>
            <li> The neural tones can highlight the eye area and the dark color on the end</li>
            <li> This is an average eyeshadow, but if you want density of color, apply with a brush, rather than with a sponge tip applicator.</li>
            <li> Now, I use it everyday although I have three other palettes (Lancome and Clinique).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something sheer and subtle, this is for you.</li>
            <li> However the 2 shades in the middle are so poorly pigmented.</li>
            <li> The texture is not very good quality either.</li>
            <li> It came completely broken and unusable</li>
            <li> Palette was broken when I got it.  </li>
            <li> This showed up completely broken.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed with this</li>
            <li> However the dark brown was nothing but a disappointment to me :c</li>
            <li> the price is wrong it i guess?</li>
            <li> False!</li>
            <li> recommended on YouTube, this was disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> so you know no one had their dirty fingers in there.</li>
            <li> Just stinks that you have to do that in order to use it.</li>
            <li> Im one for very casual make up looks.</li>
            <li> Or bad.....</li>
            <li> I guess it was a stupid idea to have makeup shipped.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Palette is awesome. Luv the colors and how affordable it is. Great pigment and perfect for on the go eye shadow.</li>
            <li> The colors look lovely in the pan, but when applied, they don&#x27;t even have enough pigment to show up on my skin, and I am very very fair.</li>
            <li> recommended on YouTube, this was disappointing to me. Out of the 6 colors, only 3 are usable for me. No mirror, but the applicator is functional when out and about.</li>
            <li> With the proper primer, this palette can give some higher end brands a run for their money. Very consumer friendly and the perfect set to switch up from day to a night look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Items came fast but it does not show up good u have to apply so many layers for it to say up</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the looks of this product as I thought it would be larger but it&#x27;s the size of your palm.&lt;br /&gt;However, the product is great.</li>
            <li> nice colors.  goes on with ease</li>
            <li> Very sheer and light even above primer .</li>
            <li> excellent product, responsible for, recommended</li>
            <li> Took me awhile to grow warm to this palette.  Now, I use it everyday although I have three other palettes (Lancome and Clinique).  I only use the two shades on the right.  Some primer is needed for the colors to stay.  They are very natural after blending, just right for work.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t go on well. its kind of cakey. i bought it and had to turn around and buy an other nudes pallet from a different manufacturer, going to send this one to my niece who likes to do monster makeup. so it will get used but not as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the colors are nice they just don&#x27;t really adhere well, they kind of chunk up in the pallet and they are very pale compared to what they look like. It&#x27;s really not a reflection of other nyx products generally because i have their glam shadow  and a few lip items and love them.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are pretty. Nice sparkle to the lighter ones. But the case broke the first day. Now that the case is broken, I waste more of the shadow because it&#x27;s crumbling and falling all over makeup bag</li>
            <li> i loved this product, the eyeshadow colors were perfect. I always practice with make up and i buy most of my things from amazon. i dont like to give my face a too overdone look so i keep it natural with a no make up make up look and these eyeshadows do the job for me. i will be buying more of these after i run out, its a must have now. if i am running out i must purchase more, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette! Now if you use a primer with this eye shadow it looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. It even came sealed in plastic so you know no one had their dirty fingers in there. Arrived before expected, very happy.</li>
            <li> Great palette for every day use. Requires a little extra in order for some of the lighter colors to show, but on my fair skin it&#x27;s still quite nice with just a few strokes. Very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking, like the name implies. I&#x27;ve paired some of these colors with other eyeshadows as well and it&#x27;s very versatile. Great purchase! Even with daily use, I still haven&#x27;t made a dent in the amount of product I have - continues to looks brand new and hardly used, so I would said there&#x27;s a decent amount of makeup per pot.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful neutral collection of beautiful colors!  This product is great for the a first eyeshadow collection, or from someone who wants a great collection of neutral colors!  The other plus, is it is a fraction of the price of other department store collections, and woks just as well!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!  Long lasting, cruelty free and delivered to my doorstep.  What else could a girl want!</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I am using the darker shades as eye brow powder :P</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she used this a lot.</li>
            <li> It came completely broken and unusable</li>
            <li> I buy makeup that I like. It can be from  Wal mart or Neiman Marcus.  The makeup is Neiman Marcus quality at a Walmart price.</li>
            <li> I like NYX Cosmetics Natural Eye Shadow Palette TNS01  very much.It makes my eyes more beautiful. l advice my friend to get it.</li>
            <li> Really like these eyeshadows. They look great and last all day. Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Use it almost every day. Perfect for the more muted tones that go well with red hair and hazel eyes</li>
            <li> I would not normally have any reason to review this product, except I am that compelled to tell you IT IS WONDERFUL. I got curious about it after seeing a Pinterest tutorial for smoky eyes. I was like, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s expensive and even if I spring for it, I&#x27;m not going to look like that Instagram model&amp;#34;. False! A) It&#x27;s like $7 and B) I have gotten so many compliments after incorporating this into my routine vs. the two-swipe plan I had been doing. You do want to buy better brushes. I use three brushes (4th color all over, 5th color for the lid/recess area, #1 for the highlight) and then the brush that comes with it for the liner (#6). It takes like five minutes and costs $7. How can you not have this?</li>
            <li> I got this palette cause I was running out of my favorite light tan and needed some new good neutrals. Can I just say I am not disappointed, the pigmentations on these are terrific and the wear is great. The only one I have anything even remotely negative to say is the white gold glitter, it goes on a bit thin for my liking but is easily build able when wet so not a big loss. Overall great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this palette because I love neutral eye shadows and could see myself getting a lot of use out of it. However the 2 shades in the middle are so poorly pigmented. Yes I want a natural look, but I still need pigmentation! If you do purchase this or have it, it is still usable. All you need to do is purchase a white eyeshadow stick, I got mine from L.A. Colors in Seashell, which is a matte white. Put that on your eyelid first. Then you can apply this and you will get pigmentation, so I can now use it. Just stinks that you have to do that in order to use it.</li>
            <li> These are really nice eye shadows. Not super pigmented, but easy to build up. All the colors go very well together and blend nicely.</li>
            <li> Palette was broken when I got it.  The colors that weren&#x27;t destroyed in the shipping did not cover well or last.  Would not buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE the natural colors of this palette. the only thing is that the eye shadow is very powdery so when i apply it, it goes everywhere and i have to build the colors up. other than that i like all the colors. great for a natural make up look which i wear everyday:)</li>
            <li> A very nice eyeshadows i really liked it</li>
            <li> These are Neutral tones perfect for my career. I needed something natural and subtle. Can&#x27;t beat such a low price too. There second color over on the left is a little shimmery, but not distracting. The Darkest color on the end is great for shading the crease or sides of my eyes. I use the furthest color on the left as a highlight and the other 3 colors are good for lid coverage or blending. It comes with an applicator, but I use all of my own brushes. I am very satisfied! Just what I needed some natural and neutral looking tones. :)</li>
            <li> havent tried it yet but for nyx im sure it will be fair (you get what you pay for) my only fear was that this product would be broken or old but it looks nice and fresh. looks good. cant wait to try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a present for my friend! Thank you so much, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find palettes of nice colors like this, love it!</li>
            <li> This little palette is wonderful for everyday. The shadows don&#x27;t feel excessively powdery and they last pretty long on me. Pigmentation is great, and the range of colors between light and dark is perfect for everyday. There is also a good range of matte and shimmer which is nice for creating dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is great and perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li> This showed up completely broken. The inside of the box was covered in eyeshadow. I guess it was a stupid idea to have makeup shipped. Also, the colors are much darker than they look.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4. The product depends on how you like to wear eyeshadow. If you want a bold look then don&#x27;t buy it but if you want it to look natural and add a tint to your eyes then buy it. After all it is called natural for a reason.</li>
            <li> Best color combo, and stays on as well!  Washes right off when needed. Blends very well. I love it very much!</li>
            <li> This is a great nude palette. It arrived quickly and in one piece!</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful and the coverage is excellent. The palette arrived on time and in secure packaging. I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good quality.  I love NYX makeup products and this is excellent too. Definitely I recommend this eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> I believe this is an urban decay naked pallet dupe! This pallete is incredible and such an amazing price, the colors are highly pigmented and as a mua i use them on all my clients! They blend so easy and look good on all skin types</li>
            <li> very nice makeup palette for everyday use. it fits anywhere and you can take it on the go. very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The last dark shade is what i use to perfect my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;But I mainly use this when doing other people makeup.</li>
            <li> This palette works so amazing, it has mostly matte shadows, plus one with chunky glitter, and one that is shimmery. I use this palette every day. The shadows are really pigmented, even though when I swatched them they looked really sheer. These work great with an eyelid primer, and they don&#x27;t crease. They are really blendable and I absoloutely love this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year-old daughter. She had this to say,&amp;#34;It is eye shadow. It works good.&amp;#34; If she is happy it is one less thing for her to complain to me about. Yay! :)</li>
            <li> The package came quickly, and had good packaging. The colors are nice, but they dont really show on your eyes unless you use a lot of it. Overall, its okay, but I definitely expected better from the brand.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great product. I use 4 of the colors and even one as a highlighter for contouring. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like it but I wish that it was more pigmented, it lacks in that department. But the colors are nice, I just have to apply a generous amount to get the shade that I want as a WOF. (Woman of Color).</li>
            <li> I got mine within 3 days of ordering and I love it! It&#x27;s really quality and the colors are great because they&#x27;re natural and don&#x27;t make you look like you have crayon all over your eyes. It was slightly smaller than I expected but I still really like it and would recommend it to you</li>
            <li> Very sheer colors, but still very pretty. Shipped very quick.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is a very good bargain.  I have tried most drugstore lines, as well as a couple of department store eyeshadows and this one is by far the best to me.  It goes on smoothly, not chalky or gritty.  I love the color selection- they look very natural.  NYX has turned out to be my go-to for makeup these days.</li>
            <li> I love the colors because they are light, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I constantly use this eyeshadow EVERY time i got out it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This shadow palette is perfect for casual days and is amazing quality. The only con about it is that the palette although seems big is now bigger than my hand (i&#x27;m 11). Comes with a large dual sided applicator and was delivered 2 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> Nice workable eye shadow palette. Goes on smoothly with no flaking. I&#x27;ll surely buy more</li>
            <li> too chalky, no pigment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided that matte is the quality I like which makes this palette ALMOST perfect.  The second last brown tone has a sparkle to it.  If it weren&#x27;t for that, it would be a perfect 5 star rating.  Other than that, this is a great palette for day time and a clean, neutral look.</li>
            <li> Love this palette...has all the colors you need for a nude look!</li>
            <li> I wanted to post a review because I feel like someone else with green eyes could really benefit from this palette. I purchased this when I realized how long I had been using my Urban Decay Naked Palette and thought I should buy a new set of \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; shadows. Let me point out that in comparison, I prefer the Urban Decay Palette because the colors are more neutral and easier to blend. In this palette the colors aren&#x27;t coordinated as well, there is high shimmer shadows next to matte shadows etc. The color right before the darkest brown isn&#x27;t a brown, it&#x27;s definitely more of a dark taupe that makes my green eyes pop. All in all, I&#x27;d say this is a good beginners pallette.. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything great as far as color payoff goes (even while using a primer) but the colors look great on my eyelid while I work for 8 hours so that says something.</li>
            <li> I really love NYX, and overall I think this is a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: the colors are excellent, and perfect for creating a more natural look.  The pigmentation for the darker colors is fairly good.  With the use of primer, you can get a great look with these colors, and the price is very reasonable for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: the consistency is a bit powdery, and there is definitely a major fall-out hazard trying to use these.  The pigmentation for the darker colors is good, but I&#x27;m not super impressed with the lighter ones.  Primer is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are definitely better palettes out there, but this is good quality for the expense.</li>
            <li> no problem with product and Amazon delivery, Good quality et Perfect for the more muted tones.&lt;br /&gt;l advice my friend to get it.</li>
            <li> Thank you!!! Great product &amp; Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural color! I love it! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and well, what do you expect? The pigment is dull, it barely shows up. Meh. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Compact with just the right colors at a price that won&#x27;t make me feel guilty if I decide to toss it in a couple of months in favor of something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have all NYX makeup if the full-face products (foundation, etc) didn&#x27;t irritate my eczema. However, I have no problems with their eyeshadow and liners and they are great!</li>
            <li> I love that the colors are matte</li>
            <li> The color palate is exactly what I was looking for. Also smooth, blendable and super inexpensive. My new fave! Purchased order from BeFlurt and received two days sooner than expected delivery date which was a nice added surprise. Def a must buy. :)</li>
            <li> You have to apply alot</li>
            <li> My first look at this product i loved it! The colors seem really vibrant and good looking. I love that it says natural because they really are, i think i can play a lot with these.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this eye Shadow. Its beautiful and the colors are rich, matte. Love this. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My favorite color pallet ! Love it</li>
            <li> This pallete is okay..&lt;br /&gt;But its not pigmented at all .</li>
            <li> Im one for very casual make up looks. This product is all you need. I use this palette every day! For work, for University and for a day out with the girls</li>
            <li> what I expected; I just use it to catch any stray eye makeup and prevent smudging of eyeliner</li>
            <li> Perfect item just what I needed great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. The eyeshadows are nicely pigmented and I didn&#x27;t notice any fall out. I&#x27;m really starting to love NYX products</li>
            <li> fast delivery I really needed a neutral palette. the colors weren&#x27;t vibrant pigments if that makes since but with a bit of primer they work well.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I expected the colors to be mostly neutral, but one is slightly green in color.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this palette again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying NYX and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I have blue eyes, so I typically where brown eyeshadows and was excited to try these colors. This palette is just OK. The colors are nice, but they are not very pigmented, so you have to use a lot. I like to wear more shimmery colors, and most of these are matte, which makes them stand out even less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read online that this palette was similar to Urban Decay&#x27;s Basics Palette, which is gorgeous and expensive. I guess you get what you pay for when NYX is only $9. This is nothing like Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; prince. Great delivery.</li>
            <li> Love  these colors.  But I wish they would figure out a way to include a decent application brush</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenager and she loves it.... :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for an excellent product! Very much I recommend to get! Excellent thing! The price and quality at high level! To use very simply!</li>
            <li> I loved it .... I loved ... :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived fine and everything, but it just isnt pigmented. I think if you wanna know more you should watch youtubers reviewing it to kno what i mean. It does the job tho</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but this pallette was too light! The colors are barely pigmented. The darkest brown is a good shade but the others are much too light!</li>
            <li> The colors are good... But the actually eye shadow itself seems kind of cheap and dull. It&#x27;s definitely matte colors. There&#x27;s no pretty iridescent shimmer to it or anything. I guess the quad itself is convenient but for better quality I&#x27;d rather just find matching colors from my Bh Cosmetics palette and use those. I love nyx products and prices, so I&#x27;m definitely not trying to bash the company. I have plenty of nyx products that I love. This is one that I&#x27;m just not crazy about. But hey, that&#x27;s my opinion. It&#x27;s cheap enough to trial and error yourself.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. I would say that the lighter colors show up better if you put an eye primer down. They also blend really well. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it came very quickly!  They blend very nicely and they are perfect for my natural look. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Ok so i bought this because ive needed some stuff to try out a pallet of any type . somethin! And i though ok this may be good. Or bad..... Bad!!! First the shimmery white color is beautiful but chalky. The two dark shades are matt. Theyre ok. But very very cool toned. In the picture they look much more warm. The darkest color is not black. No. Its a grey. All the colors are muted and chalky. The light colors are only good for blending as they have no..NO color pay off and im borderline albino . please dont buy this expecting much. You could do better ladies:) (and gentlemen)</li>
            <li> I really like these colors.  Also there is a lot of product which I like.  These will work with many different things which is a bonus.  The shadows stay on well with the help of eye primer.</li>
            <li> When I got this product I was figuring the colors weren&#x27;t going to be that pigmented for the price I got them for. I ordered December 9 and got my palette December 13. When I opened the package the product was wrapped up really good took some scissors to get the bubble wrap off:) Lol But when I opened nothing was broken and it was all good. The colors that are in there are a pinkish color, sparkly gold, light light pink (Which is the orange looking color in the picture!), light brown, golden brown, and then the darkest color looks a bit black, but has a brownish tint to it. I recommend this product for anyone who wants the warm look for that budget but this is a awesome deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good quality for the price. Colors are great. Fits in purse which is a plus. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This palette is great. I love the colors! Im more of a &#x27;neutral color&#x27; kind of girl so these are perfect</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this palette, but was very disapointed with it. The shadows are not very pigmented at all. You have to use a tone to even see it. The texture is not very good quality either. Also the darker colors do not blend out at all.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this palette, but when I got it, the colors barely showed up and didn&#x27;t have much pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Some colors have more pigmentation than others, and that makes it hard to blend anything to be honest, however the shimmery gold was amazing, and the light brow. However the dark brown was nothing but a disappointment to me :c I want to give it 4 stars because I was so EXCITED to get it but it&#x27;s okay.. the price is wrong it i guess?</li>
            <li> Love the colors but not so pigmented</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice palette, but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> cute light colors for a natural look</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented! If you&#x27;re looking for something sheer and subtle, this is for you. I understand that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; palette, but the taupe/brown/tan colors are pretty much nonexistent.</li>
            <li> Awesome little eyeshadow palette. The neural tones can highlight the eye area and the dark color on the end is my go to if I am aiming for a smokey eye look. Nice vivid colors that apply to my eye area smoothly without eye primer and I&#x27;m african american so it&#x27;ll definitely show on anyone lighter than my tone. small enough to slip into my purse or make up bag.</li>
            <li> when I received this product one of the colors from the palette had spilled EVERYWHERE . The color pay off sucked and it easily came off. I regret this purchase  &amp; I feel played....</li>
            <li> Love all the colors especially the 3 darker shades. I wear them almost every day! Works best with NYX primer!</li>
            <li> much brightness a bit dusty but ok for the price</li>
            <li> I loved this pallet but there is very little in each one. I use shadow brushes and felt that they ran out really quick. Yes they are affordable but I don&#x27;t feel like I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I felt that it didn&#x27;t show the colors on my eyes and the powder would go all over my face</li>
            <li> Love the soft colors. Easy and nice results. Would buy again</li>
            <li> This is an average eyeshadow, but if you want density of color, apply with a brush, rather than with a sponge tip applicator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, and the colors come in a range of really useful shades. They stay on pretty well with a primer. I thought the pigmentation could be better for the light colors.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great palette! I use it a lot.</li>
