            <li>Good for the environment and our bodys.</li>
            <li>Good quality and works to block sun ...</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as everything I read stated it was chemical free and great for people who are allergic to the chemical sunblock.  </li>
            <li>When you have to slather yourself with this stuff to wear it all day, it&#x27;s really nice to not have the smell.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and an effective sun screen.</li>
            <li>Solbar is by far the best sunscreen product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>But I truly am glad I purchased this</li>
            <li>and I fell it more oily</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s noncomedogenic and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on</li>
            <li>As with most of the products I have tried, it does feel a bit greasy immediately after application.</li>
            <li>It blends in well, and gives better coverage than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been buying it at my pharmacy, but this price was much better.</li>
            <li>They sell this brand at my dermatologists office, I get a better price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an outdoor Californian who spend lots of time enjoying the outdoors and</li>
            <li>sure whats going on with that</li>
            <li>cheap but effective</li>
            <li>Over time, you see most people build up tan</li>
            <li>Another one of the chief things I love about this is that there is NO FRAGRANCE.  </li>
            <li>Best Sunscreen EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use sunscreen daily, summer or winter, after being diagnosed with melanoma.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I have very fair skin and are prone to sun damage and burning, it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that really protects my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, probably good, for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Also in comparison to other zinc sunblock, this is the best priced!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, and rubs in well</li>
            <li>This sunscreen spreads easily &amp; isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li>It does not come out easily.  </li>
            <li>It does stain clothing, so make sure if you get it on something, wash it off with soap and water right away; otherwise it&#x27;ll not come off easy</li>
            <li>I challenge this distributor to guarantee that this product is from the manufacturer and not an adulterated, cheap mixture.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally olive/tan complexion, and tan very easily without burning, but I thought I had better protect my exposed skin, since I knew we would be out for hours at a time.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>I originally received a sample of the product at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>By the time I have done that, most of the greasiness has gone and I&#x27;m ready to play!</li>
            <li>Purchased this on the recommendation of my dermatologist and as usual it was great adviceâ€” this sunscreen works!</li>
            <li>I put it on my face every morning - goes on easily and is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Solbar and it is so gentle but does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>good product shared extra bottles with friends</li>
            <li>We love it, and the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is odor free and very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to redness, and this does not irritate at all, and I can use it on my face safely.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>It is not scent free; it has an overwhelming regular sunblock smell, which also lingers even after you wash it</li>
            <li>But, to me, it&#x27;s worth it, because there definitely isn&#x27;t a flawless sunscreen out there at all, if you&#x27;re really looking for something with serious coverage.  </li>
            <li>Most zinc screens are greasy and make my face shiney, which is not pretty, but Solbar is smooth like lotion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinned with reddish hair and light eyes, and I really need the coverage.  </li>
            <li>, you can only get it off by using good old soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I apply it every day that I&#x27;m going to be outside for more than 10 minutes at a time</li>
            <li>I really love this and that says a lot because I religiously forget to wear sunblock!</li>
            <li>He was buying it through her for several dollars more a tube.  </li>
            <li>I use this because I&#x27;ve been told by eththeticians that the only worthwhile sunscreens are zinc-based.  </li>
            <li>Not floral, not medicinal, not fake coconut--NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>This product really works !</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended we try this sunscreen because its zinc, and it still rubs in without staying chalky white or drying the kids skin more.</li>
            <li>It has zinc, and that block a lot more of the sun&#x27;s rays and lasts longer than regular sunblock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and realized that most of the ingredients (except the zinc) are alsoin the regular sunblock that the person I was travelling with had been using.  </li>
            <li>I am using it for my face before I put on my foundation and it is not greasy or heavy and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The product worked very well for my husband, it was really unscented, was not too thick (as so many sunscreens we have used on him are) and it soaked into his skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Hubby, who has a very fair complexion, and unfortunately, several bouts of skin cancer treatments over the years was given a few samples of this product by his dermatologist.</li>
            <li>excellent, what my dermatologist says to get, tough protection from strong sun which is what I have here where  i live in Southern California</li>
            <li>And, even with my fair skin, I can see a tiny bit of white residue build up around my neck and the inside of my elbow.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, soaks in doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin.  </li>
            <li>We were taking a trip to CA, and knew we would be spending most of our time in the full sun, exploring a few beach areas, going to Sea World, etc.</li>
            <li>thanks works well use it daily,more often in the summer.</li>
            <li>It really stays on while swimming.</li>
            <li>it was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was recommended by our dermatologist for protection from the intense Arizona sun.</li>
            <li>So the product works REALLY well.</li>
            <li>The product works very well and does all that I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>You would really have to look closely to see the lightening effect.</li>
            <li>I just wish we could get it in larger sizes, which would be more economical and would last longer--we have to re-order this a lot.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does blend in fast even though others have stated it doesn&#x27;t, just keep rubbing!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy and doesn&#x27;t come off just by wiping it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has kept my sensitive facial skin &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is not water safe in the sense that when you get into the water (no matter how long you have waited) you immediately see a large pool of sunblock in the water-much more than usual sunblock</li>
            <li>It actually worked a little TOO good for me, not allowing my skin to tan at all,</li>
            <li>I am allergic to main stream chemical sunblock.  </li>
            <li>But, of course, the most important result is that I have had very few instances of actinic keratosis (pre-cancerous skin damage) since using Solbar and no further development of carcinomas in the 7 years that I have been using</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this sunblock for people with skin problems.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more moisturizing than I prefer for my face, although some people do prefer that.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other sun blocks, it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Whether or not you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend this stuff over the drugstore products that advertise high SPF.  </li>
            <li>This is our new go to sunblock.</li>
            <li>While other people are running around as rednecks, with red noses and burned shoulders and hands, this gives phenomenal protection.  </li>
            <li>but they have moved to only higher number SPFs and wanted something in the 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But the white color disappears fast and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
            <li>In addition to working really well against harmful rays, this sunscreen blends in really REALLY well, almost the same as regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My young daughter likes it as well.  </li>
            <li>It has more of a thick creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>Great product not greasy and thick like zinc usually is  </li>
            <li>It is not difficult to copy packaging, much more difficult to duplicate the contents.</li>
            <li>In the future I&#x27;ll go back to them and deal with the higher number SPFs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I live in Florida, sunscreen is essential.</li>
            <li>The new packaging has been updated to an orange and white tube, and that&#x27;s what they sent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only sunscreens containing zinc that is translucent, very near transparent.</li>
            <li>first started using it on the recommendation of my dermatologist, mainly because of the zinc content that protects against both UVA and UVB, but found that the price on Amazon is half that of the local stores, if they even carry it.  </li>
            <li>For you other burners out there, this is a product that absolutely works.</li>
            <li>Recently, my skin became sensitive to various sunscreens.</li>
            <li>first here are the few positives:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>This was once recommended to me by my dermatologist due that I have very sensitive skin and break in hives when using regular sun block.</li>

            <li> excellent, what my dermatologist says to get, tough protection from strong sun which is what I have here where  i live in Southern California</li>
            <li> And, even with my fair skin, I can see a tiny bit of white residue build up around my neck and the inside of my elbow.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, soaks in doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin.  </li>
            <li> We were taking a trip to CA, and knew we would be spending most of our time in the full sun, exploring a few beach areas, going to Sea World, etc.</li>
            <li> thanks works well use it daily,more often in the summer.</li>
            <li> It really stays on while swimming.</li>
            <li> it was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It was recommended by our dermatologist for protection from the intense Arizona sun.</li>
            <li> So the product works REALLY well.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and does all that I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> You would really have to look closely to see the lightening effect.</li>
            <li> I just wish we could get it in larger sizes, which would be more economical and would last longer--we have to re-order this a lot.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does blend in fast even though others have stated it doesn&#x27;t, just keep rubbing!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and doesn&#x27;t come off just by wiping it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has kept my sensitive facial skin &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is not water safe in the sense that when you get into the water (no matter how long you have waited) you immediately see a large pool of sunblock in the water-much more than usual sunblock</li>
            <li> It actually worked a little TOO good for me, not allowing my skin to tan at all,</li>
            <li> I am allergic to main stream chemical sunblock.  </li>
            <li> But, of course, the most important result is that I have had very few instances of actinic keratosis (pre-cancerous skin damage) since using Solbar and no further development of carcinomas in the 7 years that I have been using</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this sunblock for people with skin problems.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more moisturizing than I prefer for my face, although some people do prefer that.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other sun blocks, it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Whether or not you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend this stuff over the drugstore products that advertise high SPF.  </li>
            <li> This is our new go to sunblock.</li>
            <li> While other people are running around as rednecks, with red noses and burned shoulders and hands, this gives phenomenal protection.  </li>
            <li> but they have moved to only higher number SPFs and wanted something in the 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> But the white color disappears fast and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> In addition to working really well against harmful rays, this sunscreen blends in really REALLY well, almost the same as regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My young daughter likes it as well.  </li>
            <li> It has more of a thick creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> Great product not greasy and thick like zinc usually is  </li>
            <li> It is not difficult to copy packaging, much more difficult to duplicate the contents.</li>
            <li> In the future I&#x27;ll go back to them and deal with the higher number SPFs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I live in Florida, sunscreen is essential.</li>
            <li> The new packaging has been updated to an orange and white tube, and that&#x27;s what they sent.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only sunscreens containing zinc that is translucent, very near transparent.</li>
            <li> first started using it on the recommendation of my dermatologist, mainly because of the zinc content that protects against both UVA and UVB, but found that the price on Amazon is half that of the local stores, if they even carry it.  </li>
            <li> For you other burners out there, this is a product that absolutely works.</li>
            <li> Recently, my skin became sensitive to various sunscreens.</li>
            <li> first here are the few positives:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> This was once recommended to me by my dermatologist due that I have very sensitive skin and break in hives when using regular sun block.</li>
            <li> My face used to break out from other sunscreens but my face has been clear since using Solbar.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that is a little oily but all sunscreen is so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I used it last week and within the first few times using it I immediately broke out in hives as I usually do with regular sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I use Solbar all year long on my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts a long time when you order the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li> and it stays there for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this sun screen for several years, ever since a bout with basal cell carcinoma due to sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and had a lot of sun exposure as a child and teenager, so I&#x27;m very careful about protecting my face and neck from further damage.  </li>
            <li> During this time I also noticed that the consistency was gritty and heavy, not smooth and lightweight as contained in the new tube I just purchased from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise everyone to check the ingredients (both active and non-active) against your regular sunblock if you are allergic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s been around 4 years now, and I still use it every single day.</li>
            <li> bought this product as I usually use Zinc Clear</li>
            <li> A small amount daily is all that is needed, and the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used to think that this sunscreen was expensive but it is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> However, I wet my hand with water, than put the lotion to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just hope the product itself is the same as the single tube I have ordered in the past..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sunblocks that did iritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and they are either greasy, or pasty, or cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (burn) lines with just about every other product, no matter what the hype is for their product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other sunscreens for the face and all of them irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li> There is something a bit annoying about the smell of most sunscreens, whch I tolerate in the summer, but it is aweful in the winter.</li>
            <li> One application lasts half day.</li>
            <li> Solbar Zinc is a creamy sunscreen and takes a little while to absorb, so plan ahead.  </li>
            <li> I can use it everyday and do.</li>
            <li> , so I bought a few bottles of the stuff.</li>
            <li> One thing to watch, when you are sweating heavily, you don&#x27;t want to get this stuff into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Heavy consistancy goes on well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Very little scent, so you won&#x27;t smell chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I usually wipe any excess off my hands with paper towel.  </li>
            <li> and I use hard contacts in one word</li>
            <li> I use a lighter weight less expensive one for my arms and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald and this keeps me from being in serious pain all summer.</li>
            <li> Not so thick that it gets gloppy when I try to spread it, not so thin that it runs when I start to sweat.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> Needless to say we treated a lot of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> My children get terrible eczema and sunscreen along with chlorine made it worse.</li>
            <li> Now I have to go through a painful session (or maybe two of them) for laser removal of the sun damage that will cost between $500-$1000.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this sun screen for several years, ever since a bout with basal cell carcinoma due to sun damage.  I apply it every day that I&#x27;m going to be outside for more than 10 minutes at a time and I am very pleased with the results.  Unlike other sun blocks, it is easy to apply.  Not so thick that it gets gloppy when I try to spread it, not so thin that it runs when I start to sweat.  But, of course, the most important result is that I have had very few instances of actinic keratosis (pre-cancerous skin damage) since using Solbar and no further development of carcinomas in the 7 years that I have been using Solbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using it on the recommendation of my dermatologist, mainly because of the zinc content that protects against both UVA and UVB, but found that the price on Amazon is half that of the local stores, if they even carry it.  Whether or not you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend this stuff over the drugstore products that advertise high SPF.  It&#x27;s not just the SPF that matters, but also the ingredients.  Solbar is the best on the market, I think.</li>
            <li> Great product. Rated well on EWG. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power, you do have to reapply. But the white color disappears fast and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy. It&#x27;s our go-to sunblock. Good price for 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> I originally received a sample of the product at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Solbar Zinc is a creamy sunscreen and takes a little while to absorb, so plan ahead.  It&#x27;s gentle, probably good, for the skin.  The over-the-counter zinc sunscreen I tried tended to irritate my skin, so I went back to ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This was once recommended to me by my dermatologist due that I have very sensitive skin and break in hives when using regular sun block. Itâ€™s been around 4 years now, and I still use it every single day. Only thing is that is a little oily but all sunscreen is so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunblock for years now.  I like it because it is odor free and very gentle on my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other sunblocks that did iritate my skin.  It desolves into the skin within minutes.  No sunburn wherever Solbar is applied.  I use Solbar all year long on my face.  I would highly recommend this sunblock for people with skin problems.</li>
            <li> Recently, my skin became sensitive to various sunscreens. Since I live in Florida, sunscreen is essential. A friend recommended Solbar and it is so gentle but does an outstanding job. It also does not leave a white film on your skin. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I really love this and that says a lot because I religiously forget to wear sunblock! But I truly am glad I purchased this it doesn&#x27;t make me greasy or white both of which I abhor about sunblock. I gave it a try and it gave me a great product! EVERYONE IS SUBJECTED TO MY RANTINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT LMBO lol ha ha its really awesome</li>
            <li> The picture of the product is not the same as what arrived.  I just hope the product itself is the same as the single tube I have ordered in the past..</li>
            <li> great product but need travel size (3 OZ) for TSA rules for flying</li>
            <li> Great product not greasy and thick like zinc usually is  I can use it everyday and do. Worth the price</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommend this to him.  He was buying it through her for several dollars more a tube.  This 3 pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li> the presentation is not the same and I fell it more oily and I use hard contacts in one word is not the same that I got last time</li>
            <li> Used this for years - great product</li>
            <li> I use this because I&#x27;ve been told by eththeticians that the only worthwhile sunscreens are zinc-based.  The problem is that I need to use it sparingly or I look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> thanks works well use it daily,more often in the summer.It really stays on while swimming.</li>
            <li> In addition to working really well against harmful rays, this sunscreen blends in really REALLY well, almost the same as regular sunscreen. Definitely recommend using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am always outdoors and it&#x27;s always sunny in So. Cal. and Solbar is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I put it on my face every morning - goes on easily and is easily absorbed. I love that it&#x27;s noncomedogenic and fragrance-free. My face used to break out from other sunscreens but my face has been clear since using Solbar. it was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I highly recommend it! I used to think that this sunscreen was expensive but it is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> For you other burners out there, this is a product that absolutely works. keep it in your car and sports bag</li>
            <li> Best protection for best price. One application lasts half day. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great sun protection. Does not penetrate into your skin&#x27;s inner layers so no chemicals enter your body.</li>
            <li> Used this since dx of Basil Cell Ca in 1998 ....... never had another problem since ! I love the way it goes on ,I wear it Daily rain shine or snow !</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and my grandchildren&#x27;s face. This product works great! I do suggest this product to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while, and can recommend it. Even after a lot of sun exposure, I find I have avoided being burned when I use it. As with most of the products I have tried, it does feel a bit greasy immediately after application. I usually wipe any excess off my hands with paper towel.  By the time I have done that, most of the greasiness has gone and I&#x27;m ready to play!</li>
            <li> The kids don&#x27;t complain when I put it on. Actually works (no sunburn). Rubs in well; not greasy. Good for the environment and our bodys. This is our new go to sunblock.</li>
            <li> Good quality and works to block sun ... Beware of expired sunscreen though because it will lose it&#x27;s affect.</li>
            <li> This micro zinc formula is perfect!!  I use it on my face and neck daily before applying makeup.  It blends in well, and gives better coverage than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It has more of a thick creamy consistency. I use a lighter weight less expensive one for my arms and shoulders.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and had a lot of sun exposure as a child and teenager, so I&#x27;m very careful about protecting my face and neck from further damage.  Very little scent, so you won&#x27;t smell chemicals.  My young daughter likes it as well.  The new packaging has been updated to an orange and white tube, and that&#x27;s what they sent.  No worries because they  haven&#x27;t update the picture.  They send me a current tube.  I&#x27;d been buying it at my pharmacy, but this price was much better.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is very effective.  Easy to apply, soaks in doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin.  They sell this brand at my dermatologists office, I get a better price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> provides protection without turning your face white</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Solbar. I have been using it for +5 years and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else. I&#x27;m an outdoor Californian who spend lots of time enjoying the outdoors and Solbar is by far the best sunscreen product I&#x27;ve ever used. I just recently had a skin check up, and my dermatologist commented on how well Solbar protects my skin. Buy it in the 3 pack, and keep one at home, one in the car and one at work.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Been using for 8 years - works excellent!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I have ever used.  I have very sensitive skin, prone to redness, and this does not irritate at all, and I can use it on my face safely.</li>
            <li> Best sun block. Does not irritate eyes. It was recommended by our dermatologist for protection from the intense Arizona sun.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen!  Ive been using it for 20 years</li>
            <li> Purchased this on the recommendation of my dermatologist and as usual it was great adviceâ€” this sunscreen works! My daughters and I have very fair skin and are prone to sun damage and burning, it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that really protects my skin. My daughter used it on recent trips to Florida and Vegasâ€”absolutely prevented burning through both trips. I use it daily since I&#x27;m outdoors everyday, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Hubby, who has a very fair complexion, and unfortunately, several bouts of skin cancer treatments over the years was given a few samples of this product by his dermatologist. This is one of the only sunscreens containing zinc that is translucent, very near transparent. We were taking a trip to CA, and knew we would be spending most of our time in the full sun, exploring a few beach areas, going to Sea World, etc., so I bought a few bottles of the stuff. The product worked very well for my husband, it was really unscented, was not too thick (as so many sunscreens we have used on him are) and it soaked into his skin nicely. I have a naturally olive/tan complexion, and tan very easily without burning, but I thought I had better protect my exposed skin, since I knew we would be out for hours at a time. It actually worked a little TOO good for me, not allowing my skin to tan at all, LOL. So the product works REALLY well. Great for hubby. It&#x27;s a keeper for him. I did appreciate the protection it gave my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, and rubs in well so it is not visible.  Helps me keep rosacea in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time when you order the 3 pack.  I&#x27;ve used other brands and they are either greasy, or pasty, or cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it five stars if it cured my rosacea.</li>
            <li> good product shared extra bottles with friends</li>
            <li> Although  I Like this product and have used it for years, The ad says PACK OF 3, I only received ONE 4 OUNCE TUBE...NOT A PACK OF 3&lt;br /&gt;Not sure whats going on with that but you might want to clarify before you purchase</li>
            <li> excellent, what my dermatologist says to get, tough protection from strong sun which is what I have here where  i live in Southern California&lt;br /&gt;not cheap but effective</li>
            <li> Works great and won&#x27;t sting your eyes when it melts off. I&#x27;m bald and this keeps me from being in serious pain all summer. Have used lots of sunscreens, this is the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen spreads easily &amp; isn&#x27;t too greasy. Pleasant fragrance &amp; delivers good protection.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and does all that I want it to do.  One thing to watch, when you are sweating heavily, you don&#x27;t want to get this stuff into your eyes.  It does not come out easily.  Don&#x27;t rub your eyes, and watch out when you wipe your brow.</li>
            <li> Been using it on my face for five years.  By itself, it is too greasy for me.  However, I wet my hand with water, than put the lotion to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has kept my sensitive facial skin &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; and healthy.  Recommend, even if you have eczema.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great!</li>
            <li> We like the tube and the consistency of the sun screen.  It works to keep away sunburn. We have been longtime users of this product.</li>
            <li> Worked for a Dermatologist for several years in a beach town. Needless to say we treated a lot of skin cancer. I always feel well protected with the Solbar Zinc. Does leave a sheen of opaqueness (great for covering Roseacea). You would really have to look closely to see the lightening effect. Heavy consistancy goes on well under makeup. Use year around.</li>
            <li> I started buying this at the recommendation of a dermatologist, and I use it faithfully for myself and two kiddos, with hubby using it occasionally.  We have lived in both southern California and overseas in the Middle East, where the sun is literally blistering year-round, and we swear by it.  While other people are running around as rednecks, with red noses and burned shoulders and hands, this gives phenomenal protection.  Over time, you see most people build up tan (burn) lines with just about every other product, no matter what the hype is for their product.  With this, there is truly no evidence of the sun having been there at all.  I&#x27;m very fair-skinned with reddish hair and light eyes, and I really need the coverage.  It&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t leave me with a farmer&#x27;s tan (burn, that is).  It&#x27;s a little more moisturizing than I prefer for my face, although some people do prefer that.  And, even with my fair skin, I can see a tiny bit of white residue build up around my neck and the inside of my elbow.  (Although it doesn&#x27;t stain.)  But, to me, it&#x27;s worth it, because there definitely isn&#x27;t a flawless sunscreen out there at all, if you&#x27;re really looking for something with serious coverage.  Another one of the chief things I love about this is that there is NO FRAGRANCE.  Not floral, not medicinal, not fake coconut--NOTHING.  When you have to slather yourself with this stuff to wear it all day, it&#x27;s really nice to not have the smell.  I just wish we could get it in larger sizes, which would be more economical and would last longer--we have to re-order this a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous sunscreens and this is the only one where I don&#x27;t break out with  rash.  Not greasy and an effective sun screen.</li>
            <li> Physical barrier, in this case zinc oxide , is what&#x27;s needed for UVA/UVB protection. This product really works !</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by my doctor, and it works great for rosacea.  A small amount daily is all that is needed, and the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> great sunscreen, husband had melanoma and his doctor recommended this.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I have tried other sunscreens for the face and all of them irritated my eyes.  Solbar has not caused any eye irritation for me.</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand of sun screen from my Dermatologist and could not get it anymore so I went on Amazon and discovered this product had the same ingredients so I ordered it.  I have been very satisfied.  I am using it for my face before I put on my foundation and it is not greasy or heavy and does a good job.  The price is reasonable and I would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey Dawson</li>
            <li> My children get terrible eczema and sunscreen along with chlorine made it worse. My dermatologist recommended we try this sunscreen because its zinc, and it still rubs in without staying chalky white or drying the kids skin more. We love it, and the whole family uses it. A little goes a long way also. We have them in every sport bag and bathroom in the house!</li>
            <li> I challenge this distributor to guarantee that this product is from the manufacturer and not an adulterated, cheap mixture. I purchased from them and have used this daily for several years only to find that it has not provided the sun protection that the same formula provided that came from my cosmetic physician. During this time I also noticed that the consistency was gritty and heavy, not smooth and lightweight as contained in the new tube I just purchased from the pharmacy. Of course the labeling on their packaging is nearly perfect (although not identical in font size to the pharmacy tube). It is not difficult to copy packaging, much more difficult to duplicate the contents. Now I have to go through a painful session (or maybe two of them) for laser removal of the sun damage that will cost between $500-$1000. Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> Best Sunscreen EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use sunscreen daily, summer or winter, after being diagnosed with melanoma. There is something a bit annoying about the smell of most sunscreens, whch I tolerate in the summer, but it is aweful in the winter. This has no scent with optimal coverage. Most zinc screens are greasy and make my face shiney, which is not pretty, but Solbar is smooth like lotion! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Like the texture. Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to the hype.  Read my reviews and that&#x27;ll help you decide whether or not to buy this product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as I usually use Zinc Clear but they have moved to only higher number SPFs and wanted something in the 30&#x27;s.  In the future I&#x27;ll go back to them and deal with the higher number SPFs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok first here are the few positives:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great price!! Getting the 3 pack saves you a lot of money!  Also in comparison to other zinc sunblock, this is the best priced!&lt;br /&gt;2. It does blend in fast even though others have stated it doesn&#x27;t, just keep rubbing!!&lt;br /&gt;3. It has zinc, and that block a lot more of the sun&#x27;s rays and lasts longer than regular sunblock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, here are the numerous negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does stain clothing, so make sure if you get it on something, wash it off with soap and water right away; otherwise it&#x27;ll not come off easy later.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s very greasy and doesn&#x27;t come off just by wiping it, you can only get it off by using good old soap and water.  Also it beads where you sweat and can run into your eyes and it BURNNNNS!!  If you don&#x27;t like this I&#x27;d recommend getting another for your face and use this on your body.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is not scent free; it has an overwhelming regular sunblock smell, which also lingers even after you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;4. This is not water safe in the sense that when you get into the water (no matter how long you have waited) you immediately see a large pool of sunblock in the water-much more than usual sunblock and it stays there for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;5. I am allergic to main stream chemical sunblock.  I bought this as everything I read stated it was chemical free and great for people who are allergic to the chemical sunblock.  I used it last week and within the first few times using it I immediately broke out in hives as I usually do with regular sunblock.  I read the ingredients and realized that most of the ingredients (except the zinc) are alsoin the regular sunblock that the person I was travelling with had been using.  I&#x27;d advise everyone to check the ingredients (both active and non-active) against your regular sunblock if you are allergic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these things helped you to decide if you&#x27;d buy this.  I would never buy it again, but that&#x27;s your choice!</li>
