            <li>Since my review though I have purchased again :)&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>and she was so impressed that not only did it sooth there was no burning or pain!  </li>

            <li>In love with this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>great item i cannot live without now</li>
            <li>the fact that it is all natural and completely safe is a huge plus!!!</li>
            <li>I love it, I was given this product for free for review.  </li>
            <li>It has a good strong spray that covers a nice sized area, was super easy to rub in if you spray to much.  </li>
            <li>So far, it looks great on (without a greasy feeling, once it absorbs).</li>
            <li>It absorbs really quickly and is nice and light on the skin while also being moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it stays in the liquid form regardless of the temperature so it can be quickly sprayed on whenever needed.</li>
            <li>Luckily we were able to transfer what didn&#x27;t spill into another spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I also spray it all over my belly as I am pregnant and it is great for keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li>There is no scent to the product, which is a huge bonus in my book as I don’t like scented moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Capriclear.</li>
            <li>They enjoy the feel of the oil on their skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth without the greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>It is a light oil</li>
            <li>I did some research and was happy to discover that the coconut oil is the only ingredient!  </li>
            <li>Light, odor free and does not stain my clothes.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you; my skin was incredibly smooth and it never peeled.</li>
            <li>I added some ylang ylang and now have a light, soothing scent whenever I apply it.</li>
            <li>This versatility is fabulous to me.</li>
            <li>It goes on light but provides moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This oil is not sticky and light on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li>This product is all I use on my skin to moisturize as it is light, absorbs nicely, and does not irritate me (I am very sensitive to most products and react quickly).  </li>
            <li>For this product my main use was skin moistener, and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>and I feel safe using it for my whole family!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This oil is ultra light weight and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eczema or not this product is amazing, it is a hidden treasure that more people should know about!</li>
            <li>I love that it is scent free because I am very sensitive to smells and dyes, etc.</li>
            <li>but the skin adores it and absorbs it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and my DR was pleased too.</li>
            <li>It still might be nice for general skin conditioning but didn&#x27;t do a thing for the psoriasis.</li>
            <li>She told me products normally hurt and burn more, but I used this spray on her</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to smell it all the time even though the smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants an easy spray on skin treatment</li>
            <li>I love that it is a spray because it is easy to apply on anyone but especially a toddler.  </li>
            <li>Based on her experience of that recent theft, and my retrieval of said item, she quickly ordered her own.</li>
            <li>It really is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I love having a natural way to lock moisture into my skin.</li>
            <li>and this has no artificial ingredients or preservatives.</li>
            <li>This dermatologist-formulated product is hypoallergenic and should work with even the most sensitive of skin.</li>
            <li>This is a really basic product, just fractionated coconut oil without any extras or fragrance of any kind.</li>
            <li>I like not having anything compete with perfume if I wear it and that I can add my own essential oils to customize it a bit.</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and am dealing with drier skin and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I use it for so many things, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I love that there is only one ingredient</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it consistently, but it leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>Super for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>but I was hoping that since it was pure oil that I would not have any issues with it.</li>
            <li>You can easily remedy the second option by spraying straight into your hands.</li>
            <li>It worked well on my dry itchy skin, absorbed pretty quickly and no odor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see this as an issue.</li>
            <li>I saw on the cap it is accepted by National Eczema Association and started using on my spots and it really helps with the itch and spots).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak in very well.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be real greasy because it is basically just coconut oil</li>
            <li>I REALLY want to like this product, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really helps with discoloration too.</li>
            <li>Capriclear is 100% natural and is only 1 ingredient-- coconut oil-- which i have found has many benefits</li>
            <li>The oil is light, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Capriclear to anyone who appreciates a light moisturizer that goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I are hooked, and we feel comfortable using it on our child due to the pure ingredient.</li>
            <li>but it is NOT fragrance free after a few hours smells kind of sour</li>
            <li>It is not irritating and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>Normally, my forehead and nose would peel for a week</li>
            <li>Even though I was showering her right after class is wasn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and moisturizes my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it to remove eye makeup, I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>if it wasn&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d love it :/</li>
            <li>I developed a rash from this!</li>
            <li>, my skin is so soft, my husband loves it too!</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out the smell factor was removed, but I still got all the benefits that come from using coconut oil!  </li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my skin unbelievable</li>
            <li>Last week I got extremely sunburned, mostly on my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li>You can buy the exact same thing, fractionated coconut oil, from the baking isle of your grocery or health food store for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle of this oil and have already purchased a second.</li>
            <li>really excited about this product because it makes it that much easier to use coconut oil as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just fell down the rabbit hole of researching fractionated coconut oil, and it appears that it’s the primary coconut oil that’s used in cosmetic and beauty products advertising the addition of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Just spray it on and no mess on your hands!  </li>
            <li>so all you are left with is a pure oil that won’t harden up when the oil gets above a certain temperature.</li>
            <li>Thumbs 👍Capri Clear</li>
            <li>Much easier to apply than regular coconut oil because it doesn&#x27;t harden up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no smell, I do love &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I always want to walk around smelling like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try other brands, too.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a small bottle at Walgreens when they offered Register Rewards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth, this is going to be used now in my everyday regimen</li>
            <li>I like that it does not contain any irritating ingredients and all the ingredients I can see are non-toxic and safe.</li>
            <li>I am personally unable to use many lotions because of how sensitive my skin is</li>
            <li>However, it does NOT dry and stays oily on my face for hours afterward.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So far, it looks great on (without a greasy feeling, once it absorbs).</li>
            <li> It absorbs really quickly and is nice and light on the skin while also being moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that it stays in the liquid form regardless of the temperature so it can be quickly sprayed on whenever needed.</li>
            <li> Luckily we were able to transfer what didn&#x27;t spill into another spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I also spray it all over my belly as I am pregnant and it is great for keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li> There is no scent to the product, which is a huge bonus in my book as I don’t like scented moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Capriclear.</li>
            <li> They enjoy the feel of the oil on their skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth without the greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> It is a light oil</li>
            <li> I did some research and was happy to discover that the coconut oil is the only ingredient!  </li>
            <li> Light, odor free and does not stain my clothes.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you; my skin was incredibly smooth and it never peeled.</li>
            <li> I added some ylang ylang and now have a light, soothing scent whenever I apply it.</li>
            <li> This versatility is fabulous to me.</li>
            <li> It goes on light but provides moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This oil is not sticky and light on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> This product is all I use on my skin to moisturize as it is light, absorbs nicely, and does not irritate me (I am very sensitive to most products and react quickly).  </li>
            <li> For this product my main use was skin moistener, and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> and I feel safe using it for my whole family!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This oil is ultra light weight and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eczema or not this product is amazing, it is a hidden treasure that more people should know about!</li>
            <li> I love that it is scent free because I am very sensitive to smells and dyes, etc.</li>
            <li> but the skin adores it and absorbs it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and my DR was pleased too.</li>
            <li> It still might be nice for general skin conditioning but didn&#x27;t do a thing for the psoriasis.</li>
            <li> She told me products normally hurt and burn more, but I used this spray on her</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to smell it all the time even though the smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants an easy spray on skin treatment</li>
            <li> I love that it is a spray because it is easy to apply on anyone but especially a toddler.  </li>
            <li> Based on her experience of that recent theft, and my retrieval of said item, she quickly ordered her own.</li>
            <li> It really is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I love having a natural way to lock moisture into my skin.</li>
            <li> and this has no artificial ingredients or preservatives.</li>
            <li> This dermatologist-formulated product is hypoallergenic and should work with even the most sensitive of skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really basic product, just fractionated coconut oil without any extras or fragrance of any kind.</li>
            <li> I like not having anything compete with perfume if I wear it and that I can add my own essential oils to customize it a bit.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and am dealing with drier skin and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I use it for so many things, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I love that there is only one ingredient</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it consistently, but it leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> Super for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> but I was hoping that since it was pure oil that I would not have any issues with it.</li>
            <li> You can easily remedy the second option by spraying straight into your hands.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my dry itchy skin, absorbed pretty quickly and no odor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see this as an issue.</li>
            <li> I saw on the cap it is accepted by National Eczema Association and started using on my spots and it really helps with the itch and spots).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak in very well.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be real greasy because it is basically just coconut oil</li>
            <li> I REALLY want to like this product, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really helps with discoloration too.</li>
            <li> Capriclear is 100% natural and is only 1 ingredient-- coconut oil-- which i have found has many benefits</li>
            <li> The oil is light, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Capriclear to anyone who appreciates a light moisturizer that goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I are hooked, and we feel comfortable using it on our child due to the pure ingredient.</li>
            <li> but it is NOT fragrance free after a few hours smells kind of sour</li>
            <li> It is not irritating and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Normally, my forehead and nose would peel for a week</li>
            <li> Even though I was showering her right after class is wasn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and moisturizes my super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove eye makeup, I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> if it wasn&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d love it :/</li>
            <li> I developed a rash from this!</li>
            <li> , my skin is so soft, my husband loves it too!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out the smell factor was removed, but I still got all the benefits that come from using coconut oil!  </li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my skin unbelievable</li>
            <li> Last week I got extremely sunburned, mostly on my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> You can buy the exact same thing, fractionated coconut oil, from the baking isle of your grocery or health food store for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of this oil and have already purchased a second.</li>
            <li> really excited about this product because it makes it that much easier to use coconut oil as an everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just fell down the rabbit hole of researching fractionated coconut oil, and it appears that it’s the primary coconut oil that’s used in cosmetic and beauty products advertising the addition of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Just spray it on and no mess on your hands!  </li>
            <li> so all you are left with is a pure oil that won’t harden up when the oil gets above a certain temperature.</li>
            <li> Thumbs 👍Capri Clear</li>
            <li> Much easier to apply than regular coconut oil because it doesn&#x27;t harden up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no smell, I do love &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I always want to walk around smelling like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend, especially if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try other brands, too.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a small bottle at Walgreens when they offered Register Rewards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth, this is going to be used now in my everyday regimen</li>
            <li> I like that it does not contain any irritating ingredients and all the ingredients I can see are non-toxic and safe.</li>
            <li> I am personally unable to use many lotions because of how sensitive my skin is</li>
            <li> However, it does NOT dry and stays oily on my face for hours afterward.</li>
            <li> like am old sour dish sponge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple dry oils because I have severe psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t one of the fractionated coconut oils that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but right when I brought my &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; one into work, my coworker, nabbed it right away and took it home with her :( ... since it was a Friday, I had to survive without it over the weekend.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product before i tried it, but i ABSOLUTELY LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> has helped also with dry itchy tops of my feet  </li>
            <li> use this on my son&#x27;s dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema, itchy dry skin all the time and after one use I noticed a difference .</li>
            <li> Living in Michigan, we get long, bitter winters and it takes a toll on our skin.</li>
            <li> The only down side it</li>
            <li> My sister also uses this to moisturize and treat the skin on her hands which are severely dry and rough from work.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to how long this product would last with daily use but for me (at least 3 uses per week)</li>
            <li> I was surprised to say the least.</li>
            <li> i spray it on while wet after shower and rub in....</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize well initially, however, after a few hours the moisturizing effect seems to wear off and I feel like I have to moisturize again.</li>
            <li> I can moisturize and then get dressed without having to wait a few extra minutes for the product to absorb and haven&#x27;t had any transfer onto any of my clothing.</li>
            <li> little sister has eczema and her hands are always dry and break out.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this oil is that it is not scented and it doesn&#x27;t have crap fillers.</li>
            <li> This product has helped to sooth rough patches without leaving a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I just wipe down with baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I use argon oil for my face and this feels slightly heavier.</li>
            <li> In less than 10 seconds they stopped itching.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using slight mist on damp skin after washing my face in the evening for moisture.</li>
            <li> They both have patches of eczema on their little bodies.  </li>
            <li> , it feels a little greasy.</li>
            <li> If I want a little moisturizing aromatherapy before going to bed, I mist the palm of my hand with this oil and include one drop of jasmine oil and press onto my face.</li>
            <li> Relief of scaly skin on legs, soften cuticles, stops the itch and flake of a few eczema spots on scalp</li>
            <li> Not to heavy</li>
            <li> No colors, scents or harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> and they end up crying.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few days to see if my skin got acclimated to it, but no, it just did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> I did not use this everyday</li>
            <li> Not sure about healing scars and all</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again, perhaps just to have it around.</li>
            <li> UR too lazy to rub</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizing oil a lot -- but the spray is vary hard to press.  </li>
            <li> spray is SO moisturizing without being in the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> know what I mean)</li>
            <li> : Also, I use it when my boys&#x27; eczema gets so bad that it hurts to put lotion on (those of you with dry skin that gets irritated when you&#x27;ve put off lotioning for a while</li>
            <li> Even though I like the smell of coconut oil, you don&#x27;t have to worry about any irritating scents.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is thin plastic and cracked after one drop in the shower.</li>
            <li> He also suffers from eczema so this soothes his skin with that and mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler who suffers from psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I hate putting products on her that are loaded with chemicals</li>
            <li> And nearly impossible, once you&#x27;ve got oil on your hands!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this all over my body and love it. My skin is in the best condition I can remember. Living in Michigan, we get long, bitter winters and it takes a toll on our skin. What I love about this oil is that it is not scented and it doesn&#x27;t have crap fillers. The only down side it that as you spray and apply it can be cumbersome to manage (oil on the hands). I read a review or two with people complaining of this, and while it gets slippery I don&#x27;t really see this as an issue. The overspray will get on your floor, counter, etc. You can easily remedy the second option by spraying straight into your hands. One bottle will last me about 3-4 months. Highly recommend, especially if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my kids eczema.  I also use this on my dry skin on my feet. I love how it goes on feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I received a compliementary product for review.</li>
            <li> I love having a natural way to lock moisture into my skin. I have always had sensitivities to lotion and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It has really helped with my dry skin and I feel safe using it for my whole family!</li>
            <li> Love it, a great hydrator</li>
            <li> love it  i spray it on while wet after shower and rub in.... has helped also with dry itchy tops of my feet  will buy again</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your skin feel but it is NOT fragrance free after a few hours smells kind of sour like am old sour dish sponge if it wasn&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d love it :/</li>
            <li> To say this is just a moisturizer is a big understatement.  I use it for so many things, especially in the winter.  Relief of scaly skin on legs, soften cuticles, stops the itch and flake of a few eczema spots on scalp (what I purchased for initially was for an all over body moisturizer, but I saw on the cap it is accepted by National Eczema Association and started using on my spots and it really helps with the itch and spots). Elbows, knees..allover body spray.  I love that it is scent free because I am very sensitive to smells and dyes, etc. and this has no artificial ingredients or preservatives. It truly has NO SMELL, and dries feeling nicely moisturized, but no residual greasy feel.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about Capriclear.</li>
            <li> I developed a rash from this! I don&#x27;t know if it has something to do with my allergy to baby oil but I was hoping that since it was pure oil that I would not have any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I love the CapriClear Coconut Oil spray.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this product, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I use this product for skincare, moisturizer, all over body moisturizer and to soothe mosquito bites.  I also discovered I can use coconut oil to polish wood furniture.  I now save money by not having to buy a separate product to polish furniture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my son&#x27;s dry skin.  He also suffers from eczema so this soothes his skin with that and mosquito bites.  When I use this on my mosquito bites, it helps take the itch away.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it. Not to heavy</li>
            <li> I use CapriCear oil on my grandchildren every morning before they leave for school.  They both have patches of eczema on their little bodies.  They enjoy the feel of the oil on their skin. This product has helped to sooth rough patches without leaving a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler who suffers from psoriasis. It has not helped at all. It doesn&#x27;t soak in very well. I use argon oil for my face and this feels slightly heavier. It still might be nice for general skin conditioning but didn&#x27;t do a thing for the psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! With the moisturizing properties of coconut oil but without the smell, it&#x27;s perfect for any skin type. I find it absorbs within minutes and leaves skin healthy and glowing. Both my husband and I are hooked, and we feel comfortable using it on our child due to the pure ingredient. Find the spray easy, effective and an overall wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Much easier to apply than regular coconut oil because it doesn&#x27;t harden up.</li>
            <li> Moisturises well but takes a while to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice not to oily for the skin is perfect .. for the hair is to oily..</li>
            <li> I took a sample from my dermatologist while I was visiting. I have to say, by far this is one of the best  moisturizers I have ever liked. It makes my skin feel so smooth without the greasy or sticky feeling. Thumbs 👍Capri Clear, I will definitely buy it again. I just wish more stores carried the product..</li>
            <li> This is literally the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have eczema, itchy dry skin all the time and after one use I noticed a difference . I have used everything under the sun including prescriptions and this works even better. It&#x27;s so worth, this is going to be used now in my everyday regimen, my skin is so soft, my husband loves it too! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love it, I was given this product for free for review.  Since my review though I have purchased again :)&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I love&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell, I do love &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I always want to walk around smelling like it.  I was surprised to find out the smell factor was removed, but I still got all the benefits that come from using coconut oil!  For this product my main use was skin moistener, and it works amazingly.  It has a good strong spray that covers a nice sized area, was super easy to rub in if you spray to much.  It is a light oil and I didn&#x27;t feel greasy or gross afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;My little sister has eczema and her hands are always dry and break out.  She told me products normally hurt and burn more, but I used this spray on her and she was so impressed that not only did it sooth there was no burning or pain!  I did some research and was happy to discover that the coconut oil is the only ingredient!  No colors, scents or harsh chemicals added!&lt;br /&gt;I use this on everyone!  My kiddos, my pup (Has a skin allergy that cause dry/ flaky skin), my sister, myself and my hubby.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still impressed that I keep finding new uses for it.  I read another review of someone using it on stretchmarks! I never thought to use it for them, but now I can&#x27;t wait to try it there too.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for the whole family and has so many uses.  I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> My daughter began having some skin issues once she started swim class. The pool water didn&#x27;t agree with her, she is fair skinned like her mom.  Even though I was showering her right after class is wasn&#x27;t enough.  I hate putting products on her that are loaded with chemicals so when I can across this I figured I would give it a go and I was not disappointed.  I love that it is a spray because it is easy to apply on anyone but especially a toddler.  I thought it might be real greasy because it is basically just coconut oil but the skin adores it and absorbs it quickly.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my skin unbelievable I would recommend it to anyone who wants an easy spray on skin treatment</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it daily. I use it for many things, just like regular coconut oil, but it is especially great for diaper rash treatment and prevention. Just spray it on and no mess on your hands!  Also cloth diaper friendly!</li>
            <li> I love the spray applicator and the way my skin feels after use. The oil is light, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I recently had a C-section and appreciate that it helps to reduce scarring as well. I would highly recommend Capriclear to anyone who appreciates a light moisturizer that goes a long way!</li>
            <li> **I was provided with this product in exchange for an honest review.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been making a concerted to use more all-natural skincare and beauty products and have fallen in love with coconut oil (like everyone else in the world). I’ve tried using virgin coconut oil in lieu of lotion but it&#x27;s not the easiest product to use once it hardens up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully there&#x27;s Capriclear Coconut Oil Spray, which has been “fractionated” so all you are left with is a pure oil that won’t harden up when the oil gets above a certain temperature. I just fell down the rabbit hole of researching fractionated coconut oil, and it appears that it’s the primary coconut oil that’s used in cosmetic and beauty products advertising the addition of coconut oil. It is not, however, a type of coconut oil that you want to ingest because it has a different chemical composition than virgin coconut oil as a result of being fractionated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is SO moisturizing without being in the least bit greasy. There is no scent to the product, which is a huge bonus in my book as I don’t like scented moisturizers. This dermatologist-formulated product is hypoallergenic and should work with even the most sensitive of skin. I am personally unable to use many lotions because of how sensitive my skin is but I have had no issues using this product on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m really excited about this product because it makes it that much easier to use coconut oil as an everyday moisturizer. I absolutely love that it stays in the liquid form regardless of the temperature so it can be quickly sprayed on whenever needed.</li>
            <li> In love with this stuff. Sprays out nicely and never clogs. Not sure about healing scars and all it&#x27;s wonders. Haven&#x27;t been using it consistently, but it leaves my hair very shiny. No greasy feeling after it dries, except when I sweat, it feels a little greasy. I just wipe down with baby wipes. It does have a shelf life of 2 years after the mfg date or lot date. This isn&#x27;t one of the fractionated coconut oils that lasts a long time. Maybe it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s been processed? Who knows. I&#x27;m willing to try other brands, too.</li>
            <li> I break out with EVERYTHING!! So far, it looks great on (without a greasy feeling, once it absorbs). I also feel like I am doing something good for my skin - so for this reason, I feel better, and feel that I look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be a bit of overkill, in the Florida humidity, but oddly enough, I&#x27;m more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; at the end of the days which I don&#x27;t use it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this item, and will be buying again once this runs out.  I was considering buying one for work, for my hands (messing with paper all day, severely dries my hands out) - but right when I brought my &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; one into work, my coworker, nabbed it right away and took it home with her :( ... since it was a Friday, I had to survive without it over the weekend.  Based on her experience of that recent theft, and my retrieval of said item, she quickly ordered her own.</li>
            <li> This spray oil is wonderful. Even though I like the smell of coconut oil, you don&#x27;t have to worry about any irritating scents.  Update 4/8/15:: Also, I use it when my boys&#x27; eczema gets so bad that it hurts to put lotion on (those of you with dry skin that gets irritated when you&#x27;ve put off lotioning for a while know what I mean) and they end up crying. Well, they don&#x27;t cry with this. It soothes them. They *ask* for this stuff. I love it.</li>
            <li> I give it that, it is soothing, but I find my emu oil or my argan oil works just as good. Not sure if I would buy again, perhaps just to have it around. You get a lot for your money!</li>
            <li> I REALLY want to like this product, but I just can&#x27;t. I love the fact that it&#x27;s a spray and seems lightweight with non-toxic ingredients. However, it does NOT dry and stays oily on my face for hours afterward. May it&#x27;s not meant to be used on the face? I gave it a few days to see if my skin got acclimated to it, but no, it just did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> Super for sensitive skin...i am literally allergic to everything and this works wonders for me...great item i cannot live without now</li>
            <li> Great value. Love it!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a small bottle at Walgreens when they offered Register Rewards. My Radiation Oncologist allowed me to use this coconut oil. It is the BEST moisturizer you can buy...not greasy, feels so good...soaks into the skin..leaves no spots on clothing either. I highly recommend this product and my DR was pleased too.</li>
            <li> I love it! So easy to apply and it&#x27;s great mosterizer.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face and neck.  I am 46 years old and am dealing with drier skin and fine lines.  This product is all I use on my skin to moisturize as it is light, absorbs nicely, and does not irritate me (I am very sensitive to most products and react quickly).  I get complements on how youthful my skin is, and never used to until I started using it.  I have not tried it on my body.</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize well initially, however, after a few hours the moisturizing effect seems to wear off and I feel like I have to moisturize again. I like that it does not contain any irritating ingredients and all the ingredients I can see are non-toxic and safe.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for everything and love it! I use it to remove eye makeup, I have very sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate them and removes my eye makeup wonderfully. I also spray it all over my belly as I am pregnant and it is great for keeping my skin soft. I love that it comes in a spray pump so you can spray it anywhere on your body!</li>
            <li> Best oil I&#x27;ve tried.  Light, odor free and does not stain my clothes.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizing oil a lot -- but the spray is vary hard to press.  And nearly impossible, once you&#x27;ve got oil on your hands!  I wound up taking the sprayer off and pouring the oil from the bottle.  It feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all.  Can be used on your face and your hair.</li>
            <li> Last week I got extremely sunburned, mostly on my forehead and nose. I also got burned on the tops of my feet(!!). Normally, my forehead and nose would peel for a week and I would look horrendously blotchy. I used CapriClear on my forehead and nose on day #1. Let me tell you; my skin was incredibly smooth and it never peeled. I was surprised to say the least. I then sprayed some on the tops of my feet for the burn was making them itch. In less than 10 seconds they stopped itching. I reapplied the product for two days after and never peeled and my feet never itched again. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used and the fact that it is all natural and completely safe is a huge plus!!! You will not regret trying this amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the smaller size to try it out. It worked well on my dry itchy skin, absorbed pretty quickly and no odor. Now I&#x27;m back to buy the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> You can buy the exact same thing, fractionated coconut oil, from the baking isle of your grocery or health food store for a fraction of the price. It works just the same.</li>
            <li> I really love coconut oil. I cook with it, moisturize my hair and skin with it, remove makeup with it but I don&#x27;t want to smell it all the time even though the smell is not unpleasant. I like this unscented oil and I&#x27;ve been using slight mist on damp skin after washing my face in the evening for moisture. I don&#x27;t put anything else on my face after doing this. My sister also uses this to moisturize and treat the skin on her hands which are severely dry and rough from work. If I want a little moisturizing aromatherapy before going to bed, I mist the palm of my hand with this oil and include one drop of jasmine oil and press onto my face. Using oils have really been great to my skin and I will definitely repurchase this one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is non-greasy and moisturizes my super dry skin. I love that there is only one ingredient and I would trust using this on my kids!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product before i tried it, but i ABSOLUTELY LOVE it. Capriclear is 100% natural and is only 1 ingredient-- coconut oil-- which i have found has many benefits (just google it- you will be amazed). This oil is fractinated (which means the yucky stuff-- allergens, smell, ect are removed)so any one can use it!! This oil is ultra light weight and super moisturizing. Also, it works amazing on symptoms of eczema without hurting to apply :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eczema or not this product is amazing, it is a hidden treasure that more people should know about!</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of this oil and have already purchased a second. I am really happy with this product for a number of reasons. This is a really basic product, just fractionated coconut oil without any extras or fragrance of any kind. It absorbs really quickly and is nice and light on the skin while also being moisturizing. I love the packaging and purchased it because of it&#x27;s spray application. I can moisturize and then get dressed without having to wait a few extra minutes for the product to absorb and haven&#x27;t had any transfer onto any of my clothing. It really is fragrance free. I like not having anything compete with perfume if I wear it and that I can add my own essential oils to customize it a bit. I added some ylang ylang and now have a light, soothing scent whenever I apply it. This versatility is fabulous to me. I did not use this everyday so I can&#x27;t attest to how long this product would last with daily use but for me (at least 3 uses per week) it has lasted me a couple of months. If you need something to moisturize your skin that is gentle and effective this would be a great product to try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely outstanding. I&#x27;ve tried multiple dry oils because I have severe psoriasis. THIS gave me outstanding relief. It goes on light but provides moisture throughout the day. I personally spray it all over after a shower/bath and rub it in. It seems to penetrate best that way.</li>
            <li> This oil is not sticky and light on the skin. Happy with the product. It is not irritating and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter who struggles with eczema on her ankles. The product eases the dryness and itching. The bottle is thin plastic and cracked after one drop in the shower. Luckily we were able to transfer what didn&#x27;t spill into another spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with ingrown hairs or anything but it&#x27;s nice to have for the days UR too lazy to rub and u just want to spray and go.</li>
            <li> Great for stretch marks. I used this during my pregnancy and saw a reversal almost instantly. Really helps with discoloration too. Amazing! I highly recommend this, best buy in a while.</li>
            <li> It works well on my grandsons exzema.</li>
