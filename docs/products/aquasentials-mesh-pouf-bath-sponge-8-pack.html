            <li>I love these poufs!</li>
            <li>I guess they just exfoliate better!</li>
            <li>I love these poufs!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe you get four of them for what most places charge for one!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Like getting so many in one pack!</li>
            <li>Will buy again as we love poufs!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the quality and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great deal, needed to add to cart to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that you get 4</li>
            <li>While not as effective to exfoliate the skin, it also doesn&#x27;t cause pain as some people have mentioned to me.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set of Poufs.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Poufs have a nice handy loop which I hang on the shower caddy.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s on my body effectively.</li>
            <li>Nice combination.  </li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice.</li>
            <li>one of these with a nice body wash will do the trick</li>
            <li>They are nicely made and not scratchy.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, didn&#x27;t smell like petroleum,  unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>It was poufy and kind of felt silky, not scratchy.  </li>
            <li>They are high-quality, long-lasting and feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would not recommend this purchase, unless the seller(s) guarantee that what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li>I gave two of them to my mom, and she liked them.</li>
            <li>The quality is superior, better than the one I got at Safeway.</li>
            <li>Using these kind of feel like I&#x27;m rubbing a cotton towel against my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice buy and a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice sized loofahs.  </li>
            <li>The colors were nice, but that burnt orange was quite out of place.  </li>
            <li>I definitely liked the variety of colors they came in.</li>
            <li>I think they liked them.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice to buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li>This item was kind of deceiving.  </li>
            <li>I also find the feel of the loofah gives a nice amount of scrub without being scratchy.  </li>
            <li>I like the size and it is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>To be honest I am writing this review while I am opening the product.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a nice size and seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, works really well.</li>
            <li>They are softer than others and feel nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Material is nice not scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>These sponges have vibrant colors and are the perfect size for all the members of my family.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t quite as good as the ones I&#x27;d buy from my local store, but they were a great price!</li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Again, excellent shower sponges for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would have been happy if they were all white, but the colors were a pleasant, cheery surprise.</li>
            <li>This is undoubtedly one of the more hesitant purchases I have done but one of the best still.&lt;br /&gt;The main concern I had was the size-thankfully these are quite &amp;#34;adult</li>
            <li>More exfoliating than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good price since the quality isn&#x27;t as cheap as what you may get at dollar stores.</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to buy it as a 4 pack.</li>
            <li>They are great size, sturdy &amp; colorful.  </li>
            <li>I got them today, beautiful colors &amp; didn&#x27;t get white which I&#x27;m happy on.</li>
            <li>I really like the bright colors!</li>
            <li>Nice shower poufs for the whole family with a great price point.</li>
            <li>Our daughter suggested these as a good way of keeping our skin clean.</li>
            <li>Good loofahs to keep you clean.  </li>
            <li>Theses are great sponges for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>But these offer great quality at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is made very well!</li>
            <li>These are very hard-like plastic and really don&#x27;t feel your getting good suds and doesn&#x27;t feel the greatest when you&#x27;re washing them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t see an update assume they washed just fine!</li>
            <li>Very cheap and works well.</li>
            <li>They are strong and have a nice ribbon to hang by.  </li>
            <li>These puffs are cheap and look good out of the box, but they loosen and separate extremely easily.</li>
            <li>they came I was pleased with the beautiful vibrant colors and</li>
            <li>However, this is definitely better than using a rag or your hands to sap and scrub your body.</li>
            <li>I might buy them again for the price, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for a better value.</li>
            <li>I love to use them with my Philosophy and plenty of puffs to share.</li>
            <li>Love them and always buy when I am in the store.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the size.</li>
            <li>I like em, and they seem a bit more substantial than the ones at Walmart, but who knows</li>
            <li>Love that I have a stock of these for when they start to wear out.</li>
            <li>love em</li>
            <li>and they Are nice and cheap.</li>
            <li>I love pouf sponges.</li>
            <li>Nice colors; they don&#x27;t fall apart like those cheap crappy ones you find in the store.</li>
            <li>and i love them.</li>
            <li>Our favorite mesh sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors that came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cute colored loofas, but the strap on mine broke off.</li>
            <li>I have to use more soap with these.</li>
            <li>These loofas are great quality and MUCH cheaper than anything you can find in the store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying to write more informative reviews, so if you found this review helpful, please check &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; below where it says &amp;#34;Was this review helpful to you?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I will buy better quality</li>
            <li>I like knowing that I have more, in case I need them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I appreciate more the rope hanger...</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>bought a magic showerhead that changes colors</li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the size of each pouf.  </li>
            <li>love the pouf sponge but thought I was getting more then</li>
            <li>please I can go to walmark and get a better deal</li>
            <li>I was getting 10 that would have been better</li>
            <li>but these darn things better hold up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish the quality was better but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get much better than a pouf.</li>
            <li>We have been using them for a month and they seem more durable than the cheap kind they sell at the store.</li>
            <li>We will have to get more.</li>
            <li>m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love the quantity.</li>
            <li>I love loofah&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Soap lathers so much better with a loofah.  </li>
            <li>The colors are bright and fun</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t like cotton balls but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Can never have too many - always use these.</li>
            <li>Bright colors, seems to absorb my body wash very well and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>They are nice and smooth and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper rubbing on your body.</li>
            <li>Fits in my hand perfectly.. and with the sheer number you get, you can throw it out after a month use..</li>
            <li>I was really just looking for the cheapest option out there and received these really great quality loofahs.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>Seems to be better quality than the store bought.</li>
            <li>Then again, anything is better quality than those.</li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>I Would buy more.</li>
            <li>They are better than the ones at the store</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin is more healthy using these too.</li>
            <li>What I was most worried about was that the color of these run in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Whether fewer hands touch Aquasentials poufs or not, these poufs are of a better quality than the ones at my drugstore.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s in decent shape, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice clean, and holds soap well.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I am still on my first loofah still in tact.</li>
            <li>Great for showers and liked the different selection of colors.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, pretty colors, I love the ribbon to hang it up (much prettier than just a white string), great value</li>
            <li>Same quality that you would find in a store and the price per unit is very good.  </li>
            <li>bit smaller than I would&#x27;ve liked, but it does the job just fine, and at this price point I am perfectly happy.</li>
            <li>I like these very much as the colors are bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li>Holds my body wash perfectly and is not too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>So much better than the cheap ones you find at mass merchandise stores.</li>
            <li>Cheap way to shop for these as they are more money in the store.</li>
            <li>These are so soft and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t need much body wash solution to get a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest poofs out there, they all fell apart after only a couple of months, but their definitely not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>They were ok, some fell apart much more quickly than others.  </li>
            <li>easy to travel and use.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I used them until they fall apart, and these have lasted easily months for me.</li>
            <li>one has a bath where the pouf can not be easily seen, it doesn&#x27;t matter but</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>I am hoping because of the size they do not rip easily.</li>
            <li>It is nice that Overall they are a good product</li>
            <li>and I can complain as they have held up fine and as the title states the price is right!!</li>
            <li>wait till BBW is running a special or something and stock up then :)</li>
            <li>Wish it was made a little better, but for a cheap 8 pack they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>The loop is made out of ribbon and not rope - nice pretty touch.</li>
            <li>8 sponges for 8 bucks, That&#x27;s a good deal compared to what I normally pay.</li>
            <li>these are nice and thick not like the cheap crappy ones and great so everyone can have their own color,</li>
            <li>If you prefer to mail order everything, they&#x27;re a fine deal.</li>
            <li>These work fine for me</li>
            <li>This product is fine.</li>
            <li>Has a bit of a chemical smell (probably the processing/packaging) but they work fine.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was fine.</li>
            <li>I have read that these things can harbor bacteria if you don&#x27;t switch them out with new ones frequently so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>They seem to be pretty good and price is right for 8 of them.</li>
            <li>Nice price, but they fall apart fast.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want another one of these if they were free.</li>
            <li>and I definitely enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Get some real castille soap, bar or bottled, use a Mesh pouf and your soap will lather up amazingly and sparingly, too.   </li>
            <li>Free shipping, too.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I just wish that they would be available all the time.  </li>
            <li>They are the larger sponges, with a great ribbon hanging device to use.  </li>
            <li>If all you need is cheap, knock yourself out.</li>
            <li>Great price, comparable quality to the ones you find in the drugstore, thicker then some, not as big as some others.</li>
            <li>They feel cheap, and their quality is cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality, fell apart after 1st use.  </li>
            <li>But the price was cheap...</li>
            <li>I like these poufs because they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li>These cost just slightly more, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and use again.</li>
            <li>Great deal, not quite as big as I was expecting but work just as well.</li>
            <li>These are soft, a good size and work well.</li>
            <li>They have a nice and smooth feel to them and the ribbon loop is very function.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to be changed out frequently in the shower to avoid mold and bacteria buildup, so a good idea to have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li>The colors are very bright and not exactly to my taste</li>
            <li>very nice especially for the price  has cloth hanging strap  </li>
            <li>These were way smaller than I expected, fitting in the palm of my hand, but I loved the colors and they soap up beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love how easy and cheap these products are, but are still very high quality.</li>
            <li>These poufs are much softer than the dollar store ones, so it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>They are on the large size compared to most easily found in stores nowadays.  </li>
            <li>This is really worth the money!</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re not fussy about the colors since you don&#x27;t know what colors you&#x27;ll get they are a great value</li>
            <li>but then again I use it once a month and then throw it away so as long as it scrubs and does it jobs I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I had used them in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
            <li>I think these are very decent quality (better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drugstore), for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy poufs that&#x27;ll clean you well.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure what I needed or what I&#x27;d like, so I went the cheap route.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and these are bigger than most that you see in the store.  </li>
            <li>My body feels clean and energized after using these in the shower.</li>
            <li>clean clean clean washes my manly dirt away</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and really functional, and they hold a great lather too.</li>
            <li>Gets me squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Soft and decent quality (not spa or anything but good), better than the ones you get at WalMart for about $3 a piece.</li>
            <li>Soft yet hold up well over many uses!</li>
            <li>Four different colors are great one for each of my family members.&lt;br /&gt;Price is right too.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about them, except the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li>I would describe them as a more of a medium size rather than large.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than from the drug store which at times would get you one for this price, nice and thick, great colors, highly recommend</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re here because the colors are important, it may not be worth the risk shopping online.</li>
            <li>If you really like to scrub yourself then these are not for you - you&#x27;d be better off with a bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Simple and durable, good buy.</li>
            <li>The initial use is good.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else is saying, they are definitely smaller than the ones you can buy at the store, but they&#x27;re a good price</li>
            <li>Full size pouf sponges.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will still come apart just as fast as the others</li>
            <li>They last a good while (before falling apart).  </li>
            <li>OK for the price, but lose their shape fast.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and would last a lot longer than I keep them which is at max, 2 months.</li>
            <li>but really was hopoing for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have 7 replacements around for when one gets old.</li>
            <li>They hold up fairly well and last longer then you should probably keep them hang in in your shower.  </li>
            <li>For a smaller guy or for a lady, these are probably a good</li>
            <li>I love exfoliating in the shower and these hold the shower gel very well</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, just not what I am used to.</li>
            <li>The string falls apart pretty easily....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely happy with my purchase, some of the ones we had were entirely too large, or too &amp;#34;fluffy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I will for sure by some again when I need new ones!</li>
            <li>I would squeeze a decent amount and lather it around most of the convenient body parts, again rather</li>
            <li>The products came quickly and as ordered.  </li>
            <li>but this is such a great product that we are ready to order another package to keep it in stock.</li>
            <li>I keep these at home as backups in case quests come over and would like to shower, and every time I travel I throw one of these in my suite case and just throw it away whenever i&#x27;m ready to fly back home.</li>
            <li>They fall apart rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>These fall apart rather quickly, well within a month.</li>
            <li>And it has to rinse out quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick shipment as well.</li>
            <li>The others have fallen apart quickly as our kids pull them apart.  </li>
            <li>do come apart rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>If they last a good while, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more!</li>
            <li>Love the pale colors, love the size, love the price.  </li>
            <li>Still a decent deal, but not as great as it initially seems.</li>
            <li>These are a great value but they seem to be less durable than the ones I can buy at Target.</li>
            <li>They are made strongly and work well for bathing and scrubbing the skin gently</li>
            <li>My first one lasted a couple months with daily use...just as good as any I have seen in the stores.  </li>
            <li>They do not tear easily and really get the suds going.</li>
            <li>Threw the whole lot away after I used one without pre-testing and showered with it, felt just like sand paper!!</li>
            <li>In fact, I got sexually excited just anticipating the first use.</li>
            <li>Why show all the pretty multi colored sponges if you keep sending myself and others all one color?!</li>
            <li>Daughter and husband love these they the perfect size not to big or small.  </li>
            <li>but they would great for a little boy or girl.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice soft pouf but, hanging in the shower, it stands out through the glass like a large sore</li>
            <li>Nice to have a bunch since you shouldn&#x27;t use these for more than a few months for hygienic reasons.</li>
            <li>It seems that when I am ready to order them that I have to wait for them to become available again.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My favorite one so far.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re bigger and more poufy than the $.99 kind at the drugstore at not a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Stay fresh and</li>
            <li>they were a good value, however they turned out to be way too rough.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth attempting to return.</li>
            <li>so these colorful sponges went along with their gift.</li>
            <li>These Pouf sponges were much larger than I thought and they are definitely nice to use.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that they would not be worth the price.  </li>
            <li>These poufs lather well and are nice and big.</li>
            <li>They are nice and big.</li>
            <li>Plastic string quality was not as good as the yarn type.</li>
            <li>These are nice and big.</li>
            <li>Worth it 100%</li>
            <li>The ribbon they are tied with is much better than a rope it dries completely.  </li>
            <li>These are a good deal (monetary), hold up well (about 30 days each), &amp; are cleansing without being rough.  </li>
            <li>I love getting exactly what I want and then seeing there i some little detail that makes it even better!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, does the job, very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>These work ok, but they feel stiff and kind of scratchy.  </li>
            <li>They have an average abrasiveness that imparts a pleasantly scratchy, exfoliating feel to scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>The pack has a variety of brightly colored sponges which don&#x27;t quite go with my decor like the gray or other neutral colors that I can pick at the store.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re poufies, they work as good as any other poofies</li>
            <li>They are large, high quality (don&#x27;t fall apart quickly) and manufactured with \\&quot;soft\\&quot; plastic that feels much better on the skin, yet strong enough to clean.    </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s using them right now, though.</li>
            <li>They are just right.  </li>
            <li>but the price was right.  </li>
            <li>and you can feel your body clean without having to rub too much.</li>
            <li>They are a bit compact at first but soon open up to a nice, comfy size.</li>
            <li>These are actually pretty nice quality and last for a while.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing special about them.  </li>
            <li>I love how well it lathers and works in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my annual shower, which I usually take on Christmas eve.</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me too much if the quality was better, but it&#x27;s a very cheap feeling product and much smaller than the ones you can pick up cheaply from your local drug store.</li>
            <li>Standard bath poufs, cheap and with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I notice how much cleaner I actually feel after a shower, which is a nice surprise I wasn&#x27;t expecting when purchasing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great buy, bigger then ones from Target and Walmart, but smaller then the ones from Walgreens</li>
            <li>Functional, received quickly and serve their purpose, hold up very well</li>
            <li>I recently ordered a pack of poufs and I am happy to see that now the product description does state that one may receive all the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though it has to be a cheap material in order for them to price these so low, the quality doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>These are very high quality pouf sponges!</li>
            <li>These are not the tiny sponges - they are a larger size and very nice quality.</li>
            <li>I will say that they can be found just as cheap at Walmart or many other discount stores.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty much the same as every other cheap loofah I&#x27;ve gotten before - they&#x27;re great in the shower with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and they pull apart over time.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped and what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more when these are used up.</li>
            <li>The first one is holding up well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Bath Sponge (4 Pack) about two months ago and we still using the first one.</li>
            <li>They work well, and although I knew I&#x27;d get a variety of colors, I was glad the majority were white since I used them with gift packs for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just re-order more when my last one is done.</li>
            <li>The ones sold at your local Dollar Tree or 99 cent store are much better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - delivered as promised</li>
            <li>Going back to more plush, softer, gentler ones.</li>
            <li>if you have spent time and money creating a nicely coordinated bath, don&#x27;t count on even getting one pouf that will blend in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the first one for a couple weeks now</li>
            <li>They seem to be holding up better than the ones you buy from local places, especialy for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a couple of months in on using the first one and there is not even the smallest rip in the sponge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it does exactly what you want and seem to be made as well as any pouf I have used.  </li>
            <li>I suppose I&#x27;ll update if they unravel on the first wash...  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the colorful sponges.</li>
            <li>They are pretty but in  no way functional -- I threw them away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bath sponge out of the eight that is in this set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first one after a month.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are okay.</li>
            <li>I think only one of them lasted more than three days -- all the rest came untied and unwound in one or two uses.</li>
            <li>First off, you cannot beat this price.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, seem very well made, and should last a long while.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>1-star higher (to 4 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these should and its the first time I ever seen that</li>
            <li>The density of these poufs is even pretty good, some are rather small and lack substance, but these are just about right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used my first pouf for very long, but the quality seems good so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for cheap backup poufs, these will do fine, but they&#x27;re not high quality.</li>
            <li>Great value, the poufs are well made and 8 will last us a very long time!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the price and they seem to be holding up just fine after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li>Smallish compared to poufs in stores, but has certainly held up much better than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in stores recently.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>very cost efficient buy, the sponges are great quality and will last a long time each</li>
            <li>They are as big as I expected and do a great job.</li>
            <li>When you open the package up they look more compact then the real size after they Pouf</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something simple but useful, and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really awesome,and it&#x27;s MUCH better than the one I got from wal-mart at the same price.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, for a reasonable price, and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>They are pretty small, but good for the price.</li>
            <li>Not quite big enough for my liking but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>Would have liked to see a little more &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; feel, but works well for daily use.</li>
            <li>I came across these on Amazon and bought them based off the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they hold up fine, but I wish I could find as good a deal on a pack of plain white poufs.</li>
            <li>The hanging strings are the first to go and then the whole loofah unravels allowing you to chose another.  </li>
            <li>These loufahs are soft and full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>These things are pretty small, but they&#x27;re so much more cost effective than buying bath sponges individually.  </li>
            <li>Always need a new one of these and rarely remember to pick them up at the store.  </li>
            <li>They are just the right size and just abrasive enough for you to feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t have to worry about this getting softer and less effective.    </li>
            <li>The different colors make it easy to insure that I don&#x27;t wash my face with something I just used to freshen up my SwampAss.</li>
            <li>I received a selection of several colors and they arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Expected more, first one i used broke when shaking excess water out when was finished.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good texture too, not completely soft like some I&#x27;ve felt, but they also aren&#x27;t overly coarse.</li>
            <li>They feel just as good and last just as long.</li>
            <li>Your add said these were these large size sponges.</li>
            <li>They certainly weren&#x27;t 5 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Large size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap but it&#x27;s really the same quality that you&#x27;ll buy at the stores at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>They are soft and seem to be made of good quality materials, but you could pick them up at the dollar store and spend less money.  </li>
            <li>Stayed nice and tightly wrapped together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the bright green one for the past couple of days and so far it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li>The price per unit is about the same as those sold locally &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; but definitely better quality than those!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These have held up nicely, and the ribbon loop make them look a little classier.</li>
            <li>Nice little poufs...</li>
            <li>The product arrived On time and exactly as described and I  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty simple, nothing fancy or special about them.</li>
            <li>These are just the right size and although tightly bunched I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; with use.  </li>
            <li>I replace these every month, and within that time frame, these have held up really well.</li>
            <li>Nothing really.</li>
            <li>The whole thing literally unravelled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these loofahs for the last few months and can say that they are simply the best ones I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>And they came fast.  </li>
            <li>Really lathers and scrub away the dirt, will detinitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I really like this bath pouf...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t change them very often.</li>
            <li>These are very comfy, i think they are well balanced</li>
            <li>after showering with them I noted that they lathered really well-better than the one I bought in the store.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I did not want to write a review until I used this product for a while, and they have stood up very well.</li>
            <li>They are made for a child, I was very dissapointed and will never order again</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>How much can you say about a bath sponge?</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t scratch the skin, just gently removes dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>what I did really 10$ for 4</li>
            <li>and I much prefer that over the ribbon type material used for these.  </li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>They foam the soap up well and seem to be holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>the satin like string has not broken on me in case your wondering</li>
            <li>Cleans really well too.</li>
            <li>Its a bath sponge, but has lasted a whole lot longer</li>
            <li>size, but not by much.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really care about that since its just a shower sponge.</li>
            <li>Really like these scrubs.</li>
            <li>I like the texture of the mesh, too, it feels effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li>First, as many of the other reviewers stated I received 4-pcs that are all ONE COLOR!</li>
            <li>I want to get more colors than the original blue, purple, and pink.</li>
            <li>NICE FULL AND PLUSH THICK!</li>
            <li>This is soft but not soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scrub anything, if you like the gentile kind to the skin get this, i even have fun playing with this because it is softer then</li>
            <li>The poofs are fine, exactly the texture I expected.</li>
            <li>also like that the loop is ribbon and not cord like most other poufs I have</li>
            <li>They are a little scratchy, but not terrible, and the string came off the first week I had it.  </li>
            <li>has lasted better then other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>probably best to use on little ones and not adults as the scrubbers are small in size.</li>
            <li>A dollar here, a dollar there and the ones I get are junky and do not lather well, but these are heavy and very full!</li>
            <li>Not the biggest sponge but decent size and feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Good price, convenient especially if you have prime and about average in size and quality.  </li>
            <li>poofs  last a decent amount of time, they are richly colored</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised when I pulled the first one out of the bag.  </li>
            <li>Although the colors are pretty; they aren&#x27;t nearly as soft as the reviews let on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are pretty soft.  </li>
            <li>Sponges are pretty soft and lather well.</li>
            <li>Tightly meshed; should last for a good while.</li>
            <li>After using these, I really wish I had bought a new one a looong time ago.</li>
            <li>Decent poof balls.</li>
            <li>I put a pretty small amount of body wash on the pouf and am able to cover all over my body without problems.</li>
            <li>These are of decent size, not too small/big.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just personal preference, overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I tell you we allways strugle to buy a decent scrub</li>
            <li>I was very impressed, as I was a bit wary of buying bulk poufs (especially after buying one from the store that I paid 5 bucks for and it fell apart within a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got all vibrant colors and none repeated.</li>
            <li>Go to your local store and spend the same amount for a better product.</li>
            <li>They are soft but very sturdy and hold soap and body wash very well.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and comfortable in daily use.</li>
            <li>Decent quality loofas.</li>
            <li>I thought cheap stuffs mean cheap quality, but this one changed my idea.</li>
            <li>Normal ones like what you can find in the local super market or drug store.</li>
            <li>If I cannot find large or extra large pouf balls in Amazon, then I don’t know where?!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these body wash sponges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again and would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Almost too well made for me; I like them better after they start to fall apart a little.  </li>
            <li>I use these everyday, and feel fresh and clean afterwords, every time.</li>
            <li>They do not fall apart as easily as some other higher-end brands.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel soft at all and are very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Great buy, but I was not impressed with the quality of the pouf sponges.  </li>
            <li>These work very well, soft and do not fall apart like others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and well made so they hold up very well.</li>
            <li>that what I normally can get one or two.</li>
            <li>I with the poufs were bigger, but they&#x27;re not scratchy and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re normal bath size, and hold up well.</li>
            <li>They are a nice, large size, and are stiff enough to give skin a vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I would normally pay for one.</li>
            <li>These are just like any normal bath pouf.</li>
            <li>I have not used any of them yet, but I do not think they will last as long as the more generous, fuller sponges.</li>
            <li>The first 8 pack last very well</li>
            <li>and when I rinse them its with the body wash I normally use.</li>
            <li>They are nice and thick and made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No hard plastic piece on it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all right for the price, but I can get the same thing at the drug store for 79 cents.</li>
            <li>I typed large and extra large mesh pouf bath sponges</li>
            <li>one fuchsia, one bright green, one pastel green, and one light blue.</li>
            <li>They produce a good amount of foam, but I think they&#x27;re a little rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>so it can save you a trip to the store when you need a new one.  </li>
            <li>BUT I CAN LIVE WITH IT.  </li>
            <li>We try to change loofahs every time we get a new bottle of body wash.</li>
            <li>I ordered them because I purchase a new one every time I go food shopping...</li>
            <li>I like buying this 8 pack because then I have them on hand and can have a new one every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>Needed new pouf sponges.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because when I have bought them at the drugstores near my home, I get only 3 for more than the price of these.&lt;br /&gt;They function fine, and do not wear thin very soon.  </li>
            <li>They are made out of nice material which is not too harsh, yet abrasive enough to feel exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I bought this since I needed to add another item to get free shipping, so it was actually only my 2nd purchase of pouf sponge</li>
            <li>These mesh pouf bath sponges are more like little tootoos!</li>
            <li>but they are very soft.</li>
            <li>Seem to be lasting a long time and lather well and rinse out easily too.  </li>
            <li>The first one fell apart the second time it was used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working so far!</li>
            <li>I received 2 white, 1 pink and 1 yellow - nice assortment.  </li>
            <li>One pouf has lasted over a month so far!  </li>
            <li>These are the same price but much higher quality than the ones I can get at wal-mart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I expected - colors are nice, one I&#x27;ve been using has held up well for the past couple of months.</li>
            <li>These are much thicker than the ones you can buy at Dollar General for a buck.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good size, works well, the green is kinda ugly, but you can see that from the picture</li>
            <li>since taken hygiene slightly more seriously and wanted a way to really cover all the nooks and cranny</li>
            <li>This is a great deal but the sponges are a little rougher than I usually like in a sponge.  </li>
            <li>So far I think my &#x27;pouf&#x27; has lasted a month with onlyh beginning to show signs of needing a new one.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t really last t hat long, but they were cheap.</li>
            <li>Small, sparce, fall apart pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Ordered these in bulk because I thought they might wear out quickly like the ones I get from Walmart...but we have only used a couple out the packet..putting them in everyone&#x27;s bathroom...and almost 2 months later...</li>
            <li>They are too thick for me barely hold able and don&#x27;t lather as good as the thin ones</li>
            <li>The different colors are very vibrant and that is what I need.  </li>
            <li>Mine came factory wrapped in a large package of 4, various colors.</li>
            <li>The are not so large, but the regular size.</li>
            <li>I simply cannot find any large size pouf balls anywhere.</li>
            <li>The loofahs are a bit thick, which makes it kind of hard to lather the soap all about the sponge, but either way it works just fine.</li>
            <li>to hard need to be more softer, so i gave to my boyfriend</li>
            <li>These are good sized &amp;#34;Poufs&amp;#34; but they are a little too fluffy.</li>
            <li>The size is great considering the price, usually if you buy a loofa in walgreens it goes for $7 and its the small one.</li>
            <li>I now have clean poufs for months to come for a lot less than I&#x27;d pay elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these do not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>They are soft though so for anyone looking for a firmer sponge to help exfoliate this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>I prefer the ones I get at the beauty store which are much poofier  and last longest, but I&#x27;m too lazy-busy to go get</li>
            <li>The colors help me feel like I&#x27;ve changed out the old and in with</li>
            <li>Works well so far.  </li>
            <li>No big deal for me really.</li>
            <li>A marked improvement over a washrag in my estimation.</li>
            <li>I purchased this multipack months ago and have thrown away 2 of them so far.</li>
            <li>These appear larger then they really are...</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that they are.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything</li>
            <li>2 were completely unraveled when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Soft and not overly abrasive.</li>
            <li>These are soft and rugged.  </li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t like them as much as the ones I had before the smaller</li>
            <li>Not at all soft and doesn&#x27;t lather well.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cheaply priced, average quality, and they came quickly, I expected nothing less... or more.</li>
            <li>I was expecting average quality and a small size, but these are very nice and big.</li>
            <li>They also do not come apart as easily with use as some of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little on the small side; my old one was almost twice the size but at this price with this quantity these sponges are a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>these are great colors but don&#x27;t last very long before they fall apart, but it&#x27;s hard to find one that does last.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent tradeoff for price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these several times in the past and been reasonably satisfied given the price.</li>
            <li>I got bright green, blue, pink, and red.  </li>
            <li>I mean, if you like the small ones, they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>These were nice little puffs, smaller than average but still very soft.  </li>
            <li>These puffs do NOT provide adequate lather and are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep the strap around your wrist the whole time you&#x27;re using the pouf, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that</li>
            <li>So they are cheap, small and average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are the same roughness you&#x27;d expect from a normal one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not impressed, even for the price I could get better at the store for just a few cents more.  </li>
            <li>This is just my preference, but I like it when my loofahs are a little more rough against the skin.</li>
            <li>If I knew they were smaller than store, I would not even purchase them; however, I have to admit that they are cheap and for the price, you get small size and average roughness balls which is not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of this silky kind of ribbon that sort of sticks together when wet and is sometimes hard to separate.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a new one, which fell apart about three days later.    </li>
            <li>Not that big a deal (we just tied new knots in them) but is the factor keeping them from being a 5 star product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not necessarily a germaphobe, but this is something I&#x27;m using to clean my body; who knows many dirty hands or surfaces these came in contact with between manufacturing and packaging.</li>
            <li>They are all the same color with Old Spice on the hand loop!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70&amp;#34; tall man and it fills up my hands so if you&#x27;re small they might be to big, not even sure if you can have a to big loffa</li>
            <li>In the past I was the type of person to jump into a shower and use the bar of soap over most of my body, but I was always pretty lazy with it.</li>
            <li>They are supposed to be soft and feel comfortable to use in the shower, but actually they are very harsh</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with some unique color variations (like one that is green and white) which helps the roommates remember which one is which, and I appreciate that a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also have a ribbon loop as opposed to a rope loop, which is a fun little detail.</li>
            <li>It is abrasive enough to get the dead skin off and make you feel clean without feeling like you are getting hit with a sander.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft enough not to scratch your skin but not so soft that it&#x27;s in a any way not sturdy or low quality.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft enough and get the job done.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, but feel like they&#x27;d last awhile too.</li>
            <li>I surprised my student employees with a variety of &#x27;stuff&#x27; and these were a big hit!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used expensive shower poufs before and these are just as nice.</li>
            <li>These are very tight and hold the liquid body wash better than other poufs.</li>
            <li>We need a stockpile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sandwich of buying the el cheapo drug store or grocery store ones that last more like 9 showers rather than 20 ( for me&#x27; there&#x27;s nothing more annoying than the poof  unraveling mid- sudds ).</li>
            <li>They send you random colors, which I&#x27;m fine with as I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>but these are much coarser then the ons from our local grocery store, to rough for the kids</li>
            <li>I will order these again in the far future when I actually wear these ones out.</li>
            <li>Mine came with little ribbons instead of rope and 2 were solid purple, and the others were a combination color, each pouf being half white and half bright</li>
            <li>They are cheap, poorly made little things barely worth using as a travel item.</li>
            <li>and i mean like it gets you clean</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t keep the lather up as long as my old ratty one, either.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these for a few weeks now and the one I&#x27;ve been using has held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>These are slightly scratchy but I&#x27;ve certainly had scratchier.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; ones I have previously purchased at Target, but they are pretty soft and half the price.</li>
            <li>It really helps exfoliate, which my previous (Target brand) shower pouf didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>Theirs are actually soft and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>The poufs run a little on the large side, but no complaints.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I got four of the one bold color that absolutely clashes with my bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>These are soft enough to not rough up your skin but rough enough that they remove dirt and stuff in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was afraid they would be super cheap and rough on my skin</li>
            <li>Each sponge comes out costing like $1.50, and one sponge can last for at least half a year with no problems :)</li>
            <li>They are fine, not too harsh, but just a little too big.</li>
            <li>I was looking for real large size pouf balls which were really rough, so they could scrub all the dead skins off my body and back.</li>
            <li>I put them in clear solo cups and put a pom pom on top,then i wraped them in a cellophane bag with pink ribbons.</li>

            <li> GREAT for the money, these are nice Poufs much better than what I buy at the dollar store seem to hold up well and no complaints from the wife or the daughter</li>
            <li> I love these poufs!</li>
            <li> I guess they just exfoliate better!</li>
            <li> I love these poufs!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe you get four of them for what most places charge for one!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Like getting so many in one pack!</li>
            <li> Will buy again as we love poufs!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the quality and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great deal, needed to add to cart to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It is nice that you get 4</li>
            <li> While not as effective to exfoliate the skin, it also doesn&#x27;t cause pain as some people have mentioned to me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of Poufs.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Poufs have a nice handy loop which I hang on the shower caddy.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s on my body effectively.</li>
            <li> Nice combination.  </li>
            <li> Nice colors.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice.</li>
            <li> one of these with a nice body wash will do the trick</li>
            <li> They are nicely made and not scratchy.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, didn&#x27;t smell like petroleum,  unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> It was poufy and kind of felt silky, not scratchy.  </li>
            <li> They are high-quality, long-lasting and feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would not recommend this purchase, unless the seller(s) guarantee that what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li> I gave two of them to my mom, and she liked them.</li>
            <li> The quality is superior, better than the one I got at Safeway.</li>
            <li> Using these kind of feel like I&#x27;m rubbing a cotton towel against my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice buy and a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice sized loofahs.  </li>
            <li> The colors were nice, but that burnt orange was quite out of place.  </li>
            <li> I definitely liked the variety of colors they came in.</li>
            <li> I think they liked them.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice to buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> This item was kind of deceiving.  </li>
            <li> I also find the feel of the loofah gives a nice amount of scrub without being scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I like the size and it is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> To be honest I am writing this review while I am opening the product.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a nice size and seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works really well.</li>
            <li> They are softer than others and feel nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Material is nice not scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> These sponges have vibrant colors and are the perfect size for all the members of my family.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t quite as good as the ones I&#x27;d buy from my local store, but they were a great price!</li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Again, excellent shower sponges for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would have been happy if they were all white, but the colors were a pleasant, cheery surprise.</li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly one of the more hesitant purchases I have done but one of the best still.&lt;br /&gt;The main concern I had was the size-thankfully these are quite &amp;#34;adult</li>
            <li> More exfoliating than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good price since the quality isn&#x27;t as cheap as what you may get at dollar stores.</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to buy it as a 4 pack.</li>
            <li> They are great size, sturdy &amp; colorful.  </li>
            <li> I got them today, beautiful colors &amp; didn&#x27;t get white which I&#x27;m happy on.</li>
            <li> I really like the bright colors!</li>
            <li> Nice shower poufs for the whole family with a great price point.</li>
            <li> Our daughter suggested these as a good way of keeping our skin clean.</li>
            <li> Good loofahs to keep you clean.  </li>
            <li> Theses are great sponges for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> But these offer great quality at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is made very well!</li>
            <li> These are very hard-like plastic and really don&#x27;t feel your getting good suds and doesn&#x27;t feel the greatest when you&#x27;re washing them.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t see an update assume they washed just fine!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> They are strong and have a nice ribbon to hang by.  </li>
            <li> These puffs are cheap and look good out of the box, but they loosen and separate extremely easily.</li>
            <li> they came I was pleased with the beautiful vibrant colors and</li>
            <li> However, this is definitely better than using a rag or your hands to sap and scrub your body.</li>
            <li> I might buy them again for the price, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for a better value.</li>
            <li> I love to use them with my Philosophy and plenty of puffs to share.</li>
            <li> Love them and always buy when I am in the store.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the size.</li>
            <li> I like em, and they seem a bit more substantial than the ones at Walmart, but who knows</li>
            <li> Love that I have a stock of these for when they start to wear out.</li>
            <li> love em</li>
            <li> and they Are nice and cheap.</li>
            <li> I love pouf sponges.</li>
            <li> Nice colors; they don&#x27;t fall apart like those cheap crappy ones you find in the store.</li>
            <li> and i love them.</li>
            <li> Our favorite mesh sponge.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors that came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cute colored loofas, but the strap on mine broke off.</li>
            <li> I have to use more soap with these.</li>
            <li> These loofas are great quality and MUCH cheaper than anything you can find in the store.  </li>

            <li> I will buy better quality</li>
            <li> I like knowing that I have more, in case I need them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I appreciate more the rope hanger...</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> bought a magic showerhead that changes colors</li>
            <li> I am also pleased with the size of each pouf.  </li>
            <li> love the pouf sponge but thought I was getting more then</li>
            <li> please I can go to walmark and get a better deal</li>
            <li> I was getting 10 that would have been better</li>
            <li> but these darn things better hold up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the quality was better but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get much better than a pouf.</li>
            <li> We have been using them for a month and they seem more durable than the cheap kind they sell at the store.</li>
            <li> We will have to get more.</li>
            <li> m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the quantity.</li>
            <li> I love loofah&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Soap lathers so much better with a loofah.  </li>
            <li> The colors are bright and fun</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like cotton balls but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Can never have too many - always use these.</li>
            <li> Bright colors, seems to absorb my body wash very well and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> They are nice and smooth and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper rubbing on your body.</li>
            <li> Fits in my hand perfectly.. and with the sheer number you get, you can throw it out after a month use..</li>
            <li> I was really just looking for the cheapest option out there and received these really great quality loofahs.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> Seems to be better quality than the store bought.</li>
            <li> Then again, anything is better quality than those.</li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> I Would buy more.</li>
            <li> They are better than the ones at the store</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin is more healthy using these too.</li>
            <li> What I was most worried about was that the color of these run in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Whether fewer hands touch Aquasentials poufs or not, these poufs are of a better quality than the ones at my drugstore.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s in decent shape, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice clean, and holds soap well.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I am still on my first loofah still in tact.</li>
            <li> Great for showers and liked the different selection of colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, pretty colors, I love the ribbon to hang it up (much prettier than just a white string), great value</li>
            <li> Same quality that you would find in a store and the price per unit is very good.  </li>
            <li> bit smaller than I would&#x27;ve liked, but it does the job just fine, and at this price point I am perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> I like these very much as the colors are bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li> Holds my body wash perfectly and is not too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> So much better than the cheap ones you find at mass merchandise stores.</li>
            <li> Cheap way to shop for these as they are more money in the store.</li>
            <li> These are so soft and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t need much body wash solution to get a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest poofs out there, they all fell apart after only a couple of months, but their definitely not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> They were ok, some fell apart much more quickly than others.  </li>
            <li> easy to travel and use.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I used them until they fall apart, and these have lasted easily months for me.</li>
            <li> one has a bath where the pouf can not be easily seen, it doesn&#x27;t matter but</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> I am hoping because of the size they do not rip easily.</li>
            <li> It is nice that Overall they are a good product</li>
            <li> and I can complain as they have held up fine and as the title states the price is right!!</li>
            <li> wait till BBW is running a special or something and stock up then :)</li>
            <li> Wish it was made a little better, but for a cheap 8 pack they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> The loop is made out of ribbon and not rope - nice pretty touch.</li>
            <li> 8 sponges for 8 bucks, That&#x27;s a good deal compared to what I normally pay.</li>
            <li> these are nice and thick not like the cheap crappy ones and great so everyone can have their own color,</li>
            <li> If you prefer to mail order everything, they&#x27;re a fine deal.</li>
            <li> These work fine for me</li>
            <li> This product is fine.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of a chemical smell (probably the processing/packaging) but they work fine.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have read that these things can harbor bacteria if you don&#x27;t switch them out with new ones frequently so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> They seem to be pretty good and price is right for 8 of them.</li>
            <li> Nice price, but they fall apart fast.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want another one of these if they were free.</li>
            <li> and I definitely enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Get some real castille soap, bar or bottled, use a Mesh pouf and your soap will lather up amazingly and sparingly, too.   </li>
            <li> Free shipping, too.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I just wish that they would be available all the time.  </li>
            <li> They are the larger sponges, with a great ribbon hanging device to use.  </li>
            <li> If all you need is cheap, knock yourself out.</li>
            <li> Great price, comparable quality to the ones you find in the drugstore, thicker then some, not as big as some others.</li>
            <li> They feel cheap, and their quality is cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, fell apart after 1st use.  </li>
            <li> But the price was cheap...</li>
            <li> I like these poufs because they&#x27;re cheap.  </li>
            <li> These cost just slightly more, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and use again.</li>
            <li> Great deal, not quite as big as I was expecting but work just as well.</li>
            <li> These are soft, a good size and work well.</li>
            <li> They have a nice and smooth feel to them and the ribbon loop is very function.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be changed out frequently in the shower to avoid mold and bacteria buildup, so a good idea to have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> The colors are very bright and not exactly to my taste</li>
            <li> very nice especially for the price  has cloth hanging strap  </li>
            <li> These were way smaller than I expected, fitting in the palm of my hand, but I loved the colors and they soap up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love how easy and cheap these products are, but are still very high quality.</li>
            <li> These poufs are much softer than the dollar store ones, so it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> They are on the large size compared to most easily found in stores nowadays.  </li>
            <li> This is really worth the money!</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not fussy about the colors since you don&#x27;t know what colors you&#x27;ll get they are a great value</li>
            <li> but then again I use it once a month and then throw it away so as long as it scrubs and does it jobs I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I had used them in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
            <li> I think these are very decent quality (better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drugstore), for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy poufs that&#x27;ll clean you well.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure what I needed or what I&#x27;d like, so I went the cheap route.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and these are bigger than most that you see in the store.  </li>
            <li> My body feels clean and energized after using these in the shower.</li>
            <li> clean clean clean washes my manly dirt away</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and really functional, and they hold a great lather too.</li>
            <li> Gets me squeaky clean</li>
            <li> Soft and decent quality (not spa or anything but good), better than the ones you get at WalMart for about $3 a piece.</li>
            <li> Soft yet hold up well over many uses!</li>
            <li> Four different colors are great one for each of my family members.&lt;br /&gt;Price is right too.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about them, except the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li> I would describe them as a more of a medium size rather than large.</li>
            <li> Much more affordable than from the drug store which at times would get you one for this price, nice and thick, great colors, highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re here because the colors are important, it may not be worth the risk shopping online.</li>
            <li> If you really like to scrub yourself then these are not for you - you&#x27;d be better off with a bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> Simple and durable, good buy.</li>
            <li> The initial use is good.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else is saying, they are definitely smaller than the ones you can buy at the store, but they&#x27;re a good price</li>
            <li> Full size pouf sponges.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will still come apart just as fast as the others</li>
            <li> They last a good while (before falling apart).  </li>
            <li> OK for the price, but lose their shape fast.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and would last a lot longer than I keep them which is at max, 2 months.</li>
            <li> but really was hopoing for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have 7 replacements around for when one gets old.</li>
            <li> They hold up fairly well and last longer then you should probably keep them hang in in your shower.  </li>
            <li> For a smaller guy or for a lady, these are probably a good</li>
            <li> I love exfoliating in the shower and these hold the shower gel very well</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, just not what I am used to.</li>
            <li> The string falls apart pretty easily....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely happy with my purchase, some of the ones we had were entirely too large, or too &amp;#34;fluffy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I will for sure by some again when I need new ones!</li>
            <li> I would squeeze a decent amount and lather it around most of the convenient body parts, again rather</li>
            <li> The products came quickly and as ordered.  </li>
            <li> but this is such a great product that we are ready to order another package to keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> I keep these at home as backups in case quests come over and would like to shower, and every time I travel I throw one of these in my suite case and just throw it away whenever i&#x27;m ready to fly back home.</li>
            <li> They fall apart rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> These fall apart rather quickly, well within a month.</li>
            <li> And it has to rinse out quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick shipment as well.</li>
            <li> The others have fallen apart quickly as our kids pull them apart.  </li>
            <li> do come apart rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> If they last a good while, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> Love the pale colors, love the size, love the price.  </li>
            <li> Still a decent deal, but not as great as it initially seems.</li>
            <li> These are a great value but they seem to be less durable than the ones I can buy at Target.</li>
            <li> They are made strongly and work well for bathing and scrubbing the skin gently</li>
            <li> My first one lasted a couple months with daily use...just as good as any I have seen in the stores.  </li>
            <li> They do not tear easily and really get the suds going.</li>
            <li> Threw the whole lot away after I used one without pre-testing and showered with it, felt just like sand paper!!</li>
            <li> In fact, I got sexually excited just anticipating the first use.</li>
            <li> Why show all the pretty multi colored sponges if you keep sending myself and others all one color?!</li>
            <li> Daughter and husband love these they the perfect size not to big or small.  </li>
            <li> but they would great for a little boy or girl.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice soft pouf but, hanging in the shower, it stands out through the glass like a large sore</li>
            <li> Nice to have a bunch since you shouldn&#x27;t use these for more than a few months for hygienic reasons.</li>
            <li> It seems that when I am ready to order them that I have to wait for them to become available again.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My favorite one so far.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re bigger and more poufy than the $.99 kind at the drugstore at not a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Stay fresh and</li>
            <li> they were a good value, however they turned out to be way too rough.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even worth attempting to return.</li>
            <li> so these colorful sponges went along with their gift.</li>
            <li> These Pouf sponges were much larger than I thought and they are definitely nice to use.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that they would not be worth the price.  </li>
            <li> These poufs lather well and are nice and big.</li>
            <li> They are nice and big.</li>
            <li> Plastic string quality was not as good as the yarn type.</li>
            <li> These are nice and big.</li>
            <li> Worth it 100%</li>
            <li> The ribbon they are tied with is much better than a rope it dries completely.  </li>
            <li> These are a good deal (monetary), hold up well (about 30 days each), &amp; are cleansing without being rough.  </li>
            <li> I love getting exactly what I want and then seeing there i some little detail that makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, does the job, very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These work ok, but they feel stiff and kind of scratchy.  </li>
            <li> They have an average abrasiveness that imparts a pleasantly scratchy, exfoliating feel to scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> The pack has a variety of brightly colored sponges which don&#x27;t quite go with my decor like the gray or other neutral colors that I can pick at the store.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re poufies, they work as good as any other poofies</li>
            <li> They are large, high quality (don&#x27;t fall apart quickly) and manufactured with \\&quot;soft\\&quot; plastic that feels much better on the skin, yet strong enough to clean.    </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s using them right now, though.</li>
            <li> They are just right.  </li>
            <li> but the price was right.  </li>
            <li> and you can feel your body clean without having to rub too much.</li>
            <li> They are a bit compact at first but soon open up to a nice, comfy size.</li>
            <li> These are actually pretty nice quality and last for a while.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing special about them.  </li>
            <li> I love how well it lathers and works in general.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my annual shower, which I usually take on Christmas eve.</li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me too much if the quality was better, but it&#x27;s a very cheap feeling product and much smaller than the ones you can pick up cheaply from your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Standard bath poufs, cheap and with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I notice how much cleaner I actually feel after a shower, which is a nice surprise I wasn&#x27;t expecting when purchasing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great buy, bigger then ones from Target and Walmart, but smaller then the ones from Walgreens</li>
            <li> Functional, received quickly and serve their purpose, hold up very well</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a pack of poufs and I am happy to see that now the product description does state that one may receive all the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though it has to be a cheap material in order for them to price these so low, the quality doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality pouf sponges!</li>
            <li> These are not the tiny sponges - they are a larger size and very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I will say that they can be found just as cheap at Walmart or many other discount stores.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty much the same as every other cheap loofah I&#x27;ve gotten before - they&#x27;re great in the shower with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and they pull apart over time.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped and what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more when these are used up.</li>
            <li> The first one is holding up well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Bath Sponge (4 Pack) about two months ago and we still using the first one.</li>
            <li> They work well, and although I knew I&#x27;d get a variety of colors, I was glad the majority were white since I used them with gift packs for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just re-order more when my last one is done.</li>
            <li> The ones sold at your local Dollar Tree or 99 cent store are much better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Going back to more plush, softer, gentler ones.</li>
            <li> if you have spent time and money creating a nicely coordinated bath, don&#x27;t count on even getting one pouf that will blend in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the first one for a couple weeks now</li>
            <li> They seem to be holding up better than the ones you buy from local places, especialy for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a couple of months in on using the first one and there is not even the smallest rip in the sponge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it does exactly what you want and seem to be made as well as any pouf I have used.  </li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ll update if they unravel on the first wash...  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the colorful sponges.</li>
            <li> They are pretty but in  no way functional -- I threw them away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bath sponge out of the eight that is in this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first one after a month.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are okay.</li>
            <li> I think only one of them lasted more than three days -- all the rest came untied and unwound in one or two uses.</li>
            <li> First off, you cannot beat this price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, seem very well made, and should last a long while.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> 1-star higher (to 4 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these should and its the first time I ever seen that</li>
            <li> The density of these poufs is even pretty good, some are rather small and lack substance, but these are just about right.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my first pouf for very long, but the quality seems good so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking for cheap backup poufs, these will do fine, but they&#x27;re not high quality.</li>
            <li> Great value, the poufs are well made and 8 will last us a very long time!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the price and they seem to be holding up just fine after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> Smallish compared to poufs in stores, but has certainly held up much better than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in stores recently.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> very cost efficient buy, the sponges are great quality and will last a long time each</li>
            <li> They are as big as I expected and do a great job.</li>
            <li> When you open the package up they look more compact then the real size after they Pouf</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something simple but useful, and cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awesome,and it&#x27;s MUCH better than the one I got from wal-mart at the same price.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, for a reasonable price, and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> They are pretty small, but good for the price.</li>
            <li> Not quite big enough for my liking but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Would have liked to see a little more &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; feel, but works well for daily use.</li>
            <li> I came across these on Amazon and bought them based off the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they hold up fine, but I wish I could find as good a deal on a pack of plain white poufs.</li>
            <li> The hanging strings are the first to go and then the whole loofah unravels allowing you to chose another.  </li>
            <li> These loufahs are soft and full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> These things are pretty small, but they&#x27;re so much more cost effective than buying bath sponges individually.  </li>
            <li> Always need a new one of these and rarely remember to pick them up at the store.  </li>
            <li> They are just the right size and just abrasive enough for you to feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t have to worry about this getting softer and less effective.    </li>
            <li> The different colors make it easy to insure that I don&#x27;t wash my face with something I just used to freshen up my SwampAss.</li>
            <li> I received a selection of several colors and they arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Expected more, first one i used broke when shaking excess water out when was finished.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good texture too, not completely soft like some I&#x27;ve felt, but they also aren&#x27;t overly coarse.</li>
            <li> They feel just as good and last just as long.</li>
            <li> Your add said these were these large size sponges.</li>
            <li> They certainly weren&#x27;t 5 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> Large size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap but it&#x27;s really the same quality that you&#x27;ll buy at the stores at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> They are soft and seem to be made of good quality materials, but you could pick them up at the dollar store and spend less money.  </li>
            <li> Stayed nice and tightly wrapped together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the bright green one for the past couple of days and so far it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> The price per unit is about the same as those sold locally &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; but definitely better quality than those!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These have held up nicely, and the ribbon loop make them look a little classier.</li>
            <li> Nice little poufs...</li>
            <li> The product arrived On time and exactly as described and I  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty simple, nothing fancy or special about them.</li>
            <li> These are just the right size and although tightly bunched I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; with use.  </li>
            <li> I replace these every month, and within that time frame, these have held up really well.</li>
            <li> Nothing really.</li>
            <li> The whole thing literally unravelled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these loofahs for the last few months and can say that they are simply the best ones I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> And they came fast.  </li>
            <li> Really lathers and scrub away the dirt, will detinitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath pouf...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t change them very often.</li>
            <li> These are very comfy, i think they are well balanced</li>
            <li> after showering with them I noted that they lathered really well-better than the one I bought in the store.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I did not want to write a review until I used this product for a while, and they have stood up very well.</li>
            <li> They are made for a child, I was very dissapointed and will never order again</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> How much can you say about a bath sponge?</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t scratch the skin, just gently removes dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> what I did really 10$ for 4</li>
            <li> and I much prefer that over the ribbon type material used for these.  </li>
            <li> I really like them</li>
            <li> They foam the soap up well and seem to be holding up very well.  </li>
            <li> the satin like string has not broken on me in case your wondering</li>
            <li> Cleans really well too.</li>
            <li> Its a bath sponge, but has lasted a whole lot longer</li>
            <li> size, but not by much.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really care about that since its just a shower sponge.</li>
            <li> Really like these scrubs.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the mesh, too, it feels effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li> First, as many of the other reviewers stated I received 4-pcs that are all ONE COLOR!</li>
            <li> I want to get more colors than the original blue, purple, and pink.</li>
            <li> NICE FULL AND PLUSH THICK!</li>
            <li> This is soft but not soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scrub anything, if you like the gentile kind to the skin get this, i even have fun playing with this because it is softer then</li>
            <li> The poofs are fine, exactly the texture I expected.</li>
            <li> also like that the loop is ribbon and not cord like most other poufs I have</li>
            <li> They are a little scratchy, but not terrible, and the string came off the first week I had it.  </li>
            <li> has lasted better then other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> probably best to use on little ones and not adults as the scrubbers are small in size.</li>
            <li> A dollar here, a dollar there and the ones I get are junky and do not lather well, but these are heavy and very full!</li>
            <li> Not the biggest sponge but decent size and feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Good price, convenient especially if you have prime and about average in size and quality.  </li>
            <li> poofs  last a decent amount of time, they are richly colored</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised when I pulled the first one out of the bag.  </li>
            <li> Although the colors are pretty; they aren&#x27;t nearly as soft as the reviews let on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are pretty soft.  </li>
            <li> Sponges are pretty soft and lather well.</li>
            <li> Tightly meshed; should last for a good while.</li>
            <li> After using these, I really wish I had bought a new one a looong time ago.</li>
            <li> Decent poof balls.</li>
            <li> I put a pretty small amount of body wash on the pouf and am able to cover all over my body without problems.</li>
            <li> These are of decent size, not too small/big.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just personal preference, overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I tell you we allways strugle to buy a decent scrub</li>
            <li> I was very impressed, as I was a bit wary of buying bulk poufs (especially after buying one from the store that I paid 5 bucks for and it fell apart within a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got all vibrant colors and none repeated.</li>
            <li> Go to your local store and spend the same amount for a better product.</li>
            <li> They are soft but very sturdy and hold soap and body wash very well.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and comfortable in daily use.</li>
            <li> Decent quality loofas.</li>
            <li> I thought cheap stuffs mean cheap quality, but this one changed my idea.</li>
            <li> Normal ones like what you can find in the local super market or drug store.</li>
            <li> If I cannot find large or extra large pouf balls in Amazon, then I don’t know where?!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these body wash sponges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again and would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Almost too well made for me; I like them better after they start to fall apart a little.  </li>
            <li> I use these everyday, and feel fresh and clean afterwords, every time.</li>
            <li> They do not fall apart as easily as some other higher-end brands.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel soft at all and are very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Great buy, but I was not impressed with the quality of the pouf sponges.  </li>
            <li> These work very well, soft and do not fall apart like others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and well made so they hold up very well.</li>
            <li> that what I normally can get one or two.</li>
            <li> I with the poufs were bigger, but they&#x27;re not scratchy and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re normal bath size, and hold up well.</li>
            <li> They are a nice, large size, and are stiff enough to give skin a vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I would normally pay for one.</li>
            <li> These are just like any normal bath pouf.</li>
            <li> I have not used any of them yet, but I do not think they will last as long as the more generous, fuller sponges.</li>
            <li> The first 8 pack last very well</li>
            <li> and when I rinse them its with the body wash I normally use.</li>
            <li> They are nice and thick and made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No hard plastic piece on it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all right for the price, but I can get the same thing at the drug store for 79 cents.</li>
            <li> I typed large and extra large mesh pouf bath sponges</li>
            <li> one fuchsia, one bright green, one pastel green, and one light blue.</li>
            <li> They produce a good amount of foam, but I think they&#x27;re a little rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> so it can save you a trip to the store when you need a new one.  </li>
            <li> BUT I CAN LIVE WITH IT.  </li>
            <li> We try to change loofahs every time we get a new bottle of body wash.</li>
            <li> I ordered them because I purchase a new one every time I go food shopping...</li>
            <li> I like buying this 8 pack because then I have them on hand and can have a new one every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> Needed new pouf sponges.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because when I have bought them at the drugstores near my home, I get only 3 for more than the price of these.&lt;br /&gt;They function fine, and do not wear thin very soon.  </li>
            <li> They are made out of nice material which is not too harsh, yet abrasive enough to feel exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I bought this since I needed to add another item to get free shipping, so it was actually only my 2nd purchase of pouf sponge</li>
            <li> These mesh pouf bath sponges are more like little tootoos!</li>
            <li> but they are very soft.</li>
            <li> Seem to be lasting a long time and lather well and rinse out easily too.  </li>
            <li> The first one fell apart the second time it was used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working so far!</li>
            <li> I received 2 white, 1 pink and 1 yellow - nice assortment.  </li>
            <li> One pouf has lasted over a month so far!  </li>
            <li> These are the same price but much higher quality than the ones I can get at wal-mart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I expected - colors are nice, one I&#x27;ve been using has held up well for the past couple of months.</li>
            <li> These are much thicker than the ones you can buy at Dollar General for a buck.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good size, works well, the green is kinda ugly, but you can see that from the picture</li>
            <li> since taken hygiene slightly more seriously and wanted a way to really cover all the nooks and cranny</li>
            <li> This is a great deal but the sponges are a little rougher than I usually like in a sponge.  </li>
            <li> So far I think my &#x27;pouf&#x27; has lasted a month with onlyh beginning to show signs of needing a new one.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really last t hat long, but they were cheap.</li>
            <li> Small, sparce, fall apart pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordered these in bulk because I thought they might wear out quickly like the ones I get from Walmart...but we have only used a couple out the packet..putting them in everyone&#x27;s bathroom...and almost 2 months later...</li>
            <li> They are too thick for me barely hold able and don&#x27;t lather as good as the thin ones</li>
            <li> The different colors are very vibrant and that is what I need.  </li>
            <li> Mine came factory wrapped in a large package of 4, various colors.</li>
            <li> The are not so large, but the regular size.</li>
            <li> I simply cannot find any large size pouf balls anywhere.</li>
            <li> The loofahs are a bit thick, which makes it kind of hard to lather the soap all about the sponge, but either way it works just fine.</li>
            <li> to hard need to be more softer, so i gave to my boyfriend</li>
            <li> These are good sized &amp;#34;Poufs&amp;#34; but they are a little too fluffy.</li>
            <li> The size is great considering the price, usually if you buy a loofa in walgreens it goes for $7 and its the small one.</li>
            <li> I now have clean poufs for months to come for a lot less than I&#x27;d pay elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these do not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> They are soft though so for anyone looking for a firmer sponge to help exfoliate this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ones I get at the beauty store which are much poofier  and last longest, but I&#x27;m too lazy-busy to go get</li>
            <li> The colors help me feel like I&#x27;ve changed out the old and in with</li>
            <li> Works well so far.  </li>
            <li> No big deal for me really.</li>
            <li> A marked improvement over a washrag in my estimation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this multipack months ago and have thrown away 2 of them so far.</li>
            <li> These appear larger then they really are...</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that they are.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything</li>
            <li> 2 were completely unraveled when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Soft and not overly abrasive.</li>
            <li> These are soft and rugged.  </li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t like them as much as the ones I had before the smaller</li>
            <li> Not at all soft and doesn&#x27;t lather well.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cheaply priced, average quality, and they came quickly, I expected nothing less... or more.</li>
            <li> I was expecting average quality and a small size, but these are very nice and big.</li>
            <li> They also do not come apart as easily with use as some of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little on the small side; my old one was almost twice the size but at this price with this quantity these sponges are a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> these are great colors but don&#x27;t last very long before they fall apart, but it&#x27;s hard to find one that does last.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent tradeoff for price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these several times in the past and been reasonably satisfied given the price.</li>
            <li> I got bright green, blue, pink, and red.  </li>
            <li> I mean, if you like the small ones, they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> These were nice little puffs, smaller than average but still very soft.  </li>
            <li> These puffs do NOT provide adequate lather and are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep the strap around your wrist the whole time you&#x27;re using the pouf, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that</li>
            <li> So they are cheap, small and average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are the same roughness you&#x27;d expect from a normal one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed, even for the price I could get better at the store for just a few cents more.  </li>
            <li> This is just my preference, but I like it when my loofahs are a little more rough against the skin.</li>
            <li> If I knew they were smaller than store, I would not even purchase them; however, I have to admit that they are cheap and for the price, you get small size and average roughness balls which is not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of this silky kind of ribbon that sort of sticks together when wet and is sometimes hard to separate.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a new one, which fell apart about three days later.    </li>
            <li> Not that big a deal (we just tied new knots in them) but is the factor keeping them from being a 5 star product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not necessarily a germaphobe, but this is something I&#x27;m using to clean my body; who knows many dirty hands or surfaces these came in contact with between manufacturing and packaging.</li>
            <li> They are all the same color with Old Spice on the hand loop!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70&amp;#34; tall man and it fills up my hands so if you&#x27;re small they might be to big, not even sure if you can have a to big loffa</li>
            <li> In the past I was the type of person to jump into a shower and use the bar of soap over most of my body, but I was always pretty lazy with it.</li>
            <li> They are supposed to be soft and feel comfortable to use in the shower, but actually they are very harsh</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with some unique color variations (like one that is green and white) which helps the roommates remember which one is which, and I appreciate that a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also have a ribbon loop as opposed to a rope loop, which is a fun little detail.</li>
            <li> It is abrasive enough to get the dead skin off and make you feel clean without feeling like you are getting hit with a sander.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough not to scratch your skin but not so soft that it&#x27;s in a any way not sturdy or low quality.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough and get the job done.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, but feel like they&#x27;d last awhile too.</li>
            <li> I surprised my student employees with a variety of &#x27;stuff&#x27; and these were a big hit!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive shower poufs before and these are just as nice.</li>
            <li> These are very tight and hold the liquid body wash better than other poufs.</li>
            <li> We need a stockpile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sandwich of buying the el cheapo drug store or grocery store ones that last more like 9 showers rather than 20 ( for me&#x27; there&#x27;s nothing more annoying than the poof  unraveling mid- sudds ).</li>
            <li> They send you random colors, which I&#x27;m fine with as I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> but these are much coarser then the ons from our local grocery store, to rough for the kids</li>
            <li> I will order these again in the far future when I actually wear these ones out.</li>
            <li> Mine came with little ribbons instead of rope and 2 were solid purple, and the others were a combination color, each pouf being half white and half bright</li>
            <li> They are cheap, poorly made little things barely worth using as a travel item.</li>
            <li> and i mean like it gets you clean</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t keep the lather up as long as my old ratty one, either.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few weeks now and the one I&#x27;ve been using has held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> These are slightly scratchy but I&#x27;ve certainly had scratchier.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; ones I have previously purchased at Target, but they are pretty soft and half the price.</li>
            <li> It really helps exfoliate, which my previous (Target brand) shower pouf didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Theirs are actually soft and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> The poufs run a little on the large side, but no complaints.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got four of the one bold color that absolutely clashes with my bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> These are soft enough to not rough up your skin but rough enough that they remove dirt and stuff in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would be super cheap and rough on my skin</li>
            <li> Each sponge comes out costing like $1.50, and one sponge can last for at least half a year with no problems :)</li>
            <li> They are fine, not too harsh, but just a little too big.</li>
            <li> I was looking for real large size pouf balls which were really rough, so they could scrub all the dead skins off my body and back.</li>
            <li> I put them in clear solo cups and put a pom pom on top,then i wraped them in a cellophane bag with pink ribbons.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy since the price seemed low, but I was pleasantly surprised to get really good, thick poufs.</li>
            <li> Still they are decent and they last as long as other bath sponges.</li>
            <li> These are a little smaller and slightly harsher than I expected, but they seem to get the dirt off just fine.  </li>
            <li> I like the little handle being made of a simple loop of ribbon, although I&#x27;m sure this makes it  little harder to locate (as shown by my husband rarely hanging this poor on the shower handle ).</li>
            <li> Now at first, I thought these were quite rough, but now I really appreciate the roughness after they&#x27;ve broken in a bit.</li>
            <li> so they obviously only last so long.</li>
            <li> never had a poufy last so long; going on 2 1/2 months and just finally had to change it.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t return something that cost so little</li>
            <li> These are not very soft and actually hurt my skin when using it.  </li>
            <li> Usually on a new &amp;#34;pouf&amp;#34; the mesh is rather tight and balled up, these do not feel that way and don&#x27;t last quite as long as ones purchased from the store.</li>
            <li> works, doesnt fall apart too fast (and I usually tear these apart).</li>
            <li> They last a fairly long time as well.</li>
            <li> This sponge doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I think each one will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and they last long.</li>
            <li> They do have a funky odor at first but it slowly diminishes.</li>
            <li> These pouf&#x27;s have a sweet little ribbon loop instead of the usual yarnlike rope loop.</li>
            <li> I was afraid all the others I came across would be the same and wasn&#x27;t sure how to buy another.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the ribbon handle, allowing the sponge to hand inside the shower and dry between uses.</li>
            <li> Pouf&#x27;s are larger than I thought, definitely bigger than my closed fist.</li>
            <li> I received red, blue, pink and purple.</li>
            <li> After I observed someone touch EVERY pouf in a bin at my local drugstore while fishing for the only pink pouf, I decided to buy my poufs online.  </li>
            <li> They are large, at least for me.</li>
            <li> bought this and has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one for a long time and the shape keeps up.</li>
            <li> They keep their shape for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They did not fall apart and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected it to be but works well nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Holds soap for washing those long days and nights away.</li>
            <li> these come with a thicker cloth hanger that is not quite as long.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Theres not really any cons for the change in material, its just my personal preference I think, but I thought Id mention it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since adding this to my wishlist a long time ago, they used to sell it as a four pack.  </li>
            <li> Had an odd small at first, but I believe that just the nature of plastic.  </li>
            <li> At least the ones I received are worth buying and cost a lot less than the ones I almost bought at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> and they are useful but are a little small and too rough for me.  </li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;ve used so far, since January, is still in one piece, hasn&#x27;t fallen apart, is still tightly compacted and lathers galore!</li>
            <li> Be careful with the hanging strap because I can tell it&#x27;s very thin and easy to break the stitching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bigger person and am used to something a little bigger.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than some other poufs, but I dont care, I just need something to help me scrub my body.</li>
            <li> They are a little small at first, but after a couple of uses they work well</li>
            <li> The material is different from other brands.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and tough enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> When I received them they were all the same color, they were very small, and also very soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stocked up now for a very long time.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the mesh is a too soft.</li>
            <li> The only bummer is that the ribbon holder falls off after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a suction cup that slides along the rope that I wish I could take off since I can&#x27;t use it in my modified clawfoot tub, but that&#x27;s a pretty minor complaint, especially since it is fairly small, maybe 1.5\\&quot; in diameter.</li>
            <li> Sponges are not too small and soft.  </li>
            <li> They are smaller than average store pouf balls which you can purchase in Walmart, Target or so on.</li>
            <li> Their roughness is average but they are only a dollar a peace.</li>
            <li> I searched online and purchased from this seller ONLY because I needed the 4 colors displayed (pink, purple, blue, green).</li>
            <li> They have maintained their shape and have not come loose from the loop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived with no packaging, just loose in a postal envelope.</li>
            <li> I had used my last pouf for the past couple years and it had totally fallen apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually managed to use the same one for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> are decent and not too rough, but a little small for me.</li>
            <li> I wish they could be a little gentler (no need to take off an entire layer of skin!)</li>
            <li> They are regular size, not that little \\&quot;mini\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> maybe a little smaller then the &amp;#34;average&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recently got a pouf  from a grocery store that felt fine to the touch but scratched my skin so bad that it hurt when I bathed with it.</li>
            <li> I little too firm for soft skin, but once they break in they are alright.</li>
            <li> They are not to soft and not to hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for about a month and none of the mesh has started to come out of the center yet.</li>
            <li> They even have a ribbon handle (unlike a lot of them that have that rough plasitic rope that tends to scratch as well).  </li>
            <li> COLORS OF PINK</li>
            <li> Does what it is expected to.  </li>
            <li> Rougher than expected.  </li>
            <li> They lather and scrub my body parts as expected.  </li>
            <li> The loop is very sturdy and hasn&#x27;t broken off once.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these--</li>
            <li> These sponges work exactly as expected. &#x27;</li>
            <li> The poufs feel like they&#x27;re doing their job without being rough or overly scratchy.</li>
            <li> consider what they sell in store, small and not rough.</li>
            <li> They are too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I gave the pink and purple ones to my girlfriend</li>
            <li> The mesh seems to unravel after just a few weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> They are thick - do not fall apart - and I&#x27;ve purchased this item multiple times and will continue to in the future.</li>
            <li> We got the blue pink purple and green.</li>
            <li> I got a pink, purple, blue, and green one.</li>
            <li> received 2 green, 2 purple, 2 blue, and 2 pink.</li>
            <li> Firm and not easily fall apart like other spongers, The fabric is very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Well, none of the pretty, colorful ones pictured - I GOT 4 UGLY DARK EMERALD GREEN SPONGES!</li>
            <li> the time I ordered the product, judging by the description and by the other reviews, I expected to get a color assortment.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my loofas at Walmart or stores like that and pay at least twice as much as these.</li>
            <li> I rate it 4 because it is small than what i regularly use.</li>
            <li> They are so small, about the size of my fist, if not smaller.</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviews on this product say, these shower poufs do NOT have attached suction cups on the strings.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I jumped on this product.  </li>
            <li> They are actually the small size.</li>
            <li> They fall apart like all the other ones do after 30-90 days</li>
            <li> I am not sure I&#x27;d want any larger than these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert in this product, so to me it seems like any other mesh I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My last order, however, bore no resemblance to what I&#x27;ve received in the past.</li>
            <li> Sharp looking and well made.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Dye doesn&#x27;t leak into the tub like other loofahs.</li>
            <li> In other words, they don&#x27;t hold their shape.</li>
            <li> Well, I use the man colored ones and the woman uses the other colors.  </li>
            <li> Some you buy are way to big and some are way to small..</li>
            <li> The quality does seem comparative to other poufs I&#x27;ve bought, but they are not the size or style that I prefer.</li>
            <li> keep all 4 in my shower and use a different color everyday!</li>
            <li> Strap doesn&#x27;t break like some of the other sponges I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Will last me a year for the price I usually buy one.</li>
            <li> Very rough I trashed them</li>
            <li> The string attached is very small which didn&#x27;t allow for it to dry properly without my using a hanger.</li>
            <li> And I shower a lot as I&#x27;ve quite active.</li>
            <li> Instead of that, I received the number mentioned in the pack, but they were a shadow of what they should be, in fact, they were TOO small, not even round as the pictures and could barely help in cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use even less soap now, as a small drop is sufficient to wash my entire body due to it lathering so well.</li>
            <li> They do the job, but the place where the strap connects to the pouf feels extremely sharp and can graze you if you put that side down toward your skin.</li>
            <li> A little too rough.  </li>
            <li> I bought these online ONLY for the fact that the reviews stated they had attached suction cups, and was very disappointed when I received my 5 packages to find they&#x27;re just regular, cheap shower poufs with NO suction cups.</li>
            <li> I also like the ribbon attached to them instead of that little white rope you usually see.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find body sponges - I had a number of them left over from my sales days as a MK consultant.  </li>
            <li> This is your average bath sponge for cleaning your body.</li>
            <li> These are just your average loofahs.</li>
            <li> The Colors are random but who really cares?  </li>
            <li> These run tinier than your average shower poof but still get the job done.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I dont like the material they used to make the loop to hang it from.  </li>
            <li> and I assumed these are at least bigger size than the store.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A CRAP SHOOT, BUT QUALITY ITEMS AND EVERYONE IS PLEASED.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that these would be thin poufs but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> These are not large puffs like I expected, they are small ones.</li>
            <li> I used all my stash and now I am down to these.</li>
            <li> I received a dark purple, a dark teal, an olive green and a fushia.  </li>
            <li> Pink, neon green, purple, and like a moldy green.  </li>
            <li> Half of the poofs strings broke after one use.</li>
            <li> They are about HALF the size.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting these to be less dense than they are.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Received a bag full of 1 purple, 1 black and the rest all an ugly green color.</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I thought maybe these would be a little softer.  </li>
            <li> These are a little harsher than I would like, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They are a little bit firmer than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I think these poufs a little overrated.  </li>
            <li> We wash our three little toddlers with these things.  </li>
            <li> These items are a little on the abrasive side for a shower pouf as compared to others.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a little forceful with things, so it&#x27;s probably her fault.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are small (3-4&amp;#34; in diameter), very rough, and never &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34;, and after 2 weeks the string fell off.</li>
            <li> The layers of mesh are thick and tightly grouped at the center.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how small these were and how cheaply made they seemed to be.</li>
            <li> Although these give you a firm &amp;#34;handful&amp;#34;, the material is not abrasive on skin.</li>
            <li> Package arrived with purple and green missing altogether and therefore won&#x27;t work for this family.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They seem heavy duty and the colors are so chic.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the green one hanging on my shower now.</li>
            <li> I had to throw them away because I couldn&#x27;t afford the wasted soap anymore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on them.</li>
            <li> Some were two tones with the ugliest shades of green.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, i gave them away.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of buying these things from stores.</li>
            <li> Hold up well to everyday use.</li>
            <li> None were missing from the sealed package that they came in.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained about how rough the loofahs are, but why use a loofah if you don&#x27;t want something to scrub your skin?</li>
            <li> green/pink/dull green.</li>
            <li> I like these as they don&#x27;t fall apart after a few times of use.</li>
            <li> I received four small, dark green loufas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are not huge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come across bath sponges that had a hard material in the center of the sponges or on the hanging loop, but not these!</li>
            <li> Not true!</li>
            <li> These are a little small.</li>
            <li> I always rinse these before use when I buy, but I was shocked that the color ran (i used the purple one first.)  </li>
            <li> These are just your ordinary pouf that you would find at any store.  </li>
            <li> I saw a review that said these were small, which is what sold me.  </li>
            <li> They are small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> These are rougher than the ones that I usually purchase in the store.  </li>
            <li> There sorta small from what I&#x27;m used to buying</li>
            <li> They look really small in the package but</li>
            <li> I usually pay about three to four bucks for a loofah sponge so getting four for about five bucks is</li>
            <li> There was another listing for SMALL ones</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say.  </li>
            <li> , thats how small they are.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> , these are the small ones that you can get for $1.00 anywhere</li>
            <li> They are too small.  </li>
            <li> Just like the expensive version in regular stores.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t supposed to be travel size poufs, but I find them really small.  </li>
            <li> If there was less than one star, I would give  that!!  </li>
            <li> These are no better than the ones you get for $1, and at least you get to pick the color.</li>
            <li> my previous one, if your looking for something a bit tough that it scrubs hardcore to the cleanest</li>
            <li> They start off very stiff but I&#x27;ve found that it allows them to stay tighter longer.</li>
            <li> The mesh is not crunchy or hard.  </li>
            <li> I found these hard to lather.</li>
            <li> I figured with 8 coming in the package, I was guaranteed to get at least 1 each of the 4 needed colors.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and poofy, and I&#x27;ve never had one fall apart.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money on These!!</li>
            <li> no more community loofahs!</li>
            <li> They are very small.</li>
            <li> You get 4 in the pack and much less expensive</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The only downside I found is that they smell terribly of plastic when you open them, but they&#x27;re intended to use with soap, so after 2 washes that smell is gone.</li>
            <li> Not a good sing when deployed to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> They are also small and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe a single bad review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get them sudsy and they have a strange unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I use these every time I shower and each sponge lasts for at least 2 months, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these, an 8 pk for 8</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying these singularly at the store</li>
            <li> I would prefer twine or thin rope for the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; but the ribbon they use works well.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of my loofahs falling apart every month or so, so I bought this pack to stock up.</li>
            <li> the ribbon that they hang on has broken on all 4 in the pack.</li>
            <li> I am a girly girl, I don&#x27;t want ugly Emerald Green.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why poufs are so expensive, but these were the cheapest I found and seem to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Really uncomfortable material.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I have been unable to match the quality of these loofas (sp?) for the price anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> These were terrible, harsh, awful little things that I ended up just throwing in the trash.</li>
            <li> I went crazy with Bath and Body Works end of the year sale and matched these sponges with them for gifts.</li>
            <li> They had a terrible smell; I&#x27;m not sure what it was, but it reminded me of turpentine.</li>
            <li> The colors you receive are very random, but I dont mind.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use them they were so bad..</li>
            <li> Too bad you couldn&#x27;t choose the color you want..</li>
            <li> but these are so bad</li>
            <li> UNHAPPY &amp; UNIMPRESSED!</li>
            <li> Boom... get yourself a 4 pack and go CRAZY!</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit annoying to try and hold on to.</li>
            <li> the colors that I received I hate</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless!!</li>
            <li> Smelled terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These puffs do NOT provide adequate lather and are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> to hard need to be more softer, so i gave to my boyfriend</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality.  Will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> bought this and has lasted me a long time. easy to travel and use.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a donation for boarding school kids.</li>
            <li> They send you random colors, which I&#x27;m fine with as I don&#x27;t really care. I replace these every month, and within that time frame, these have held up really well. They&#x27;re a good texture too, not completely soft like some I&#x27;ve felt, but they also aren&#x27;t overly coarse.</li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly one of the more hesitant purchases I have done but one of the best still.&lt;br /&gt;The main concern I had was the size-thankfully these are quite &amp;#34;adult sized&amp;#34;- not MINIs.&lt;br /&gt;Second concern was &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;- again a winner! Although these give you a firm &amp;#34;handful&amp;#34;, the material is not abrasive on skin. As a matter of fact I have taken this baby to my face. UH HUH. It&#x27;s that nice.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they seem well put together. They have maintained their shape and have not come loose from the loop.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the loop is ribbon and not cord like most other poufs I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;All in all an amazing deal for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal, for 4 sponges that&#x27;s neat. I rate it 4 because it is small than what i regularly use.</li>
            <li> Nice price, but they fall apart fast.</li>
            <li> Tightly meshed; should last for a good while. You get good lather with it. Hung by ribbon not rope. Happy.</li>
            <li> A little too rough.  Great value.  Would have liked to see a little more &amp;#34;plush&amp;#34; feel, but works well for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Buy it!! What are you risking? Nothing really. Just a couple bucks. Be warned though, if you&#x27;re a guy, some of the colors are fruity. But there is like two you would not mind using like at the gym or some place.</li>
            <li> Much more affordable than from the drug store which at times would get you one for this price, nice and thick, great colors, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  Standard bath poufs, cheap and with free shipping.  Beats the prices where I&#x27;d get them locally.</li>
            <li> Small, sparce, fall apart pretty quickly. These are no better than the ones you get for $1, and at least you get to pick the color. Bad purchase, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These are just your ordinary pouf that you would find at any store.  There&#x27;s really nothing special about them.  They are soft and seem to be made of good quality materials, but you could pick them up at the dollar store and spend less money.  It is nice that you get 4 so it can save you a trip to the store when you need a new one.  The colors are very bright and not exactly to my taste but they would great for a little boy or girl.  It is nice that Overall they are a good product but I think next time I will just grab one at the local dollar store.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to using a Loofa. While not as effective to exfoliate the skin, it also doesn&#x27;t cause pain as some people have mentioned to me. Also, you don&#x27;t have to worry about this getting softer and less effective.    I would use a loofa is you can afford it and withstand the difference in feeling. However, this is definitely better than using a rag or your hands to sap and scrub your body.</li>
            <li> These loufahs are soft and full. You get 4 in the pack and much less expensive that what I normally can get one or two. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The first one fell apart the second time it was used. The whole thing literally unravelled. Thinking this was a one-off I replaced it with a new one, which fell apart about three days later.    All four mesh poufs were used up within two weeks.     I wouldn&#x27;t want another one of these if they were free.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous. They are all the same color with Old Spice on the hand loop! They are so small, about the size of my fist, if not smaller. Save your money. Either go to your local dollar store and buy one for $0.99 or spend $3.00 on one that&#x27;ll actually last and isn&#x27;t going to disappoint you by its size..</li>
            <li> These bath sponges are the perfect texture for me and my boyfriend. I have sensitive skin and these do not hurt at all. They are soft though so for anyone looking for a firmer sponge to help exfoliate this product is not for you. This is your average bath sponge for cleaning your body. My favorite one so far.</li>
            <li> I saw a review that said these were small, which is what sold me.  They are too big in my opinion.  They are fine, not too harsh, but just a little too big.</li>
            <li> These puffs are cheap and look good out of the box, but they loosen and separate extremely easily. I might buy them again for the price, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for a better value.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They&#x27;re not scratchy at all.  There&#x27;s even a suction cup to afix these to the shower wall.  They&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> Great value for the number of poufs. Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> good quality product.</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviews on this product say, these shower poufs do NOT have attached suction cups on the strings. I bought these online ONLY for the fact that the reviews stated they had attached suction cups, and was very disappointed when I received my 5 packages to find they&#x27;re just regular, cheap shower poufs with NO suction cups. They&#x27;re all right for the price, but I can get the same thing at the drug store for 79 cents. If you prefer to mail order everything, they&#x27;re a fine deal.</li>
            <li> These are great. They&#x27;re bigger and more poufy than the $.99 kind at the drugstore at not a whole lot more. I&#x27;ve been using one for about a month and none of the mesh has started to come out of the center yet. I like the texture of the mesh, too, it feels effective without being harsh. There&#x27;s a suction cup that slides along the rope that I wish I could take off since I can&#x27;t use it in my modified clawfoot tub, but that&#x27;s a pretty minor complaint, especially since it is fairly small, maybe 1.5\\&quot; in diameter. All in all, a really solid buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a pouf before, but these feel nice!  I use with Olay Moisture Body Wash to try to alleviate \\&quot;winter itch\\&quot; here in Minnesota.  It&#x27;s working so far!</li>
            <li> So many loofa!!! So cleaaan</li>
            <li> Lasted around 2 years. Decent poof balls.</li>
            <li> I love these poufs! I recently got a pouf  from a grocery store that felt fine to the touch but scratched my skin so bad that it hurt when I bathed with it. I was afraid all the others I came across would be the same and wasn&#x27;t sure how to buy another.  After reading these reviews I thought maybe these would be a little softer.  These are perfect!  They&#x27;re soft enough not to scratch your skin but not so soft that it&#x27;s in a any way not sturdy or low quality.  They even have a ribbon handle (unlike a lot of them that have that rough plasitic rope that tends to scratch as well).  I definately reccomend them!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. The different colors make it easy to insure that I don&#x27;t wash my face with something I just used to freshen up my SwampAss.</li>
            <li> they are puffy and big I&#x27;m 70&amp;#34; tall man and it fills up my hands so if you&#x27;re small they might be to big, not even sure if you can have a to big loffa</li>
            <li> Great deal!!  I love to use them with my Philosophy and plenty of puffs to share.</li>
            <li> These are a little harsher than I would like, but you can&#x27;t beat the price. They last a fairly long time as well.</li>
            <li> Sturdy poufs that&#x27;ll clean you well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these loofahs for the last few months and can say that they are simply the best ones I have ever used.  They are large, high quality (don&#x27;t fall apart quickly) and manufactured with \\&quot;soft\\&quot; plastic that feels much better on the skin, yet strong enough to clean.    I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really last t hat long, but they were cheap. A bit scratchier than the pricier versions in the store. Overall a decent tradeoff for price.</li>
            <li> must get another shipment!</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of Poufs.  They are made out of nice material which is not too harsh, yet abrasive enough to feel exfoliating.  When you open the package up they look more compact then the real size after they Pouf up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Poufs have a nice handy loop which I hang on the shower caddy. The current model does not have suction cups mentioned in some reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the size and the feel and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love them and always buy when I am in the store. Love the colors and the size. It always takes me an extra trip. I thank you</li>
            <li> In the past I was the type of person to jump into a shower and use the bar of soap over most of my body, but I was always pretty lazy with it. Once I switched to body wash I would squeeze a decent amount and lather it around most of the convenient body parts, again rather lazily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since taken hygiene slightly more seriously and wanted a way to really cover all the nooks and cranny&#x27;s on my body effectively. I really wasn&#x27;t sure what I needed or what I&#x27;d like, so I went the cheap route. I came across these on Amazon and bought them based off the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pouf&#x27;s are larger than I thought, definitely bigger than my closed fist. I put a pretty small amount of body wash on the pouf and am able to cover all over my body without problems. I do have a bit of an issue reaching my mid-to-upper back. The pouf doesn&#x27;t feel like sand paper and I definitely enjoy using it. It&#x27;s something simple but useful, and cheap. Exactly what I hoped and what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Get some real castille soap, bar or bottled, use a Mesh pouf and your soap will lather up amazingly and sparingly, too.   So far I think my &#x27;pouf&#x27; has lasted a month with onlyh beginning to show signs of needing a new one. I like em, and they seem a bit more substantial than the ones at Walmart, but who knows, they might even be the same thing.</li>
            <li> These were perfect! I went crazy with Bath and Body Works end of the year sale and matched these sponges with them for gifts.</li>
            <li> They are small. I&#x27;m a bigger person and am used to something a little bigger. Probably good for travel but not for every day use.</li>
            <li> Love that I have a stock of these for when they start to wear out. Great price and more durable than others I&#x27;ve bought I stores.</li>
            <li> These are of decent size, not too small/big. I use these every time I shower and each sponge lasts for at least 2 months, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these, an 8 pk for 8$ seems like a deal.</li>
            <li> These are definitely bigger than one&#x27;s fist.  Whoever wrote that is exaggerating, or nuts.  I got bright green, blue, pink, and red.  Nice combination.  I didn&#x27;t get a suction cup on mine, but the hanging string is nicer than the ones in the store.  It matches the pouf.  These seem to hold up well and do the job.  Good value considering the ones at the store are 3.50 each.  Free shipping, too.  And they came fast.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> very nice especially for the price  has cloth hanging strap  no suctions cups  love em</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying these singularly at the store so I decided to buy them in bulk.  The products came quickly and as ordered.  The colors are nice and these are bigger than most that you see in the store.  They also do not come apart as easily with use as some of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I think these are a really great value for the price and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great quality for cost.  They are thick - do not fall apart - and I&#x27;ve purchased this item multiple times and will continue to in the future.</li>
            <li> Well made, sturdy. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless!! Threw the whole lot away after I used one without pre-testing and showered with it, felt just like sand paper!! I bought these to switch out for me and my daughters&#x27; since it&#x27;s recommended to change your pouf every month because of bacteria growth, Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money on These!! Your kids will NEVER use these even if you can stand the roughness, thankfully I didn&#x27;t throw out the girls&#x27; poufs from before, only mine.</li>
            <li> Does what it was intended to do, good body scrubber at a good price. Just wish it came in multiple colors and not just a bunch of the same color.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRICE AND A GREAT PRODUCT.  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A CRAP SHOOT, BUT QUALITY ITEMS AND EVERYONE IS PLEASED.  COLORS OF PINK AREN&#x27;T MY CHOICE BUT I CAN LIVE WITH IT.  NICE FULL AND PLUSH THICK!</li>
            <li> Soft yet hold up well over many uses!</li>
            <li> Stayed nice and tightly wrapped together. Worth the purchase. Holds my body wash perfectly and is not too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> These things are pretty small, but they&#x27;re so much more cost effective than buying bath sponges individually.  They&#x27;re soft enough and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I had used my last pouf for the past couple years and it had totally fallen apart. After using these, I really wish I had bought a new one a looong time ago. They&#x27;re soft, but feel like they&#x27;d last awhile too. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Same quality that you would find in a store and the price per unit is very good.  Colors are randomized as indicated.  Will definitely be buying more when these are used up.</li>
            <li> Love the pale colors, love the size, love the price.  What else can you say about bath sponges?</li>
            <li> I myself take two showers a day, plus whatever my husband does so between the two of us, poker are a weekly disposable. I think they are supposed to last like twenty showers... So do the math... We need a stockpile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sandwich of buying the el cheapo drug store or grocery store ones that last more like 9 showers rather than 20 ( for me&#x27; there&#x27;s nothing more annoying than the poof  unraveling mid- sudds ). I prefer the ones I get at the beauty store which are much poofier  and last longest, but I&#x27;m too lazy-busy to go get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these poofs  last a decent amount of time, they are richly colored and they Are nice and cheap. That&#x27;s the trifecta in my book! I like the little handle being made of a simple loop of ribbon, although I&#x27;m sure this makes it  little harder to locate (as shown by my husband rarely hanging this poor on the shower handle ). But I do think its a chick addition. The colors help me feel like I&#x27;ve changed out the old and in with the new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve set up A auto shipment on these so they just come once a month and its all taken care of. I keep the stockpile in the spare bath. For me, its a good product that I don&#x27;t have to think about.</li>
            <li> Nice shower poufs for the whole family with a great price point. Now at first, I thought these were quite rough, but now I really appreciate the roughness after they&#x27;ve broken in a bit. It really helps exfoliate, which my previous (Target brand) shower pouf didn&#x27;t do. I notice how much cleaner I actually feel after a shower, which is a nice surprise I wasn&#x27;t expecting when purchasing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with some unique color variations (like one that is green and white) which helps the roommates remember which one is which, and I appreciate that a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit smaller than I would&#x27;ve liked, but it does the job just fine, and at this price point I am perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few weeks now and the one I&#x27;ve been using has held up pretty well. Be careful with the hanging strap because I can tell it&#x27;s very thin and easy to break the stitching. The loofahs are a bit thick, which makes it kind of hard to lather the soap all about the sponge, but either way it works just fine.</li>
            <li> These are just your average loofahs. Nothing special about them, except the price.</li>
            <li> Works well so far.  Does what it is expected to.  Price was good for the 8pk.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is made very well! Great price too, I would definitely reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I searched online and purchased from this seller ONLY because I needed the 4 colors displayed (pink, purple, blue, green). I figured with 8 coming in the package, I was guaranteed to get at least 1 each of the 4 needed colors.  (With 6 people in one bathroom, color coding becomes a necessity!)  Package arrived with purple and green missing altogether and therefore won&#x27;t work for this family.  If you&#x27;re here because the colors are important, it may not be worth the risk shopping online.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t great, but they&#x27;ll do for the price.  I probably won&#x27;t buy them again.  They are a little scratchy, but not terrible, and the string came off the first week I had it.  If you&#x27;re just looking for cheap backup poufs, these will do fine, but they&#x27;re not high quality.</li>
            <li> I am still on the 1st one of these I have been using. They are made strongly and work well for bathing and scrubbing the skin gently and they don&#x27;t need much body wash solution to get a good cleaning. At least the ones I received are worth buying and cost a lot less than the ones I almost bought at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I jumped on this product.  When I received them they were all the same color, they were very small, and also very soft.  If you really like to scrub yourself then these are not for you - you&#x27;d be better off with a bar of soap.  One of them fell apart about a week or use.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Your add said these were these large size sponges. Not true! They are actually the small size.</li>
            <li> The price for these loofa is great! The size is great considering the price, usually if you buy a loofa in walgreens it goes for $7 and its the small one. Really lathers and scrub away the dirt, will detinitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> the material is not that good. it&#x27;ll start to tear after five uses. then another five , it will be all torn. bought six at two different times</li>
            <li> After using this batch sponge twice it came apart. Not a good sing when deployed to Afghanistan. Product did not reach expectations.</li>
            <li> I was worried that these would be thin poufs but was pleasantly surprised.  They seem heavy duty and the colors are so chic.  I received a dark purple, a dark teal, an olive green and a fushia.  I am very happy with the purchase. It does not seem like I have to worry about them falling apart.</li>
            <li> Poufier (sp?) that I thought.  Happy with the product.  Had an odd small at first, but I believe that just the nature of plastic.  Works well for the price.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath pouf...great quality and great price!  I was expecting average quality and a small size, but these are very nice and big. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Great for showers and liked the different selection of colors. They weren&#x27;t quite as good as the ones I&#x27;d buy from my local store, but they were a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this since I needed to add another item to get free shipping, so it was actually only my 2nd purchase of pouf sponge and I can complain as they have held up fine and as the title states the price is right!!</li>
            <li> I love pouf sponges. I use them way longer than others seem to. I used them until they fall apart, and these have lasted easily months for me. I don&#x27;t change them very often. And I shower a lot as I&#x27;ve quite active. Good poufs.</li>
            <li> These are way scratchier (is that even a word!?) than what I&#x27;m used to. But I will use them anyways because I don&#x27;t have time to deal with returning them! I guess they just exfoliate better!</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected but they were just perfect!</li>
            <li> These poufs are a great deal. Soft and decent quality (not spa or anything but good), better than the ones you get at WalMart for about $3 a piece.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, you can receive the same color, and of course, I did. No big deal for me really. I was disappointed in how small these were and how cheaply made they seemed to be. The string attached is very small which didn&#x27;t allow for it to dry properly without my using a hanger. Next time I will stick to the larger loofahs. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> These are slightly scratchy but I&#x27;ve certainly had scratchier. The first one is holding up well.  If you&#x27;re looking for a firmer pouf, you&#x27;ll be happy with these.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use these all the time. These are soft enough to not rough up your skin but rough enough that they remove dirt and stuff in the shower. A marked improvement over a washrag in my estimation.</li>
            <li> I got these for stocking stuffers for my daughters, granddaughters and great granddaughters.  These are very tight and hold the liquid body wash better than other poufs.</li>
            <li> These are very comfy, i think they are well balanced and you can feel your body clean without having to rub too much. Happy buyer here!</li>
            <li> I tend to buy a bag every year as needed, these things last a while before wearing out.  Solid product.</li>
            <li> Very rough I trashed them</li>
            <li> No surprises here. Good product, comes as pictured. I would buy them again after I use up all of these.</li>
            <li> These work fine for me and they hold up fine, but I wish I could find as good a deal on a pack of plain white poufs.</li>
            <li> These are soft, a good size and work well. I have read that these things can harbor bacteria if you don&#x27;t switch them out with new ones frequently so this is perfect. I am happy with the quality and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice colors; they don&#x27;t fall apart like those cheap crappy ones you find in the store. It&#x27;s a good deal for the size and quantity, plus the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Good quality bath puff.  Just got them yesterday, but they feel as good of quality as what you pay $5+ each at the store.  Good choice.  The loop is made out of ribbon and not rope - nice pretty touch.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to see some color variety. I only got purple and white. That&#x27;s just personal preference, overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Simple and get the job done! Nice colors.</li>
            <li> Simple and durable, good buy.</li>
            <li> I with the poufs were bigger, but they&#x27;re not scratchy and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I know you can buy these in the dollar section, but they&#x27;re junky.  These are high-quality.  They are nice and thick and made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;d be great to give as a gift!</li>
            <li> I DID NOT get 8 bath sponges, I only got 2</li>
            <li> The loofa&#x27;s work. I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll hold up for awhile, even though I change mine out regularly. It&#x27;s a loofa.... Nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li> I like the handling, storage and cleanliness of body wash vs. soap. These sponges work well, but some do fall apart sooner than others in the package. It&#x27;s almost like some are not properly tied at the factory.</li>
            <li> These were way smaller than I expected, fitting in the palm of my hand, but I loved the colors and they soap up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I bought this Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Bath Sponge (4 Pack) about two months ago and we still using the first one. I tell you we allways strugle to buy a decent scrub but this is such a great product that we are ready to order another package to keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> These are a little small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little on the small side; my old one was almost twice the size but at this price with this quantity these sponges are a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;When they came I was pleased with the beautiful vibrant colors and after showering with them I noted that they lathered really well-better than the one I bought in the store. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and good quality. I&#x27;ve used one for a long time and the shape keeps up. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Rougher than expected.  These are rougher than the ones that I usually purchase in the store.  More exfoliating than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> They lather and scrub my body parts as expected.  They fall apart like all the other ones do after 30-90 days</li>
            <li> These work ok, but they feel stiff and kind of scratchy.  I like the ones that feel silky and luxurious.  If you feel that way too I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these ones.</li>
            <li> Great product. Pouf still intact after 3 weeks of daily uses.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a variety. The initial use is good. The product is holding, but its dismantling...might have have to use the next.</li>
            <li> These are good quality for the price and i like to toss these guys every two weeks so this is a good option.</li>
            <li> The price for these mesh sponges made this an unbeatable deal.  I especially like the ribbon handle, allowing the sponge to hand inside the shower and dry between uses.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my loofas at Walmart or stores like that and pay at least twice as much as these. They feel just as good and last just as long. Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised/nice texture without being too abrasive. Would definetly recommend this product! Nice pastel assorted colors!</li>
            <li> I received red, blue, pink and purple. They are large, at least for me. I am not sure I&#x27;d want any larger than these. Bigger than the ones I&#x27;ve seen in the store and cheaper. The price is actually good, and the quality is great as well. I will for sure by some again when I need new ones!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty simple, nothing fancy or special about them. Like everyone else is saying, they are definitely smaller than the ones you can buy at the store, but they&#x27;re a good price so I don&#x27;t have any complaints besides the size. Also haven&#x27;t been having any problems with them falling apart. Got blue, red, white, and purple. Colors are nice.</li>
            <li> I got them today, beautiful colors &amp; didn&#x27;t get white which I&#x27;m happy on. There sorta small from what I&#x27;m used to buying</li>
            <li> Cheap, great and a good texture.  The Colors are random but who really cares?  I get about 2-3 months out of each one.</li>
            <li> these work great and i love them. one of these with a nice body wash will do the trick right. good quality</li>
            <li> I was suprised these sponges weren&#x27;t smaller for the price I paid.They work well, and although I knew I&#x27;d get a variety of colors, I was glad the majority were white since I used them with gift packs for Christmas. (I ordered two packs.)</li>
            <li> I love getting exactly what I want and then seeing there i some little detail that makes it even better! These pouf&#x27;s have a sweet little ribbon loop instead of the usual yarnlike rope loop. They&#x27;re normal bath size, and hold up well. I like to keep a basket of bath comforts in my guest room - these are a perfect addition.</li>
            <li> very good quality compared to a store bought. will buy again in the future. Recommended. Full size pouf sponges. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice poufs! I have no idea why poufs are so expensive, but these were the cheapest I found and seem to do the trick.</li>
            <li> The product performs as it is intended to work.  My body feels clean and energized after using these in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert in this product, so to me it seems like any other mesh I&#x27;ve used. Very cheap and works well. Nice to have a bunch since you shouldn&#x27;t use these for more than a few months for hygienic reasons.</li>
            <li> They reek of mold. I washed them and let them sit covered in baking soda and it didn&#x27;t help. Then I washed them in the washing machine. They still smell like mold. My family can&#x27;t use them. What a waste.</li>
            <li> Keeps the crud off at a good price. Works good and it&#x27;s a good Christmas present. They don&#x27;t fall apart like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest poofs out there, they all fell apart after only a couple of months, but their definitely not bad for the price. I&#x27;ll probably just re-order more when my last one is done.</li>
            <li> These were nice little puffs, smaller than average but still very soft.  They are nicely made and not scratchy. I would give them 5 stars and would recommend them! Buy these with confidence!</li>
            <li> Our favorite mesh sponge.  They keep their shape for a long time.  I just wish that they would be available all the time.  It seems that when I am ready to order them that I have to wait for them to become available again.</li>
            <li> These are very standard sponges. We got the blue pink purple and green. They look really small in the package but once u get them out and start using them they puff much bigger.</li>
            <li> These sponges have vibrant colors and are the perfect size for all the members of my family.  They did not fall apart and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> clean clean clean washes my manly dirt away</li>
            <li> Was concerned these sponges, would not be the big plush ones I was looking for.  They are the larger sponges, with a great ribbon hanging device to use.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> Great buy, bigger then ones from Target and Walmart, but smaller then the ones from Walgreens but you get 8 for the price of 2 from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, didn&#x27;t smell like petroleum,  unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> I give these 4 stars as you can tell they are not made of the best quality, however its not like they are $10 each either. I keep these at home as backups in case quests come over and would like to shower, and every time I travel I throw one of these in my suite case and just throw it away whenever i&#x27;m ready to fly back home. They are inexpensive and get the job done, yet they wont exfoliate you as well as some others will.</li>
            <li> Great for the price and hold up.</li>
            <li> I purchased these at around $1 a piece. It came in multiple different colors, 4 boy and 4 girl. They seem to last and do the job well!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected it to be but works well nonetheless. I love the variety of colors that came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds soap well and rinses off well too. The loop is very sturdy and hasn&#x27;t broken off once.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality pouf sponges! I was very impressed, as I was a bit wary of buying bulk poufs (especially after buying one from the store that I paid 5 bucks for and it fell apart within a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have held up nicely, and the ribbon loop make them look a little classier. I even put one in the guest bathroom because they&#x27;re so nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these several times in the past and been reasonably satisfied given the price. My last order, however, bore no resemblance to what I&#x27;ve received in the past. The poofs were tiny and already falling apart. They certainly weren&#x27;t 5 inches in diameter. Back they went.</li>
            <li> Not the biggest sponge but decent size and feels very sturdy. I got all vibrant colors and none repeated. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised when I pulled the first one out of the bag.  It was poufy and kind of felt silky, not scratchy.  I&#x27;m sure it will still come apart just as fast as the others</li>
            <li> I want to get more colors than the original blue, purple, and pink.</li>
            <li> These are just the right size and although tightly bunched I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; with use.  I received 2 white, 1 pink and 1 yellow - nice assortment.  The price per unit is about the same as those sold locally &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; but definitely better quality than those!  Will be reordering in the future.</li>
            <li> These were the cheapest 5 start loofas that I could find. I have no complaints. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Holds soap for washing those long days and nights away. Stay fresh and yeah what else is there to say...</li>
            <li> This sponge doesn&#x27;t last long.  It&#x27;s a good thing they come in a 4 pack, since I&#x27;ll need to be replacing it often.</li>
            <li> They start off very stiff but I&#x27;ve found that it allows them to stay tighter longer.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; ones I have previously purchased at Target, but they are pretty soft and half the price.</li>
            <li> They are high-quality, long-lasting and feel nice on the skin. I did not want to write a review until I used this product for a while, and they have stood up very well. I highly recommend these body wash sponges.</li>
            <li> Id recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works as described. They are not a really tiny one. These are good size sponges.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of sets of these with the expectation of receiving what is pictured. Instead of that, I received the number mentioned in the pack, but they were a shadow of what they should be, in fact, they were TOO small, not even round as the pictures and could barely help in cleaning. Honestly, I would not recommend this purchase, unless the seller(s) guarantee that what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are small (3-4&amp;#34; in diameter), very rough, and never &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34;, and after 2 weeks the string fell off. I would just as soon use a dish scrubby to wash myself with. I guess you get what you pay for which is why I can&#x27;t understand the glowing reviews. If all you need is cheap, knock yourself out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the green one hanging on my shower now. They&#x27;re soft and really functional, and they hold a great lather too. In fact, I got sexually excited just anticipating the first use. I gave two of them to my mom, and she liked them. Don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s using them right now, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awesome,and it&#x27;s MUCH better than the one I got from wal-mart at the same price.</li>
            <li> This is really worth the money! I like it a lot and gave a lot to my family members. The quality is superior, better than the one I got at Safeway.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and value. They do not fall apart as easily as some other higher-end brands. As a matter-of-fact, I have not had one fall apart yet!</li>
            <li> Cute colored loofas, but the strap on mine broke off. Wish it was made a little better, but for a cheap 8 pack they&#x27;re great! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, does the job, very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Functional, received quickly and serve their purpose, hold up very well</li>
            <li> Cheap!!!! Go to your local store and spend the same amount for a better product. I couldn&#x27;t even use them they were so bad..</li>
            <li> Great price, comparable quality to the ones you find in the drugstore, thicker then some, not as big as some others. Variety of colors received, no complaints, we would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive shower poufs before and these are just as nice. As long as you&#x27;re not fussy about the colors since you don&#x27;t know what colors you&#x27;ll get they are a great value and I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> these are great colors but don&#x27;t last very long before they fall apart, but it&#x27;s hard to find one that does last.</li>
            <li> I have to use more soap with these. The extra soap I use makes these poufs the most expensive shower poufs I have ever bought. I had to throw them away because I couldn&#x27;t afford the wasted soap anymore. They are also small and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are great!!  Sharp looking and well made. I prefer to use these with the liquid body washes instead of using a wash cloth and bar soap.</li>
            <li> These loofas are great quality and MUCH cheaper than anything you can find in the store.  The rope stays on well and the loofa itself keeps its shape (as opposed to others, which unravel with time).  They&#x27;re also a good texture - exfoliating without scratching off all of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to write more informative reviews, so if you found this review helpful, please check &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; below where it says &amp;#34;Was this review helpful to you?&amp;#34;. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like these pouf sponges a lot.  They are a nice, large size, and are stiff enough to give skin a vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this multipack months ago and have thrown away 2 of them so far. They were still in very good shape when I threw them away. The mesh stayed together and didn&#x27;t unravel. It&#x27;s just a good idea in my opinion to change my pouf on a monthly basis. They are as big as I expected and do a great job.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these pouf sponges. Mine came factory wrapped in a large package of 4, various colors. These are not the tiny sponges - they are a larger size and very nice quality. One pouf has lasted over a month so far!  I reordered.</li>
            <li> I usually pay about three to four bucks for a loofah sponge so getting four for about five bucks is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are slightly smaller than the full-sized ones you pick up at your local store, but definitely bigger and sturdier than the 99 cent ones I have bought at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the mesh is a too soft. This is just my preference, but I like it when my loofahs are a little more rough against the skin. Using these kind of feel like I&#x27;m rubbing a cotton towel against my skin. Otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> low quality as after 1 use these started to fall apart -  dissatisfied with purchase - next time I will buy better quality</li>
            <li> These appear larger then they really are... They are made for a child, I was very dissapointed and will never order again</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than I thought they would be. There was another listing for SMALL ones so figured these were bigger. They seem to be pretty good and price is right for 8 of them. Wish they were slightly bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were a good value, however they turned out to be way too rough.  They don&#x27;t feel soft at all and are very scratchy.  It&#x27;s difficult to get them sudsy and they have a strange unpleasant odor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The ones sold at your local Dollar Tree or 99 cent store are much better.</li>
            <li> I received an assortment of colors and have used one for over a month and it has not fallen apart. They are not to soft and not to hard so it feels perfect on the skin.</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;ve used so far, since January, is still in one piece, hasn&#x27;t fallen apart, is still tightly compacted and lathers galore! I like the ribbon hanger on it too. The colors are very nice. I like knowing that I have more, in case I need them. Nice buy and a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate on these! They&#x27;re work the $6. Trust me, they are!</li>
            <li> Definitely a great deal and quality. I love how well it lathers and works in general. I have already gone through on in about 4-5 months... so they obviously only last so long.</li>
            <li> They last a good while (before falling apart).  The quality is good.  The color is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again and would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. It is grabbable, but not enough to make a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li> I love these poufs!  They are soft but very sturdy and hold soap and body wash very well.  I can&#x27;t believe you get four of them for what most places charge for one!  These are great!</li>
            <li> Have worked out great for my bathing needs.</li>
            <li> Nice little poufs... Not sure what else to say.  I would prefer twine or thin rope for the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; but the ribbon they use works well.  With the shower caddy that I&#x27;ve got it sometimes slips off as the ribbon is a bit thicker than the slit hanger.  Other than that, I like the 4 pack idea... never know when your pouf will dissintegrate mid-shower... always keep a spare.  The density of these poufs is even pretty good, some are rather small and lack substance, but these are just about right.</li>
            <li> They produce a good amount of foam, but I think they&#x27;re a little rough on the skin. I wish they could be a little gentler (no need to take off an entire layer of skin!), otherwise they&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li> what can i say, they are loofa thingies that you scrub yourself with. came in a variety of colors. i only needed 1 but i guess im set for life now.</li>
            <li> They fall apart rather quickly.  OK for the price, but lose their shape fast.</li>
            <li> My headline summarizes my feelings on this product.  Works as expected, for a reasonable price, and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> These are like mini&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t realize they would be so tiny when I got them!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Smallish compared to poufs in stores, but has certainly held up much better than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in stores recently. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Good price, convenient especially if you have prime and about average in size and quality.  I do like the ribbon for some reason.</li>
            <li> Great value and having an assortment of colors is always good too. I use even less soap now, as a small drop is sufficient to wash my entire body due to it lathering so well. I only wish it was a littler rougher, but it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m just used to a harsher wash cloth.</li>
            <li> They do the job, but the place where the strap connects to the pouf feels extremely sharp and can graze you if you put that side down toward your skin. As long as you keep the strap around your wrist the whole time you&#x27;re using the pouf, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that and they work well.</li>
            <li> Love these and it&#x27;s cheaper than getting them at Walmart or target. They are good quality and would last a lot longer than I keep them which is at max, 2 months. I also like the ribbon attached to them instead of that little white rope you usually see.</li>
            <li> Dye doesn&#x27;t leak into the tub like other loofahs.</li>
            <li> They work, I got 4.  Pink, neon green, purple, and like a moldy green.  They&#x27;re poufies, they work as good as any other poofies</li>
            <li> They are a little bit firmer than I wanted. I little too firm for soft skin, but once they break in they are alright.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to finding good poufs at a great price. Well i found a great price, but not the pouf. These are very hard-like plastic and really don&#x27;t feel your getting good suds and doesn&#x27;t feel the greatest when you&#x27;re washing them. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on them. wait till BBW is running a special or something and stock up then :)</li>
            <li> Gets me squeaky clean</li>
            <li> 8 sponges for 8 bucks, That&#x27;s a good deal compared to what I normally pay. The sponges are the same size of the ones you find in the department store aisles and hold together well. Life span seems to be about a month before they start to loosen up.</li>
            <li> Nice sized loofahs.  Very sturdy and well made.  Almost too well made for me; I like them better after they start to fall apart a little.  I received a selection of several colors and they arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good size and good quality.</li>
            <li> Fist time I tried this product and happy with them family has there own color and works great has lasted better then other brands I have tried. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Really uncomfortable material. These were terrible, harsh, awful little things that I ended up just throwing in the trash. Going back to more plush, softer, gentler ones.</li>
            <li> These are great! They&#x27;re even a great size, I thought they would be more on the mini size and they&#x27;re not. I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> How much can you say about a bath sponge? It&#x27;s a standard bath sponge. Very brightly colored. The cord is a bit annoying to try and hold on to. It&#x27;s made of this silky kind of ribbon that sort of sticks together when wet and is sometimes hard to separate. Although I admittedly have manish hands for a woman, the cord is just a bit too short for me, and it&#x27;s tricky to get my hand through .</li>
            <li> This product is fine. Has a bit of a chemical smell (probably the processing/packaging) but they work fine.</li>
            <li> These poufs are great.  They are on the large size compared to most easily found in stores nowadays.  The mesh is not crunchy or hard.  It is gentle and tough enough to get the job done.  I appreciate more the rope hanger... these come with a thicker cloth hanger that is not quite as long.  The colors are quite assorted.  I received purple, white, red, and a burnt orange.  The colors were nice, but that burnt orange was quite out of place.  No biggie... just stays hiding in my tub anyways.  They are a bit compact at first but soon open up to a nice, comfy size.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a pack of poufs and I am happy to see that now the product description does state that one may receive all the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I ordered the product, judging by the description and by the other reviews, I expected to get a color assortment. Unfortunately, I got four of the one bold color that absolutely clashes with my bathrooms.  It is a nice soft pouf but, hanging in the shower, it stands out through the glass like a large sore thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one has a bath where the pouf can not be easily seen, it doesn&#x27;t matter but if you have spent time and money creating a nicely coordinated bath, don&#x27;t count on even getting one pouf that will blend in.</li>
            <li> These are the same price but much higher quality than the ones I can get at wal-mart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that you don&#x27;t get to choose the color. I got a purple set with my order.</li>
            <li> These fall apart rather quickly, well within a month. You can buy similar sponges at Wal-Mart for $1/each so I won&#x27;t be reordering these.</li>
            <li> Pros: Perfect size, pretty colors, I love the ribbon to hang it up (much prettier than just a white string), great value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: can&#x27;t choose which colors I will get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that used bar soaps for years. Was finally convinced recently to try body wash and also decided to try these to go along with. It is abrasive enough to get the dead skin off and make you feel clean without feeling like you are getting hit with a sander. I&#x27;ve had the first one for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s still holding together. So this 4 pack at this price is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Firm and not easily fall apart like other spongers, The fabric is very soft to the touch. Love it!</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the same as every other cheap loofah I&#x27;ve gotten before - they&#x27;re great in the shower with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and they pull apart over time.  They have an average abrasiveness that imparts a pleasantly scratchy, exfoliating feel to scrubbing.  I&#x27;ve been using the same one for three months and it&#x27;s in decent shape, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like to use all 8 of these at once when I shower. It&#x27;s great for my annual shower, which I usually take on Christmas eve.</li>
            <li> very cost efficient buy, the sponges are great quality and will last a long time each</li>
            <li> Bought this and only 4 showed up. Wasn&#x27;t even worth attempting to return. But I dislike when I am lied to.</li>
            <li> Great value, the poufs are well made and 8 will last us a very long time!</li>
            <li> The poofs are fine, exactly the texture I expected. However, the colors were so off!  Some were two tones with the ugliest shades of green. Definitely not the colors I was hoping for. All in all, a good product &amp; I would order again.</li>
            <li> The poufs run a little on the large side, but no complaints. They&#x27;re shower poufs, and they&#x27;re not scratchy and they do the job.</li>
            <li> Expected more, first one i used broke when shaking excess water out when was finished.  Okay but really was hopoing for more.</li>
            <li> When i read the reviews, i was expecting big, plush and multi colored loufas. I received four small, dark green loufas. I can hold them in my hand and close my fist, thats how small they are. Waste of money, i gave them away.</li>
            <li> These are great; inexpensive and durable</li>
            <li> I thought they would be larger.</li>
            <li> I found these hard to lather. Price is good, which is why I bought it. They seem to be holding up better than the ones you buy from local places, especialy for the price.</li>
            <li> What a great deal for nice quality poufs.</li>
            <li> never had a poufy last so long; going on 2 1/2 months and just finally had to change it.</li>
            <li> bought a magic showerhead that changes colors so these colorful sponges went along with their gift.</li>
            <li> These are smaller travel size sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Light, well formed and can produce a good amount of foam.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good deal for this price. Love it!</li>
            <li> These Pouf sponges were much larger than I thought and they are definitely nice to use.  I&#x27;m a couple of months in on using the first one and there is not even the smallest rip in the sponge.  They are definitely a great value.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see the quality of these poufs.  I was concerned that they would not be worth the price.  I was surprised to find that they are.  The different colors are very vibrant and that is what I need.  I am also pleased with the size of each pouf.  They are just right.  They are regular size, not that little \\&quot;mini\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> These poufs lather well and are nice and big. I definitely liked the variety of colors they came in. They don&#x27;t scratch the skin, just gently removes dirt and oil. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> love the pouf sponge but thought I was getting more then what I did really 10$ for 4 please I can go to walmark and get a better deal sorry thought I was getting a better deal with ya&#x27;ll got 4 for 10$ thought I was getting 10 that would have been better</li>
            <li> We try to change loofahs every time we get a new bottle of body wash. These don&#x27;t tear up and the ribbon is sturdy. At this price you can&#x27;t beat it. We keep ordering them and keep extra on hand for guests.</li>
            <li> Received a bag full of 1 purple, 1 black and the rest all an ugly green color. Wanted to use as gifts.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t the softest pouf sponges I have ever purchased, you can&#x27;t argue with the price.  They work great.  Large size.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but the price was right.  Gave each of the girls these for Christmas.  I think they liked them.  My husband and I also got one and I like it.</li>
            <li> After a couple uses, they come apart. In other words, they don&#x27;t hold their shape. Also, they don&#x27;t have any heft to them. They feel cheap, and their quality is cheap.</li>
            <li> Too small. Need to be fuller and larger.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of buying these things from stores. I said ef it and bought this. It&#x27;s nice to have 7 replacements around for when one gets old. Also, they basically come in at a $1 and change each. Seems like a good price since the quality isn&#x27;t as cheap as what you may get at dollar stores.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, fell apart after 1st use.  But the price was cheap...so what do you expect.  probably best to use on little ones and not adults as the scrubbers are small in size.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY! First, as many of the other reviewers stated I received 4-pcs that are all ONE COLOR! Want to know what color? Well, none of the pretty, colorful ones pictured - I GOT 4 UGLY DARK EMERALD GREEN SPONGES! I am a girly girl, I don&#x27;t want ugly Emerald Green. SELLER: Why show all the pretty multi colored sponges if you keep sending myself and others all one color?! MISLEADING SELLER ADVERT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these are the small ones that you can get for $1.00 anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used these yet but these darn things better hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNHAPPY &amp; UNIMPRESSED! Will not ever buy these again.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these-- I like these poufs because they&#x27;re cheap.  They are smaller than some other poufs, but I dont care, I just need something to help me scrub my body.</li>
            <li> Theses are great sponges for very reasonable price. They are just the right size and just abrasive enough for you to feel really clean.  Hold up well to everyday use.</li>
            <li> These poufs are much softer than the dollar store ones, so it&#x27;s a pretty good value. I just wish I could choose the colors. I got a pink, purple, blue, and green one.</li>
            <li> They were ok, some fell apart much more quickly than others.  For the price, it was fine.</li>
            <li> Good deal but these are much coarser then the ons from our local grocery store, to rough for the kids and I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> I wish the quality was better but you get what you pay for. Still they are decent and they last as long as other bath sponges.</li>
            <li> I like these very much as the colors are bright and cheerful. I&#x27;m stocked up now for a very long time. The Pouf is a really good size too.</li>
            <li> Sponges are not too small and soft.  None were missing from the sealed package that they came in.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I think these poufs a little overrated.  Although the colors are pretty; they aren&#x27;t nearly as soft as the reviews let on.  The next time I need to purchase a pouf, I will go to The Body Shop.  Theirs are actually soft and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cheaply priced, average quality, and they came quickly, I expected nothing less... or more.</li>
            <li> great value and quality</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get much better than a pouf. These were exactly what I expected - colors are nice, one I&#x27;ve been using has held up well for the past couple of months. Solid purchase.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for gifts or for home use!  I like the colors and the quality is also very good!</li>
            <li> They are pretty small, but good for the price. You get four for the price I would normally pay for one. I would recommend if you are looking for serving inexpensive that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought they&#x27;d be. Very sturdy and an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this 4 pack and it is terrific. It always seems as though I never remember to buy one at the store when I need one but now I have them in my house and can just walk over and grab one. The colors are so vibrant and they last a long time. Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I thought cheap stuffs mean cheap quality, but this one changed my idea. It feels soft and comfortable in daily use. Good.</li>
            <li> These are good to have and throw out as needed. Work just like they should and are a good price online.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the biggest loofahs out there, but they do the job.  I was pleased with the price and they seem to be holding up just fine after a few months of use.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> This vendor gave me Excellent service.  The product arrived On time and exactly as described and I  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> These run tinier than your average shower poof but still get the job done.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. They have a nice and smooth feel to them and the ribbon loop is very function. We have been using them for a month and they seem more durable than the cheap kind they sell at the store. My wife loves them too. We will have to get more.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. works, doesnt fall apart too fast (and I usually tear these apart). I will order these again in the far future when I actually wear these ones out.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to match the quality of these loofas (sp?) for the price anywhere.  My only complaint is that I dont like the material they used to make the loop to hang it from.  Ive had some before with the material made with rope and I much prefer that over the ribbon type material used for these.  Theres not really any cons for the change in material, its just my personal preference I think, but I thought Id mention it.  Definitely not a deal breaker though.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing purchase. For starters, they shipped me a 4-pack, not an 8-pack. That wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me too much if the quality was better, but it&#x27;s a very cheap feeling product and much smaller than the ones you can pick up cheaply from your local drug store. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> These sponges work exactly as expected. &#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Love the quantity.</li>
            <li> Decent quality loofas. Nice to buy them in bulk. The colors you receive are very random, but I dont mind.</li>
            <li> I love loofah&#x27;s.  Soap lathers so much better with a loofah.  These are smaller than I&#x27;m used to but will suffice for the price.  They hold up fairly well and last longer then you should probably keep them hang in in your shower.  The hanging strings are the first to go and then the whole loofah unravels allowing you to chose another.  Too bad you couldn&#x27;t choose the color you want..but oh well.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal but the sponges are a little rougher than I usually like in a sponge.  The colors are bright and fun and they are useful but are a little small and too rough for me.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These lufas are inexpensive and each one will last for a couple months of regular use.  I will be buying these again in te future.</li>
            <li> This is soft but not soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scrub anything, if you like the gentile kind to the skin get this, i even have fun playing with this because it is softer then my previous one, if your looking for something a bit tough that it scrubs hardcore to the cleanest your skin seems like it was polished and waxed get the mini ones and i mean like it gets you clean not that it gives pain, both great products! Best of luck and have a good one!</li>
            <li> These are much thicker than the ones you can buy at Dollar General for a buck.  These cost just slightly more, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a bar of soap guy, but I thought I would give these a try. I really like them and I can totally tell there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought these through the Amazon add-on program.  They do the job at a good price.  I will say that they can be found just as cheap at Walmart or many other discount stores.  If you are placing an order and want to save the hassle of going to the store then I would not hesitate to purchase them.  If you are going to a brick and mortar store already then just pick some up while you are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does exactly what you want and seem to be made as well as any pouf I have used.  The biggest thing I can say is the price does not make these a great buy.  It is a good buy but only if you want to save some time.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained about how rough the loofahs are, but why use a loofah if you don&#x27;t want something to scrub your skin? Use a wash towel.&lt;br /&gt;This are decent and not too rough, but a little small for me.</li>
            <li> When I buy a pouf, I want it to have 4 things.  It needs to be soft.  It needs to be big.  It needs to make a lot of lather.  And it has to rinse out quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are pretty soft.  They aren&#x27;t like cotton balls but that&#x27;s ok.  There should be some exfoliation without feeling like you are washing with sandpaper.  You get that here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not huge.  I wear size 8 surgical gloves and these are slightly smaller than my hand.  I like them bigger than that so that&#x27;s why I took off one star.  For a smaller guy or for a lady, these are probably a good size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lather well and aren&#x27;t a pain to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you go.  Not quite big enough for my liking but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> These are just like any normal bath pouf. They are the same roughness you&#x27;d expect from a normal one. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This item was kind of deceiving.  They are too small.  I mean, if you like the small ones, they&#x27;re great.  I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great deal, needed to add to cart to get free shipping.  These are supposed to be changed out frequently in the shower to avoid mold and bacteria buildup, so a good idea to have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I think those sponges are good value.  It was nice to be able to buy it as a 4 pack.</li>
            <li> Quality Product, Affordable</li>
            <li> Can never have too many - always use these.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy since the price seemed low, but I was pleasantly surprised to get really good, thick poufs. I&#x27;d recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Our existing loofahs were starting to deteriorate so I decided to replace them all.  I&#x27;m completely happy with my purchase, some of the ones we had were entirely too large, or too &amp;#34;fluffy.&amp;#34;  These have (for me) an ideal mixture of compactness, and fluffyness.  I also find the feel of the loofah gives a nice amount of scrub without being scratchy.  I haven&#x27;t tossed these in the laundry yet to see how they hold up.  I suppose I&#x27;ll update if they unravel on the first wash...  If you don&#x27;t see an update assume they washed just fine!</li>
            <li> Like getting so many in one pack!</li>
            <li> Great price and they don&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; great quality. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great deal..perfect sponges</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find body sponges - I had a number of them left over from my sales days as a MK consultant.  When those died, I could not believe that I could not find them in the local markets etc.  Checked amazon &amp; ordered these.  They are great size, sturdy &amp; colorful.  Am happy &amp; will order more when these have reached end of life cycle.</li>
            <li> Durable and great size</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise. I think these are just like the ones that are at the store, which range from 2.00-4.00 per. Mine came with little ribbons instead of rope and 2 were solid purple, and the others were a combination color, each pouf being half white and half bright green/pink/dull green. I would have been happy if they were all white, but the colors were a pleasant, cheery surprise.</li>
            <li> I think these are very decent quality (better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drugstore), for a very reasonable price.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, no complaints.  Just like the expensive version in regular stores.  Will buy again as we love poufs!</li>
            <li> Well, I use the man colored ones and the woman uses the other colors.  The are not so large, but the regular size. Great for a 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; hairy, smelly man. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far but so far, so good. I love exfoliating in the shower and these hold the shower gel very well</li>
            <li> I like these.  They foam the soap up well and seem to be holding up very well.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bright colors, seems to absorb my body wash very well and it lathers up nicely. I was afraid they would be super cheap and rough on my skin but they are very soft. Great shower poufs!</li>
            <li> These are very poor quality. 2 were completely unraveled when they arrived. They are tiny. No bigger than the palm of my hand and not at all like what is in the photo. I normally wouldn&#x27;t return something that cost so little but these are so bad, they had to go back. Save your money and go pick up one for a $1 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I like these as they don&#x27;t fall apart after a few times of use. They are easy to clean and use again. They are nice and smooth and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper rubbing on your body.</li>
            <li> The Mesh Pouf Sponge is the pefect size.. Some you buy are way to big and some are way to small.. and these are perfect size.. Fits in my hand perfectly.. and with the sheer number you get, you can throw it out after a month use..</li>
            <li> When I ordered these sponges, I thought they are a bit more expensive. But these offer great quality at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great deal, not quite as big as I was expecting but work just as well. I would describe them as a more of a medium size rather than large. They do have a funky odor at first but it slowly diminishes.</li>
            <li> the colors that I received I hate but then again I use it once a month and then throw it away so as long as it scrubs and does it jobs I&#x27;m happy. the colors are like a surprise to me when I receive them. the satin like string has not broken on me in case your wondering</li>
            <li> Thanks for the colorful sponges. They are nice and big. If I need them again I know where to look. I am hoping because of the size they do not rip easily.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  Plastic string quality was not as good as the yarn type.</li>
            <li> They are pretty but in  no way functional -- I threw them away</li>
            <li> I have ordered two sets of these and have gotten packages that work perfect for him/her.  Great price, cespecially considering I can just add this to my order and they ship it to Hawaii for free!  Will continue to order...</li>
            <li> I ordered these recently. I got four: one fuchsia, one bright green, one pastel green, and one light blue. I&#x27;ve been using the bright green one for the past couple of days and so far it&#x27;s been good. The layers of mesh are thick and tightly grouped at the center. The poufs feel like they&#x27;re doing their job without being rough or overly scratchy. I&#x27;m waiting to see how they hold up over time. If they last a good while, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> They are a little small at first, but after a couple of uses they work well</li>
            <li> The string falls apart pretty easily....</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is a helluva deal.  Eight great Loufahs for an incredible price.  Quick shipment as well.</li>
            <li> Well-made and I think each one will last a long time. I&#x27;m still on my first bath sponge out of the eight that is in this set. It doesn&#x27;t fall off after I have used it for several times already. Cleans really well too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap but it&#x27;s really the same quality that you&#x27;ll buy at the stores at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Excellent sponges for the price! What is it $10 dollars for 4 sponges, and the sponges last 1-2 months each? You&#x27;ve got yourself a deal, Aquasentials! I use these everyday, and feel fresh and clean afterwords, every time. I&#x27;ve actually managed to use the same one for the past 3 months. So if my math is correct, this pack could last me up to a year! Again, excellent shower sponges for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These Aquasentials Mesh pouf Sponge are great for my family. Their made well and they last long. Four different colors are great one for each of my family members.&lt;br /&gt;Price is right too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good of quality these loofah sponges are. I was really just looking for the cheapest option out there and received these really great quality loofahs. Buy them!</li>
            <li> These are good sized &amp;#34;Poufs&amp;#34; but they are a little too fluffy. Usually on a new &amp;#34;pouf&amp;#34; the mesh is rather tight and balled up, these do not feel that way and don&#x27;t last quite as long as ones purchased from the store. Still a decent deal, but not as great as it initially seems.</li>
            <li> These are nice and big. They hold showing gels and oil very nice and feel nice against my skin. Soft and not overly abrasive. I like it when I buy something online by a picture only and it turns out to be a winner!</li>
            <li> Always need a new one of these and rarely remember to pick them up at the store.  Problem solved.  I now have clean poufs for months to come for a lot less than I&#x27;d pay elsewhere.  These are good-sized and appear to be well made.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great buy, but I was not impressed with the quality of the pouf sponges.  I have not used any of them yet, but I do not think they will last as long as the more generous, fuller sponges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different poufs for years.  These are not very soft and actually hurt my skin when using it.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Half of the poofs strings broke after one use.</li>
            <li> Our daughter suggested these as a good way of keeping our skin clean. I had used them in the past and wasn&#x27;t impressed but she said that the way to make them work well is to put some liquid soap on them and add water while squeezing to build up a lather!! They work great and are much better than wash cloths in the shower.</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today... I ordered them because I purchase a new one every time I go food shopping... A dollar here, a dollar there and the ones I get are junky and do not lather well, but these are heavy and very full! Great quality! These go for $2.99 in the stores each!!!!!! I&#x27;m very pleased! Worth it 100%</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t supposed to be travel size poufs, but I find them really small.  Also, some of the colors I received are 2 colors of mesh, which means that they aren&#x27;t one cohesive piece.  I&#x27;m not impressed, even for the price I could get better at the store for just a few cents more.  I will not reorder.  The quality does seem comparative to other poufs I&#x27;ve bought, but they are not the size or style that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Good price, good size, works well, the green is kinda ugly, but you can see that from the picture</li>
            <li> We wash our three little toddlers with these things.  They are the highest quality bath fluff sponges we&#x27;ve ever had by far.  The others have fallen apart quickly as our kids pull them apart.  These are soft and rugged.  Seem to be lasting a long time and lather well and rinse out easily too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart like the $1 ones you get and this price was good.</li>
            <li> these are nice and thick not like the cheap crappy ones and great so everyone can have their own color, no more community loofahs!</li>
            <li> They are very small. I thought they were the equivalent of the ones Target sells for about $2. They are about HALF the size. If I had to do it again, I would have NOT bought them.</li>
            <li> Excellent poufs for the money. I&#x27;m still on my first one after a month. Does exactly what you want it to do. The big thing here is bang for buck. One of these at a grocery store or pharmacy is like $5....</li>
            <li> I like for these to last a month or so.  These do the trick.  Holds lather well and the ribbon holds the pouf on my shower handle when I&#x27;m finished.  Will order more.</li>
            <li> The Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge pack of 4 are beautiful in color. i was hoping for a sturdier mesh product.  Overall, they are okay.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my loofahs falling apart every month or so, so I bought this pack to stock up. Surprisingly, I am still on my first loofah still in tact. Seems to be better quality than the store bought. Then again, anything is better quality than those.</li>
            <li> They are too thick for me barely hold able and don&#x27;t lather as good as the thin ones I think I bought some from this brand before and they were thinner and good quality idk just didn&#x27;t like them as much as the ones I had before the smaller the better</li>
            <li> I like the size and it is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t like the material these were made with</li>
            <li> GREAT for the money, these are nice Poufs much better than what I buy at the dollar store seem to hold up well and no complaints from the wife or the daughter so they must be winners.</li>
            <li> Its a bath sponge, but has lasted a whole lot longer that any I have bought locally from Wal-Mart and Target. So it gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Title says it all. I think only one of them lasted more than three days -- all the rest came untied and unwound in one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffers for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price and the quality! It comes in varying colors. Sponges are pretty soft and lather well. No hard plastic piece on it. I&#x27;ve come across bath sponges that had a hard material in the center of the sponges or on the hanging loop, but not these!</li>
            <li> Not at all soft and doesn&#x27;t lather well.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Not an exfoliating poof.  Normal ones like what you can find in the local super market or drug store.</li>
            <li> Love these! So much better than the cheap ones you find at mass merchandise stores. They are thick and poofy, and I&#x27;ve never had one fall apart.</li>
            <li> If there was less than one star, I would give  that!!  TINY TINY TINY, not sewn together. Smelled terrible.  DO NOT buy these!!!</li>
            <li> First off, you cannot beat this price. It seems like the price of loofahs are continuing to increase at stores like Target or Wal-Mart. These are the same size loofah you&#x27;ll find at Target for $3. Spend the extra  $2 and get the 4-pack on Amazon. The only downside I found is that they smell terribly of plastic when you open them, but they&#x27;re intended to use with soap, so after 2 washes that smell is gone. I totally recommend them.</li>
            <li> These mesh pouf bath sponges are more like little tootoos! They are smaller than average store pouf balls which you can purchase in Walmart, Target or so on. Their roughness is average but they are only a dollar a peace. So they are cheap, small and average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider what they sell in store, small and not rough. I was looking for real large size pouf balls which were really rough, so they could scrub all the dead skins off my body and back. I simply cannot find any large size pouf balls anywhere. My final hope was Amazon and I assumed these are at least bigger size than the store. I typed large and extra large mesh pouf bath sponges and I got these for my search. If I cannot find large or extra large pouf balls in Amazon, then I don’t know where?! I used all my stash and now I am down to these. If I knew they were smaller than store, I would not even purchase them; however, I have to admit that they are cheap and for the price, you get small size and average roughness balls which is not bad but that was not my intention!</li>
            <li> Great shower loofas, But the ribbon that they hang on has broken on all 4 in the pack. Not that big a deal (we just tied new knots in them) but is the factor keeping them from being a 5 star product</li>
            <li> These are a little smaller and slightly harsher than I expected, but they seem to get the dirt off just fine.  They don&#x27;t keep the lather up as long as my old ratty one, either.  Not a bad product, just not what I am used to.</li>
            <li> An 8-Pack for this price was great.My first one lasted a couple months with daily use...just as good as any I have seen in the stores.  Update 3.19.15:  Just placed my second order for these. The first 8 pack last very well and they continue to be a good deal.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, seem very well made, and should last a long while.  I surprised my student employees with a variety of &#x27;stuff&#x27; and these were a big hit!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe a single bad review. Had 6 months still together. These are a steal at the price.</li>
            <li> Good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do come apart rather quickly.  I do not even scrub hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since adding this to my wishlist a long time ago, they used to sell it as a four pack.  I am reviewing this as a four pack, NOT an 8-pack.  If it was an 8-pack, I would rate it 1-star higher (to 4 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say?  It does the job.  Do not expect a super-high quality pouf bath sponge.</li>
            <li> These work very well, soft and do not fall apart like others I have purchased.  Great buy!!!  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Each sponge comes out costing like $1.50, and one sponge can last for at least half a year with no problems :)&lt;br /&gt;I keep all 4 in my shower and use a different color everyday!</li>
            <li> What is even the point of these? They look nothing like their picture. They are cheap, poorly made little things barely worth using as a travel item. Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> My partner loves thes Pouf Sponge and he prefers these over a wash cloth. Great buy and would buy again.</li>
            <li> So, we got your run of the mill 4 pack of Loofah&#x27;s.  To be honest I am writing this review while I am opening the product.  I find these Mesh Pouf Sponges to be &amp;#34;on par&amp;#34; with the last 400 of these things I have bought.  Boom... get yourself a 4 pack and go CRAZY!</li>
            <li> They are supposed to be soft and feel comfortable to use in the shower, but actually they are very harsh, I feel like I am using a brush instead of sponge</li>
            <li> The sponges seem sturdy and last as well as more expensive sponges. Bright colors. Does the job. Strap doesn&#x27;t break like some of the other sponges I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought they would be. doesn&#x27;t lather well, but gets the job.</li>
            <li> I use these mesh pouf sponge all the time. They work well for me. I Would buy more.Arrived on time.Great. Good customer service.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting these to be less dense than they are. They&#x27;re a nice size and seem to be holding up well. I&#x27;d definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I love how easy and cheap these products are, but are still very high quality. They do not tear easily and really get the suds going. They are not too abrasive that my skin will hurt after, but I can definitely feel/see the exfoliation that I get when using these sponges.</li>
            <li> I was iffy buying sponges on Amazon, but since I buy everything on here I thought lets try it. They are better than the ones at the store and I will buy them again. They are also cheaper than the store so that was a plus for me!</li>
            <li> The price is fair. I also said the quality should be good, because I have not used this product but will soon. When I actually use it, I will update the review.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> They are too rough on the skin. The material is different from other brands.</li>
            <li> Arrived with no packaging, just loose in a postal envelope. I&#x27;m not necessarily a germaphobe, but this is something I&#x27;m using to clean my body; who knows many dirty hands or surfaces these came in contact with between manufacturing and packaging. They had a terrible smell; I&#x27;m not sure what it was, but it reminded me of turpentine. I washed them in a mesh bag in the washing machine to remove the smell and any dirt they may have collected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 2 green, 2 purple, 2 blue, and 2 pink. I&#x27;m not overly concerned with the colors, but saw that some reviewers weren&#x27;t happy with their assortment. They are a good size (6&amp;#34; diameter). I haven&#x27;t used my first pouf for very long, but the quality seems good so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works really well. The cost is another plus, I doubt if you can buy this product at such a low price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> These are silky and work well... maybe a little smaller then the &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; size, but not by much. I gave the pink and purple ones to my girlfriend</li>
            <li> These were just as good in quality as any others i have seen.  They were cheaper, though, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> These are a great value but they seem to be less durable than the ones I can buy at Target. The mesh seems to unravel after just a few weeks of daily use. But overall the price can&#x27;t be beat so I will probably still buy these in the future. I just wish there was a choice of colors. The pack has a variety of brightly colored sponges which don&#x27;t quite go with my decor like the gray or other neutral colors that I can pick at the store.</li>
            <li> Good loofahs to keep you clean.  Cheap way to shop for these as they are more money in the store.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect purchase.  They are strong and have a nice ribbon to hang by.  I always for get to pick them up at the store so the quantity was perfect.  The colors that arrived are different than shown but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those roommates who refuse to buy their own.</li>
            <li> Excellent pouf&#x27;s!  I like buying this 8 pack because then I have them on hand and can have a new one every 2-3 months.  If one gets a rip or something, then I toss it and have plenty of backups on hand!  Good quality too!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good price.</li>
            <li> TINY, like baby size, garbage, over priced. $1 at walmart is way bigger and nicer.</li>
            <li> Very good sponges.  Satisfied with this product. The colors tones are not that great.  But I don&#x27;t really care about that since its just a shower sponge.</li>
            <li> Needed new pouf sponges. This is a five pack for the price of four. Will last me a year for the price I usually buy one. They are softer than others and feel nice on my skin. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am used to paying around $4.00 a piece for these at the local drug store. These are great and at just around $1.00 per pouf, they&#x27;re an amazing bargain. They are soft and well made so they hold up very well. I will certainly be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> i used these to make baby shower thank yous.I put them in clear solo cups and put a pom pom on top,then i wraped them in a cellophane bag with pink ribbons.</li>
            <li> These items are a little on the abrasive side for a shower pouf as compared to others.</li>
            <li> After using these, I think I will stick to the ones I get at Walmarts for $1. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> These are not large puffs like I expected, they are small ones.</li>
            <li> Daughter and husband love these they the perfect size not to big or small.  Material is nice not scratchy.  The ribbon they are tied with is much better than a rope it dries completely.  There haven&#x27;t been any problem with them unraveling at all.</li>
            <li> These are actually pretty nice quality and last for a while. The only bummer is that the ribbon holder falls off after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered these in bulk because I thought they might wear out quickly like the ones I get from Walmart...but we have only used a couple out the packet..putting them in everyone&#x27;s bathroom...and almost 2 months later...still holding up well.</li>
            <li> Really like these scrubs. Gives me a nice clean, and holds soap well. Easy to clean, and lasts a long time. I noticed my skin is more healthy using these too.</li>
            <li> Perfect loofahs! These are so soft and feel great on the skin. Though it has to be a cheap material in order for them to price these so low, the quality doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Definitely the only loofahs I will be buying.</li>
            <li> These are a good deal (monetary), hold up well (about 30 days each), &amp; are cleansing without being rough.  I really like the bright colors!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issue with these pouf sponges.  I am only giving it 4 scars because my girlfriend claimed that it cut her when she was washing.  She&#x27;s a little forceful with things, so it&#x27;s probably her fault.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because when I have bought them at the drugstores near my home, I get only 3 for more than the price of these.&lt;br /&gt;They function fine, and do not wear thin very soon.  What I was most worried about was that the color of these run in the shower.  I always rinse these before use when I buy, but I was shocked that the color ran (i used the purple one first.)  The color ran for  week during use and on 2 rinsing baths before use.  I don&#x27;t think these should and its the first time I ever seen that and when I rinse them its with the body wash I normally use.</li>
            <li> After I observed someone touch EVERY pouf in a bin at my local drugstore while fishing for the only pink pouf, I decided to buy my poufs online.  Whether fewer hands touch Aquasentials poufs or not, these poufs are of a better quality than the ones at my drugstore.  They are larger and maintain their shape longer.  They also have a ribbon loop as opposed to a rope loop, which is a fun little detail.</li>
