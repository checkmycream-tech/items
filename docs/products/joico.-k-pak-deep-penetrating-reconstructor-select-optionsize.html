            <li>My hair looked great and it did the job.    </li>

            <li>Great product makes hair feel so good and feel so great,, will buy it again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;and will let my friends know about it .</li>
            <li>I am sure this is probably an excellent conditioner because the shampoo is and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and does a great job of repairing chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I did leave it in by accident for about 15 min</li>
            <li>Still makes my hair feel good though.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell good and it would come out chunky.</li>
            <li>The product wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I received the Joico K-Pak on time, seald in nice plastic bags, in perfect condition, no leaks etc., beautiful, new, I used some today and it worked great.</li>
            <li>i love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order &amp; the&lt;br /&gt;delivery.</li>
            <li>ok, good product, good price, I recommend</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, it&#x27;s my favorite hair medicine!</li>
            <li>I love the Joico product !&lt;</li>
            <li>your hair will love you!</li>
            <li>I should have known better!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not the most pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It turly is amazing.</li>
            <li>Yes the joico reconstructer is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it worked amazingly, so</li>
            <li>I normally love Joico products, and was happy to be able to puchase this via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy this kind of product via Amazon again.</li>
            <li>It really started showing, so I&#x27;ve decided to have blond highlights done at a salon, which turned out wonderful.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice, like bananas, but I do not like the watery consistency and texture.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I can&#x27;t say if this product had anything to do with my hair looking so nice</li>
            <li>Although the instruction don&#x27;t say so, you must follow this treatment immediately with a rich moisturizing conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine color treated &amp; permed hair.</li>
            <li>I was so happy I could get this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed with fine strands and this reconstructor does an amazing job of strengthening each strand.</li>
            <li>Thank Goodness! :)</li>
            <li>I love this Product.</li>
            <li>* I&#x27;m still going to stick with the Matrix Sleek products, they work so much better for my hair  </li>
            <li>So an ok buy to me</li>
            <li>I did make sure to use a moisturizing conditioner after rinsing the product out.</li>
            <li>There are too many reviewers posting here with experiences like mine to give any hope of getting an authentic product from Amazon at this time.</li>
            <li>but the price was even better.  </li>
            <li>This was the cheapest price I have ever been able to find it.</li>
            <li>The Joico K-pak system is my favorite hair care system.</li>
            <li>I find the shampoo and conditioner to be outstanding, and possibly slightly better than the reconstructor.</li>
            <li>and I thought IT FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love this reconstructor&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe it takes more than one time to see better results.</li>
            <li>I would do this once a month at most.</li>
            <li>like so I needed more than 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The best there is, simple as that.</li>
            <li>I am not too sure</li>
            <li>and my hair was healthy again.</li>
            <li>have tried this brand many times,it always worked.</li>
            <li>This product provides a great intense conditioning treatment for your hair.  </li>
            <li>, I like this product better.</li>
            <li>I have used this reconstructor for many years and it is my favorite</li>
            <li>I ended up trying the Dove Quench conditioner which worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>I was leery of ordering this from a Marketplace Seller after reading many reviews where buyers received a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>When mine arrived, it was warm to the touch and sounded like it was full of liquid.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased to discover that it was available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>hair now, silky smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and loved it when I bought at a real salon...</li>
            <li>I bought this product and what I received was a bottle full of water!</li>
            <li>I had just finished a tube purchased from Ulta, so the difference between the two was easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li>It is beyond amazing and you can feel it working the first time.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE FINE AND DAMAGED HAIR BY WIDER HIGHLIGHTS</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s meant for fine hair or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Smells like bananas and helped strengthen my super processed hair!</li>
            <li>I made sure I had a great moisture conditioner on my hair after I used it and that helps the dry feeling go away.  </li>
            <li>will be buying a huge bottle of this.  </li>
            <li>This is a terrific brand of haircare and I expect nothing but great quality products from it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthier and feels smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>I ordered from the seller ASAP Beauty and received genuine product.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the real thing from my salon for years with awesome results and this junk is definitely NOT THE REAL THING!!!  </li>
            <li>Not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>The only thing that I can say about this product, is that it smells very nice.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t to sure about it because it made my hair even feel drier than before.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is a scam</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be stocking up on some more very soon!</li>
            <li>Best to use a small amount, rubbing between</li>
            <li>This is vastly different than the wonderful soft feel to my hair after using the tube I purchased from Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice &amp; made my hair incredibly soft</li>
            <li>I did return mine for a full refund.</li>
            <li>keep on for 30 minutes, rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>But it is not bad.</li>
            <li>It is super lightweight.</li>
            <li>All around, this is a pretty fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I liked the other one better than this one.  </li>
            <li>sure your other products are of professional quality as well and you&#x27;ll be happy with what effects your routine can accomplish with K-Pak included.</li>
            <li>This product works well .&lt;br /&gt;There are not many products that will be better than this one- a good buy.</li>
            <li>The only issue that I&#x27;ve found with the reconstructor is that it smells a bit more strongly than the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t purchase on here, make sure to purchase from a salon or professional beauty store.</li>
            <li>Whatever this seller is putting in these bottles is not even worth the $7 they&#x27;re charging for it.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it was a fresh bottle if</li>
            <li>Formula seems the same to me, beige and kind of coagulated.</li>
            <li>I left the product on my hair for about an hour (covered with a shower cap) and applied very warm towels to it frequently.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think the seller tried to rip me off due to the good reviews some people put.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and it shipped right on time but</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle it was pure liquid in the consistancy of water!</li>
            <li>Thank you very fast shipping ILove</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This reconstructor made my dyed/fried hair alive and smooth after ONE use.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll be soon ready for my rescue color!</li>
            <li>ok if you have an extra 5 minutes in the shower, 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>I later leared many people sell fakes here.</li>
            <li>I think they cut the product most likely.</li>
            <li>Exact formula I purchased through salon and paid $19.99.  </li>
            <li>real product is amazing--it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice per week and my hair is much healthier!  </li>
            <li>Be aware when applying to your hair.</li>
            <li>After first use, I did not see any improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>Could tell it was helping my hair the first day.</li>
            <li>It was very runny and don&#x27;t even know if I will be able to use it because I cant bare the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling its because of the hot weather conditions the product has been through shipping here.</li>
            <li>It was so liquidy like water when I first got it</li>
            <li>and it was hot,</li>
            <li>Thanks Joico!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite deep conditioners!</li>
            <li>Just to be sure Joico hadn&#x27;t changed the product, I went out and purchased another K-pak from a salon, and compared the two products side by side; the one I purchased in the salon was the same K-pak that I have always used.</li>
            <li>Essentially, it works faster, smells better and again, works faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually changes damaged hair to healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for dry damaged hair and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>The smell is interesting, not unpleasant, but not really pleasing either.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the chance to save half my original purchase price.  </li>
            <li>had such amazing results as far as what it did for my hair</li>
            <li>Love it my hair is finally going back to normal after being over processed and dry this product is great</li>
            <li>The first handful I dispensed was very separated (see review pictures).</li>
            <li>NOT at all pleased, a huge waste of money!  </li>
            <li>Either this seller is tampering with the product or it&#x27;s super old.</li>
            <li>I mix this with my Joico Body Luxe conditioner and it makes my hair super soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good and it curds so the texture is weird, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t try to save money by buying a substandard product it will cost you more in the long run!!!</li>
            <li>Just so you know it does smell like very ripe bananas.</li>
            <li>and this is not, its very watery.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very runny and it smells like a banana.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt so much stronger as soon as I washed it out</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to repair my hair.</li>
            <li>I fined this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>But THIS stuff from this seller is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about the amount, as it was 1/2 way empty.</li>
            <li>I assume it is working, but I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Really helped my over bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I give this product a 5 (or a 4.5, really)</li>
            <li>I had to use the WHOLE BOTTLE before I felt like my strands were covered.</li>
            <li>seller of this item should be really ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li>The product texture was very oily ....</li>
            <li>I have read reviews where people who have used this line of products before, are claiming that it is a fraud, not the real product, so I went to the joico website and found a dealer of the real product</li>
            <li>I will compare the two to see if it is in fact a fraud or the real thing.</li>
            <li>This product, recommended by hairdresser, really restored my damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it kind of seems like it might have been mixed with something as the consistency isnt the same as when i buy it from the salon.</li>
            <li>It should be thick and creamy and smell good.  </li>
            <li>REAL K-pak is creamy, thick and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>This reconstructor is much more than I expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and fine and colored.  </li>
            <li>:After the first use, my roots became springy and curly and after a few more uses the midshafts have become curly again as well.</li>
            <li>With this Tx and along with the Joico recovery moisture Balm Tx before you dry your hair so makes your hair feel soft and healthy to the the touch.  </li>
            <li>The tube I received from Hayword Beauty was only 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really notice much in the way of damage repair but maybe after a few more uses, hopefully I&#x27;ll start to see some improvement.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a slight banana-ish smell during the treatment process, then I think it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I shook it a little bit to see if that would work, but it didn&#x27;t make it better.</li>
            <li>it was runny and watery, not thick, so</li>
            <li>it helps your damaged hair become as close to normal as any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>More than a few times I over process my hair to the point it was breaking off, I used this twice weekly</li>
            <li>The real thing should be smooth and smell slightly like bananas.</li>
            <li>When it was dry it was soft smooth and shiney without&lt;br /&gt;any</li>
            <li>Protein strengthens hair but also makes it dry and more prone to breakage if you don&#x27;t add moisture back in.</li>
            <li>The product I received from the seller Hayword Beauty was a VERY watered down version of the original Joico K-pak Reconstructor product.</li>
            <li>Like putting H2O on your hair!My first reaction was it can&#x27;t be right and after reading other reviews I think I am right!The</li>
            <li>When I started getting my hair done with a new stylist she promoted the product so well that I thought I would try it again.  </li>
            <li>Product new as described by the seller.</li>
            <li>and I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Seemed runnier than it should and did not smell new or as others described it should smell.</li>
            <li>My scalp felt very sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s look like a very old product.</li>
            <li>I used this product before using kanechom chocolate hair moisturizing conditioner and silicone mix, I then dried and flat ironed my hair, and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice since getting it and it doesnt make my hair silky shiney and healthy like K-pak has always done for me in the past</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li>It smells like the joico k-pack I used in the past many years ago.</li>
            <li>it is grainy, clearly old, and I seriously doubt it is still effective.  </li>
            <li>Stay far far away from these!</li>
            <li>SO finally, I ordered Joico K-pak, applied it to my damp hair (as soon as the mailman dropped it off) left it on for 5 minutes, rinsed with cool water and now my hair is soft and manageable again after all that abuse.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has helped my hair so far was hot oil treatments and frequent trims.</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t live with that color as it made me look like a corpse :), so I used a semi permanent med brown to color the white blonde back to a relatively livable color.</li>
            <li>It works a little but shyly in comparison to the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>my hair became soft limp smooth and I could straighten out the tangles</li>
            <li>It does make my hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I had natural medium ash blond hair</li>
            <li>Joico K-Pak Reconstructor is the only conditioner that absolutely leaves your hair feeling renewed.</li>
            <li>The reconstructor  has made my hair feel soft &amp; manageable</li>
            <li>Keep the Reconstructor on for 5 minutes, wash it out and do this again for at least one more application if not two.  </li>
            <li>It looked old - it looked like oatmeal.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it might be a tad old bc</li>
            <li>It does contain protein so it is not recommended for daily use as too much protein can cause your hair to break off.  </li>
            <li>It smelled old and it was curdled</li>
            <li>but so far... it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>compliments from people all the time, thinking my hair is &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li>And I bought the Intense Hydrating Treatment from the same seller too.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s supposed to be thick but it did work magic.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you are feelin&#x27; a little dry on top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I use that scores high on ewg.org/skindeep (0-10 scale for toxins in products)</li>
            <li>Just rinse it the next morning without washing it and your hair will feel like new.</li>
            <li>I just think it&#x27;s pretty shady that you&#x27;d try to pass this off as the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this has left my hair feeling very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>But after about 6-8 weeks my roots started showing and I didn&#x27;t have enough  money to have a professional retouch, so I used a home highlight kit (with the cap) that turned me into bleached blond (which is REALLY not my color as I have fair white skin) and dried my hair out extremely.</li>
            <li>: you MUST shake then bottle before use as the consistency looks weird and separated...when you shake it first, it reblends the ingredients and the texture comes out creamy and smooth...</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time, but must be several years old -</li>
            <li>It left my hair Amazingly soft and it didn&#x27;t even look like I colored my hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I marked one star is because it will not post without it.</li>
            <li>Smelled old to me and bottle had superficial damage to outside.</li>
            <li>Very watered down.... not thick like the one I purchased at my salon...does not even smell the same.</li>
            <li>Normal to dry</li>
            <li>like other reviewers have suggested, i first condition my hair, and then i use this deep conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li>However With Joico it gave back my hair back to its natural Ph.</li>
            <li>but if you are fragrance sensitive I would choose a different deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>The products are not bad they are just hard to use with my hair.  </li>
            <li>However the product is very watered down.</li>
            <li>It has transformed my hair from dry and lifeless to shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Watered down half full not joico.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I&#x27;m far less than thrilled..</li>
            <li>smell is odd not really bad just odd</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I knew the product was great</li>
            <li> I ordered the largest bottle because of how great it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> My hair looked great and it did the job.    </li>
            <li> Product is great however.</li>
            <li> Smells great too, kinda like banana bread.  </li>

            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love Joico products!!</li>
            <li> Great product makes hair feel so good and feel so great,, will buy it again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;and will let my friends know about it .</li>
            <li> I am sure this is probably an excellent conditioner because the shampoo is and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and does a great job of repairing chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I did leave it in by accident for about 15 min</li>
            <li> Still makes my hair feel good though.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good and it would come out chunky.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I received the Joico K-Pak on time, seald in nice plastic bags, in perfect condition, no leaks etc., beautiful, new, I used some today and it worked great.</li>
            <li> i love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order &amp; the&lt;br /&gt;delivery.</li>
            <li> ok, good product, good price, I recommend</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, it&#x27;s my favorite hair medicine!</li>
            <li> I love the Joico product !&lt;</li>
            <li> your hair will love you!</li>
            <li> I should have known better!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not the most pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It turly is amazing.</li>
            <li> Yes the joico reconstructer is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it worked amazingly, so</li>
            <li> I normally love Joico products, and was happy to be able to puchase this via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this kind of product via Amazon again.</li>
            <li> It really started showing, so I&#x27;ve decided to have blond highlights done at a salon, which turned out wonderful.</li>
            <li> The product smells nice, like bananas, but I do not like the watery consistency and texture.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I can&#x27;t say if this product had anything to do with my hair looking so nice</li>
            <li> Although the instruction don&#x27;t say so, you must follow this treatment immediately with a rich moisturizing conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine color treated &amp; permed hair.</li>
            <li> I was so happy I could get this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed with fine strands and this reconstructor does an amazing job of strengthening each strand.</li>
            <li> Thank Goodness! :)</li>
            <li> I love this Product.</li>
            <li> * I&#x27;m still going to stick with the Matrix Sleek products, they work so much better for my hair  </li>
            <li> So an ok buy to me</li>
            <li> I did make sure to use a moisturizing conditioner after rinsing the product out.</li>
            <li> There are too many reviewers posting here with experiences like mine to give any hope of getting an authentic product from Amazon at this time.</li>
            <li> but the price was even better.  </li>
            <li> This was the cheapest price I have ever been able to find it.</li>
            <li> The Joico K-pak system is my favorite hair care system.</li>
            <li> I find the shampoo and conditioner to be outstanding, and possibly slightly better than the reconstructor.</li>
            <li> and I thought IT FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I love this reconstructor&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe it takes more than one time to see better results.</li>
            <li> I would do this once a month at most.</li>
            <li> like so I needed more than 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The best there is, simple as that.</li>
            <li> I am not too sure</li>
            <li> and my hair was healthy again.</li>
            <li> have tried this brand many times,it always worked.</li>
            <li> This product provides a great intense conditioning treatment for your hair.  </li>
            <li> , I like this product better.</li>
            <li> I have used this reconstructor for many years and it is my favorite</li>
            <li> I ended up trying the Dove Quench conditioner which worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> I was leery of ordering this from a Marketplace Seller after reading many reviews where buyers received a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> When mine arrived, it was warm to the touch and sounded like it was full of liquid.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased to discover that it was available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> hair now, silky smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and loved it when I bought at a real salon...</li>
            <li> I bought this product and what I received was a bottle full of water!</li>
            <li> I had just finished a tube purchased from Ulta, so the difference between the two was easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> It is beyond amazing and you can feel it working the first time.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE FINE AND DAMAGED HAIR BY WIDER HIGHLIGHTS</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s meant for fine hair or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Smells like bananas and helped strengthen my super processed hair!</li>
            <li> I made sure I had a great moisture conditioner on my hair after I used it and that helps the dry feeling go away.  </li>
            <li> will be buying a huge bottle of this.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific brand of haircare and I expect nothing but great quality products from it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthier and feels smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> I ordered from the seller ASAP Beauty and received genuine product.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the real thing from my salon for years with awesome results and this junk is definitely NOT THE REAL THING!!!  </li>
            <li> Not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I can say about this product, is that it smells very nice.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t to sure about it because it made my hair even feel drier than before.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is a scam</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be stocking up on some more very soon!</li>
            <li> Best to use a small amount, rubbing between</li>
            <li> This is vastly different than the wonderful soft feel to my hair after using the tube I purchased from Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; my scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice &amp; made my hair incredibly soft</li>
            <li> I did return mine for a full refund.</li>
            <li> keep on for 30 minutes, rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> But it is not bad.</li>
            <li> It is super lightweight.</li>
            <li> All around, this is a pretty fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I liked the other one better than this one.  </li>
            <li> sure your other products are of professional quality as well and you&#x27;ll be happy with what effects your routine can accomplish with K-Pak included.</li>
            <li> This product works well .&lt;br /&gt;There are not many products that will be better than this one- a good buy.</li>
            <li> The only issue that I&#x27;ve found with the reconstructor is that it smells a bit more strongly than the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t purchase on here, make sure to purchase from a salon or professional beauty store.</li>
            <li> Whatever this seller is putting in these bottles is not even worth the $7 they&#x27;re charging for it.</li>
            <li> it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it was a fresh bottle if</li>
            <li> Formula seems the same to me, beige and kind of coagulated.</li>
            <li> I left the product on my hair for about an hour (covered with a shower cap) and applied very warm towels to it frequently.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the seller tried to rip me off due to the good reviews some people put.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it shipped right on time but</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle it was pure liquid in the consistancy of water!</li>
            <li> Thank you very fast shipping ILove</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This reconstructor made my dyed/fried hair alive and smooth after ONE use.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll be soon ready for my rescue color!</li>
            <li> ok if you have an extra 5 minutes in the shower, 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> I later leared many people sell fakes here.</li>
            <li> I think they cut the product most likely.</li>
            <li> Exact formula I purchased through salon and paid $19.99.  </li>
            <li> real product is amazing--it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice per week and my hair is much healthier!  </li>
            <li> Be aware when applying to your hair.</li>
            <li> After first use, I did not see any improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> Could tell it was helping my hair the first day.</li>
            <li> It was very runny and don&#x27;t even know if I will be able to use it because I cant bare the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling its because of the hot weather conditions the product has been through shipping here.</li>
            <li> It was so liquidy like water when I first got it</li>
            <li> and it was hot,</li>
            <li> Thanks Joico!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite deep conditioners!</li>
            <li> Just to be sure Joico hadn&#x27;t changed the product, I went out and purchased another K-pak from a salon, and compared the two products side by side; the one I purchased in the salon was the same K-pak that I have always used.</li>
            <li> Essentially, it works faster, smells better and again, works faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually changes damaged hair to healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for dry damaged hair and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> The smell is interesting, not unpleasant, but not really pleasing either.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the chance to save half my original purchase price.  </li>
            <li> had such amazing results as far as what it did for my hair</li>
            <li> Love it my hair is finally going back to normal after being over processed and dry this product is great</li>
            <li> The first handful I dispensed was very separated (see review pictures).</li>
            <li> NOT at all pleased, a huge waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Either this seller is tampering with the product or it&#x27;s super old.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my Joico Body Luxe conditioner and it makes my hair super soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell very good and it curds so the texture is weird, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t try to save money by buying a substandard product it will cost you more in the long run!!!</li>
            <li> Just so you know it does smell like very ripe bananas.</li>
            <li> and this is not, its very watery.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very runny and it smells like a banana.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt so much stronger as soon as I washed it out</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to repair my hair.</li>
            <li> I fined this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> But THIS stuff from this seller is NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the amount, as it was 1/2 way empty.</li>
            <li> I assume it is working, but I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really helped my over bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 (or a 4.5, really)</li>
            <li> I had to use the WHOLE BOTTLE before I felt like my strands were covered.</li>
            <li> seller of this item should be really ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> The product texture was very oily ....</li>
            <li> I have read reviews where people who have used this line of products before, are claiming that it is a fraud, not the real product, so I went to the joico website and found a dealer of the real product</li>
            <li> I will compare the two to see if it is in fact a fraud or the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product, recommended by hairdresser, really restored my damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it kind of seems like it might have been mixed with something as the consistency isnt the same as when i buy it from the salon.</li>
            <li> It should be thick and creamy and smell good.  </li>
            <li> REAL K-pak is creamy, thick and smells really good.  </li>
            <li> This reconstructor is much more than I expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and fine and colored.  </li>
            <li> :After the first use, my roots became springy and curly and after a few more uses the midshafts have become curly again as well.</li>
            <li> With this Tx and along with the Joico recovery moisture Balm Tx before you dry your hair so makes your hair feel soft and healthy to the the touch.  </li>
            <li> The tube I received from Hayword Beauty was only 2/3 full.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really notice much in the way of damage repair but maybe after a few more uses, hopefully I&#x27;ll start to see some improvement.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a slight banana-ish smell during the treatment process, then I think it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I shook it a little bit to see if that would work, but it didn&#x27;t make it better.</li>
            <li> it was runny and watery, not thick, so</li>
            <li> it helps your damaged hair become as close to normal as any I have tried.  </li>
            <li> More than a few times I over process my hair to the point it was breaking off, I used this twice weekly</li>
            <li> The real thing should be smooth and smell slightly like bananas.</li>
            <li> When it was dry it was soft smooth and shiney without&lt;br /&gt;any</li>
            <li> Protein strengthens hair but also makes it dry and more prone to breakage if you don&#x27;t add moisture back in.</li>
            <li> The product I received from the seller Hayword Beauty was a VERY watered down version of the original Joico K-pak Reconstructor product.</li>
            <li> Like putting H2O on your hair!My first reaction was it can&#x27;t be right and after reading other reviews I think I am right!The</li>
            <li> When I started getting my hair done with a new stylist she promoted the product so well that I thought I would try it again.  </li>
            <li> Product new as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> and I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Seemed runnier than it should and did not smell new or as others described it should smell.</li>
            <li> My scalp felt very sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s look like a very old product.</li>
            <li> I used this product before using kanechom chocolate hair moisturizing conditioner and silicone mix, I then dried and flat ironed my hair, and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice since getting it and it doesnt make my hair silky shiney and healthy like K-pak has always done for me in the past</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> It smells like the joico k-pack I used in the past many years ago.</li>
            <li> it is grainy, clearly old, and I seriously doubt it is still effective.  </li>
            <li> Stay far far away from these!</li>
            <li> SO finally, I ordered Joico K-pak, applied it to my damp hair (as soon as the mailman dropped it off) left it on for 5 minutes, rinsed with cool water and now my hair is soft and manageable again after all that abuse.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has helped my hair so far was hot oil treatments and frequent trims.</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t live with that color as it made me look like a corpse :), so I used a semi permanent med brown to color the white blonde back to a relatively livable color.</li>
            <li> It works a little but shyly in comparison to the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> my hair became soft limp smooth and I could straighten out the tangles</li>
            <li> It does make my hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I had natural medium ash blond hair</li>
            <li> Joico K-Pak Reconstructor is the only conditioner that absolutely leaves your hair feeling renewed.</li>
            <li> The reconstructor  has made my hair feel soft &amp; manageable</li>
            <li> Keep the Reconstructor on for 5 minutes, wash it out and do this again for at least one more application if not two.  </li>
            <li> It looked old - it looked like oatmeal.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it might be a tad old bc</li>
            <li> It does contain protein so it is not recommended for daily use as too much protein can cause your hair to break off.  </li>
            <li> It smelled old and it was curdled</li>
            <li> but so far... it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compliments from people all the time, thinking my hair is &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> And I bought the Intense Hydrating Treatment from the same seller too.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s supposed to be thick but it did work magic.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you are feelin&#x27; a little dry on top</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use that scores high on ewg.org/skindeep (0-10 scale for toxins in products)</li>
            <li> Just rinse it the next morning without washing it and your hair will feel like new.</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s pretty shady that you&#x27;d try to pass this off as the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this has left my hair feeling very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> But after about 6-8 weeks my roots started showing and I didn&#x27;t have enough  money to have a professional retouch, so I used a home highlight kit (with the cap) that turned me into bleached blond (which is REALLY not my color as I have fair white skin) and dried my hair out extremely.</li>
            <li> : you MUST shake then bottle before use as the consistency looks weird and separated...when you shake it first, it reblends the ingredients and the texture comes out creamy and smooth...</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, but must be several years old -</li>
            <li> It left my hair Amazingly soft and it didn&#x27;t even look like I colored my hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I marked one star is because it will not post without it.</li>
            <li> Smelled old to me and bottle had superficial damage to outside.</li>
            <li> Very watered down.... not thick like the one I purchased at my salon...does not even smell the same.</li>
            <li> Normal to dry</li>
            <li> like other reviewers have suggested, i first condition my hair, and then i use this deep conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li> However With Joico it gave back my hair back to its natural Ph.</li>
            <li> but if you are fragrance sensitive I would choose a different deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> The products are not bad they are just hard to use with my hair.  </li>
            <li> However the product is very watered down.</li>
            <li> It has transformed my hair from dry and lifeless to shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Watered down half full not joico.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m far less than thrilled..</li>
            <li> smell is odd not really bad just odd</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to repair their hair without weighing it down!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was in this container that I received, but it wasn&#x27;t K-pak, it smelled like coconut and was really greasy.</li>
            <li> I have long curly/wavy hair that has been prone to breakage the  last five or so years, probably because I started coloring it.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of my time and money because it was so old it will be going into the trash!</li>
            <li> What I did not understand is that it puts protein back in your hair and it will make it very dry feeling after you wash it off, almost feels as if there is no oil/moisture in your hair, so the next time I used it</li>
            <li> coarse, dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the instant results I expected after watching several youtubers review the product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for much longer than the recommended time though because it can make your hair feel sort of hard.</li>
            <li> But, I will not leave it in for that long again.</li>
            <li> The bottle however is way harder to open this time!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying it here because it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> DO NOT order the super cheap one--it is either watered down or fake!!</li>
            <li> I went from blone to brown to black and managed my way back to blonde.</li>
            <li> Almost as if the product had been sitting around for a long time!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I managed so long without it!</li>
            <li> It made my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dry and sticky.</li>
            <li> By the way, any smell disappears when you rinse and dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Per my stylist, you must towel dry your hair before applying for access water with dilute the solution and it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I bought this treatment hoping it would work wonders for my dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It is made for dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> and while my hair felt harder than normal, I did not experience the excessive breakage I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I have expensive extensions and after using one time it dried them out so bad it went from super great to dried out and breaking off big time!!</li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair from styling irons or dying your hair then use this stuff!  </li>
            <li> My hair had become fried due to iron loss in my blood, and I was not aware until later that this effects your nails and hair.  </li>
            <li> only less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as my old standby for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> and this had never happened to me before, as I always tried to be careful.  </li>
            <li> But If you apply to much protein to your hair it will damange it worse.</li>
            <li> One of my fave products, delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I carefully read all the reviews for the K pak after I fried my hair and I will agree-it worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3b curly hair and since the damage my hair wouldn&#x27;t curl when wet or even with curl activators.</li>
            <li> I showed my hairdresser and he told me that this was not a real Joico product.</li>
            <li> I used other products with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my hair heavy and weighed down like other deep conditioners do.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had fried it from a straightner, but I just could not wrap my mind around how and when I had done this due to the fact that I had beeen using a straightner for yrs</li>
            <li> This one did too, but not as well as the other one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a scam or what, but I do not think the actual product was in the container I got.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a 5 due to parabens</li>
            <li> I just use it in combination with my other conditioner.</li>
            <li> But, for 1, half of my bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because after years of heat damage, my hair needed some serious help, and apparently this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> Probably just not right for my hair type.</li>
            <li> As long as it works like this small bottle did</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse 3C hair</li>
            <li> I am not overwhelmed with it as it did not do much extra for my thin dry hair that a cheaper product did.</li>
            <li> but after a couple hours of cooling down it was a thicker consistency (still liquidy though).</li>
            <li> But like I said, who knows for all I know the seller could have watered this down.</li>
            <li> I used it once that month, and since I wadh my hair once a week, I put it into my hair regime, every other week, and the results have been phenominal!</li>
            <li> and I get much less breakage now.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it had a slight oily coating after using the tube purchased from Hayword Beauty.</li>
            <li> (My hair is naturally black, but i bleach it honey blond)</li>
            <li> I also thought the product would make my hair softer and less tangled, but it did not.</li>
            <li> Well... I managed to turn my hair into a brassy yellowish mess.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, frizz prone hair, the conditioner helped detangle and moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used K-pak alot of times in the past and it healed my extremely damaged hair.</li>
            <li> it seemed like it separated a little</li>
            <li> I am using it up anyway due to its small size</li>
            <li> If you are constantly disappointed with other hair products, its worth the $12 to try this one.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> After shaking up the tube for about 30 seconds the 2nd time I tried to dispense the product, it ran out of the tube in a stream as thin as milk.</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was way too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to heavily moisturize tho afterward.</li>
            <li> My hair was a dried up matted tangled rat&#x27;s nest that I couldn&#x27;t get a brush&lt;br /&gt;through.  </li>
            <li> What I got seems like a watered down version of what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampoo at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> My hair was in Pretty bad shape.</li>
            <li> This product was watered down and runny, not even as thick as the intensive moisture.</li>
            <li> I usually sleep with it in my hair once a month.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing here I read the reviews and almost didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon because of a few negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> but I am annoyed it&#x27;s not right.</li>
            <li> However, since I have been moving about the country, Joico has been hard to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppossed to be a thick cream</li>
            <li> it is supposed to be thick and smell like bananas</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s thick or watery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was disgusting and not the thick rich consistency of this product when purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li> And believe me when I say that I have tried alot over the past 3 months!  </li>
            <li> Was recommended by my hair stylist a few years ago and have been hooked ever since!!</li>
            <li> My hair was in need of serious repair...</li>
            <li> Smell not good, it doesn&#x27;t help me(((</li>
            <li> This one was thin and runny - thinner than shampoo would be.  </li>
            <li> Like serious!</li>
            <li> I got a very bad perm and the next day you could pull my hair like taffy.</li>
            <li> The product in the bottle is fake.</li>
            <li> Might have been a fake product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fake - the consistency was all wrong and the smell was off.  </li>
            <li> , it was weird, watery and chunky.  </li>
            <li> and I could tell immediately there was something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afraid it was either fake or expired.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake joico product because the others that I&#x27;ve bought from tj maxx aren&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with kpak, this is the one for all of us who just cant get  away from heatstyling.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fake product.</li>
            <li> The product was so weird and watery.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> The texture seems like any hair conditioner mixed with water and the worst part is that smelled bad.</li>
            <li> It smelled awful, it was runny, and had an odd color.  </li>
            <li> A must buy for broken strands!!</li>
            <li> I have to have an expensive treatment put on my hair now to repair it!</li>
            <li> About 20 years ago this product saved me years of growing out my damaged hair after a bad coloring experience.  </li>
            <li> You WON&#x27;T be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beware ladies:(</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad stuff!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty.</li>
            <li> Smelled disgusting.</li>
            <li> Did smell horrible as reported by others.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> So mad!!!</li>
            <li> Bubble gum scented glue and made my hair feel terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful, like rotting apples.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell was the same as Joico Reconstructor, but the texture was just off. It was runny with chunky bits, and did not moisturize like the salon-purchased products I&#x27;ve bought of the same brand.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampoo at least every other day.  It does make my hair feel soft and manageable.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product - does wonders to my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you very fast shipping ILove it</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful product along with another Joico Tx it helps your damaged hair become as close to normal as any I have tried.  And believe me when I say that I have tried alot over the past 3 months!  My hair had become fried due to iron loss in my blood, and I was not aware until later that this effects your nails and hair.  I thought I had fried it from a straightner, but I just could not wrap my mind around how and when I had done this due to the fact that I had beeen using a straightner for yrs and this had never happened to me before, as I always tried to be careful.  But the fact remained that my hair was damaged and I had to do something, I did alot of research and this product kept coming up, so I decided to give it a try.  The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t to sure about it because it made my hair even feel drier than before.  What I did not understand is that it puts protein back in your hair and it will make it very dry feeling after you wash it off, almost feels as if there is no oil/moisture in your hair, so the next time I used it I made sure I had a great moisture conditioner on my hair after I used it and that helps the dry feeling go away.  With this Tx and along with the Joico recovery moisture Balm Tx before you dry your hair so makes your hair feel soft and healthy to the the touch.  Just so you know it does smell like very ripe bananas.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is probably an excellent conditioner because the shampoo is and that&#x27;s what I thought I was ordering</li>
            <li> I normally love Joico products, and was happy to be able to puchase this via Amazon.  Product arrived on time, but must be several years old - it is grainy, clearly old, and I seriously doubt it is still effective.  What a waste of money.  I won&#x27;t buy this kind of product via Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and I am not easily impressed by beauty products... This reconstructor made my dyed/fried hair alive and smooth after ONE use.  Here&#x27;s what happened: I had natural medium ash blond hair and I was very happy with it until I started to get grays in it. It really started showing, so I&#x27;ve decided to have blond highlights done at a salon, which turned out wonderful. But after about 6-8 weeks my roots started showing and I didn&#x27;t have enough  money to have a professional retouch, so I used a home highlight kit (with the cap) that turned me into bleached blond (which is REALLY not my color as I have fair white skin) and dried my hair out extremely. But I couldn&#x27;t live with that color as it made me look like a corpse :), so I used a semi permanent med brown to color the white blonde back to a relatively livable color. Well... I managed to turn my hair into a brassy yellowish mess. I could stand it for three days, then got a color remover kit and removed the brown. At this point my hair looked like those hay bails on Halloween: coarse, dry and unmanageable. So I was back to the bleached blond color with hair so brittle it broke while I brushed it. SO finally, I ordered Joico K-pak, applied it to my damp hair (as soon as the mailman dropped it off) left it on for 5 minutes, rinsed with cool water and now my hair is soft and manageable again after all that abuse. So I&#x27;ll be soon ready for my rescue color! Thank Goodness! :)</li>
            <li> I have used K-pak alot of times in the past and it healed my extremely damaged hair. What I got seems like a watered down version of what I have used in the past. It&#x27;s suppossed to be a thick cream and this is not, its very watery. I have used it twice since getting it and it doesnt make my hair silky shiney and healthy like K-pak has always done for me in the past</li>
            <li> I love this Product. I&#x27;m in the motion of attending hair school at the moment. My hair was in Pretty bad shape. I went from blone to brown to black and managed my way back to blonde. So you can only picture the condition of my hair. However With Joico it gave back my hair back to its natural Ph. It left my hair Amazingly soft and it didn&#x27;t even look like I colored my hair. This product has the perfect amount of protein and Moisture. You can NEVER have enought Moisture. But If you apply to much protein to your hair it will damange it worse. So this has equal amounts of both. It turly is amazing. My hair has never felt this Great.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty. The product in the bottle is fake. It is watery and doesn&#x27;t help reconstruct your hair at all. I&#x27;ve used it before and loved it when I bought at a real salon...Either this seller is tampering with the product or it&#x27;s super old.</li>
            <li> Joico products have always worked the best on my hair. However, since I have been moving about the country, Joico has been hard to find sometimes. I was really pleased to discover that it was available through Amazon. This purchase was received promptly. The only issue that came up for me was the thickness of the K-pac. I thought I rememered it to be thicker. Nonetheless, it did the job and my hair is recovering its softness and sheen after the issues of dryness that it had had since my last perm.If you are constantly disappointed with other hair products, its worth the $12 to try this one.</li>
            <li> i have been using joico k-pak products for over three yrs, and recently i have started using this deep conditioner for couple of months. this has left my hair feeling very soft and silky.  i love, love, love!!! like other reviewers have suggested, i first condition my hair, and then i use this deep conditioner afterwards.  i leave it on for five minutes.  don&#x27;t think this product is expired when you see this conditioner.  it&#x27;s very runny and it smells like a banana.  the best product!!!</li>
            <li> * I&#x27;m still going to stick with the Matrix Sleek products, they work so much better for my hair  * Normal to dry, med-thick, med length hair  * So an ok buy to me</li>
            <li> Ive have had Joico&#x27;s reconstructor before and know what to expect and this is DEFINITELY not that. Its as if something entirely different was put inside the package.. The smell and texture are entirely different...Needless to say I&#x27;m far less than thrilled..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased from this seller, however, I purchase the K Pak Reconstructor from Ulta, I see a lot of people posting about the consistency,  it is supposed to be thick and smell like bananas, it&#x27;s not the most pleasant smell. But I&#x27;ve been using this product 2 times a week  for about 1 month and I will continue to use it. It has transformed my hair from dry and lifeless to shiny and soft. I&#x27;m truly amazed.  If you don&#x27;t purchase on here, make sure to purchase from a salon or professional beauty store. You WON&#x27;T be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed with fine strands and this reconstructor does an amazing job of strengthening each strand. My hair felt so much stronger as soon as I washed it out and I get much less breakage now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for much longer than the recommended time though because it can make your hair feel sort of hard. Surprisingly, I did leave it in by accident for about 15 min and while my hair felt harder than normal, I did not experience the excessive breakage I was expecting. I did make sure to use a moisturizing conditioner after rinsing the product out. But, I will not leave it in for that long again. The smell is interesting, not unpleasant, but not really pleasing either. Some may like it. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> The product I received from the seller Hayword Beauty was a VERY watered down version of the original Joico K-pak Reconstructor product. I had just finished a tube purchased from Ulta, so the difference between the two was easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;1) The tube I received from Hayword Beauty was only 2/3 full. 2) The first handful I dispensed was very separated (see review pictures). 3) After shaking up the tube for about 30 seconds the 2nd time I tried to dispense the product, it ran out of the tube in a stream as thin as milk. 4) My hair felt like it had a slight oily coating after using the tube purchased from Hayword Beauty. This is vastly different than the wonderful soft feel to my hair after using the tube I purchased from Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: BUYER BEWARE! There are too many reviewers posting here with experiences like mine to give any hope of getting an authentic product from Amazon at this time.</li>
            <li> I knew the product was great but the price was even better.  Just research the Joico Product line and this will appear.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a product that would noticeably improve the texture, look and feel of my hair.  I stumbled on Joico shampoo and Conditioner, and thought let me search and see if they have a reconstructor, and of course they did.  I  started using it about 2 months ago.  I used it once that month, and since I wadh my hair once a week, I put it into my hair regime, every other week, and the results have been phenominal! I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Very watered down.... not thick like the one I purchased at my salon...does not even smell the same. I don&#x27;t know what was in the Joico bottle but it was not the Joico I use!</li>
            <li> Watered down half full not joico.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because after years of heat damage, my hair needed some serious help, and apparently this stuff works wonders. I ordered the largest bottle because of how great it&#x27;s supposed to be. The product I received literally looks like cottage cheese in a bottle, it&#x27;s gross. It made my hair feel dry and sticky. Pretty sure this is a scam so beware if you&#x27;re thinking of getting it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received the Joico K-Pak on time, seald in nice plastic bags, in perfect condition, no leaks etc., beautiful, new, I used some today and it worked great. Thank you. 🌼⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌺</li>
            <li> Joico K-Pak Reconstructor is the only conditioner that absolutely leaves your hair feeling renewed. I usually sleep with it in my hair once a month. Just rinse it the next morning without washing it and your hair will feel like new. I swear by this stuff. This was the cheapest price I have ever been able to find it.</li>
            <li> It works  ok if you have an extra 5 minutes in the shower, 3 times a week.  I would recommend it if you are feelin&#x27; a little dry on top and you have 1 or 2 weeks until your next hair appt, otherwise, just get Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Smelled disgusting. Like it was expired. Might have been a fake product. I later leared many people sell fakes here. I won&#x27;t buy again. Did absolutely nothing to repair my hair.</li>
            <li> The Joico K-pak system is my favorite hair care system. I find the shampoo and conditioner to be outstanding, and possibly slightly better than the reconstructor. The only issue that I&#x27;ve found with the reconstructor is that it smells a bit more strongly than the shampoo and conditioner. If you don&#x27;t mind a slight banana-ish smell during the treatment process, then I think it is fantastic! By the way, any smell disappears when you rinse and dry your hair. All around, this is a pretty fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, frizz prone hair, the conditioner helped detangle and moisturize my hair.  I used other products with minimal results.  I will reorder AND recommend.</li>
            <li> I fined this product works very well for me. I have very fine color treated &amp; permed hair. This causes damage. The reconstructor  has made my hair feel soft &amp; manageable &amp; my scalp feel clean. I would suggest it to anyone who colors or perms their hair to give it strength.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of Joico products.  When I started getting my hair done with a new stylist she promoted the product so well that I thought I would try it again.  The products are not bad they are just hard to use with my hair.  Something to know about how to use this Reconstructor properly that it does not say on the bottle.  Per my stylist, you must towel dry your hair before applying for access water with dilute the solution and it won&#x27;t work.  Keep the Reconstructor on for 5 minutes, wash it out and do this again for at least one more application if not two.  If you use the product correctly it&#x27;s works great!  My hair looked great and it did the job.    I give this 3 stars b/c I want a mask that doesn&#x27;t take 15 minutes for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> It smells nice &amp; made my hair incredibly soft but I didn&#x27;t really notice much in the way of damage repair but maybe after a few more uses, hopefully I&#x27;ll start to see some improvement.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS HAIR TREATMENT! I HAVE FINE AND DAMAGED HAIR BY WIDER HIGHLIGHTS and I thought IT FANTASTIC! RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, it&#x27;s my favorite hair medicine!</li>
            <li> I love this reconstructor&lt;br /&gt;I use it once every 3 weeks, and is being awesome to my hair. I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> One of my fave products, delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> i dont think it helped at all</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was way too heavy for my hair. My scalp felt very sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li> Great product makes hair feel so good and feel so great,, will buy it again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;and will let my friends know about it .</li>
            <li> Yes the joico reconstructer is amazing. But THIS stuff from this seller is NOT the real deal. Do NOT waste your money like I did! I think they cut the product most likely. It works a little but shyly in comparison to the real deal!!! Also, no returns on it! Stay far far away from these!</li>
            <li> Exact formula I purchased through salon and paid $19.99.  Before purchasing here I read the reviews and almost didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon because of a few negative reviews.  Glad I took the chance to save half my original purchase price.  This product is excellent for dry damaged hair and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp and lifeless.  Will be purchasing more soon!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about buying this product because of some of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and purchased 2 anyway and I&#x27;m happy I did! The product isn&#x27;t any different than the one I&#x27;ve purchased from my hairdresser -- only less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be stocking up on some more very soon!</li>
            <li> Wonderful RECONSTRUCTOR for hair</li>
            <li> This product is good! I&#x27;m not so sure about the amount, as it was 1/2 way empty. It arrived on time and I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> it kind of seems like it might have been mixed with something as the consistency isnt the same as when i buy it from the salon. Still makes my hair feel good though.</li>
            <li> I ordered three. They all came in separate boxes. Feels incredibly wasteful. Product is great however. I&#x27;m a Joico fan!</li>
            <li> DO NOT order the super cheap one--it is either watered down or fake!! The real thing should be smooth and smell slightly like bananas. If it&#x27;s watery, you&#x27;re being ripped off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real product is amazing--it is worth the money. Whatever this seller is putting in these bottles is not even worth the $7 they&#x27;re charging for it.</li>
            <li> Love it my hair is finally going back to normal after being over processed and dry this product is great</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice per week and my hair is much healthier!  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific brand of haircare and I expect nothing but great quality products from it. With this reconstructor, it is no different. I assume it is working, but I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair. You are not to use it too often because that would overload your strands with protein and make them feel coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your other products are of professional quality as well and you&#x27;ll be happy with what effects your routine can accomplish with K-Pak included.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair from styling irons or dying your hair then use this stuff!  It is beyond amazing and you can feel it working the first time.  Smells great too, kinda like banana bread.  I use it like once or twice a week</li>
            <li> If I could would give 0 stars... The texture seems like any hair conditioner mixed with water and the worst part is that smelled bad. Don&#x27;t look like a Joico product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was clumpy..?</li>
            <li> Really helped my over bleached hair. It works. No nonsense kinda working.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and does a great job of repairing chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This product was disgusting and not the thick rich consistency of this product when purchased from the salon. Did smell horrible as reported by others. Be aware when applying to your hair. Not a sealed bottled product. I did return mine for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon and it was terrible. It looked old - it looked like oatmeal. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I used the reconstructor instead of conditioner and it took my 30 minutes to get all the detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I received my product in the mail today, used once, and immediately asked for a refund. Like everyone else this was the texture of watery oatmeal and didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair. What a scam!</li>
            <li> This product works well .&lt;br /&gt;There are not many products that will be better than this one- a good buy.</li>
            <li> Product new as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fake - the consistency was all wrong and the smell was off.  It should be thick and creamy and smell good.  This one was thin and runny - thinner than shampoo would be.  Very poor quality.  I won&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment hoping it would work wonders for my dry, damaged hair. After first use, I did not see any improvement in my hair. I thought that maybe it takes more than one time to see better results. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and my hair still looks and feels the same. The product smells nice, like bananas, but I do not like the watery consistency and texture. Maybe it&#x27;s not working on my hair which was damaged from bleach and heat damage. The only thing that has helped my hair so far was hot oil treatments and frequent trims.</li>
            <li> Has done everything it says it will do.  My hair looks healthier and feels smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Transforms my hair!! Amazing!!! Makes my hair stronger and fuller I love this product!! A must buy for broken strands!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell. Excellent product for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 (or a 4.5, really) because I used it one time and my shedding stopped immediately. Now, I think I have discovered what is going on with the &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; issue that people are speaking of. When mine arrived, it was warm to the touch and sounded like it was full of liquid. I put it in the fridge for a while, and it became creamy again. I then left it on the counter for a few days until I was ready to use it, and it was still creamy. So, I think it is melting in the UPS truck or something. Anyway - I used it after shampooing. I had to use the WHOLE BOTTLE before I felt like my strands were covered. That was a bummer. But I got mine for $6 and it worked amazingly, so it was worth it. I would do this once a month at most.</li>
            <li> This is the weirdest consistency ever.Like putting H2O on your hair!My first reaction was it can&#x27;t be right and after reading other reviews I think I am right!The smell is odd not really bad just odd and I can live with that.But it has done NOTHING for my hair,NOTHING! Beware ladies:(</li>
            <li> I carefully read all the reviews for the K pak after I fried my hair and I will agree-it worked wonders on my hair. I used along with Nexxus Humectress and my hair is on the way to health!&lt;br /&gt;I left the K pak on for about 20 minutes~ my hair was especially fried and straw like so I needed more than 5-10 minutes. I cant wait to go back to my hairdresser so she can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I should have known not to bother buying this online, but when in another country, your options aren&#x27;t the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this wasn&#x27;t K-pak reconstructor in this bottle that I got.  There might be 1% in it so you can call it that.  But, for 1, half of my bottle was empty.  2, it was weird, watery and chunky.  REAL K-pak is creamy, thick and smells really good.  This stuff stunk and I will NOT be putting it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they say that unless it&#x27;s bought from a salon you don&#x27;t know what it is; lesson learned.  I just think it&#x27;s pretty shady that you&#x27;d try to pass this off as the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this item should be really ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Smell not good, it doesn&#x27;t help me(((</li>
            <li> The only reason I marked one star is because it will not post without it. I am really disappointed with this product. I dispensed the product onto my hand and I could tell immediately there was something wrong with it. The consistency was siMilan to that of spoiled milk. Almost as if the product had been sitting around for a long time! I shook it a little bit to see if that would work, but it didn&#x27;t make it better. The product texture was very oily ....I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> Smells like bananas and helped strengthen my super processed hair! (My hair is naturally black, but i bleach it honey blond) It seemed like it might be a tad old bc it seemed like it separated a little but it still seemed to do the trick. I had to heavily moisturize tho afterward.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the instant results I expected after watching several youtubers review the product. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair was a dried up matted tangled rat&#x27;s nest that I couldn&#x27;t get a brush&lt;br /&gt;through.  It&#x27;s long and fine and colored.  As soon as this hit my head in the&lt;br /&gt;shower my hair became soft limp smooth and I could straighten out the tangles&lt;br /&gt;easily in the shower.  When it was dry it was soft smooth and shiney without&lt;br /&gt;any tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it was runny and watery, not thick, so I can&#x27;t say it was a fresh bottle if&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s supposed to be thick but it did work magic.  I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a huge bottle of this.  As long as it works like this small bottle did&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s thick or watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it here on Amazon and if it seems like it&#x27;s a gross texture send it back for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I had such amazing results as far as what it did for my hair I would buy it on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;again without hesitation.  This is like someone else&#x27;s hair.  It looks like the runway&lt;br /&gt;models&#x27; hair now, silky smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I received this in a runny clotted condition.  I am using it up anyway due to its small size but I am annoyed it&#x27;s not right.</li>
            <li> The very best conditioner I have ever found!</li>
            <li> The best there is, simple as that.</li>
            <li> Works great! Bought 3 of em!</li>
            <li> I bought this around the same time I bought another reconstructor.  I liked the other one better than this one.  It worked faster and made my hair look healthier.  This one did too, but not as well as the other one did.</li>
            <li> Could tell it was helping my hair the first day. My hair was so damaged and with the help of  the K-Pak products my hair is on its way back to healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> I love the Joico product !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order &amp; the&lt;br /&gt;delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it shipped right on time but the moment I smelt the packaging without even opening it all I smelt was mold. The product was not moldy it was just how it smelt. It was very runny and don&#x27;t even know if I will be able to use it because I cant bare the smell of it. I am not too sure but I don&#x27;t think the seller tried to rip me off due to the good reviews some people put. I have a feeling its because of the hot weather conditions the product has been through shipping here. It was so liquidy like water when I first got it and it was hot, but after a couple hours of cooling down it was a thicker consistency (still liquidy though). I just think the weather conditions threw it off, so if you wanna purchase this get it in the winter or at a salon, that&#x27;s about all I can say. But like I said, who knows for all I know the seller could have watered this down.</li>
            <li> I got a very bad perm and the next day you could pull my hair like taffy. I tried everything before I tried Joico K-Pak. One or Two deep uses and my hair recovered!</li>
            <li> I use this product a couple times a week.  It is a Deep Penetrating Reconstructor.  It is made for dry damaged hair.  I love Joico products!! I mix this with my Joico Body Luxe conditioner and it makes my hair super soft and silky.  It does not make my hair heavy and weighed down like other deep conditioners do.  It does not make my hair greasy either.  It is super lightweight. It does contain protein so it is not recommended for daily use as too much protein can cause your hair to break off.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to repair their hair without weighing it down!! Thanks Joico!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was a scam or what, but I do not think the actual product was in the container I got.  It smelled awful, it was runny, and had an odd color.  I&#x27;ve used Joico products before.  Maybe this was expired or maybe I got taken, but after one use I threw the rest of it away, Lord only knows what was in there that I was putting on my hair!  NOT at all pleased, a huge waste of money!  Buy these products at a licensed retailer, not on here!</li>
            <li> The buying experience was great. Very fast delivery of the product. However the product is very watered down. I thought that since it&#x27;s a deep conditioner that it would be a thicker consistency. It looks to me like water was added to dilute the content. I also thought the product would make my hair softer and less tangled, but it did not. Maybe because of the same reason that it is too watery. I hope that you guys can do something about this.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing!!! Beware!!! I have expensive extensions and after using one time it dried them out so bad it went from super great to dried out and breaking off big time!! I&#x27;m furious! I&#x27;ve used the real thing from my salon for years with awesome results and this junk is definitely NOT THE REAL THING!!!  DON&#x27;t BUY IT OR PUT IT ON YOUR HAIR!! Bad bad bad stuff!!  I have to have an expensive treatment put on my hair now to repair it! So mad!!! If you notice to ingredients are listed don&#x27;t try to save money by buying a substandard product it will cost you more in the long run!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product before using kanechom chocolate hair moisturizing conditioner and silicone mix, I then dried and flat ironed my hair, and the results were amazing. With that being said, I can&#x27;t say if this product had anything to do with my hair looking so nice or if it was just the kanechom and silicone mix. The only thing that I can say about this product, is that it smells very nice. I have read reviews where people who have used this line of products before, are claiming that it is a fraud, not the real product, so I went to the joico website and found a dealer of the real product and I purchased the product again. I will compare the two to see if it is in fact a fraud or the real thing. I will post my findings when I receive it.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse 3C hair and it did nothing for my hair. It didn&#x27;t stop the breakage and made my hair feel like straw. I guess it&#x27;s meant for fine hair or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 10 years. I use it once a week and it keeps my hair strong and healthy. More than a few times I over process my hair to the point it was breaking off, I used this twice weekly and my hair was healthy again.</li>
            <li> This product was watered down and runny, not even as thick as the intensive moisture. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought it on amazon through this seller,very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this brand many times,it always worked.But this time its awful,smells like rotten eggs.Still I tried it once and it didn&#x27;t do anything literally.&lt;br /&gt;Afraid it was either fake or expired.</li>
            <li> It smelled old and it was curdled</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good and it would come out chunky. It did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite deep conditioners! Was recommended by my hair stylist a few years ago and have been hooked ever since!!</li>
            <li> 100% happy w/ purchase</li>
            <li> This product provides a great intense conditioning treatment for your hair.  I left the product on my hair for about an hour (covered with a shower cap) and applied very warm towels to it frequently.  This is what my hairdresser suggested instead of following the directions on the tube.  It worked great for me.  My hair looked and felt great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was in this container that I received, but it wasn&#x27;t K-pak, it smelled like coconut and was really greasy. I&#x27;ve been using K-pak for years, and this product had a completely different look, smell, texture, and consistency than K-pak. Just to be sure Joico hadn&#x27;t changed the product, I went out and purchased another K-pak from a salon, and compared the two products side by side; the one I purchased in the salon was the same K-pak that I have always used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as my old standby for at least 15 years. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but I always have a bottle. It&#x27;s the only thing I use that scores high on ewg.org/skindeep (0-10 scale for toxins in products) it&#x27;s a 5 due to parabens and fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like banana or Banana Boat to me which for some reason doesn&#x27;t bother me. Formula seems the same to me, beige and kind of coagulated. The bottle however is way harder to open this time! Fix the bottle not the formula please Joico!</li>
            <li> About 20 years ago this product saved me years of growing out my damaged hair after a bad coloring experience.  I all but forgot about it for the longest time, and just rediscovered it.  Don&#x27;t know how I managed so long without it!</li>
            <li> After damaging My perfectly curly hair from chemicals and heat... My hair was in need of serious repair... Like serious! I have 3b curly hair and since the damage my hair wouldn&#x27;t curl when wet or even with curl activators. I tried ApoGhee reconstructor before this and must admit, I like this product better. Essentially, it works faster, smells better and again, works faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:After the first use, my roots became springy and curly and after a few more uses the midshafts have become curly again as well. I think the ends of my hair have to be clipped in order for some of the damaged follicles to accept the nutrients this products has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repost after I go to the salon and get a trim but so far... it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: you MUST shake then bottle before use as the consistency looks weird and separated...when you shake it first, it reblends the ingredients and the texture comes out creamy and smooth...</li>
            <li> The best! Actually changes damaged hair to healthy. I&#x27;ve used it for twenty years, through bleaching and perms, and&lt;br /&gt;get compliments from people all the time, thinking my hair is &#x27;natural&#x27;. Best to use a small amount, rubbing between&lt;br /&gt;hands and distributing evenly after shampooing and leaving it in.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s look like a very old product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake joico product because the others that I&#x27;ve bought from tj maxx aren&#x27;t like this one. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good and it curds so the texture is weird, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling moisturized. Don&#x27;t bother buying it here because it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with kpak, this is the one for all of us who just cant get  away from heatstyling. for a treat, wash hair, apply kpak, wrap head with plastic wrap, then cover with beanie. keep on for 30 minutes, rinse with cool water. your hair will love you!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but it could work for you. All hair responds differently.</li>
            <li> I was so happy I could get this product at such a great price. I should have known better! I have used this reconstructor for many years and it is my favorite so this is nothing against JOICO. However, the seller is selling what appears to be an expired product. When I opened the bottle it was pure liquid in the consistancy of water! This is a total waste of my time and money because it was so old it will be going into the trash! What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Seemed runnier than it should and did not smell new or as others described it should smell. Smelled old to me and bottle had superficial damage to outside.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hair.  I use it often, especially because I have to wash and blowdry my hair every day.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fake product. Bubble gum scented glue and made my hair feel terrible. I have used kpak before and this isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. I am not overwhelmed with it as it did not do much extra for my thin dry hair that a cheaper product did. But it is not bad. Probably just not right for my hair type. I ended up trying the Dove Quench conditioner which worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> That came open and the smell completely different</li>
            <li> I was leery of ordering this from a Marketplace Seller after reading many reviews where buyers received a counterfeit product. I ordered from the seller ASAP Beauty and received genuine product. I&#x27;ve use this treatment once every 4-6 weeks for about five years. I have long curly/wavy hair that has been prone to breakage the  last five or so years, probably because I started coloring it. This seems to help strengthen my hair. IMPORTANT: Although the instruction don&#x27;t say so, you must follow this treatment immediately with a rich moisturizing conditioner!! Protein strengthens hair but also makes it dry and more prone to breakage if you don&#x27;t add moisture back in. After rinsing out the Joico K-pak I follow up with Loreal Mega Moisture conditioner, leave that in for 5 minutes and rinse. I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t listed in the instruction. The website for Joico recommends using their moisture conditioner following treatment with the K-Pak</li>
            <li> ok, good product, good price, I recommend</li>
            <li> It smells like the joico k-pack I used in the past many years ago. However, the actual product when pressed together in my hands, before I apply it to my hair, seems to dissolve. To say this is a &amp;#34;reconstructor&amp;#34; is a joke. I just use it in combination with my other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and what I received was a bottle full of water! And I bought the Intense Hydrating Treatment from the same seller too. The product was so weird and watery. I showed my hairdresser and he told me that this was not a real Joico product. This is such a shame! I felt cheated. If I could give 0 stars, I would!</li>
            <li> This reconstructor is much more than I expected! I recommend to all who are with her hair damaged by chemical processes.</li>
            <li> This product, recommended by hairdresser, really restored my damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;I use after every shampoo, let sit in for 5-10 minutes, then finish with a drop of cream rinse on my ends.&lt;br /&gt;Have volume AND shine!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful, like rotting apples. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product but if you are fragrance sensitive I would choose a different deep conditioner.</li>
