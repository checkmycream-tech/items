            <li>Tried these in place of baby wipes and really liked them.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent and soothing.  </li>
            <li>and they have a nice, sealable lid that keeps them from drying out.  </li>
            <li>They are VERY easy to rip when trying to get out of the container.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and scent is very plesant.</li>

            <li>These wipes are so refreshing I take them with everywhere</li>
            <li>packages are so convenient, love the smell, its flushable.</li>
            <li>but I really love the softness and the scent.</li>
            <li>They really are a great find</li>
            <li>This had better ingredients than the store-bought stuff, so it was an easy call.</li>
            <li>I link these a lot but would like them just a tad bit bigger but good product!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rip when you pull them from the pouch, they have an inoffensive, light scent, and they are great for sensitive bums and fannies.</li>
            <li>, you know what happens then, tear easily, thus a stinky finger, and</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but not too much or too strong.  </li>
            <li>Great to keep in your overnight bag or just in the powder room for regular use.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the scent on the mens version and with the high ratings given to this product</li>
            <li>I was excited after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but I love these wipes so much, I felt compelled!</li>
            <li>These are moist and you feel clean after using.</li>
            <li>I love having these in every bathroom, and they&#x27;re handy enough to travel with.</li>
            <li>nothing special - but they do the trick.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about these at all.  </li>
            <li>she uses at the gym or at home when she doesnt have time for a full shower, etc</li>
            <li>My mom needed a more sensitive alternative to the Cottonelle flushable wet wipes and these fit the bill splendidly.  </li>
            <li>I travel a lot, and these wipes keep me fresh and clean on the go.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild to my nose</li>
            <li>They would probably be nice to keep in your purse though for traveling so that you had them available for use in public restrooms.  </li>
            <li>These keep me feeling fresh all day</li>
            <li>They are fresh and soft and leave you feeling clean!  </li>
            <li>They are gentle to the skin and have a clean smell.  </li>
            <li>And, they fit nicely in the gym bag or your purse or if you also happen to travel alot, in the suitcase with little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the smell of them is nice nothing too strong, the only part i dont like is the fact that they stick together in the packaging and are kind of hard to get out without ripping.</li>
            <li>The package reseals pretty well.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Ladygroomer!</li>
            <li>if just using the product is more work than its promised goal just get something different.</li>
            <li>Did not use them as much as I expected (300 is a lot...), but they smell nice and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>i really like the fresh scent</li>
            <li>These are probably nice for other people, however I didn&#x27;t like the smell of these.</li>
            <li>First, these are not as large or sturdy as baby wipes.  </li>
            <li>Besides, opening the package makes a unique noise that is loud, so much for  discreteness.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s unscented baby wipes are just as good, if not better-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend getting a single pack (at the time not avaialable on amazon), before getting a 6 pack to make sure you like the scent.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these to all the ladies!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I really don&#x27;t like the scent</li>
            <li>They are very moist so the cloths stick together and don&#x27;t want to come out one at a time.</li>
            <li>The reason for the lower rating is the scent, I guess this is really a subjective reason, but it is the main reason we bought the product.</li>
            <li>These personal wipes have a mild fragrance, though not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and these wipes are gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use them at home and at work for extra fresh ness</li>
            <li>They come in an easy to re-close wrapper but tear easily as you pull them out; it doesn&#x27;t help that the edge is very hard to find from outside the package in order to get a grip on one in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not sure it&#x27;s good with the natural composition of the female body.</li>
            <li>the wipes feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>They are too hard to separate and often times end up pulling out more than one or tearing them.  </li>
            <li>i am a wipe fanatic and love these.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product, you can tell thought was put into making a thick, strong  wipe in a convenient package.</li>
            <li>Small package makes it easy to take with me to gym or when traveling.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the cloth tears easily when trying to get one out of the packet.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like the product.</li>
            <li>They are rough and not at all comfortable on delicate areas.</li>

            <li> The wipes are not as moist as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> I was using some other brands</li>
            <li> The scent is too sweet and has an unpleasant after scent.  </li>
            <li> getting out of package is just not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> could be a little less cumbersome.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little unnatrual, which to me, is off putting.</li>
            <li> But...After a few uses, the wipes gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I have tried these previously, and they are great...especially after leaving the gym!  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is they are a bit thin.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had a small size or trial size</li>
            <li> Not happy with these at all.  </li>
            <li> too thin</li>
            <li> the smell is awful but that&#x27;s just my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> and now I have an expensive 6 pack.</li>
            <li> They are expensive.  </li>
            <li> They shred, tear, and are worthless.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrible product!  The 1 star is because the packets close well.  The scent is too sweet and has an unpleasant after scent.  The wipes fall apart as you try to get them out of the packet.  They shred, tear, and are worthless.  Never again.</li>
            <li> the smell is awful but that&#x27;s just my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these at all.  They are rough and not at all comfortable on delicate areas.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them...she uses at the gym or at home when she doesnt have time for a full shower, etc</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> These keep me feeling fresh all day the smell of them is nice nothing too strong, the only part i dont like is the fact that they stick together in the packaging and are kind of hard to get out without ripping.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! They smell great - like a spa. The individual packages are the perfect size to keep in your purse or car.</li>
            <li> They smell okay but the wipes aren&#x27;t under/over folded so you have to dog for the next wipe. They don&#x27;t take care of the smells either, you have to use about 5 to get the job done.</li>
            <li> These are probably nice for other people, however I didn&#x27;t like the smell of these.</li>
            <li> They are gentle to the skin and have a clean smell.  The only complaint I have is they are a bit thin.  They are VERY easy to rip when trying to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> I like this product. These are moist and you feel clean after using. The package reseals pretty well. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in your overnight bag or just in the powder room for regular use.  The aroma is neutral, not perfumed nor antiseptic.  No problems with irritation.  Good product.  Also have used as diaper wipes for guests with infants.</li>
            <li> These wipes are so refreshing I take them with everywhere</li>
            <li> I link these a lot but would like them just a tad bit bigger but good product! Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little unnatrual, which to me, is off putting. I&#x27;m also not sure it&#x27;s good with the natural composition of the female body. Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought so many! Ahh well.</li>
            <li> I use them at home and at work for extra fresh ness</li>
            <li> wish they were bigger and thicker</li>
            <li> packages are so convenient, love the smell, its flushable. great product</li>
            <li> I have tried these previously, and they are great...especially after leaving the gym!  The scent is nice but not too much or too strong.  And, they fit nicely in the gym bag or your purse or if you also happen to travel alot, in the suitcase with little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to all the ladies!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and scent is very plesant.</li>
            <li> Tried these in place of baby wipes and really liked them.  Small package makes it easy to take with me to gym or when traveling.  Nice scent and soothing.  Great idea for women. Terrific stocking stuffer.  Plan to share with family and friends.</li>
            <li> The wipes are not as moist as I would have expected.  My son&#x27;s unscented baby wipes are just as good, if not better- and a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law reccommended these wipes. I was using some other brands but I really love the softness and the scent. They really are a great find and I have reccommended them to all my girl friends</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product, you can tell thought was put into making a thick, strong  wipe in a convenient package. The reason for the lower rating is the scent, I guess this is really a subjective reason, but it is the main reason we bought the product. I really liked the scent on the mens version and with the high ratings given to this product I had high expectations. Unfortunately I really don&#x27;t like the scent and now I have an expensive 6 pack. I&#x27;d recommend getting a single pack (at the time not avaialable on amazon), before getting a 6 pack to make sure you like the scent.</li>
            <li> First, these are not as large or sturdy as baby wipes.  They come in an easy to re-close wrapper but tear easily as you pull them out; it doesn&#x27;t help that the edge is very hard to find from outside the package in order to get a grip on one in the first place.  Happily, they fit the reusable plastic tub Charmin Wipes come in, (~7 1/4\\&quot; X 5 1/2\\&quot;) perfectly so that&#x27;s what I use instead of the wrapper.  The scent is mild to my nose but that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
            <li> These personal wipes have a mild fragrance, though not overpowering. They come in a convenient resealable pack of 50 so you can keep it in your purse or bathroom. My only complaint is that the cloth tears easily when trying to get one out of the packet. They are very moist so the cloths stick together and don&#x27;t want to come out one at a time. Other than that, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy wipes any day.</li>
            <li> I was excited after reading the reviews. But...After a few uses, the wipes gave me a rash. I went to the doctor and she said that some wipes, especially scented or perfumed products, can cause irritation to skin. Just be careful. I wish they had a small size or trial size so I could have tested it.</li>
            <li> nothing special - but they do the trick.</li>
            <li> I love having these in every bathroom, and they&#x27;re handy enough to travel with. This had better ingredients than the store-bought stuff, so it was an easy call. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Just received my LADYGROOMER Wipes.  They are fresh and soft and leave you feeling clean!  Love them!!  Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I love these wipes so much, I felt compelled! I travel a lot, and these wipes keep me fresh and clean on the go.  The scent is amazing, and I love that they are flushable.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and these wipes are gentle on my skin. Thanks, Ladygroomer!</li>
            <li> too thin, you know what happens then, tear easily, thus a stinky finger, and getting out of package is just not worth the effort. if just using the product is more work than its promised goal just get something different. Besides, opening the package makes a unique noise that is loud, so much for  discreteness.</li>
            <li> These woman wipes are great because their not overly &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34;, easy to carry, and are perfect for women who workout a lot. I use them for all of those in between moments... from the gym to shopping or work. I would recommend these wipes to all my female friends. My only concern is the way they close... could be a little less cumbersome. Great value... would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not use them as much as I expected (300 is a lot...), but they smell nice and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about these at all.  These are basically wet wipes for use in your personal hygiene in the restroom.  They would probably be nice to keep in your purse though for traveling so that you had them available for use in public restrooms.  Thought of that just as I was typing...great idea.</li>
            <li> My mom needed a more sensitive alternative to the Cottonelle flushable wet wipes and these fit the bill splendidly.  They don&#x27;t rip when you pull them from the pouch, they have an inoffensive, light scent, and they are great for sensitive bums and fannies.</li>
            <li> very nice for a clean up!</li>
            <li> these woman wipes are a necessity!  i am a wipe fanatic and love these.  i really like the fresh scent and they have a nice, sealable lid that keeps them from drying out.  the wipes feel very soft.  great item.</li>
            <li> They are too hard to separate and often times end up pulling out more than one or tearing them.  They are expensive.  You have to take the cover off if you want to use them in a dispencer.</li>
