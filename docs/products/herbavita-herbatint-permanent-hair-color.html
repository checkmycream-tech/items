            <li>Love, love, Love this hair color product!</li>
            <li>Does the job easily and nice colors.</li>
            <li>As the process went on, he was more into it.</li>
            <li>my hair is feeling (and looking) better and better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the shine that the product produces on my hair, but I should have gone a shade lighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled healthy hair color and Herbatint came up.  </li>
            <li>So, I bought one more box to do just roots this time.</li>
            <li>, I get so many</li>
            <li>About to order some more.</li>
            <li>My hair was much better before I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this productâ€¦</li>
            <li>It really looks good.  </li>
            <li>The color is true and \\&quot;real\\&quot; and I can go 6-8 wks between coloring because it does not fade!</li>
            <li>But what an easy fix to go ignored.</li>
            <li>The Herbatint haircolour is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used it over the 6N and it seemed to lighten it just fine.  </li>
            <li>I only use it every couple of months &amp; find it easy to apply &amp; great results.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and healthy!</li>
            <li>Therefore, 8N - \\&quot;Light Blonde\\&quot; is actually a \\&quot;true blonde\\&quot; color.  </li>
            <li>It looks amazing and completely cover my gray hair.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again and hope the price stays good too.</li>
            <li>The color itself is good but the name of the color is totally off.  </li>
            <li>and it seems just right, a light brown.  </li>
            <li>It was actually a very pretty ash.</li>
            <li>By the time my hair was dry he loved the color</li>
            <li>Love this -- safe and covers grey</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite box color...</li>
            <li>This works far better.</li>
            <li>but after I got used to it, it looks much more natural.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for nearly a year now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the upside; my hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I mix this with the 7N for just the right color for me.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I did not think so at first.  </li>
            <li>When I applied the color to roots first ..waited 20 minutes then applied the rest to the ends...</li>
            <li>I love the lack of chemical smell and sting I got from the regular store-bought brands.  </li>
            <li>Close to my natural light auburn brown I guess would be the color.</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner that came with it as instructed and had more than enough.</li>
            <li>Light blonde is very ashy light brown.  </li>
            <li>I have shorter hair and the have enough product to do 1-2 more times.  </li>
            <li>The color stays amazing well for 4-5 weeks, and after the application my hair is left very soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I love Herbatint &amp; 8N-Light Blonde is a very natural look.</li>
            <li>Light blonde</li>
            <li>I wanted to get away from heavy-chemical coloring and came across Herbatint after much searching.    </li>
            <li>N series covers gray very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought the 8N which is a light blonde</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real price saver.  </li>
            <li>and I did not get much coverage with the dye.</li>
            <li>In general by going into more natural (less store bought products and more homemade stuff)</li>
            <li>I always mix 1 box of Light Blond and 1 box of dark golden blond and</li>
            <li>If I had a big contrast between my true color &amp; Herbatint, then I would probably have to color at 4-6 wks.      </li>
            <li>The box was burned on the inside and the hair color gel was much much thicker than normal.</li>
            <li>But it leaves a beautiful color that lasts just as long as Wella and other traditional coloring products.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing around 50% or maybe even more, and this product covered all and blended with my previously chemically treated color and highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light smell and did NOT dry out my dry hair.</li>
            <li>but If I change color later ...I can at least feel good about the condition of it.  </li>
            <li>The odor is very soft, almost none.</li>
            <li>I put the haircolor on that spot first and left it on the longest, but still did not get the coverage I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I got the hang of it, there was no mess involved!</li>
            <li>I.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the texture and</li>
            <li>So, I order it direct and save.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft.  </li>
            <li>It covers as well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>My natural color is med brown hair</li>
            <li>My stylist was surprised it was color-from-a-box.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and does not stink.  </li>
            <li>herbatint shampoo first and then apply the coloring to dry hair.</li>
            <li>Like because there is no harsh content, all natural and gentle and covers grey.</li>
            <li>European hair color descriptions are different from American and they describe 8N as a light blonde color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>well however, I have to admit I was so nervous I rinsed it out a little early and should have left it on the full amount of time - next time I will.</li>
            <li>I was told that I should get 2 shades lighter than the color I actually want, so I bought the light blonde hoping my hair would come out dark blonde.</li>
            <li>I use this brand for a long time, so nothing new here.</li>
            <li>This particular shade does not cover gray as well or seems to last as long as 7N shade.</li>
            <li>I first used 6N which is called dark blonde, I would have called it medium brown.  </li>
            <li>color is natural and long</li>
            <li>(my true color IS blonde, but my roots are dull &amp; mousy and beginning to gray).  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural and didn&#x27;t have an odor at all, unlike all the other colors that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> I am a natural blonde and all the other brands that I have tried make my hair turn red.  </li>
            <li> not sure of how much gray I have now,</li>
            <li> Maybe I left the dye in for too long (1 hour).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover all of the grey, but it covers pretty well; and I like that the ingredients aren&#x27;t as harsh as other haircolors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no way near as harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> The color lasts just as long</li>
            <li> not sure I can do it myself next time, but not because it is difficult to use, I&#x27;m just not very capable when it comes to doing things with my hair in the back, but I may just do the top and sides, which is what I see anyways.</li>
            <li> Because this color has two bottles inside the box, I mixed only half of each.</li>
            <li> believe how many times they got the color wrong!  </li>
            <li> No more burning scalp and the color looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t ever go back to salon coloring which is frightfully expensive, very time consuming and</li>
            <li> it seems to be doing what i expected...</li>
            <li> started to dry and style and it lighted a little</li>
            <li> I admit I was nervous after reading some reviews about how dark it would be</li>
            <li> Trying to cut down on products loaded with chemical preservatives and whatever manufacturers throw in.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help to tone down and keep my 1&amp;#34; roots from being so</li>
            <li> almost black.  </li>
            <li> I will have black hair.  </li>
            <li> I have stubborn grey hair on my side-burn area and I have a hard time getting any color to take there including this one.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now dull and dry.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you are looking for less harsh alternatives to hair coloring.</li>
            <li> This is a little darker than&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Trying to cut down on products loaded with chemical preservatives and whatever manufacturers throw in. But I&#x27;ve always colored my hair in a salon, so I asked my guy if he would agree to use Herbatint instead of whatever he uses regularly. After warning me that he can&#x27;t guarantee results, he went for it.&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning he behave like he didn&#x27;t care for it, but as he mixed the 2 bottles and saw the forming gel, he started to like it. As the process went on, he was more into it. By the time my hair was dry he loved the color and so did I.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the texture and how the hair felt, I give it \\&quot;good to go\\&quot;. In general by going into more natural (less store bought products and more homemade stuff) my hair is feeling (and looking) better and better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure of how much gray I have now, but I&#x27;m guessing around 50% or maybe even more, and this product covered all and blended with my previously chemically treated color and highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I can do it myself next time, but not because it is difficult to use, I&#x27;m just not very capable when it comes to doing things with my hair in the back, but I may just do the top and sides, which is what I see anyways.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is easy to use and you get good results.  The cost is actually cheaper that if I bought it locally.  I have tried to buy it in local health food stores and they have to order it also.  So, I order it direct and save.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and healthy!</li>
            <li> This is really good hair color. Hair is soft.  Looks very natural and didn&#x27;t have an odor at all, unlike all the other colors that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very good no smell at all... nice color as I was expecting. Thank you very much. I will definitely buy again and hope the price stays good too.</li>
            <li> Really love this product!!! The odor is very soft, almost none. I can&#x27;t use regular colors because my asthma. I mix it with platinum blonde. It looks amazing and completely cover my gray hair. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the shine that the product produces on my hair, but I should have gone a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> This was my perfect color.....I did not think so at first.  When I did the test color (one small strip of hair) it looked a tad bit darker than my over processed blond hair.  I thought this would help to tone down and keep my 1&amp;#34; roots from being so pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to get away from bleaches as they were ruining my hair.  My last frost job left me with horrible looking dry hair and breakage plus set me back $100.  I was afraid I would be bald in about a week.  eventually my hair started to look like hair again however my roots had grown out about an inch and I was looking pretty bad,.  It was time to make a decision.  Color ...or go back to the salon and pay to hate my hair.  Hummm  what should I do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled healthy hair color and Herbatint came up.  I checked amazon and there it was.  I thought I would give it a try and at least tone down my hair without stripping it and camouflage the roots.  When I applied the color to roots first ..waited 20 minutes then applied the rest to the ends...I had just enough product.  My hair is just below the  shoulder.  I keep looking in the mirror and it turned very dark...almost black.  I thought OMG..I will have black hair.  After the 10 minutes I rinsed and it did look soooo dark.&lt;br /&gt;I started to dry and style and it lighted a little however did not look at all the color I bought.  Light blonde 8N.  It was actually a very pretty ash. It was the perfect color ..barely lighter than my roots.  No need to worry about that now.  My husband loves it.  says it is my perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit ..this is the healthiest my hair has felt after color.  EVER !!  I was going to order the lightest blonde but I think I will stick with this.  At least for now...but If I change color later ...I can at least feel good about the condition of it.  It really looks good.  I am very impressed !!!!!!</li>
            <li> very good hair color product. Does the job easily and nice colors.</li>
            <li> I love Herbatint &amp; 8N-Light Blonde is a very natural look. I only use it every couple of months &amp; find it easy to apply &amp; great results.</li>
            <li> I mix this with the 7N for just the right color for me.  I love the lack of chemical smell and sting I got from the regular store-bought brands.  It covers as well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> No more burning scalp and the color looks so natural.  This coupled with Wen products yields a head of hair I&#x27;m proud of.</li>
            <li> I admit I was nervous after reading some reviews about how dark it would be but, I combined the 5R, 5M, and 8N and got the perfect color. Close to my natural light auburn brown I guess would be the color. Covered gray well however, I have to admit I was so nervous I rinsed it out a little early and should have left it on the full amount of time - next time I will. I have shoulder length hair and have enough for another color in several months when needed. Very light smell and did NOT dry out my dry hair. I used the conditioner that came with it as instructed and had more than enough.</li>
            <li> Comes with no brush, no bowl to mix in. Color is good. Probably will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It has been over a month. My natural color is med brown hair and I used 8N, it turned my hair into golden brown happy color, I got so many compliments! Color lasts, does not wash off. So, I bought one more box to do just roots this time. I also bought a set of bawl and brush. Now, I am all set. Because this color has two bottles inside the box, I mixed only half of each. So I can use one box for two root touch ups. I am hooked now ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from heavy-chemical coloring and came across Herbatint after much searching.    This gives a wonderful fully-dimentional color.    FYI:  Herbatint is made in Italy and European standards for color are darker than American.  Therefore, 8N - \\&quot;Light Blonde\\&quot; is actually a \\&quot;true blonde\\&quot; color.  And 7N \\&quot;blonde\\&quot;  is border-line Brown.     The color is true and \\&quot;real\\&quot; and I can go 6-8 wks between coloring because it does not fade! (my true color IS blonde, but my roots are dull &amp; mousy and beginning to gray).  If I had a big contrast between my true color &amp; Herbatint, then I would probably have to color at 4-6 wks.      My stylist was surprised it was color-from-a-box.  She was really impressed with it.  Use a good shampoo &amp; conditioner to maintian healthy hair.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m poor and cant afford to get my hair done at the salon when it needs it I always cheat with Herbatint. My hair feels and looks completely different when I use this as compared to drug store brands. It&#x27;s no way near as harsh or drying. The color lasts just as long and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or irritate my scalp, the difference is amazing! I always mix 1 box of Light Blond and 1 box of dark golden blond and the color always turns out beautiful, I get so many compliments;o) This is by far my favorite box color...hands down! Buy it, your hair WILL ty;o)</li>
            <li> About to order some more. I use it exclusively now, and don&#x27;t use dyes any longer. This works far better.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this stuff for several years and it even covers the gray in my beard.  I&#x27;d have gone 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the horrible customer service line.  We called to ask a question and their CSR was just bad.      Of course, you don&#x27;t color your hair with customer service.  But what an easy fix to go ignored.</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever!  I am a natural blonde and all the other brands that I have tried make my hair turn red.  This is a little darker than&lt;br /&gt;I usually use, but after I got used to it, it looks much more natural.  My hair is soft and shiny and does not stink.  It also does not&lt;br /&gt;dry out your hair.  Give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and on tine delivery.  I  will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I like the color. It doesn&#x27;t cover all of the grey, but it covers pretty well; and I like that the ingredients aren&#x27;t as harsh as other haircolors.</li>
            <li> I use this brand for a long time, so nothing new here. Like because there is no harsh content, all natural and gentle and covers grey. I was buying it in WF and it&#x27;s more expensive there. I like this price...</li>
            <li> My hair was much better before I used this product.  Light blonde is very ashy light brown.  I will never buy this again and since I bought two I hope I can get my money back.  My hair is now dull and dry.  I have never given a product a rating like this one.  I will give it one thing.... didn&#x27;t smell badly.  No bottle given to mix chemicals in either.</li>
            <li> This product was defective.  The box was burned on the inside and the hair color gel was much much thicker than normal. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize this until it was too late to return the items.  I tried to contact Herbatint using the contact button on their website, but the email keeps coming back as undeliverable.  So I&#x27;m leery about buying this product again.</li>
            <li> The color itself is good but the name of the color is totally off.  Definitely get a lighter color than you think you need.</li>
            <li> Love this -- safe and covers grey</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you are looking for less harsh alternatives to hair coloring. This particular shade does not cover gray as well or seems to last as long as 7N shade.</li>
            <li> On-time delivery and meet my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have used this for nearly a year now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The color is natural and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8N is a medium to light brown on my hair and it looks wonderful. European hair color descriptions are different from American and they describe 8N as a light blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;The N series covers gray very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have saved a lot of money by coloring my hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever go back to salon coloring which is frightfully expensive, very time consuming and you&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t believe how many times they got the color wrong!  Not to mention all those chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use herbatint shampoo first and then apply the coloring to dry hair. I do think I got the best results that way even though the instructions say not to wash your hair first.  If you have hairspray, gels, etc. in your hair they are going to interfere with the ability of the hair to absorb the herbatint.</li>
            <li> The Herbatint haircolour is easy to use. I first used 6N which is called dark blonde, I would have called it medium brown.  I read a review that said to use 2 shades lighter than the color you want.  I bought the 8N which is a light blonde and it seems just right, a light brown.  I used it over the 6N and it seemed to lighten it just fine.  I like the Herbatint, it holds the color well between root touchups/coloring.  I have stubborn grey hair on my side-burn area and I have a hard time getting any color to take there including this one.  I put the haircolor on that spot first and left it on the longest, but still did not get the coverage I was hoping for.  The rest of my grays colored beautifully.  I have shorter hair and the have enough product to do 1-2 more times.  That&#x27;s a real price saver.  I will use this product again.  The company delivered quickly and the package was in great shape.</li>
            <li> i had never used it before. it seems to be doing what i expected...</li>
            <li> I like knowing that the hair product is not filled with chemicals.  The color stays amazing well for 4-5 weeks, and after the application my hair is left very soft and very manageable. I like that there is enough for two applications too.  I am so glad I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, Love this hair color product! I had to change over from Wella brand to Herbatint when I was diagnosed as having Iron Oxide contact allergies.  I was skeptical.  But it leaves a beautiful color that lasts just as long as Wella and other traditional coloring products.  And my hair is actually softer that before.  My beautician was amazed at the improvement!</li>
            <li> I love this productâ€¦.once I got the hang of it, there was no mess involved! Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought herbatint because of all the great reviews. I was told that I should get 2 shades lighter than the color I actually want, so I bought the light blonde hoping my hair would come out dark blonde. Well, my hair is now a reddish-copper color. I had brown hair and I had never dyed my hair before. Maybe I left the dye in for too long (1 hour). I also had a few grays and I did not get much coverage with the dye. On the upside; my hair feels soft and healthy. There was no scalp irritation.</li>
