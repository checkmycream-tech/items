            <li>Look cheap.</li>

            <li>I am giving this 5 stars because the quality of the product is good and because I like the little bonus hand roller.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, the color is not what is shown in the photographs.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>WHICH ALL THESE MEAN A GREAT DEAL</li>
            <li>It is more of a hot pink color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, hard to find and seems effective so far!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works really well especially with cream/ lotions.</li>
            <li>I liked the little bonus massager as well.</li>
            <li>The little roller was nice on the bottom of my feet</li>
            <li>very  nice&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used this product</li>
            <li>For people with very sensitive skin, Iâ€™d recommend wearing a glove.</li>
            <li>Omg wow! 2</li>
            <li>I love the roller when I am treating skin dry or have smaller areas like the back of my arms.</li>
            <li>2- the big massager really hurts when you massage because to break cellulite</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin please beware.</li>
            <li>For the price I can&#x27;t complain because treatments to fix my problems would cost at least 100 times more than this massager.</li>
            <li>I use the massager in the shower, it&#x27;s a little more cooperative there due to the slip I get from my soap/shower gel.</li>
            <li>I will definitely have to get back on the search for a decent mitt.</li>
            <li>So far I only used it on one leg because I wanted to see the difference</li>
            <li>This one is small enough and comfortable enough to use on my arms and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> main massager is neither too soft nor too hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> I havenâ€™t used it long enough to observe definite results in cellulite reduction.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the roller I pressed fairly hard and ended up with bruises all over my thighs.</li>
            <li> WHICH IS FLAT</li>
            <li> I have used this only a few times so far</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for long</li>
            <li> a little bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> I cannot comment about durability in wet conditions.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> My trouble zone is just under my butt on the upper part of the thigh.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it doesnâ€™t need electricity, and it is small enough to pack with me when traveling.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> ,I USE ALOT OF PRESSURE BREAKING DOWN</li>
            <li> do find it a bit hard on the top surface of my hand, but it is not too bad.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is quite severe, so it would take a while, but I do notice slight improvement and smoothing in the dimples, which gives me hope that with prolonged use it would be beneficial.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite nor am I a heavy person</li>
            <li> but I stopped after a few nights of rubbing my legs with this.</li>
            <li> I use it with a cellulite/slimming cream, otherwise its a bit harsh on the skin, but with the cream is almost like a massage.</li>
            <li> The round massager also works well</li>
            <li> Third, the little roller is practically useless.</li>
            <li> I also would recommend using with a massage oil or cream because it does not glide for me unless I am applying my moisturizer or heavily lathered with a thick layer of soap.</li>
            <li> I MEAN IT</li>
            <li> I used it a few times but it was cold out and always shad lots of clothes on....</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Stupid impulse buy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved this so much for my stomach and my thighs. I love to do this after a shower :) or after a workout . Arrived quickly and just as described . Great price too</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month. Haven&#x27;t seen any difference. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> It is a simple, inexpensive device but with regular use it can add to improvement in cellulite. I like the fact that it doesnâ€™t need electricity, and it is small enough to pack with me when traveling. I liked the little bonus massager as well. This one is small enough and comfortable enough to use on my arms and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main massager is neither too soft nor too hard on my skin. You control the pressure with your hand. I have never used in in the shower, so I cannot comment about durability in wet conditions. I only use it after shower to massage skin tightening gel or cream; it works well for that purpose. According to instructions it could be used with or without gel or cream, and it should be effective in reduction of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find it a bit hard on the top surface of my hand, but it is not too bad. For people with very sensitive skin, Iâ€™d recommend wearing a glove. It feels fine on my legs and buttocks. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to observe definite results in cellulite reduction. My cellulite is quite severe, so it would take a while, but I do notice slight improvement and smoothing in the dimples, which gives me hope that with prolonged use it would be beneficial.</li>
            <li> I do not feel these items made any difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> Really nice for massaging. I use to help with my skin tone. Hoping to lessen some of the cellulite before I have to be in a bathing suit :)&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s super nice for after putting on lotion and to massage you thighs and butt! I&#x27;ve been working out so this helps relieve the pain! The little roller was nice on the bottom of my feet</li>
            <li> I will give it 3 stars even thought I think it deserves 2- the big massager really hurts when you massage because to break cellulite you have to press but unless you put a TON of cream it will just leave you in pain. I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite nor am I a heavy person but if you have sensitive skin please beware. I will keep using it but it does hurt especially if your lotion dries!</li>
            <li> It is helping :)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the roller it came with</li>
            <li> Gave to daughter to use n she likes it.</li>
            <li> Seriously a great product! I have tried numerous methods to try and reduce my cellulite as much as possible. Nothing has given me results as good as this. I use the mitt in the shower, the roller after. After just one week, my problem area (back of thighs) has improved INCREDIBLY. I am  overjoyed and extremely satisfied with this product. Trust me ladies, it works!</li>
            <li> I bought it, thinking I would use it but I stopped after a few nights of rubbing my legs with this. Lots of effort for no results. Stupid impulse buy.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this product. First, the color is not what is shown in the photographs. It is more of a hot pink color. Second, it arrived having been opened and used before. Third, the little roller is practically useless. I will definitely have to get back on the search for a decent mitt.</li>
            <li> I like this.  The small roller is great.</li>
            <li> stopped using. doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Yay! It works! I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> better than I expect~</li>
            <li> great products. I love the roller when I am treating skin dry or have smaller areas like the back of my arms. Massager brush is comfortable, easy to get a good grip and big enough that you can do what you want to do fast. Seems well made.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast! I am enjoying this product so much, thanks Shessentials!!!</li>
            <li> I am giving this 5 stars because the quality of the product is good and because I like the little bonus hand roller.  That said, I am never 100% sold on the idea that these things reduce cellulite-- but we will see! I am using this with a retinol cream</li>
            <li> works good, I have never used any others before so I can&#x27;t compare it.</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Look cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take some time to know whether this works.</li>
            <li> I just bought this Monday received it Tuesday and LOVED it by Friday ! I use the handle at my gym ( mid day ) and I use the bigger one at home after my shower at night. So far I only used it on one leg because I wanted to see the difference and I can proudly say WOW this morning I could not believe the difference in my two legs after only three days ! I will start doing both legs today ! I use it with a Neiva Cellulite cream and a Walmart brand cream like Neivas. The Neiva cream I use mid day and the Walmart cream I use at night. I think the creams in total cost me 20 bucks. This was a great buy !</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful I use it in the shower followed by the cellulitencream I feel a difference already!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works really well especially with cream/ lotions. I would recommend anyone!!</li>
            <li> Omg wow! 2 uses and I start to see a difference already? Amazing! for the price? EVEN BETTER! I use it with a cellulite/slimming cream, otherwise its a bit harsh on the skin, but with the cream is almost like a massage. I cannot wait for the long-term results!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for long but I love the roller. It&#x27;s easy to use, hard to find and seems effective so far! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort. I am a massage therapist this item is flimsy.</li>
            <li> very  nice&lt;br /&gt;but a little bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used this product Like I thought I would. Better for me to stick to a lotion.</li>
            <li> I have only started using this, so the verdict is still out. With that being said, I do see how this could be effective. I use the massager in the shower, it&#x27;s a little more cooperative there due to the slip I get from my soap/shower gel. I get out and apply my cellulite cream thereafter. I will update with results as soon as I see some.</li>
            <li> Noticed the differences in the third use. I recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I used it a few times but it was cold out and always shad lots of clothes on....so now that it&#x27;s warmer, maybe I&#x27;ll actually use it.</li>
            <li> IM NOT A BIG GIRL IM 5 &#x60;10 145 lbs BUT MY BODY IS MY TEMPLE AND I&#x27;VE DECIDED TO RID IT OF ANYTHING UNDESIRABLE I DO HAVE CELLULITE AND STRETCH MARKS FROM MY WEIGHT FLUCTUATIONS,I DIDN&#x27;T BUY ANYTHING TO USE IT WITH SO I USE GRAPE OIL ON MY STOMACH WHICH IS FLAT BUT I REALIZED IT WAS GOOD FOR MY INTESTINES AS I USE THE RESTROOM  QUITE EASILY  AFTER USING IT GIVING A PUSH TO WHATEVER NEEDED IT THEN I USE IT ON MY BOOTY MY THIGHS MY UPPER ARMS EVEN AND YES IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  ITS LIKE A PART OF ME FITS PERFECT IN THE PALM OF MY HAND ,I USE ALOT OF PRESSURE BREAKING DOWN THE FAT TURNING IT INTO MUSCLE MY ARMS ARE SMALLER MY THIGHS NOT DIMPLY LOOKING MY BUTT IS LOOKING GOOD,ALL I USE IS THIS SET AND GRAPE SEED OIL I LOVE THE CIRCULATION ROLLER I USE IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY,THERE&#x27;S ALSO THE GUARANTEE BUT AFTER YOU GET THIS YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED AS ITS STRONG AND WELL WORTH MORE AND THE BIG NAMES I KNOW ARE GOOD BECAUSE THEY HOLD UP THAT NAME BUT LADIES IF YOU HAVE HEALTH CONCERNS ESPECIALLY WITH CIRCULATION DONT WAIT I MEAN IT HASNT ONLY HELPED WITH VANITY BUT VERY MUCH WITH CIRCULATION AND BEING ABLE TO NOT FEEL CONSTIPATED ALWAYS WHICH ALL THESE MEAN A GREAT DEAL,THERES NOTHING TO LOSE AND DONT TOSS THE ROLLER IT WORKS LADIES. THANK YOU AND AMAZON AS ALWAYZ</li>
            <li> I have used this only a few times so far but it seems to be making a difference. My trouble zone is just under my butt on the upper part of the thigh. I find the best time to use this is  after bathing while having leisure time, r&amp;r, watching TV. I also would recommend using with a massage oil or cream because it does not glide for me unless I am applying my moisturizer or heavily lathered with a thick layer of soap. Too time consuming to use in the shower for me. For the price I can&#x27;t complain because treatments to fix my problems would cost at least 100 times more than this massager.</li>
            <li> Great product! The first time I used the roller I pressed fairly hard and ended up with bruises all over my thighs. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all but it was bruised. The round massager also works well but I needed to make sure there was plenty of lotion otherwise it pulls the skin. Can&#x27;t beat the price on these items! It does appear to be working on toning my skin as well</li>
