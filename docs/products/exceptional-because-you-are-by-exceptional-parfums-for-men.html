            <li>Highly recommended for the guy who likes to smell great all day!</li>
            <li>but what good is it if it disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, but it fades and smells very good.</li>
            <li>I smells great for the first 30 minutes</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would of gave it 4 stars if this cologne was more appropriately price for what it is.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, it started off with a sample vial i received and from there i&#x27;d been wanting to get my hands on this for like ever....</li>
            <li>WE haven&#x27;t been able to smell it on him</li>
            <li>love it and so does my women</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy to try if you want something that&#x27;s exceptional for just about any occasion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great smelling cologne to any guy.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a very special man.  </li>
            <li>This item is exactly what it says,  Exceptional.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this for several months, with some very good reactions.</li>
            <li>I have to like a scent to be comfortable with it, but I&#x27;ve also received many compliments from the ladies at work and from others whom I&#x27;ve dated.</li>
            <li>Although this cologne isnt exactly unique its pretty good.</li>
            <li>great smell love it wish it was a bigger  bottle for the money</li>
            <li>Luckily the nightmare was over in about 90 minutes!</li>
            <li>Received in 2 days with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It has an exceptionally semi-spice with a bitter kind of twist.</li>
            <li>There are many other GOOD fragrances you can get for this price.</li>
            <li>If I purchased this cologne at full price, I would be upset.</li>
            <li>Its a bit sweet, but women seem to like it and so do I.</li>
            <li>it has a light enough fragrance that when you walk in the room you don&#x27;t overpower everyone, but it has a very nice LIGHT scent that last&#x27;s for the endurance of your event.</li>
            <li>Please send me deals when available thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s muddy pooh-water in a spray bottle, it&#x27;s just cheap, synthetic and very overpriced.</li>
            <li>IMHO this would be worth it if the price was about $30.</li>
            <li>Like I said, this is worth about 15</li>
            <li>The bottle doesn&#x27;t look like much, looks very plain but the smell is very good.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong manly smell to it and It stays on for a long time as well.</li>
            <li>Longevity also seems mediocre at best (about 5 hours on my skin).</li>
            <li>Actually have one to father and will need some more soon...</li>
            <li>A real winner!</li>
            <li>and I received several compliments about it, so my favorite still my Bleu de Channel.</li>
            <li>My current favorite.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE FRAGRANCE VERY MUCH AND WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN</li>
            <li>It even has a positive aromatherapy effect.</li>
            <li>My wife loves its subtle, sexy essence so much so that we snuggle and cuddle more often.</li>
            <li>It would appear that the house just threw a whole bunch of notes in a bottle and added some urine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pinpoint what it is about the smell,but it has an original smell that isnt too sweet and not spicy,it&#x27;s hard to compare ,i would recommend this to anyone wanting to smell like a clean man..</li>
            <li>Perhaps the name is ironical, I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I WAS VERY EXCITED.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a nice scent for a change up from the usual Polo or John Varvatos.  </li>
            <li>My fiance loves it and it was a decent price.</li>
            <li>Its not what I expected its almost the same as Ed hardy love and luck</li>
            <li>The opening blast is a little strong but dissipates after about 7-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>i have LESS than zero regrets about getting this for my boyfriend - it smells AMAZING and as soon as he runs out</li>
            <li>You put it on early in the evening and by the time you are at your party, restaurant, whatever, it is undetectable.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a little pricy, as a lot of new colognes are, but this is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who cares how they feel about being around the general public.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last me forever, and I use it frequently...</li>

            <li> Fragrance don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The cologne doesn&#x27;t last as long as we&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> is not exactly what I expected, I have been using it for couple weeks in my Job and nobody noticed that I&#x27;m using a new parfum,&lt;br /&gt;before</li>
            <li> Ive only used this a few times so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely something you could wear to somewhere formal, but because it&#x27;s not too strong, nor too soft, you could wear this on a casual day, maybe even with a few compliments.</li>
            <li> LONG LASTING.I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> All day long cologne.</li>
            <li> it deserves each single dollar paid on it .</li>
            <li> I want to point out that the samples seem a little stronger than the actual 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> So if you want try this other than the samples you are stuck buying this size.</li>
            <li> The base and middle notes are fine.</li>
            <li> Projection is average on me.</li>
            <li> What sucks to is only size can be found and its the 3.4 Oz.</li>
            <li> projection is average.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this stuff to anyone because it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s another thing to price this at such a ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li> I will probably have this cologne for a long while but at least for now i dont plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> The cologne is a little on the pricey side seen that it doesnt comes from a designer perfume house.</li>
            <li> All of which I use in my usual rotation as well.</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECEIVED THE SMALL BOTTLE OF THIS PARFUM</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> $ is absurd</li>
            <li> The odor extremely crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that this fragrance necessarily stinks.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY skeptical and indecisive because you can&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li> I kid you not, it&#x27;s THAT bad!</li>
            <li> This may be the worst smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of putting my nose on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LIKE EXCEPTIONAL... IT&#x27;S LONG LASTING.I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I REALLY LIKE THE FRAGRANCE VERY MUCH AND WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this great smelling cologne to any guy. It,s must have and you  must try it to believe it. Rated By Buyer Ricky R.</li>
            <li> I love it. The odor extremely crazy. I evaluate it to be one of the best 5 fragrances i have bought it in my whole life . it deserves each single dollar paid on it .</li>
            <li> Fragrance don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Although this cologne isnt exactly unique its pretty good. I feel like i have smelled something like this before. The opening blast is a little strong but dissipates after about 7-8 minutes. The base and middle notes are fine. Projection is average on me. Longevity also seems mediocre at best (about 5 hours on my skin). The cologne is a little on the pricey side seen that it doesnt comes from a designer perfume house. Nothing ground breaking here folks. What sucks to is only size can be found and its the 3.4 Oz. So if you want try this other than the samples you are stuck buying this size. I would of gave it 4 stars if this cologne was more appropriately price for what it is. I would say price should be in the $25-$30 range. I will probably have this cologne for a long while but at least for now i dont plan on buying it again. Unless i start getting a bunch of compliments. Ive only used this a few times so far. My 2 sisters seem to like it though. You could probably use this at work since it&#x27;s projection is average. I want to point out that the samples seem a little stronger than the actual 3.4 oz bottle. IMHO this would be worth it if the price was about $30.</li>
            <li> The scent, of course, is a matter of opinion (I like it).  The service I received was as promised, and I was very happy with this transaction.  This bottle will last me forever, and I use it frequently...</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance!  I&#x27;d buy it again.  Its a nice scent for a change up from the usual Polo or John Varvatos.  All of which I use in my usual rotation as well.</li>
            <li> I won this same bottle at a raffle. If I purchased this cologne at full price, I would be upset. I smells great for the first 30 minutes then it&#x27;s gone. I would not recommend this stuff to anyone because it is not worth the price. I like the scent but what good is it if it disappears very quickly. You put it on early in the evening and by the time you are at your party, restaurant, whatever, it is undetectable. It&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Actually have one to father and will need some more soon... Please send me deals when available thanks</li>
            <li> A wonderful scent, lovely. Its a bit sweet, but women seem to like it and so do I. It even has a positive aromatherapy effect.</li>
            <li> This may be the worst smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of putting my nose on. This was sent to me as a sample when I ordered a bottle of Creed Aventus from FragranceNet. I made the mistake of actually testing it on my skin. It would appear that the house just threw a whole bunch of notes in a bottle and added some urine. I kid you not, it&#x27;s THAT bad! Luckily the nightmare was over in about 90 minutes! There are many other GOOD fragrances you can get for this price. I will never purchase another product from FragranceNet again unless they promise not to insult me by sending me another sample of this ungodly juice. I wouldn&#x27;t even wear this if I was 13 and going on a date. I&#x27;d rather wear Axe!</li>
            <li> Its not what I expected its almost the same as Ed hardy love and luck I think that the perfume exceptional is better than the cologne</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what it says,  Exceptional.  it has a light enough fragrance that when you walk in the room you don&#x27;t overpower everyone, but it has a very nice LIGHT scent that last&#x27;s for the endurance of your event.</li>
            <li> Always scrolling through reviews? Then you see that one that gets you to buy the product. I hope this is it. This cologne is a little pricy, as a lot of new colognes are, but this is worth the buy. Anytime I look at any cologne online I am VERY skeptical and indecisive because you can&#x27;t smell it and you HAVE to to trust the reviews based on it. Well this cologne is LITERALLY exceptional. It has an exceptionally semi-spice with a bitter kind of twist. It&#x27;s definitely something you could wear to somewhere formal, but because it&#x27;s not too strong, nor too soft, you could wear this on a casual day, maybe even with a few compliments. Definitely worth the buy to try if you want something that&#x27;s exceptional for just about any occasion.</li>
            <li> great smell love it wish it was a bigger  bottle for the money but i would buy it again great</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it started off with a sample vial i received and from there i&#x27;d been wanting to get my hands on this for like ever.... Anyway i get good compliments all the time and i&#x27;m happy with the purchase. All day long cologne.</li>
            <li> i have LESS than zero regrets about getting this for my boyfriend - it smells AMAZING and as soon as he runs out i&#x27;ll be getting it for him again!</li>
            <li> This cologne is really quite exceptional! It has a woodsy, almost musky fragrance that stays. It is clean and smells great! Highly recommended for the guy who likes to smell great all day!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pinpoint what it is about the smell,but it has an original smell that isnt too sweet and not spicy,it&#x27;s hard to compare ,i would recommend this to anyone wanting to smell like a clean man.. it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne</li>
            <li> My fiance loves it and it was a decent price. The cologne doesn&#x27;t last as long as we&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this and omg it smells really good</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very special man.  WE haven&#x27;t been able to smell it on him but I loved the smell of the cologne. SO I hope it smells good on him. And we hope that he likes it too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves its subtle, sexy essence so much so that we snuggle and cuddle more often. A real winner!</li>
            <li> Great item and at a great price.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell like a man should always smell.  You know how many people comment on how great the stuff smells?  I will always have this in my collection.</li>
            <li> My buddy uses it and i always like the way he smells with it.  It seems to also work with my chemistry.  Received in 2 days with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband as a gift and he loved it!. The bottle doesn&#x27;t look like much, looks very plain but the smell is very good. It has a very strong manly smell to it and It stays on for a long time as well.</li>
            <li> It would be one thing if this were 15$.  It&#x27;s another thing to price this at such a ridiculous price.  The list price is around 80$ - Amazon charges 50$.  80$ is absurd and so is 50$.  Like I said, this is worth about 15-20$.  Perhaps the name is ironical, I really don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s not that this fragrance necessarily stinks.  It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s muddy pooh-water in a spray bottle, it&#x27;s just cheap, synthetic and very overpriced.</li>
            <li> is not exactly what I expected, I have been using it for couple weeks in my Job and nobody noticed that I&#x27;m using a new parfum,&lt;br /&gt;before I bought the Bleu de Channel and I received several compliments about it, so my favorite still my Bleu de Channel.</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECEIVED THE SMALL BOTTLE OF THIS PARFUM I WAS VERY EXCITED.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS AN EXCELLENT EAU DE TOILETTE.</li>
            <li> Quality product has a definite acceptable aroma. Highly recommend for anyone who cares how they feel about being around the general public.</li>
            <li> Great smelling colone. My current favorite. My gf loves it.</li>
            <li> i got a sample of this &amp; I liked they way. its doing the job! im thinking about  getting my wife some as well. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> love it and so does my women</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for several months, with some very good reactions. It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, but it fades and smells very good. I have to like a scent to be comfortable with it, but I&#x27;ve also received many compliments from the ladies at work and from others whom I&#x27;ve dated. I actually bought it from fragrance.net where it is similarly priced. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
