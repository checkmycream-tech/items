            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years, and haven&#x27;t found a better hydrating cream.  </li>

            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It is not near as good.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

            <li>they really work!  </li>

            <li>, I have order this cream before and it was more thicker then the one I purchased, not sure why?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little more than a year, recommended by my Dermatologist, because I have acne scar skin and use pure Retinol, which leaves the skin dry.  </li>
            <li>When I use this people think I have a natural glow on my face.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive or allergic try this</li>
            <li>I have congested, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really miffed that they say they are the same because they are not.</li>
            <li>I was looking to buy more, and noticed that everything is out of stock or ridiculously overpriced.  </li>
            <li>I am a 62 yr old female.  </li>
            <li>I found it at Amazon much cheaper than other online stores.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way with this hydrating cream.</li>
            <li> With this mosturizer, my skin never gets dry, it&#x27;s hard to believe I am using Retinol!</li>

            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> I bought it through a spa and it was very expensive</li>

            <li> This cream is not greasy.  If you have dry skin or red skin it will not irriate it.  When I use this people think I have a natural glow on my face.  So if you&#x27;re sensitive or allergic try this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Hint:  to make your face glow even more, dab some of the cream on the cheekbones after you put on makeup..this is where the light hits and it will bring out your cheeks and eyes more.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about three weeks and notice the dry patches are gone.  It is very thick and works well on my skin. No alergies or reactions of any kind. I like the product and will probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this cream at my derm&#x27;s office but they no longer carry it.  $35 is a great price for this wonderfully rich treat when my face feels a little dry.  I actually use it every night after applying Retin A.    CAUTION:  A little goes a long way, so if you use too much, you will feel \\&quot;sticky.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this hydrating cream. My dermatologist recommended it some years ago. Other people in my family have bags under their eyes, but I believe I have avoided this, so far, due to using this cream under my eyes, daily. It&#x27;s gentle, but does a great job!</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon at a reasonable price, however, when I went to purchase the price jumped considerably.  Beware and watch the pricing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a while now and it works well.  It is not a miracle cure, but does moisturize the skin well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little more than a year, recommended by my Dermatologist, because I have acne scar skin and use pure Retinol, which leaves the skin dry.  With this mosturizer, my skin never gets dry, it&#x27;s hard to believe I am using Retinol! I just love this cream and will continue using it, even though is a little expensive, but if you use only at night like I do, it goes for a few months and I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products for oily/acne prone skin.  My dermatologist recommended M.D. Forte and it&#x27;s done wonders to my skin.  The replinishing hydrating cream is really great and you don&#x27;t have to use that much of it.  It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I have previously written glowing reviews of this product, and my opinion of the product itself remains the same.  At 65, my fair, irritation-prone skin is smooth, soft, and virtually wrinkle-free, and I thank MD Forte for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, $225 for a 2-ounce jar, PLUS shipping, is just highway robbery.  Look somewhere else.  This product should run $40 to $50 per jar -- which is expensive enough, already.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  It immediately soaks into my skin and leaves no oily trace and feels wonderful.  I have used it for about 5 years and will continue to use it as long as it is on the market and continues to be the quality product I find it is now.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have congested, sensitive skin and I use this product on an &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; basis, which is usually in the winter while I&#x27;m asleep. I can&#x27;t believe MD Forte is phasing this product out! I&#x27;m upset about it.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers caused my skin to become irritated after awhile.  However, this product has worked great for years.  I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> One of the best! I could say doesn&#x27;t have any smell but at the same time describe it&#x27;s smell like clean... non greasy, wonderful for the face, neck, hands ect. there is only one thing, it doesn&#x27;t last too long, probably because it&#x27;s texture is so thick. I want to make clear even the texture is thick the product never ever leaves a greasy residue over the skin. I would buy it again and will recommed this good product to every body even people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate. This is the best product I have use for moisture on my face (for extreme dryness). The price on amazon is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Speaking for my wife,&amp;#34;Can&#x27;t find a better price for a product I love.&amp;#34; It help&#x27;s to have a nice husband who will order it for me too!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy, it absorbs well, and it sooths your skin. I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> I live in new Orleans and this stuff is to thick and sticky for this climate. I use it for a hand cream and my hands are lookin pretty awesome!  So not a complete loss</li>
            <li> Too bad this was taken off the market...replaced with a new formula which was harsh and ineffective.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream for sensitive skin that I have used since it was&lt;br /&gt;recommended to me by my skin care doctor.  It is nourishing and gentle at the&lt;br /&gt;same time.</li>
            <li> Their replacement product is called Vivete. It is not near as good. I don&#x27;t like the Vivete. I&#x27;m really miffed that they say they are the same because they are not. Junkier product, junkier container, although it is glass which some may like more than the plastic. I&#x27;m just not happy because they don&#x27;t make MD Forte anymore.</li>
            <li> The cream arrived on time as advertised, but cream is very loose in the container, I have order this cream before and it was more thicker then the one I purchased, not sure why?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 months. I havenot seen such a big change so far.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 yr old female.  I started using MD Forte Replenshing Hydratine Cream 7 years ago. I bought it through a spa and it was very expensive but my skin looked great. The spa closed and I started using other brands with some of the same ingredents as MD. I would always end up with irritated skin.  I found MD Forte online and started using it again but it was still expensive.  Went back to other brands..breakouts &amp; irritated skin. Then a friend suggested I try Amazon. I had only bought books on Amazon. I found it at Amazon much cheaper than other online stores. I won&#x27;t stray away again.</li>
            <li> MD Forte has the best products on the market....they really work!  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years, and haven&#x27;t found a better hydrating cream.  Not greasy and non-irritating, but leaves your face feeling hydrated again.  Best price on Amazon.com plus free shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this moisturizer!!  I was looking to buy more, and noticed that everything is out of stock or ridiculously overpriced.  The company&#x27;s website advertises Vivite, and the ingredients for Vivite&#x27;s Replenish Hydrating Cream are the same as MD Forte&#x27;s Replenish Hydrating Cream.  I&#x27;m going to give it a try.  I just wanted to let my fellow MD Forte fans know.</li>
            <li> My Wife &amp; Daughter have used MD Forte Replenishing cream and they both suggest&lt;br /&gt;that The  M.D.Forte product has been chemically altered. It&#x27;s too waxy,leaves  a residue,is not as moisturizing,and is not as absorbent as before. The other&lt;br /&gt;replenishing cream ,Vivite, was also an inferior replacement. Cut quality and&lt;br /&gt;you also cut out your best &amp; most Knowledgeable customers. Sorry! Dollie Deshayes &amp; Arnold Deshayes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This an Amazon verified Purchase</li>
