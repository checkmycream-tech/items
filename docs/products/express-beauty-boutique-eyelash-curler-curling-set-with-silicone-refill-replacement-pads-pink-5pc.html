            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wow, very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li>The grips are nice and sturdy so you are able to handle it the way you need to.</li>
            <li>The curler is well built with a wonderful spring action.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does so much better!,</li>
            <li>Well, I tried and it really makes for beautiful curled lashes.</li>
            <li>Super pretty and very effective!</li>
            <li>my eyelashes were really nice and bold!</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE part of this curler though is that these bend on the backside instead of the front</li>
            <li>Having that many backup pads (and at a lower price point than what you&#x27;ll find at Sephora or the like) is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It looks cute and works wonders.</li>
            <li>I love the color combo.</li>
            <li>I have not found many differences in them except for one part: If they pinch the lashes.</li>
            <li>and I realized the others I have had were all rubber and kind of sticky, these were smooth and almost glossy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Curler is doing great job, it ship really fast</li>
            <li>Stylish design.</li>
            <li>i love this product and i very excited to try this.</li>
            <li>They feel very nice in the hand, and the rounded rubber pads really help keep from getting lashes yanked out.</li>
            <li>pretty good value for price-</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried it once I got the package, The results came out pretty good.. and it comes 5 ext replacement,</li>
            <li>Love it..  thanks for the good products...</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re the type that likes the loops for your fingers or you prefer to have them outside, these will fit your hand perfectly.</li>
            <li>Received this product a couple of days ago and so far it is working great</li>
            <li>Bought for my sister and the report back is that it&#x27;s the best curler she&#x27;s used - it makes her lashes curly, is really nice to use, seems really well made</li>
            <li>I have purchased many eyelash curlers through my years; everything from the cheap ones at the dollar store to the pricier ones at the boutiques.</li>
            <li>The pads are thick and cushy, not hard like most curlers and give a really great shape!</li>
            <li>Made of quality material and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally updated my eye lash curler, and would recommend this one to everyone; the price it is listed at, it is more than fair.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes super curly!</li>
            <li>YES it does make a HUGE difference</li>
            <li>So happy it comes with extra pads</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fantastic as the steel isn&#x27;t going to wear out any time soon</li>
            <li>I have never had any issues with eyelash curlers but this one I couldn&#x27;t fit into my eye.</li>
            <li>I received the product described for free or reduced cost to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>I use a cheap CVS eyelash curler every morning before putting on mascara and using this product this morning made a world of difference.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pinch my eye lids which is important.</li>
            <li>I have been doing a lot of reading about how important eyelash curlers are in a beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Nice, high quality eye lash curlers.</li>
            <li>Worked okay for first couple of uses, but noticed it bending in places it shouldnt have.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I grabbed a discount on this item.</li>
            <li>Too many things seem to be built to be disposable and that&#x27;s a large part of the problem we&#x27;re having with our planet&#x27;s heath.</li>
            <li>It is not painful at all and does not pull on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have used more high end brands and this one tops them all!</li>
            <li>It did come in a really cool package and included the replacement heads ot said it came with.  </li>
            <li>I could not wait to see if it was true and immediately opened it up and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Solid, effective, and structurally sound.</li>
            <li>Coming with 5 refills of the pads, it states boldly that it intends to stay with you a while.</li>
            <li>The fact that they&#x27;re free is good, but the fact that the manufacturer is confident enough that they will last that 5 are included free of charge</li>
            <li>I do not want a product that apparently requires the application of heat it in order to make it effective.</li>
            <li>, I have hardly no lashes and this makes them look alot better and longer.</li>
            <li>The extra cushions are a huge bonus!!</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on your lashes and the seller is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is nice it takes only one time to curl ur eyelash.love it</li>
            <li>and I think it goes great with the black!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them warmed yet, but since the package was sitting outside for a while before I got to it, they were pretty warm when I opened them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple times but is best I have had, no pinching, no problems grabbing all lashes, and it is pretty pink!</li>
            <li>I had bought the most expensive and the cheapest and this on, which is a great price, outshines them all.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the inserts is that they were glossy</li>
            <li>I bought it after reading all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I used t today and its very easy to grip and see where all your lashes are and it doesn&#x27;t tug at my lashes like other curlers.</li>
            <li>I took a pad off to see how easy it was to replace, and it was very simple.</li>
            <li>This curler certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I think for me the head is to large because when I released my lashes it pinched my face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li>The seller was very helpful it refunding my money for this</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look so much longer.</li>
            <li>The bonus pad replacements are a real plus, too.</li>
            <li>was reluctant with this one, but from the comments and the ratings it looked promising.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler works very well</li>
            <li>, it is very sturdy and very well made.  </li>
            <li>The Silicone pads are a really nice touch â€“ especially with 5 extra replacements.  </li>
            <li>I love that this eyelash curler comes with 5 replacement pads as others don&#x27;t come with any replacements which means you either have to search for the right pad or completely buy a new eyelash curler once the original goes out so with the 5 replacements you actually in the long run save money!</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than the average eyelash curler you get in the drug store.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have to worry to buy new one anymore, seller is very considering our buyer&#x27;s needs...</li>
            <li>I really also like the clear plastic that holds them shut when not in use.</li>
            <li>The actual pinch of it is bigger then my old one, but allows for more control.</li>
            <li>When looking for a new eyelash curler, I was in need of an item that would get the job done.</li>
            <li>I have used many eyelash curlers, expensive ones, cheap ones, until I found this one.</li>
            <li>The handle is hard plastic with silicone cushioning where your fingers grip the handles -  very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I could easily curl the inner &amp; center part of my  eyelashes , but not the outer edge.  </li>
            <li>The handles I also really like, they do not hurt your fingers because of how thick they are and definitely easy to use.</li>
            <li>After about the 10th use, it fell completely apart.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>and my eyes really popped after curling prior to applying my mascara.</li>
            <li>A lot of curlers seem to be built to be tossed in a week or two, but these really seem built to last.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler works really well as well and gave my thin short eyelashes a nice curl, with a coat of mascara</li>
            <li>I find this the most annoying thing with the metal kind is that they have a tendency to pinch my lashes</li>
            <li>I only hold it on my lashes for 5 seconds and BOOM amazing long lashes with none sticking to each other!</li>
            <li>The eyelash curler fit both my eyes without any problems which can be a problem with other similar products.</li>
            <li>but I love the little pink touches to it</li>
            <li>I first have to point out how pretty this eyelash curler is; I&#x27;m not a huge fan of pink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some cheap ones in the past and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one!</li>
            <li>Looks very expensive and I paid a good price for it too.</li>
            <li>So glad it came with extra refills as its so hard to find other brands in the store.</li>
            <li>My lashes remain slightly curled for minutes; the moment I apply the eyeliner they are back straight.</li>
            <li>It came with a separate clear Lucite clip that keeps it closed when not in use.  </li>

            <li> I have only used it a couple times but is best I have had, no pinching, no problems grabbing all lashes, and it is pretty pink!</li>
            <li> I had bought the most expensive and the cheapest and this on, which is a great price, outshines them all.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the inserts is that they were glossy</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I used t today and its very easy to grip and see where all your lashes are and it doesn&#x27;t tug at my lashes like other curlers.</li>
            <li> I took a pad off to see how easy it was to replace, and it was very simple.</li>
            <li> This curler certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I think for me the head is to large because when I released my lashes it pinched my face.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li> The seller was very helpful it refunding my money for this</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look so much longer.</li>
            <li> The bonus pad replacements are a real plus, too.</li>
            <li> was reluctant with this one, but from the comments and the ratings it looked promising.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works very well</li>
            <li> , it is very sturdy and very well made.  </li>
            <li> The Silicone pads are a really nice touch â€“ especially with 5 extra replacements.  </li>
            <li> I love that this eyelash curler comes with 5 replacement pads as others don&#x27;t come with any replacements which means you either have to search for the right pad or completely buy a new eyelash curler once the original goes out so with the 5 replacements you actually in the long run save money!</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than the average eyelash curler you get in the drug store.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have to worry to buy new one anymore, seller is very considering our buyer&#x27;s needs...</li>
            <li> I really also like the clear plastic that holds them shut when not in use.</li>
            <li> The actual pinch of it is bigger then my old one, but allows for more control.</li>
            <li> When looking for a new eyelash curler, I was in need of an item that would get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash curlers, expensive ones, cheap ones, until I found this one.</li>
            <li> The handle is hard plastic with silicone cushioning where your fingers grip the handles -  very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I could easily curl the inner &amp; center part of my  eyelashes , but not the outer edge.  </li>
            <li> The handles I also really like, they do not hurt your fingers because of how thick they are and definitely easy to use.</li>
            <li> After about the 10th use, it fell completely apart.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> and my eyes really popped after curling prior to applying my mascara.</li>
            <li> A lot of curlers seem to be built to be tossed in a week or two, but these really seem built to last.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works really well as well and gave my thin short eyelashes a nice curl, with a coat of mascara</li>
            <li> I find this the most annoying thing with the metal kind is that they have a tendency to pinch my lashes</li>
            <li> I only hold it on my lashes for 5 seconds and BOOM amazing long lashes with none sticking to each other!</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler fit both my eyes without any problems which can be a problem with other similar products.</li>
            <li> but I love the little pink touches to it</li>
            <li> I first have to point out how pretty this eyelash curler is; I&#x27;m not a huge fan of pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some cheap ones in the past and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one!</li>
            <li> Looks very expensive and I paid a good price for it too.</li>
            <li> So glad it came with extra refills as its so hard to find other brands in the store.</li>
            <li> My lashes remain slightly curled for minutes; the moment I apply the eyeliner they are back straight.</li>
            <li> It came with a separate clear Lucite clip that keeps it closed when not in use.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never have to buy another one ever again, because this one will last you a long time +</li>
            <li> Costs less than the nearly identical eyelash curlers you&#x27;ll find at makeup boutiques</li>
            <li> so I can use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> says that they will be in your vanity case for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sharp edges on both ends, too long for smaller eyes</li>
            <li> My lashes looked three times as long with this product!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, it&#x27;s spring action operated so it automatically opens after you curl your eyelashes (the unit includes a small sturdy plastic brace to lock it closed for storage and travel).</li>
            <li> My one issue - it is a little too big for my eye shape.  </li>
            <li> Even if you curl with your mascara on, the 5 replacement pads it comes with will last you a few years at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Eyelash curler was delivered as expected and curls my lashes nicely.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and use without the usual awkward feel of a standard type curler.</li>
            <li> Some other brands have done that before.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made.</li>
            <li> it comes with 5 replacement pads, what other curler comes with 5 replacement pads??</li>
            <li> BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY</li>
            <li> I like the curler itself, but I did not receive the replacement pads which kind of sucks :(</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t snag your lashes like some other curlers do!</li>
            <li> Also, the curler arrived slightly bent, tried to correct it with my fingers</li>
            <li> The packaging for this product was sealed tight and nothing was damaged.  </li>
            <li> but the little pads do wear out eventually, fall off, get lost while traveling, and so on.</li>
            <li> Lately have been trying several types because have not liked the way they worked.</li>
            <li> I can at least say that this set doesn&#x27;t perpetuate the disposable society addiction.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is something wrong with my eyelashes, but this curler does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the refills like advertised  sad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just received this and I truly adore it. It is not painful at all and does not pull on my eyelashes. It makes my eyelashes super curly!</li>
            <li> I used this eyelash Curler for a Wedding I did makeup for a couple of days after I recieved them and they work fantastically! Especially when you use the hairdryer to heat it! The pads are thick and cushy, not hard like most curlers and give a really great shape! The extra cushions are a huge bonus!! The handles I also really like, they do not hurt your fingers because of how thick they are and definitely easy to use. My FAVORITE part of this curler though is that these bend on the backside instead of the front so I do not end up pushing the pointed part into my face or those of my clients!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a3f7b500006399b2df2f0253a7c44741]]</li>
            <li> Wow, very impressed with this product! It is definitely a quality eyelash curler. I&#x27;ve had some cheap ones in the past and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one! Made of quality material and easy to use. So happy it comes with extra pads so I can use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Costs less than the nearly identical eyelash curlers you&#x27;ll find at makeup boutiques *and* comes with 5 replacement pads. That&#x27;s fantastic as the steel isn&#x27;t going to wear out any time soon but the little pads do wear out eventually, fall off, get lost while traveling, and so on. Having that many backup pads (and at a lower price point than what you&#x27;ll find at Sephora or the like) is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, it&#x27;s spring action operated so it automatically opens after you curl your eyelashes (the unit includes a small sturdy plastic brace to lock it closed for storage and travel).</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have tried many before but none curled my lashes like this one! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love it. It looks cute and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li> I have never had any issues with eyelash curlers but this one I couldn&#x27;t fit into my eye. I was poking my eye out trying to get to my lashes. The seller was very helpful it refunding my money for this so I am giving five stars for the seller</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received the product described for free or reduced cost to facilitate this review. All opinions are my own.  The packaging for this product was sealed tight and nothing was damaged.  I use a cheap CVS eyelash curler every morning before putting on mascara and using this product this morning made a world of difference.  My lashes looked three times as long with this product!  I will definitely be referring this product to all of my friends!  I cannot wait to use it again tomorrow morning!</li>
            <li> Received this product a couple of days ago and so far it is working great, I have hardly no lashes and this makes them look alot better and longer.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler! I have ordered 3, 2 for me and one for a friend. It doesn&#x27;t pinch, or over crimp!</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to buy this! It makes my eyelashes look so much longer. I love this curler!</li>
            <li> Nice grip feature, curls great!</li>
            <li> pretty good value for price- considering that it comes with extra pads- I think its a great deal! feels and looks well made. Doesn&#x27;t pinch my eye lids which is important. Some other brands have done that before. I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Curls lashes perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Extremely well made. Haven&#x27;t had an eyelash curler in a while. I used t today and its very easy to grip and see where all your lashes are and it doesn&#x27;t tug at my lashes like other curlers. I like the bonus pads that come with it too. I love the color combo. Looks very expensive and I paid a good price for it too. It definitely beats paying for an overpriced curler at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Nice, high quality eye lash curlers. Comes with 5 replacements that will last you forever</li>
            <li> my wife says they work great</li>
            <li> Worked okay for first couple of uses, but noticed it bending in places it shouldnt have. After about the 10th use, it fell completely apart. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;Must have been just one faulty product because the company sent a replacement product &amp; I have not had any problems. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good eyelash curler for awhile.This curler certainly fits the bill. It is comfortable to hold and use without the usual awkward feel of a standard type curler.The bonus pad replacements are a real plus, too. Very happy with this product..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyelash curler I have ever used. I have used more high end brands and this one tops them all! I only hold it on my lashes for 5 seconds and BOOM amazing long lashes with none sticking to each other! Also it doesn&#x27;t snag your lashes like some other curlers do! Do yourself a favor and buy this curler!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li> Bought for my sister and the report back is that it&#x27;s the best curler she&#x27;s used - it makes her lashes curly, is really nice to use, seems really well made and she loves the color!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the refills like advertised  sad</li>
            <li> I personally did not like this.  I have only tried twice but i plan on giving it another go.  I think for me the head is to large because when I released my lashes it pinched my face.  It did come in a really cool package and included the replacement heads ot said it came with.  I purchased this at discounted price and agreed to review it</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. So glad it came with extra refills as its so hard to find other brands in the store.</li>
            <li> I like the curve of it, fits perfectly in my eye lashes and I don&#x27;t pinch my eyelids with it. Very easy to use. I like how there are extra replacement pads as well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many eyelash curlers through my years; everything from the cheap ones at the dollar store to the pricier ones at the boutiques. I have not found many differences in them except for one part: If they pinch the lashes. I find this the most annoying thing with the metal kind is that they have a tendency to pinch my lashes and I end up pulling them out.&lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant with this one, but from the comments and the ratings it looked promising. The item arrived in a nice package and I was happy to find replacement inserts with them. The first thing I noticed about the inserts is that they were glossy and I realized the others I have had were all rubber and kind of sticky, these were smooth and almost glossy. I realized them that this is the part that would set this curler apart from the others.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it about 5 times and am happy to say no stuck lashes!</li>
            <li> So I have always bought cheaper lash curlers, always had problems with pinching and not getting all lashes in the curler at once. I have only used it a couple times but is best I have had, no pinching, no problems grabbing all lashes, and it is pretty pink! It comes with 5 replacement pads.</li>
            <li> Super pretty and very effective! Love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced my eye lash curler in almost a decade, but with the amount on mascara on the pad, it was time. I read the product information and it suggested to curl before applying mascara which is opposite of how I curl. Well, I tried and it really makes for beautiful curled lashes. Even if you curl with your mascara on, the 5 replacement pads it comes with will last you a few years at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is well built and sturdy. The actual pinch of it is bigger then my old one, but allows for more control. I took a pad off to see how easy it was to replace, and it was very simple. I&#x27;m glad I finally updated my eye lash curler, and would recommend this one to everyone; the price it is listed at, it is more than fair.</li>
            <li> Curler is doing great job, it ship really fast, I&#x27;ve tried it once I got the package, The results came out pretty good.. and it comes 5 ext replacement,, I don&#x27;t have to worry to buy new one anymore, seller is very considering our buyer&#x27;s needs... LOL.  Love it..  thanks for the good products...</li>
            <li> I like the curler itself, but I did not receive the replacement pads which kind of sucks :(</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I grabbed a discount on this item.I have been doing a lot of reading about how important eyelash curlers are in a beauty routine.I could not wait to see if it was true and immediately opened it up and gave it a try.YES it does make a HUGE difference and my eyes really popped after curling prior to applying my mascara.I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone in the market for one.</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash curlers, expensive ones, cheap ones, until I found this one. I truly think that this IS the greatest eyelash curler there is, period!! You&#x27;ll never have to buy another one ever again, because this one will last you a long time + it comes with 5 replacement pads, what other curler comes with 5 replacement pads?? - none that I&#x27;ve seen, that&#x27;s for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone, great product + great price + fast delivery &#x3D; happiness!!!</li>
            <li> I first have to point out how pretty this eyelash curler is; I&#x27;m not a huge fan of pink but I love the little pink touches to it and I think it goes great with the black! I love that this eyelash curler comes with 5 replacement pads as others don&#x27;t come with any replacements which means you either have to search for the right pad or completely buy a new eyelash curler once the original goes out so with the 5 replacements you actually in the long run save money! The eyelash curler fit both my eyes without any problems which can be a problem with other similar products. The grips are nice and sturdy so you are able to handle it the way you need to. This eyelash curler works really well as well and gave my thin short eyelashes a nice curl, with a coat of mascara my eyelashes were really nice and bold! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> The Eyelash curler was delivered as expected and curls my lashes nicely.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the curler in a promotion for testing and review.  The free&lt;br /&gt;bonus replacement pads are nice to have and are nicely packaged, as well.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works very well, it is very sturdy and very well made.  It works a lot better than the average eyelash curler you get in the drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever purchased.  I had bought the most expensive and the cheapest and this on, which is a great price, outshines them all.  It is so gentle on your lashes and the seller is fantastic.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> sharp edges on both ends, too long for smaller eyes</li>
            <li> The product did not curl my lashes. I do not want a product that apparently requires the application of heat it in order to make it effective.</li>
            <li> i love this product and i very excited to try this.</li>
            <li> best lash curler i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is nice it takes only one time to curl ur eyelash.love it</li>
            <li> Nice product ..I&#x27;ve use eyelash curlers for years.but was impressed with this one and the replacement cushions are great..great product..</li>
            <li> When looking for a new eyelash curler, I was in need of an item that would get the job done. With that said I am beyond thrilled with my selection. The curler is well built with a wonderful spring action. Upon pressing your lashes you can feel them and see them curling up. I have attached a picture of my lashes at the end of the day. Using the curler has proven to hold the curl all day. I would strongly suggest this product. Not to mention it showed up ahead of the scheduled delivery date. Very happy!</li>
            <li> The Silicone pads are a really nice touch â€“ especially with 5 extra replacements.  The handle is hard plastic with silicone cushioning where your fingers grip the handles -  very comfortable.  It came with a separate clear Lucite clip that keeps it closed when not in use.  My one issue - it is a little too big for my eye shape.  I could easily curl the inner &amp; center part of my  eyelashes , but not the outer edge.  Still â€“ nicely made item if it fits your eye.</li>
            <li> Best curlers I&#x27;ve ever used! No pulling, no hurting. Stylish design.</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading all these positive reviews. I am not sure if there is something wrong with my eyelashes, but this curler does not work for me. My lashes remain slightly curled for minutes; the moment I apply the eyeliner they are back straight. Also, the curler arrived slightly bent, tried to correct it with my fingers and I think it worked but still it does not do the work...  It doesn&#x27;t cut my lashes though (thank God!) so 2 stars are the maximum I can give...</li>
            <li> Have used eyelash curlers for decades. Lately have been trying several types because have not liked the way they worked. Really pleased with this one! Easy to use and does so much better!,</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re the type that likes the loops for your fingers or you prefer to have them outside, these will fit your hand perfectly. I really also like the clear plastic that holds them shut when not in use. They feel very nice in the hand, and the rounded rubber pads really help keep from getting lashes yanked out. I haven&#x27;t used them warmed yet, but since the package was sitting outside for a while before I got to it, they were pretty warm when I opened them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are NOT flimsy at all. These are built as any tool should be. Solid, effective, and structurally sound. A lot of curlers seem to be built to be tossed in a week or two, but these really seem built to last. I appreciate that. Too many things seem to be built to be disposable and that&#x27;s a large part of the problem we&#x27;re having with our planet&#x27;s heath. I can at least say that this set doesn&#x27;t perpetuate the disposable society addiction. Coming with 5 refills of the pads, it states boldly that it intends to stay with you a while. The fact that they&#x27;re free is good, but the fact that the manufacturer is confident enough that they will last that 5 are included free of charge says that they will be in your vanity case for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
