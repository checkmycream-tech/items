            <li>Love this truly organic product.  </li>

            <li>Love being able to get  this item</li>
            <li>I cannot be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but this one is much better not to say worlds better.</li>
            <li>Shea nut production in West Africa is more than a cash crop--it is an opportunity for women to cash in on their dreams and gain a sense of empowerment.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>As soon as i received this product, I understood why it had such perfect ratings (before</li>
            <li>love the smell.</li>
            <li>Well pleased.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>Love the price and quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and both times have been completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s getting much better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brand.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth like butter and very clean!</li>
            <li>So my first batch was wonderful, so much so that I ordered another jar on November 19th, 2015.</li>
            <li>It is easy to work with and makes skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>perfect for dry skin...</li>
            <li>and I was able to whip up some body cream with oils easily.</li>
            <li>Great natural moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I mix this with organic coconut oil and this makes a wonderful body cream for moisturizing my very dry, eczema prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this purchase of raw shea butter from Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
            <li>It softens easily on warm skin, soaks right in and isn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Great product - very smooth, not gritty at all.  </li>
            <li>I havent had other butter to compare this to, but of everything i read, this stuff was perfect!  </li>
            <li>The other thing that impressed me was the smoothness of the product.  </li>
            <li>It is light in color, melts easily, and is very clean.</li>
            <li>; melts easily.</li>
            <li>I hesitated because it&#x27;s in a brick, but it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does have a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; scent as others have stated, but it is easily masked when I combine it with my coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>butter melts easily between my fingers</li>
            <li>but I think the smell is very mild.</li>
            <li>The shea butter breaks apart from the bar easily and melts when rubbed in your hands.  </li>
            <li>However, I am strongly suggest you get</li>
            <li>Others have said it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if it is created with special care...  :)  </li>
            <li>Received my jar of raw shea butter from perfect body harmony enjoying the use of it</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best shea butter I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>I read about many Shea Butter products and finely decided to try the organic raw shea butter-iyt is the best!</li>
            <li>Fresh and easy to work with!</li>
            <li>I tried this unrefined organic shea butter and let me just say that this stuff is wonderful - much better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The texture was smooth and mixed beautifully.</li>
            <li>everything is fine.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a choice of receiving the large bar or the jar of the product.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful... very creamy and absorbed quickly into my skin fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best quality shea butter I have tried, including usda certified organic well - known natural brands.</li>
            <li>Great price for such a fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>If you keep it in your cabinet and not in the fridge, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy without all the  impurities.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;d be worth it to buy a pound of shea butter if I didn&#x27;t know the quality and how my skin would react.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this product and how easily it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>icing?,that&#x27;s how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>if you have Amazon Prime, shipping &amp; handling is free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth after it&#x27;s melted.  </li>
            <li>great for making lotion bars,  looking forward to making my next batch.  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is so smooth &amp; luxurious.</li>
            <li>The butter is smooth and feels absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li>I had purchased shea butter from a different supplier some time ago and was happy with the quality</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and</li>
            <li>Works great as a therapeutic deep moisturizing treatment for hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The product is satiny smooth throughout.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shea butter smells nutty and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Is great I use it for a moisturizer that I make my self is the second time I order</li>
            <li>I was prescribed steroids and while I was waiting for the prescription to be filled, some friends told me about aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of the good reviews, when I opened it and used it my reaction was WOW</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>This is the best raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and I can very easy and gentle</li>
            <li>This raw, rich, organic super-nourishing shea butter is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited for their new sleek design and will be ordering more just in time for the summer!</li>
            <li>(it works so much better than the processed stuff!), and I will definitely be buying more when I run</li>
            <li>I also ordered the cocoa butter and am not disappointed with it either.</li>
            <li>have tried many Shea Butters and this is the best so far, no need to try any other brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light smokey scent that vanishes quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super light in color.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is very easy to use in all of my homemade recipes using my essential oils, and a very light smell.</li>
            <li>On top of this being an awesome product, this company goes above &amp; beyond to make sure you are happy with your purchase &amp; if for some crazy reason you are not, they will do what it takes to make it right.</li>
            <li>Whips easily and very nicely as well to provide an excellent base for my lotions.</li>
            <li>This was amazing, truly organic and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, a friend of mine had some and gave me some when I spent the weekend over at her place and the quality is beyond reproach</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it to my skin in areas that get shaved and found that it works amazingly for keeping my skin soft and non-itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I spent a great deal of time digging and looking into who to invest in when trying to purchase shea butter.</li>
            <li>And I feel good about using a simple and organic product.</li>
            <li>Also, my mid-thirties skin is drying out more often than ever, and massaging this into my hands and face has made a real difference in my skin tone and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells sickly sweet if you can imagine that.   </li>
            <li>I use this product to make my own moisturizer and make-up items so that I can have all natural products that go on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am buying this again, I love it so much.</li>
            <li>This is nice and soft for lotion making.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient and more portable packaging.</li>
            <li>and i will in the near future order more, the shea butter is really great</li>
            <li>The bar inside the bag was good packaging because I could just chop it into the double boiler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;A DREAM COME TRUE:</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve shared samples with friends, family and neighbors hoping they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It melts so easily, with no lumps or bumps - just smooth, pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is smooth and melts right into my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency and was easy to whip with a little coconut oil and cocoa butter to make a fantastic whipped all body &amp;#34;Body Butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product from a friend and relative after complimenting them on how wonderful their skin looked since the last time I saw them.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly using my husband&#x27;s Prime account.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>you for taking care in packaging and shipping which allowed for a quick delivery with no issues.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly with no hassles whatsoever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it absorbs into the skin quickly and without a tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>I have applied it to my face and love the way it makes my skin feel - I&#x27;m not left with greasiness or an oily feeling like what most department store moisturizers leave.</li>
            <li>The package was sent quickly and the bag was intact and was double-layered to keep it fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is well packaged and shipped quickly from what I remember.</li>
            <li>is a quick rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, the scent fades rather quickly and after a bit I don&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li>ochen davolna, the quality is super, super dastavka.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and have melted this shea butter  along with coconut oil</li>
            <li>The smell is mild -- earthy and nutty.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer of this brand.  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality shea butter possibly the best that I have purchased so far!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and i will buy more.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased with this product, was very solid</li>
            <li>Packaging is fabulous &amp; this shea butter is exactly as they say.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love my Organic Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I have been using all kind of organic creams and oils on him with great success and the shea butter is just one more additional item in my arsenal that assists me to naturally fight his baby eczema (his pediatrician prescribed cortisone cream, which as a nurse I feel is criminal).</li>
            <li>Finished the first jar today and opened the 2nd one expecting it to be just as good.   </li>
            <li>; It is like a grease/oil so it does get all over everything, it doesn&#x27;t smell to great, and it doesn&#x27;t keep him from itching but as his flare ups calm down so</li>
            <li>I use Retin A for facial  fine lines and follow up with either Shea Butter to reduce irritation or a new product that I also found on Amazon called Good</li>
            <li>Product came fast, was not old but fresh and is great to use on body.</li>
            <li>and I found exactly  what I was looking  for in this company!</li>
            <li>I use this product for deep conditioning my newly natural hair and I am very pleased :)  </li>
            <li>It melts easily, it is so creamy, luxurious, and has a fantastic natural smell.  </li>
            <li>Amazing shea butter and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>its just really creamy and smooth and has a nutty scent the way Shea Butter is supposed to smell -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy with this Shea butter in the jar from Perfect Body Harmony.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and happy after use, and i can tell the difference even days later.</li>
            <li>But worth the effort for me.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is the basis of most everything I have made so far</li>
            <li>love that it is natural and organic</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite is on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>Feels SO nice and melts instantly on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and earthy as you would expect.</li>
            <li>I received useful information on how to use this shea butter in an email.</li>
            <li>I mix it with other oils as well as essential oils for the perfect smell.</li>
            <li>This is the best Shea butter I&#x27;ve used its not gritty like other butters and the piece of Shea was as described will def buy again</li>
            <li>They would follow up since right after I placed the order, all the way along until I received it, offering a coupon for repeat customers as well.</li>
            <li>My skin soaks it right up and it leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>and I purchased the 2nd jar within a month of buying and loving the first.</li>
            <li>The hard plastic container and the foil package both work beautifully.</li>
            <li>I decided to use only a shea butter and dead sea soap on my face(yes on my face-its perfect) and this shea butter to moisturize afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is absolutely amazing - I have purchased alot of what I thought was real Shea Butter from my local beauty supply</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, the butter came before my steroid prescription was ready.  </li>
            <li>Last forever great purchase use it daily.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with beeswax and grape seed oil and the bars are nice, but I much prefer using it straight out of the bag!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it got overheated during transport and changed the texture or what, but it&#x27;s not the amazing smooth shea butter I got before.</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>Hi all, I don&#x27;t normally like to send my personal feedback as everyone has their own preference to each product.</li>
            <li>The butter alone is exactly what I wanted  in a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I was still using the first jar</li>
            <li>Consistency is grainier, almost like a white moldy substance on top.</li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer of this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have finally been able to use the product</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am satisfied w/ the actual product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, soft and creamy in texture.</li>
            <li>product came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Definitely will repurchase :)</li>
            <li>I am a first time user and purchased this to make body butter.</li>
            <li>I did find one that needs to be melted and strained first</li>
            <li>so I may try the bulk one before buying this one again but only because I make a lot of product and need more for a bit of a better deal to keep my costs low for my organic products.</li>
            <li>The texture of the shea butter is light, soft, and crumbly.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say this product lives up to it&#x27;s description and is Excellent.</li>
            <li>First is the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this</li>
            <li>My feet are smooth, my elbows are soft and my hands aren&#x27;t chapped anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using this product.</li>
            <li>Used in my first body butter.</li>
            <li>opened the package onto waxed paper and used a heated knife to cut off a section about the right size for the plastic travel jar I had ready for it.</li>
            <li>It was soft, rich, &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li>i made my own lotion with other oils and it help me fade my strechmarks and leaves your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil but love the less oily feel of this rich Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>: A year or so later I ordered some more, and this time it was very grainy.</li>
            <li>Delivery was RIGHT ON TIME  and the product quality is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this brand of shea butter because I liked the low price and how so many other customers gave high, positive ratings.</li>
            <li>First of all...I have suffered from acne and hyperpigmentation my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love the texture of the product and how easily it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I tried a few different shea butters and this one was by far the best!  </li>
            <li>As far as I can see, that is true.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to the other one.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a nice dark, storage bag</li>
            <li>I searched long and hard for the perfect shea butter for my homemade mixes.</li>
            <li>It comes in a large brick form, like the photo shows.</li>
            <li>Pure goodness in a gold bag.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to open up the beautiful shiny, gold, ziplock bag...and then open up the inner bag ziplock every time I pass by it.  </li>
            <li>The quality was creamy and smells great, which is why I&#x27;m super sad that it didn&#x27;t make a dent in her skin condition.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I intend to use it for a whipped shea recipe that uses coconut oil and lavender essential oil, but it works fine by itself to apply to my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the skin on my face looks more even, and I have less razor bumps from shaving, not that I had many initially.  </li>
            <li>A very high quality product.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and white and much nicer than the shea butter I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I have used Shea Butter before by Molivera but this  Shea Butter is much easier to spread without the grainy texture.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery; will purchase from PBH again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used but is still very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It really eases the pain.</li>
            <li>, your hands are really soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal people.  </li>
            <li>and it really reduces the appearance of my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it as much as I should quite yet</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but my nails are doing so well, and I noticed they  are much stronger since I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so it is very conveninet when I am scooping the product out of it.</li>
            <li>Much lighter than what I&#x27;m use to.  </li>
            <li>and this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>but I really like the UV bag it is stored in</li>
            <li>and it does have a real organic smell.</li>
            <li>Plan to put this to use very soon.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
            <li>apply it to the skin of my face, no rubbing or pulling just a gentle touching.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for my homemade body butter with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I have a much easier time rubbing this on my skin even without melting it.</li>
            <li>If you were like me and bought body lotions galore because of the way they smelt and because the label said: &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;... I would suggest to perhaps think about ditching all the store bought and chemically loaded creams and stick with something more simple and natural.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for 2 days so far but can definitely tell its superior quality compared to butters (or whatever it was)</li>
            <li>and I have never had anything like this product - its pure unrefined Shea Butter that makes my skin feel so soft right after applying it -</li>
            <li>Using it all over - my hands and feet are usually dry and rough this time of year, catching on fabric etc., not anymore!</li>
            <li>I made a body lotion with almond oil, coconut oil, this shea butter, and some other things, but I think I like the way the shea butter works alone better.</li>
            <li>THIS BRAND is pure white, soft and crumbles easily, melts effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I have used other organic raw shea butter that did not compare to the purity, freshness, softly scented of the one sold by Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
            <li>I really liked this Raw Shea</li>
            <li>It was overpriced for such a small amount and the quality isnt even that great.</li>
            <li>I have been using it to treat my 15 year old son&#x27;s acne and much to my surprise and delight-it really works!  </li>
            <li>it lightens dark spots, keeps feet really soft &amp; it has a light clean smell.</li>
            <li>Better then what I was buying at a whole foods store, less smelly.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using shea butter and it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>First day i used it i can feel my skin is really soft</li>
            <li>I had a severe allergic reaction and developed pimple like bumps on my legs, thighs and butt after the first night using this.  </li>
            <li>but I used the shea butter on it daily and it healed up rather quickly and did not leave a mark at all.</li>
            <li>It will take me a while to finish this bar (it is quite big, and my understanding is that they will start offering a larger bar soon), but I am sure that I will reorder from them when I am done with this one.</li>
            <li>It has the exact same amount of \\&quot;shea butter has this exact scent\\&quot; aroma that the fancy name brand has.</li>
            <li>My main purpose for buying this was to incorporate it into homemade lotion/cream recipes.</li>
            <li>I purchased the bag version a few months ago and the Shea butter had a smoky, nutty earthy scent and it was very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend your face too.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A large bar of shea butter comes in a clear ziplock bag which is then put inside the UV bag to protect it.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I am thrilled to find this raw, organic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>USDA certified 100% organic, no toxic chemicals, all natural!!</li>
            <li>Seriously, feel at ease ordering from this company as they want happy, regular customers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About the third time I used the butter in the travel jar, I found that being at indoor room temperature made it possible for me to press it down into the jar solidly for a more compact size and a top surface comfortable and convenient for regular</li>
            <li>All shea butter is not &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;), I was very particular about who I would purchase from next.</li>
            <li>As long as this company sticks with what it has, I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>This is my new source for organic butters.  </li>
            <li>This new jar is so portable and convenient; it&#x27;s a must try for everybody.</li>
            <li>I was very much pleased when I received the Organic Raw Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I love this organic raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>When i received my CERTIFIED ORGANIC Raw Shea butter in the jar i took a whiff and it has a strong latex smell, it is also very grainy.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased Shea Butter, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but what I received was exactly what I expected from the description.  </li>
            <li>A highly expense face cream did not do near the job of this product.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft to touch and melt in hand</li>
            <li>Pulling off the protective cover under the lid, I knew the strong smell was not right!</li>
            <li>Within 36 hours completely gone!  </li>
            <li>melted a small amount of piece and mixed it with my other favorite lotions (to makes it more moisturizing)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have included this product so far in body and hair recipes for my family!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as it appears in the graphic (with exception of break).  </li>
            <li>The rest I placed on a shelf in our pantry where the temp is regulated allowing all items to remain fresh for as long as 1 year.</li>
            <li>Now, if my hands start drying out, I just rub in a small amount, and immediately my hands look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that has really helped his skin!</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the organic raw shea butter for all the reasons listed and I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I recently just jumped on the &amp;#34;all natural and organic&amp;#34; body product train, and let me tell you that I am thrilled with this raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I filled some of it in a dark brown glass container and sealed the other part in its original pouch where it is stored in a cool dark</li>
            <li>I wish for products like this and the companies that provide them to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they&#x27;re exercising sound ethical practices by providing transparency regarding import standards and human rights and well-being attached to the refinement and exportation of this and other natural products like it.    </li>
            <li>I chucked my old ideas and my old skin care routine and it worked!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;natural shea butter&amp;#34; from the local natural grocery store, no comparison, this is softer and just feels better, less goes farther.  </li>
            <li>Love this, totally raw organic!  </li>
            <li>Its highly emollient and I recommend this to anyone who wants pure, real, raw organic &amp; extremely fresh Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>When my newborn daughter started to show signs of eczema I also want to use shea butter on her, but I wanted something completely pure and unadulterated for her delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>I find most too hard and when melted to grainy when solidified again.</li>
            <li>Then I add my favorite Young Living Essential oils to it once it&#x27;s cooled and blend it with a little coconut oil in my Kitchen Aid mixer to make my son&#x27;s eczema cream.  </li>
            <li>This brand is super high quality and is organic and raw!, highly recommend !</li>
            <li>The raw shea butter has a natural, and somewhat strong scent.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely luxurious--the way it melts on and its natural scent is addictive.</li>
            <li>The description wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li>You should expect that; it&#x27;s a natural product.  </li>
            <li>The block of butter was soft and smelled how shea butter is supposed to smell.</li>
            <li>I can get 2 pounds directly from West Africa on the streets of NYC.</li>
            <li>also use it on my 1 year old that doesn&#x27;t have eczema as a lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s luxurious and soft.</li>
            <li>Far and away the best/highest quality shea butter I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely professional hygienic COMPANY.  </li>
            <li>I use it all over after bath/shower and my skin feels so soft even use it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have bought lots of dufferent ones but this far exceeds any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin so soft with zero residue.</li>
            <li>The outside bag keeps it very well protected and the inside bag has a zipper lock</li>
            <li>When you are in treatment your skin can be sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have already used this in several lotions and soaps, and am very happyvwith the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It made my lotion the soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>When I put it on my skin it makes my skin extremely soft and supple.</li>
            <li>oh well, better late then never.</li>
            <li>I am natural curl lady and wanted something to help with moisture retention.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something natural.  </li>
            <li>My coily natural hair loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is heavy ,but still it gave me a smooth skin.</li>
            <li>product is the softest and feels natural.</li>
            <li>It is soft and smells just as it should.  </li>
            <li>Soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>My face looks more youthful, my skin is almost completely clear, and my acne scars are slowly healing.  </li>
            <li>For easy use, I&#x27;ve been putting some of the crumbly shea butter in a small jar for daily use; that way the large bar stays protected in the bag</li>
            <li>True shea butter has a comedogenic level of 0 on a scale of 5 of causing acne, but I&#x27;m not sure about the other stuff, so I was genuinely worried.  </li>
            <li>When ordering products that claim to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; it is hard to determine most times if this is actually what you are receiving as the product normally arrives in unmarked packaging and does not state anything.</li>
            <li>price is higher than many of Amazon&#x27;s other similar products, but there isn&#x27;t any waste.</li>
            <li>Research around raw shea butter suggests that it is non comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores), and that was important for me.</li>
            <li>THIS Raw Shea Butter is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this a shot because I figured the quality may be just as good as the one I normally get and its way too cold to venture out to get that one</li>
            <li>The smell is decent -- scented oils aren&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
            <li>Meanwhile I have also used it on my face and can only highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was initially turned away by the high cost but</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky until it absorbs into your skin, but hours later your skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I had cracked itchy bleeding hands and one coating of this stuff overnight my hands were practically back to normal.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps aid in the decision making process for those socially conscious and environmentally aware consumers considering buying this, or any other product for that matter.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is really making a difference for us in these dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>I must say that unlike the last shea butter I had bought from another seller which had a bright yellow color and was hard as a rock, this shea butter on the other hand was soft and the color truly was ivory.</li>
            <li>A first time buyer can buy this to compare other shea butters to see the difference.</li>
            <li>You can break off a small chunk and massage it in your hands to make it applicable, though that gets old quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell takes a little getting used to, but the result of smoothness is worth it.</li>
            <li>The proof is in&lt;br /&gt;the pudding when the next morning your 10 year old son says &amp;</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has eczema and after trying every &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; cream/lotions in the store they just didn&#x27;t work, we also tried the regular creams/lotions and he would complain that they burned him and sometimes would cry.</li>
            <li>My face &amp; hands are unbelievably soft now -- finally!  </li>
            <li>They come and go on me so my doctor suggested I try a natural product such as Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E or Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and its bringing my youthfulness back, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with dry skin, diaper rash, eczema, or dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I also have very sensitive skin and melasma to top it off.  </li>
            <li>The scent is odd at first, but after using for a couple of weeks, I like it.</li>
            <li>The only regret that I have is that I have wasted a lot of money on chemically and toxin filled creams from the major beauty product manufactures rather than using real raw ingredients that are not only healthier but also significantly cheaper -</li>
            <li>Like others here, I bought a few essential oils, mixed the shea butter and select oils with an electric mixer (after melting in a double boiler), and packed it in a wide-mouth (important) jar.</li>
            <li>It is extremely thick and rich.</li>
            <li>We live in ND where it gets extremely dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li>They are so quick to respond and go out of their way to make their customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the ORGANIC RAW SHEA BUTTER as is</li>
            <li>If there is a knock, it&#x27;s only that raw shea butter in general takes a bit of work to make it useful in a practical way.</li>
            <li>I had this one first and then ordered the one in the black bag the next time</li>
            <li>I mixed it with other oils and everyone I have given some to all says the same things that they really, really like it.  </li>
            <li>I also started using it on my daughters sensitive dry itchy skin</li>
            <li>This is the first time I was buying raw shea butter</li>
            <li>so I stored the new jar in my bathroom pantry, where my other lotions and soaps are stored.</li>

            <li> perfect for dry skin...</li>
            <li> and I was able to whip up some body cream with oils easily.</li>
            <li> Great natural moisturizer!</li>

            <li> ; melts easily.</li>
            <li> I hesitated because it&#x27;s in a brick, but it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does have a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; scent as others have stated, but it is easily masked when I combine it with my coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> butter melts easily between my fingers</li>
            <li> but I think the smell is very mild.</li>
            <li> The shea butter breaks apart from the bar easily and melts when rubbed in your hands.  </li>
            <li> However, I am strongly suggest you get</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it to my skin in areas that get shaved and found that it works amazingly for keeping my skin soft and non-itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time digging and looking into who to invest in when trying to purchase shea butter.</li>
            <li> And I feel good about using a simple and organic product.</li>
            <li> Also, my mid-thirties skin is drying out more often than ever, and massaging this into my hands and face has made a real difference in my skin tone and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells sickly sweet if you can imagine that.   </li>
            <li> I use this product to make my own moisturizer and make-up items so that I can have all natural products that go on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am buying this again, I love it so much.</li>
            <li> This is nice and soft for lotion making.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient and more portable packaging.</li>
            <li> and i will in the near future order more, the shea butter is really great</li>
            <li> The bar inside the bag was good packaging because I could just chop it into the double boiler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A DREAM COME TRUE:</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve shared samples with friends, family and neighbors hoping they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It melts so easily, with no lumps or bumps - just smooth, pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is smooth and melts right into my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency and was easy to whip with a little coconut oil and cocoa butter to make a fantastic whipped all body &amp;#34;Body Butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend and relative after complimenting them on how wonderful their skin looked since the last time I saw them.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly using my husband&#x27;s Prime account.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> you for taking care in packaging and shipping which allowed for a quick delivery with no issues.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly with no hassles whatsoever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it absorbs into the skin quickly and without a tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> I have applied it to my face and love the way it makes my skin feel - I&#x27;m not left with greasiness or an oily feeling like what most department store moisturizers leave.</li>
            <li> The package was sent quickly and the bag was intact and was double-layered to keep it fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is well packaged and shipped quickly from what I remember.</li>
            <li> is a quick rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, the scent fades rather quickly and after a bit I don&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li> ochen davolna, the quality is super, super dastavka.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have melted this shea butter  along with coconut oil</li>
            <li> The smell is mild -- earthy and nutty.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer of this brand.  </li>
            <li> This is a very high quality shea butter possibly the best that I have purchased so far!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and i will buy more.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased with this product, was very solid</li>
            <li> Packaging is fabulous &amp; this shea butter is exactly as they say.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Organic Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I have been using all kind of organic creams and oils on him with great success and the shea butter is just one more additional item in my arsenal that assists me to naturally fight his baby eczema (his pediatrician prescribed cortisone cream, which as a nurse I feel is criminal).</li>
            <li> Finished the first jar today and opened the 2nd one expecting it to be just as good.   </li>
            <li> ; It is like a grease/oil so it does get all over everything, it doesn&#x27;t smell to great, and it doesn&#x27;t keep him from itching but as his flare ups calm down so</li>
            <li> I use Retin A for facial  fine lines and follow up with either Shea Butter to reduce irritation or a new product that I also found on Amazon called Good</li>
            <li> Product came fast, was not old but fresh and is great to use on body.</li>
            <li> and I found exactly  what I was looking  for in this company!</li>
            <li> I use this product for deep conditioning my newly natural hair and I am very pleased :)  </li>
            <li> It melts easily, it is so creamy, luxurious, and has a fantastic natural smell.  </li>
            <li> Amazing shea butter and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> its just really creamy and smooth and has a nutty scent the way Shea Butter is supposed to smell -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this Shea butter in the jar from Perfect Body Harmony.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and happy after use, and i can tell the difference even days later.</li>
            <li> But worth the effort for me.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is the basis of most everything I have made so far</li>
            <li> love that it is natural and organic</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite is on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Feels SO nice and melts instantly on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh and earthy as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I received useful information on how to use this shea butter in an email.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils as well as essential oils for the perfect smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter I&#x27;ve used its not gritty like other butters and the piece of Shea was as described will def buy again</li>
            <li> They would follow up since right after I placed the order, all the way along until I received it, offering a coupon for repeat customers as well.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right up and it leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> and I purchased the 2nd jar within a month of buying and loving the first.</li>
            <li> The hard plastic container and the foil package both work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I decided to use only a shea butter and dead sea soap on my face(yes on my face-its perfect) and this shea butter to moisturize afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is absolutely amazing - I have purchased alot of what I thought was real Shea Butter from my local beauty supply</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, the butter came before my steroid prescription was ready.  </li>
            <li> Last forever great purchase use it daily.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with beeswax and grape seed oil and the bars are nice, but I much prefer using it straight out of the bag!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it got overheated during transport and changed the texture or what, but it&#x27;s not the amazing smooth shea butter I got before.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> Hi all, I don&#x27;t normally like to send my personal feedback as everyone has their own preference to each product.</li>
            <li> The butter alone is exactly what I wanted  in a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I was still using the first jar</li>
            <li> Consistency is grainier, almost like a white moldy substance on top.</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have finally been able to use the product</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am satisfied w/ the actual product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, soft and creamy in texture.</li>
            <li> product came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Definitely will repurchase :)</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and purchased this to make body butter.</li>
            <li> I did find one that needs to be melted and strained first</li>
            <li> so I may try the bulk one before buying this one again but only because I make a lot of product and need more for a bit of a better deal to keep my costs low for my organic products.</li>
            <li> The texture of the shea butter is light, soft, and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say this product lives up to it&#x27;s description and is Excellent.</li>
            <li> First is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this</li>
            <li> My feet are smooth, my elbows are soft and my hands aren&#x27;t chapped anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time using this product.</li>
            <li> Used in my first body butter.</li>
            <li> opened the package onto waxed paper and used a heated knife to cut off a section about the right size for the plastic travel jar I had ready for it.</li>
            <li> It was soft, rich, &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li> i made my own lotion with other oils and it help me fade my strechmarks and leaves your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil but love the less oily feel of this rich Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> : A year or so later I ordered some more, and this time it was very grainy.</li>
            <li> Delivery was RIGHT ON TIME  and the product quality is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand of shea butter because I liked the low price and how so many other customers gave high, positive ratings.</li>
            <li> First of all...I have suffered from acne and hyperpigmentation my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love the texture of the product and how easily it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different shea butters and this one was by far the best!  </li>
            <li> As far as I can see, that is true.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to the other one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a nice dark, storage bag</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for the perfect shea butter for my homemade mixes.</li>
            <li> It comes in a large brick form, like the photo shows.</li>
            <li> Pure goodness in a gold bag.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to open up the beautiful shiny, gold, ziplock bag...and then open up the inner bag ziplock every time I pass by it.  </li>
            <li> The quality was creamy and smells great, which is why I&#x27;m super sad that it didn&#x27;t make a dent in her skin condition.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I intend to use it for a whipped shea recipe that uses coconut oil and lavender essential oil, but it works fine by itself to apply to my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the skin on my face looks more even, and I have less razor bumps from shaving, not that I had many initially.  </li>
            <li> A very high quality product.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and white and much nicer than the shea butter I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have used Shea Butter before by Molivera but this  Shea Butter is much easier to spread without the grainy texture.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery; will purchase from PBH again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used but is still very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It really eases the pain.</li>
            <li> , your hands are really soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal people.  </li>
            <li> and it really reduces the appearance of my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it as much as I should quite yet</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but my nails are doing so well, and I noticed they  are much stronger since I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> so it is very conveninet when I am scooping the product out of it.</li>
            <li> Much lighter than what I&#x27;m use to.  </li>
            <li> and this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> but I really like the UV bag it is stored in</li>
            <li> and it does have a real organic smell.</li>
            <li> Plan to put this to use very soon.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
            <li> apply it to the skin of my face, no rubbing or pulling just a gentle touching.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for my homemade body butter with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have a much easier time rubbing this on my skin even without melting it.</li>
            <li> If you were like me and bought body lotions galore because of the way they smelt and because the label said: &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;... I would suggest to perhaps think about ditching all the store bought and chemically loaded creams and stick with something more simple and natural.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 2 days so far but can definitely tell its superior quality compared to butters (or whatever it was)</li>
            <li> and I have never had anything like this product - its pure unrefined Shea Butter that makes my skin feel so soft right after applying it -</li>
            <li> Using it all over - my hands and feet are usually dry and rough this time of year, catching on fabric etc., not anymore!</li>
            <li> I made a body lotion with almond oil, coconut oil, this shea butter, and some other things, but I think I like the way the shea butter works alone better.</li>
            <li> THIS BRAND is pure white, soft and crumbles easily, melts effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I have used other organic raw shea butter that did not compare to the purity, freshness, softly scented of the one sold by Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Raw Shea</li>
            <li> It was overpriced for such a small amount and the quality isnt even that great.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to treat my 15 year old son&#x27;s acne and much to my surprise and delight-it really works!  </li>
            <li> it lightens dark spots, keeps feet really soft &amp; it has a light clean smell.</li>
            <li> Better then what I was buying at a whole foods store, less smelly.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using shea butter and it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> First day i used it i can feel my skin is really soft</li>
            <li> I had a severe allergic reaction and developed pimple like bumps on my legs, thighs and butt after the first night using this.  </li>
            <li> but I used the shea butter on it daily and it healed up rather quickly and did not leave a mark at all.</li>
            <li> It will take me a while to finish this bar (it is quite big, and my understanding is that they will start offering a larger bar soon), but I am sure that I will reorder from them when I am done with this one.</li>
            <li> It has the exact same amount of \\&quot;shea butter has this exact scent\\&quot; aroma that the fancy name brand has.</li>
            <li> My main purpose for buying this was to incorporate it into homemade lotion/cream recipes.</li>
            <li> I purchased the bag version a few months ago and the Shea butter had a smoky, nutty earthy scent and it was very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend your face too.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A large bar of shea butter comes in a clear ziplock bag which is then put inside the UV bag to protect it.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I am thrilled to find this raw, organic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> USDA certified 100% organic, no toxic chemicals, all natural!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, feel at ease ordering from this company as they want happy, regular customers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About the third time I used the butter in the travel jar, I found that being at indoor room temperature made it possible for me to press it down into the jar solidly for a more compact size and a top surface comfortable and convenient for regular</li>
            <li> All shea butter is not &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;), I was very particular about who I would purchase from next.</li>
            <li> As long as this company sticks with what it has, I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This is my new source for organic butters.  </li>
            <li> This new jar is so portable and convenient; it&#x27;s a must try for everybody.</li>
            <li> I was very much pleased when I received the Organic Raw Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I love this organic raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> When i received my CERTIFIED ORGANIC Raw Shea butter in the jar i took a whiff and it has a strong latex smell, it is also very grainy.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased Shea Butter, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but what I received was exactly what I expected from the description.  </li>
            <li> A highly expense face cream did not do near the job of this product.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft to touch and melt in hand</li>
            <li> Pulling off the protective cover under the lid, I knew the strong smell was not right!</li>
            <li> Within 36 hours completely gone!  </li>
            <li> melted a small amount of piece and mixed it with my other favorite lotions (to makes it more moisturizing)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have included this product so far in body and hair recipes for my family!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as it appears in the graphic (with exception of break).  </li>
            <li> The rest I placed on a shelf in our pantry where the temp is regulated allowing all items to remain fresh for as long as 1 year.</li>
            <li> Now, if my hands start drying out, I just rub in a small amount, and immediately my hands look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that has really helped his skin!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the organic raw shea butter for all the reasons listed and I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I recently just jumped on the &amp;#34;all natural and organic&amp;#34; body product train, and let me tell you that I am thrilled with this raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I filled some of it in a dark brown glass container and sealed the other part in its original pouch where it is stored in a cool dark</li>
            <li> I wish for products like this and the companies that provide them to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they&#x27;re exercising sound ethical practices by providing transparency regarding import standards and human rights and well-being attached to the refinement and exportation of this and other natural products like it.    </li>
            <li> I chucked my old ideas and my old skin care routine and it worked!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;natural shea butter&amp;#34; from the local natural grocery store, no comparison, this is softer and just feels better, less goes farther.  </li>
            <li> Love this, totally raw organic!  </li>
            <li> Its highly emollient and I recommend this to anyone who wants pure, real, raw organic &amp; extremely fresh Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> When my newborn daughter started to show signs of eczema I also want to use shea butter on her, but I wanted something completely pure and unadulterated for her delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I find most too hard and when melted to grainy when solidified again.</li>
            <li> Then I add my favorite Young Living Essential oils to it once it&#x27;s cooled and blend it with a little coconut oil in my Kitchen Aid mixer to make my son&#x27;s eczema cream.  </li>
            <li> This brand is super high quality and is organic and raw!, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> The raw shea butter has a natural, and somewhat strong scent.</li>
            <li> It feels absolutely luxurious--the way it melts on and its natural scent is addictive.</li>
            <li> The description wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> You should expect that; it&#x27;s a natural product.  </li>
            <li> The block of butter was soft and smelled how shea butter is supposed to smell.</li>
            <li> I can get 2 pounds directly from West Africa on the streets of NYC.</li>
            <li> also use it on my 1 year old that doesn&#x27;t have eczema as a lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s luxurious and soft.</li>
            <li> Far and away the best/highest quality shea butter I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely professional hygienic COMPANY.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over after bath/shower and my skin feels so soft even use it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have bought lots of dufferent ones but this far exceeds any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin so soft with zero residue.</li>
            <li> The outside bag keeps it very well protected and the inside bag has a zipper lock</li>
            <li> When you are in treatment your skin can be sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have already used this in several lotions and soaps, and am very happyvwith the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It made my lotion the soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on my skin it makes my skin extremely soft and supple.</li>
            <li> oh well, better late then never.</li>
            <li> I am natural curl lady and wanted something to help with moisture retention.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something natural.  </li>
            <li> My coily natural hair loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is heavy ,but still it gave me a smooth skin.</li>
            <li> product is the softest and feels natural.</li>
            <li> It is soft and smells just as it should.  </li>
            <li> Soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> My face looks more youthful, my skin is almost completely clear, and my acne scars are slowly healing.  </li>
            <li> For easy use, I&#x27;ve been putting some of the crumbly shea butter in a small jar for daily use; that way the large bar stays protected in the bag</li>
            <li> True shea butter has a comedogenic level of 0 on a scale of 5 of causing acne, but I&#x27;m not sure about the other stuff, so I was genuinely worried.  </li>
            <li> When ordering products that claim to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; it is hard to determine most times if this is actually what you are receiving as the product normally arrives in unmarked packaging and does not state anything.</li>
            <li> price is higher than many of Amazon&#x27;s other similar products, but there isn&#x27;t any waste.</li>
            <li> Research around raw shea butter suggests that it is non comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores), and that was important for me.</li>
            <li> THIS Raw Shea Butter is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a shot because I figured the quality may be just as good as the one I normally get and its way too cold to venture out to get that one</li>
            <li> The smell is decent -- scented oils aren&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
            <li> Meanwhile I have also used it on my face and can only highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was initially turned away by the high cost but</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky until it absorbs into your skin, but hours later your skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I had cracked itchy bleeding hands and one coating of this stuff overnight my hands were practically back to normal.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps aid in the decision making process for those socially conscious and environmentally aware consumers considering buying this, or any other product for that matter.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is really making a difference for us in these dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> I must say that unlike the last shea butter I had bought from another seller which had a bright yellow color and was hard as a rock, this shea butter on the other hand was soft and the color truly was ivory.</li>
            <li> A first time buyer can buy this to compare other shea butters to see the difference.</li>
            <li> You can break off a small chunk and massage it in your hands to make it applicable, though that gets old quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to, but the result of smoothness is worth it.</li>
            <li> The proof is in&lt;br /&gt;the pudding when the next morning your 10 year old son says &amp;</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has eczema and after trying every &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; cream/lotions in the store they just didn&#x27;t work, we also tried the regular creams/lotions and he would complain that they burned him and sometimes would cry.</li>
            <li> My face &amp; hands are unbelievably soft now -- finally!  </li>
            <li> They come and go on me so my doctor suggested I try a natural product such as Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E or Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and its bringing my youthfulness back, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with dry skin, diaper rash, eczema, or dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also have very sensitive skin and melasma to top it off.  </li>
            <li> The scent is odd at first, but after using for a couple of weeks, I like it.</li>
            <li> The only regret that I have is that I have wasted a lot of money on chemically and toxin filled creams from the major beauty product manufactures rather than using real raw ingredients that are not only healthier but also significantly cheaper -</li>
            <li> Like others here, I bought a few essential oils, mixed the shea butter and select oils with an electric mixer (after melting in a double boiler), and packed it in a wide-mouth (important) jar.</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick and rich.</li>
            <li> We live in ND where it gets extremely dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> They are so quick to respond and go out of their way to make their customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the ORGANIC RAW SHEA BUTTER as is</li>
            <li> If there is a knock, it&#x27;s only that raw shea butter in general takes a bit of work to make it useful in a practical way.</li>
            <li> I had this one first and then ordered the one in the black bag the next time</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils and everyone I have given some to all says the same things that they really, really like it.  </li>
            <li> I also started using it on my daughters sensitive dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> This is the first time I was buying raw shea butter</li>
            <li> so I stored the new jar in my bathroom pantry, where my other lotions and soaps are stored.</li>
            <li> It is raw, organic, all natural, and the consistency is just right on for not being too hard or soft.  </li>
            <li> and I just cut off the amount needed and mixed it with Lavender, geranium and some other oils into a creamy soft butter type lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is clean, and fresh, without a bad smell, and melts on my skin like butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pure shea butter in the past, this is the same thing I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to rub it in, it takes more effort than your usual lotion.</li>
            <li> I also found that once it has absorbed into my skin it does not easily wash off as other products do.</li>
            <li> Initially I was very skeptical to use it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the real shea butter or the other stuff that people have been calling &amp;</li>
            <li> The winter is so hard on your hands and really any of your skin but especially the hands when you are constantly washing them after chasing kids all day.</li>
            <li> Shame on you for trying to rip people off and charging so much for a 14oz small block of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying raw shea butter that isn&#x27;t mixed together with other materials.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is Certified Organic and free of all the nasty chemicals added to the store-bought lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> My hands were so dry prior to using this shea butter.</li>
            <li> This product is soft, slightly greasy in the beginning, but it soaks in within a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands constantly and suffer from dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about this product is the bag, next time I will get the jar as it would be much easier and less messy than the bag.</li>
            <li> It has been a few days since I had stopped using it and is just finally starting to clear up.  </li>
            <li> The other company I bought from was actually more expensive than this product.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have rough dry feet, and my skin is not dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> I used to spent big money on products like L&#x27;occitane sea butter hand cream, body cream.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was soft to touch but still firm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely sold on the scent.  </li>
            <li> the more I read the other (terrible) reviews on other vendors&#x27;, less costly products, the more I was drawn back to this vendor.</li>
            <li> I hate when all these companies try to resell shea butter since its becoming a big deal in the West and natural organic world now.</li>
            <li> stuff smells different on other ppl</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils I have.</li>
            <li> The color and aroma are the same as other Shea butter I have used.  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I had been searching for natural, organic products and ordered Organic Raw Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I shared it with ends of my dry hair, it drank it up.</li>
            <li> My dry, itchy skin drank it up too.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it to hydrate her lips and she has been using it on a dry spot on her face.</li>
            <li> I bought it to treat my severely dry hands, and it works.  </li>
            <li> I have dry itchy skin, it worked wonders without leaving that greasy</li>
            <li> cause he is plagued by baby eczema and has been suffering with extremely dry skin since birth.</li>
            <li> like that the company keeps an open line of communication and seems to really stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is packaged as a brick and will last a long time since a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> only down side is</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way the pic is from a third of the bar I purchased in a bag!</li>
            <li> It is so soft and creamy with a very faint nutty smell which is fresh and earthy.</li>
            <li> I get very dry cracked skin in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Small amount of this butter goes a long way, so this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Cured my dry itchy rough winter hands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to treat me grand daughter&#x27;s bad case of eczema.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy Shea butter via Amazon because so many of the products have bad reviews re: quality or particulates in the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> so I got what was expected</li>
            <li> &amp; on my 6 yr old Stretch marks on my tummy (twice a day)...they are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate so it is very difficult to maintain moist skin, but the shea butter is really helping with that problem.</li>
            <li> It still melts easily but the smell is too unpleasant to use this before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the raw shea butter in bar form</li>
            <li> This raw shea butter has made such a difference in healing and protecting my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am using this for making body butter &amp; other skin care products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of shea butter for years, but I don&#x27;t recall any other that matches how I feel about the quality of this one.</li>
            <li> but what a difference compared to other Shea butters.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to mixing it with some lavender or other oils.  </li>
            <li> cut off a small piece and placed in glass brown jar that I use daily.  </li>
            <li> No surprises, no mold, no funky smells ( said by other customers buying from other venders)</li>
            <li> I blindly bought this type of butter for the first time on Amazon based on reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter due to the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Lower odor than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is not grainy like other products</li>
            <li> but I prefer mixing it with beeswax and other oils so that I can put it in a jar and scoop out by the fingerful.</li>
            <li> Also so that I get the benefits of the other ingredients (coconut, almond, jojoba, etc.)</li>
            <li> I tried aloe vera from a store, but my face still burned--the bottle contained other ingredients that didn&#x27;t agree with my face.  </li>
            <li> Most of the others I tried were very hard and difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> It melts right into the skin and in this dry cold weather, the skin is just soaking it up and craving it.  </li>
            <li> but (please be VERY careful about who you eventually purchase from.</li>
            <li> I treated it as I would have treated a pound of butter made from cow&#x27;s milk and not formed into separate sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that it even had another bag that it was in until I saw the hard white plastic zipper imbedded in the product.  </li>
            <li> Its the creamy good stuff...not the hard yellow crap!</li>
            <li> My face felt/looked like a combination of raw meat and a dry, cracked mudflat.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> You can tell that this is a raw, unrefined product that has been minimally processed.</li>
            <li> The odor of the butter is slightly vegetable.</li>
            <li> I break it in half and put it in a glass jar and stick in in water heating in a pot on the stove to melt it.  </li>
            <li> It costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the one in the Black Bag that says it&#x27;s from Burkina Faso Africa.</li>
            <li> I will use up the one in the black bag and then reorder this one.</li>
            <li> Since I previously purchased shea butter that turned out to be anything</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not putting harsh active ingredients on my kids</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used it yet because it arrived a mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased raw shea butter from other sources and this was the smoothest, finest quality that I have found.</li>
            <li> This product must be past its prime as it arrived grainy, not consistent like the previous order.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is weird (since we live in a fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little &#x27;earthy&#x27; for me.  </li>
            <li> This item has a little grainy texture .</li>
            <li> A pale color and a little , tolerable sent .</li>
            <li> Note, this also works very well on my husband&#x27;s hands -- he suffers from psoriasis and this helps heal the cracks in his knuckles.</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since purchasing it on both my baby and me.</li>
            <li> Overnight, the inflammation, splotchiness, and itchiness that arise from our harsh Wisconsin winter wind was subdued and almost invisible.  </li>
            <li> Too much is wasted in the bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> I used acne washes, harsh astringents, etc...</li>
            <li> but the few times I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday and my hands couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Plz knock off a few bucks.</li>
            <li> but I prefer quality over saving a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve been duped by all the other raw shea butter brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, off amazon &amp; at market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the packaging because I feel that now I&#x27;m going to lose out on some product just to figure out where the mess is coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one of this organic raw shea butter is what you need to pamper your skin in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Always wanted to try raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this organic raw shea butter in the UV Bag.  </li>
            <li> The lotion goes on well and does not give my skin a slick or oily feel.</li>
            <li> and it came in a small block that I will probably get one or two uses out of it.</li>
            <li> it was a small cut</li>
            <li> No more spend money on brand name....</li>
            <li> I just heat it up by rubbing a small amount between my hands and apply all over.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is, the batch doesn&#x27;t expire till 2018</li>
            <li> A few times per day (at least), I  put some of this shea butter on my face, and neck and hands...and after my shower, I put the shea butter on my face and body...</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t as heavy and thick as the usual shea butter that are sold in stores or by kiosks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a product this firm and NOT GRAINY at all!</li>
            <li> I feel like the &amp;#34;pure shea butter&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought in the past was a lie</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what that is, it&#x27;s small sores that are located at the corners of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this one warrants one.  </li>
            <li> No more bleeding cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Very fluffy and frothy.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this Shea butter being hard</li>
            <li> I  like the way it&#x27;s packaged because it helps to preserve the product to keep it from getting hard.</li>
            <li> but it was hard like how cocoa butter comes.</li>
            <li> (Shea butter loses some of its qualities when exposed to UV</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled rancid SB before, this wasn&#x27;t quite as pungent as the rancid smell, but it definitely has an unpleasant FUNK to it.</li>
            <li> They [the bad ones] were always play dough-y, yellow and grainy, took a lot of effort to get it to melt in palms.</li>
            <li> My son is severely allergic to artificial colors, fragrances, and chemicals, so I have to be incredibly careful with all of his health &amp; grooming products.</li>
            <li> can hardly wait to receive my order!</li>
            <li> I am going to throw away every single bottle of worthless lotion I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> If you can not take a shower in purified water, at least you can save your skin with this shea butter!  </li>
            <li> Very very thick</li>
            <li> I got this for my toddler&#x27;s eczema and it made it worse.</li>
            <li> It still melts as you massage into your skin, but the graininess is unpleasant and takes longer to melt than usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for what it is, though.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Shea Butter.....</li>
            <li> I read on a review that they felt it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> Scary situation though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so sorry that I did not stay with this one (in the gold bag).</li>
            <li> Scary!  </li>
            <li> Does not smell bad like some do.</li>
            <li> I had super-dry, painful &amp; swollen hands before using this product.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I hate to put chemicals on my family.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> are unsightly and make me miserable with the itchiness and pain.  </li>
            <li> it now comes in a jar, the bag is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product came fast, was not old but fresh and is great to use on body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit grainy, but if I rub it between my palms it softens up. Great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this shea butter. I plan on making some homemade body butter. It&#x27;s perfect for those who want to avoid creams and lotions with added chemicals. I am happy I ordered through Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have used it everyday since purchasing it on both my baby and me. Great natural moisturizer! Will buy from vendor again!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter worked magic on my chilblains!  Overnight, the inflammation, splotchiness, and itchiness that arise from our harsh Wisconsin winter wind was subdued and almost invisible.  Within 36 hours completely gone!  Chilblains typically last on my face for several days -- are unsightly and make me miserable with the itchiness and pain.  A highly expense face cream did not do near the job of this product.  I am thrilled with this purchase of raw shea butter from Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
            <li> Its the creamy good stuff...not the hard yellow crap!</li>
            <li> Amazing! My skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I cut the bar into 4 even pieces and pressed them into 4 oz. mason jars. They fit perfectly. The quality is amazing. I gave my mother and sister one of the 4 oz. and they love it, too. I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions and have bought this Shea butter over and over again. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used Shea Butter before by Molivera but this  Shea Butter is much easier to spread without the grainy texture.  All Shea Butter has that nutty fragrance that some people find offensive, however the fragrance does fade after awhile and there is no odor. I use Retin A for facial  fine lines and follow up with either Shea Butter to reduce irritation or a new product that I also found on Amazon called Good On Ya  moisturizer which is ph balanced to 5.5.  Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I intend to use it for a whipped shea recipe that uses coconut oil and lavender essential oil, but it works fine by itself to apply to my hands and feet.  Fast delivery; will purchase from PBH again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema all my life and have found shea butter to be the best treatment to prevent rashes on my skin.  When my newborn daughter started to show signs of eczema I also want to use shea butter on her, but I wanted something completely pure and unadulterated for her delicate skin.  I tried this unrefined organic shea butter and let me just say that this stuff is wonderful - much better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I had no idea.  Even my husband likes it because it&#x27;s not as oily as some othe she butters I&#x27;ve used but is still very moisturizing. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> perfect for dry skin...</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD IT FULFILLED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> This is a great product. If you keep it in your cabinet and not in the fridge, it goes on smoothly. It is a little sticky until it absorbs into your skin, but hours later your skin feels smooth and soft. The odor of the butter is slightly vegetable. It is not ever powering, and becomes neutral as the cream absorbs.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. I use it to make body butter.  It blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great, Just as described. And arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> The best Shea butter ever..I mix it with other oils as well as essential oils for the perfect smell. I whip it for my hair and skin.  Smooth and creamy without all the  impurities. Can&#x27;t keep my husband out of it! A little does go a long way the pic is from a third of the bar I purchased in a bag! I have to keep making more for my husband too..I will be buying this again for the fourth time!!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m sure it is great!</li>
            <li> Wow, I am thrilled to find this raw, organic Shea Butter. It has such a silky moisturizing feel. I shared it with ends of my dry hair, it drank it up. My dry, itchy skin drank it up too. I noticed an improvement after the first use. I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil but love the less oily feel of this rich Shea Butter. I am very happy I found this.</li>
            <li> When i received my CERTIFIED ORGANIC Raw Shea butter in the jar i took a whiff and it has a strong latex smell, it is also very grainy.  I&#x27;m not happy with this Shea butter in the jar from Perfect Body Harmony.  I like that it now comes in a jar, the bag is awful. I purchased the bag version a few months ago and the Shea butter had a smoky, nutty earthy scent and it was very smooth.  I also purchased the cocoa butter from Perfect Body Harmony in the past and was happy with it, but not the bag.  Too much is wasted in the bag.</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff; melts easily.</li>
            <li> Wonderful consistency, good smell. Worked perfect in my products. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome body butter ingredient!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews here. They are spot on in most ways. The package arrived on time and was sealed properly. The raw shea butter has a natural, and somewhat strong scent. You should expect that; it&#x27;s a natural product.  It comes in a large brick form, like the photo shows. You can break off a small chunk and massage it in your hands to make it applicable, though that gets old quickly. Like others here, I bought a few essential oils, mixed the shea butter and select oils with an electric mixer (after melting in a double boiler), and packed it in a wide-mouth (important) jar. Now I have a more pliable lotion product, which smells nice.  The lotion goes on well and does not give my skin a slick or oily feel. I have noticed that the skin on my face looks more even, and I have less razor bumps from shaving, not that I had many initially.  Research around raw shea butter suggests that it is non comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores), and that was important for me. As far as I can see, that is true. Again, my face feels and looks smoother.  If there is a knock, it&#x27;s only that raw shea butter in general takes a bit of work to make it useful in a practical way. That&#x27;s really not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the ones you buy in the store. I recently had knee replacement and when it throbs with pain my hubby messages with the Shea butter. It really eases the pain. Also great for children with eczema.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Organic Raw Shea Butter. Delivery was RIGHT ON TIME  and the product quality is better than I expected. I&#x27;m using it to treat me grand daughter&#x27;s bad case of eczema. And I&#x27;m using it myself on my hair and heels. I will be a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li> If you need any type of healing moisture then here you have it! I use this on my face as moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. A little goes a long way. (Acne prone skin). I always use it to moisture &amp; soften my legs after I shave. &amp; on my 6 yr old Stretch marks on my tummy (twice a day)...they are slowly fading. Will be buying more after I run out!!!</li>
            <li> Small amount of this butter goes a long way, so this will last me a long time. I have not used this product on my face, just my legs and hands. My skin feels soft and happy after use, and i can tell the difference even days later. Calling it butter is very fitting. It is extremely thick and rich. It&#x27;s a bit hard to rub it in, it takes more effort than your usual lotion. But worth the effort for me. And I feel good about using a simple and organic product. Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter and cocoa butter from Perfect Body Harmony and both products are amazing - I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin treatment, it softens and hydrates like no other.  Excellent for your feet!</li>
            <li> This is the best raw shea butter.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy and easy to work with.  I mixed it with other oils and everyone I have given some to all says the same things that they really, really like it.  I know I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this Shea butter being hard and/or smelling rancid. Mine wasn&#x27;t like that at all. The block of butter was soft and smelled how shea butter is supposed to smell. I use it to make homemade body butter and shaving cream. Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product. I use this at night on my hands and feet prior to going to bed. The proof is in&lt;br /&gt;the pudding when the next morning your 10 year old son says &amp;#34;Mom, your hands are really soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it came in a small block that I will probably get one or two uses out of it. I hate when all these companies try to resell shea butter since its becoming a big deal in the West and natural organic world now. I can get 2 pounds directly from West Africa on the streets of NYC. I wanted to give this a shot because I figured the quality may be just as good as the one I normally get and its way too cold to venture out to get that one but it wasn&#x27;t. It was overpriced for such a small amount and the quality isnt even that great. Shame on you for trying to rip people off and charging so much for a 14oz small block of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I purposely waited several weeks before reviewing this product to ensure that it was up to my standards. This is a very high quality shea butter possibly the best that I have purchased so far! I use shea butter as my daily facial and body moisturizer and for any skin irritations that may occur. So I cut my finger it was a small cut but I used the shea butter on it daily and it healed up rather quickly and did not leave a mark at all. The only thing I would change about this product is the bag, next time I will get the jar as it would be much easier and less messy than the bag. Very satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li> Very very thick but it keeps my skin moist! I like it better than the liquid one. i have been using it with my pregnancy and it is working wonders!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend and relative after complimenting them on how wonderful their skin looked since the last time I saw them.  Both said this product is the freshest and best smelling shea butter they have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly wait to receive my order!</li>
            <li> Hi all, I don&#x27;t normally like to send my personal feedback as everyone has their own preference to each product. However, I am strongly suggest you get one of this organic raw shea butter is what you need to pamper your skin in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I melted a small amount of piece and mixed it with my other favorite lotions (to makes it more moisturizing) it works so good!!&lt;br /&gt;You can do many things for this shea butter... hair, hand, face, body. I used to spent big money on products like L&#x27;occitane sea butter hand cream, body cream. No more spend money on brand name.... DIY is always the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Packaged well. Excellent quality. Will buy again. I am using this for making body butter &amp; other skin care products. Does not smell bad like some do.</li>
            <li> love this product and how my skin feels...its amazing..would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;d be worth it to buy a pound of shea butter if I didn&#x27;t know the quality and how my skin would react. But it turned out to be a really excellent buy. This has become my go-to hand moisturizer and facial moisturizer over sunscreen. I reapply it several times daily because it&#x27;s such a pleasure. I take a tiny pot of it in my purse for my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve bought &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; shea butters that had an almost-gel-like consistency, that smelled a bit off, that just didn&#x27;t nourish my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t one of those. You can tell that this is a raw, unrefined product that has been minimally processed. It feels absolutely luxurious--the way it melts on and its natural scent is addictive. Also, my mid-thirties skin is drying out more often than ever, and massaging this into my hands and face has made a real difference in my skin tone and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this giant brick would last me a year, but I can see how I could use it up faster. Looking forward to that!</li>
            <li> I recently just jumped on the &amp;#34;all natural and organic&amp;#34; body product train, and let me tell you that I am thrilled with this raw Shea butter. The butter alone is exactly what I wanted  in a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t add anything to it. I just heat it up by rubbing a small amount between my hands and apply all over. It literally gives me all day moisture. I love it. If you were like me and bought body lotions galore because of the way they smelt and because the label said: &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;... I would suggest to perhaps think about ditching all the store bought and chemically loaded creams and stick with something more simple and natural. You will feel amazing in your skin. On top of that, the customer service is amazing. They e-mailed me to make sure I received the product and were very kind. Read no further and purchase this luxury Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was amazing, truly organic and soft to the touch. It just melted in your hands. Packaging was gorgeous, never seen anything like it. When I purchase more ivory shea butter, I know where to order my supply from. You guys rock!!!! 5 stars, buy your supply now people, don&#x27;t hesitate, it&#x27;s worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product -mixes well and is awesome on the skin!</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination with coconut oil and use it from head to toe.  It absorbs into the skin quickly.  It has a wonderful smell.  A little goes a long way. It is also good to know there are no added chemicals or perservatives in it.  I love this shea butter. JS</li>
            <li> This raw, rich, organic super-nourishing shea butter is WONDERFUL! My skin seems to crave it. I&#x27;ve been a fan of shea butter for years, but I don&#x27;t recall any other that matches how I feel about the quality of this one. It&#x27;s as if it is created with special care...  :)  I will definitely buy this brand over and over and over again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, a friend of mine had some and gave me some when I spent the weekend over at her place and the quality is beyond reproach and I have been using shea butter for over 10 years. I can&#x27;t wait until my order comes in.</li>
            <li> I havent had other butter to compare this to, but of everything i read, this stuff was perfect!  would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like it! I use for everything, everywhere, and at any time. The Customer Service is AWESOME! They would follow up since right after I placed the order, all the way along until I received it, offering a coupon for repeat customers as well. It will take me a while to finish this bar (it is quite big, and my understanding is that they will start offering a larger bar soon), but I am sure that I will reorder from them when I am done with this one.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve been duped by all the other raw shea butter brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, off amazon &amp; at market. They [the bad ones] were always play dough-y, yellow and grainy, took a lot of effort to get it to melt in palms. A LOT of rubbing. A lot of greasiness too. THIS BRAND is pure white, soft and crumbles easily, melts effortlessly. I was so used to yellow color that I was worried when I saw how white this was initially but it&#x27;s great! I have only used it for 2 days so far but can definitely tell its superior quality compared to butters (or whatever it was) I used before.  UPDATE:: 3/23/16 So my first batch was wonderful, so much so that I ordered another jar on November 19th, 2015. I was still using the first jar so I stored the new jar in my bathroom pantry, where my other lotions and soaps are stored. Finished the first jar today and opened the 2nd one expecting it to be just as good.   Whew! Pulling off the protective cover under the lid, I knew the strong smell was not right! I&#x27;ve smelled rancid SB before, this wasn&#x27;t quite as pungent as the rancid smell, but it definitely has an unpleasant FUNK to it. Consistency is grainier, almost like a white moldy substance on top. I scraped it off and while still grainy, the moldy part seemed gone. It still melts easily but the smell is too unpleasant to use this before leaving the house. Smells sickly sweet if you can imagine that.   Not sure what the deal is, the batch doesn&#x27;t expire till 2018 and I purchased the 2nd jar within a month of buying and loving the first.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% Shea butter! It is mixed with cocoa butter. This product is not worth the money and I don&#x27;t appreciate the disception.</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my own moisturizer and make-up items so that I can have all natural products that go on my skin.  This Shea Butter is the basis of most everything I have made so far and it has turned out great and my skin is feeling and looking good.</li>
            <li> I tried different types of Shea Butter, this is the Best of the Best! Don&#x27;t doubt it, try it!  You will not regret it!!</li>
            <li> I am buying this again, I love it so much. Great product, great company, great customer support. If you&#x27;re in the market for shea butter, get this one.</li>
            <li> Best shea butter I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  It&#x27;s clean,  has a great consistency and the packaging is resealable! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using shea butter and it far exceeded my expectations. We live in ND where it gets extremely dry during the winter months. We are using the bar as lotion and it works great. I love the fact that it is Certified Organic and free of all the nasty chemicals added to the store-bought lotions, etc. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with trying various skin-care recipes using my therapeutic grade essential oils. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product and how easily it is absorbed into the skin. If I need more I intend to order this again.</li>
            <li> My family loves this stuff. It&#x27;s smooth like butter and very clean! I&#x27;ve shared it with someone and they  thought it was cake icing?,that&#x27;s how smooth it is. I also bought the cocoa butter and I would buy these products again. I have searched for months, reading reviews and I found exactly  what I was looking  for in this company!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! it does not leave skin greasy and yu can use it on your face and it will not break yu out! it lightens dark spots, keeps feet really soft &amp; it has a light clean smell. stuff smells different on other ppl so i guess it depends on the person! :) Great to put on right after yu shave! love love!</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, butters, balms with shea butter.  This shea butter is great.  It came packaged in a plastic Ziploc bag inside a sealed foil bag.  Arrived quickly using my husband&#x27;s Prime account. (I ordered it on a Thursday afternoon and it was delivered the next afternoon!)&lt;br /&gt;Not grainy or smelly.  Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has eczema and after trying every &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; cream/lotions in the store they just didn&#x27;t work, we also tried the regular creams/lotions and he would complain that they burned him and sometimes would cry. My friend recommended using this and I have been using it for almost a year now 3-4 times a day and it works great! only down side is; It is like a grease/oil so it does get all over everything, it doesn&#x27;t smell to great, and it doesn&#x27;t keep him from itching but as his flare ups calm down so does the itching. I recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is natural and organic so I&#x27;m not putting harsh active ingredients on my kids skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my 1 year old that doesn&#x27;t have eczema as a lotion.</li>
            <li> Better then what I was buying at a whole foods store, less smelly. Works great for home made lotions will order again.</li>
            <li> This is nice and soft for lotion making.  It is easy to work with and makes skin very smooth. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic. I hate to put chemicals on my family.  I have found so many uses for it. So far my favorite is on my hair. It has helped to rehydrate my hair. It&#x27;s so soft and looks healthy. I like to use it on my feet too. My daughter uses it to hydrate her lips and she has been using it on a dry spot on her face. The shea butter is really making a difference for us in these dry winter months.  Oh and you get a lot in one package.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can do with it!!</li>
            <li> Wow! Where has this stuff been all my aging life? THIS Raw Shea Butter is fantastic. It melts easily, it is so creamy, luxurious, and has a fantastic natural smell.  I will purchase again. I am going to throw away every single bottle of worthless lotion I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer of this product. Amazon did not ship it after 7 days of my order stating they did not know if they had it in stock even though there were many units in its warehouse.  I called the seller who made an expedited overnight shipment to me. I was very much pleased when I received the Organic Raw Shea Butter.  It is raw, organic, all natural, and the consistency is just right on for not being too hard or soft.  A great product and an excellent seller.  I will recommend people buy this product, and I will for sure buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is smooth and melts right into my skin. It&#x27;s luxurious and soft. I hesitated because it&#x27;s in a brick, but it&#x27;s easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect Body Harmony has incredible customer service. Seriously, feel at ease ordering from this company as they want happy, regular customers. I misread and thought the product was \\&quot;FDA certified organic.\\&quot; After leaving that in a review with three-stars, the company contacted me by telephone &amp; email to explain the status of their \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot; license and apologized for MY mix up. Will definitely be ordering from Perfect Body Harmony again soon!</li>
            <li> Always wanted to try raw shea butter.  This is awesome!  The smell takes a little getting used to, but the result of smoothness is worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my toddler&#x27;s eczema and it made it worse. The quality was creamy and smells great, which is why I&#x27;m super sad that it didn&#x27;t make a dent in her skin condition. It&#x27;s too expensive for what it is, though. I would send it back but that&#x27;s a pain in the butt. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product and packaging.  Arrived quickly.  Would buy again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product! Never seen Shea Butter so white but what a difference compared to other Shea butters.</li>
            <li> I just recently received my Shea butter and I haven&#x27;t used it yet because it arrived a mess.  :(  I can&#x27;t get it out of the gold outer package because it&#x27;s all over the inside of it.  I didn&#x27;t know that it even had another bag that it was in until I saw the hard white plastic zipper imbedded in the product.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the packaging because I feel that now I&#x27;m going to lose out on some product just to figure out where the mess is coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***REVIEW UPDATE***  I have finally been able to use the product and I have to say that I am satisfied w/ the actual product.  It does have a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; scent as others have stated, but it is easily masked when I combine it with my coconut oil.  I use this product for deep conditioning my newly natural hair and I am very pleased :)  I will be ordering again...but maybe this time I will order the jar.  Fast delivery and customer service is great!</li>
            <li> I like each one that I bought from you. They are perfect. I shoes them it just because there rate. I thought they will be not that good, but when I use them , thy are amazing . And they came in the time as amazon tell me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am truly in love with this shea butter....USDA certified 100% organic, no toxic chemicals, all natural!! I&#x27;ve been using it to make my own body butter and hair masks, and it is amazing!! My son is severely allergic to artificial colors, fragrances, and chemicals, so I have to be incredibly careful with all of his health &amp; grooming products. I love finding a product that lives up to my expectations and is also safe for my child. Great price for a wonderful product, and if you have Amazon Prime, shipping &amp; handling is free. I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with dry skin, diaper rash, eczema, or dry/damaged hair. Order now. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased raw shea butter from other sources and this was the smoothest, finest quality that I have found. It melts so easily, with no lumps or bumps - just smooth, pure shea butter. Whips easily and very nicely as well to provide an excellent base for my lotions. Will purchase again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> First of all...I have suffered from acne and hyperpigmentation my whole life.  I&#x27;ve been taught not to use any oil on my face, since it might exacerbate my skin problems.  I used acne washes, harsh astringents, etc...all in an effort to achieve &amp;#34;perfect skin&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately, I also have very sensitive skin and melasma to top it off.  One day I decided to change all that.  I chucked my old ideas and my old skin care routine and it worked!  I decided to use only a shea butter and dead sea soap on my face(yes on my face-its perfect) and this shea butter to moisturize afterwards.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference that its making.  My face looks more youthful, my skin is almost completely clear, and my acne scars are slowly healing.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product.  Initially I was very skeptical to use it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the real shea butter or the other stuff that people have been calling &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;.  True shea butter has a comedogenic level of 0 on a scale of 5 of causing acne, but I&#x27;m not sure about the other stuff, so I was genuinely worried.  This stuff is the real deal people.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and its bringing my youthfulness back, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I  like the way it&#x27;s packaged because it helps to preserve the product to keep it from getting hard. It&#x27;s smooth, soft and creamy in texture. Mixes well with hair products and lotions...it&#x27;s the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased. it also shipped quickly, very pleased!</li>
            <li> We love this Organic Shea butter.  I break it in half and put it in a glass jar and stick in in water heating in a pot on the stove to melt it.  Then I add my favorite Young Living Essential oils to it once it&#x27;s cooled and blend it with a little coconut oil in my Kitchen Aid mixer to make my son&#x27;s eczema cream.  It&#x27;s so smooth after it&#x27;s melted.  I think it&#x27;s a great product.  I now buy it about once a month.</li>
            <li> This product must be past its prime as it arrived grainy, not consistent like the previous order.</li>
            <li> I love us using this in my body butters. So nice and creamy when I am done. I like way they package it to.</li>
            <li> product came exactly as described. I&#x27;ve used pure shea butter in the past, this is the same thing I&#x27;ve used for years. Very convenient and more portable packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Far and away the best/highest quality shea butter I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exceeded my expectations. I have included this product so far in body and hair recipes for my family! Definitely will be a repeat customer!!!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and using a trial size of a fancy name brand shea butter, I purchased a bag of this. I am thrilled with the product: it melts in my palms and goes on my eczema and fingernails just like the fancy name brand. It has the exact same amount of \\&quot;shea butter has this exact scent\\&quot; aroma that the fancy name brand has. It costs a lot less. I am very pleased indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my purchase in winter, so it arrived in a very solid form outdoors. I treated it as I would have treated a pound of butter made from cow&#x27;s milk and not formed into separate sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package onto waxed paper and used a heated knife to cut off a section about the right size for the plastic travel jar I had ready for it. It came off in chunks, which was just as well as I would have had to cut it up into chunks to get it into the jar. I put the remaining butter back into both bags and left it in the refrigerator. (Butter is butter, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the third time I used the butter in the travel jar, I found that being at indoor room temperature made it possible for me to press it down into the jar solidly for a more compact size and a top surface comfortable and convenient for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this excellent value and high quality. I will return to this seller when I run out and need to buy more shea butter.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and you can feel how pure it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I like the way it was packed.  First day i used it i can feel my skin is really soft and i also used it as my moisturizer and it really reduces the appearance of my wrinkles.  Highly recommended and i will buy more.</li>
            <li> always top quality. This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter from Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of the good reviews, when I opened it and used it my reaction was WOW THIS IS NICE! I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;natural shea butter&amp;#34; from the local natural grocery store, no comparison, this is softer and just feels better, less goes farther.  I recommend this product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Best Shea butter ever just wish price Was cheaper because i would buy alot more because its very  rich and creamy</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the real deal.  Feels SO nice and melts instantly on your skin.  I bought it to treat my severely dry hands, and it works.  Love it, don&#x27;t hesitate buying this product!</li>
            <li> Thumbs up! Will be purchasing more when I finish this batch.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I have not used it as much as I should quite yet but the few times I&#x27;ve used it I saw remarkable results. It Goes on smooth and stays on all day, the smell is mild (a very good thing) so it tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking care in packaging and shipping which allowed for a quick delivery with no issues.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I decided to purchase the organic raw shea butter for all the reasons listed and I was not disappointed!  I have been using it to treat my 15 year old son&#x27;s acne and much to my surprise and delight-it really works!  Also use it as a body cream and it keeps my skin feeling smooth all day!  Looking forward to mixing it with some lavender or other oils.  I was most impressed with the follow up from the company with a reminder of all of the many uses and directions on storage, etc!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my face great moisturizing</li>
            <li> Simply he best product I have used for skin care. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased with this product, was very solid and I was able to whip up some body cream with oils easily. Highly recommend. Comes in a block and I just cut off the amount needed and mixed it with Lavender, geranium and some other oils into a creamy soft butter type lotion. Worked out awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of brands of shea butter over the years, but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought. The texture is incredibly smooth, not grainy at all, and the smell is very mild and pleasant. I appreciate that the company goes to such lengths to ensure that the vitamin content is protected as well as possible (it works so much better than the processed stuff!), and I will definitely be buying more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: A year or so later I ordered some more, and this time it was very grainy. I&#x27;m not sure if it got overheated during transport and changed the texture or what, but it&#x27;s not the amazing smooth shea butter I got before. It still melts as you massage into your skin, but the graininess is unpleasant and takes longer to melt than usual.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever run out.  This is my new source for organic butters.  The package  was great.  Quality butters  Thanks.</li>
            <li> So smooth and creamy its just like butter great for my whipped hair butter</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Shea Butter.....very pleased with this</li>
            <li> This butter is the best…use it in all my home made soaps, butters, and balms….also love their cocoa butter too!!</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a choice of receiving the large bar or the jar of the product. The description wasn&#x27;t clear. Other than that I love the texture of the product and how easily it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful moisturizer, sinks into skin rapidly and feels great! It&#x27;s smooth and white and much nicer than the shea butter I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere. Note, this also works very well on my husband&#x27;s hands -- he suffers from psoriasis and this helps heal the cracks in his knuckles.</li>
            <li> My SIL got me this for Christmas. I have dry itchy skin, it worked wonders without leaving that greasy feel that my husband hates!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is AMAZING!!!  A few times per day (at least), I  put some of this shea butter on my face, and neck and hands...and after my shower, I put the shea butter on my face and body...it feels so luxurious!  I can&#x27;t wait to open up the beautiful shiny, gold, ziplock bag...and then open up the inner bag ziplock every time I pass by it.  I just rub a piece of the shea butter in my hands and rub them together and can&#x27;t wait to apply...I&#x27;m hooked...I hope you will ALWAYS be in business, because I don&#x27;t want to buy shea butter from any place else...I trust your company...Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but my nails are doing so well, and I noticed they  are much stronger since I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter. It&#x27;s amazing! Thank you, again!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this, totally raw organic!  This is an absolutely professional hygienic COMPANY.  I have used other organic raw shea butter that did not compare to the purity, freshness, softly scented of the one sold by Perfect Body Harmony. It looks exactly as it appears in the graphic (with exception of break).  It comes in the gold container and inside the shea butter is protected by another bag. I use it all over after bath/shower and my skin feels so soft even use it in my hair.  Just a lil goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut off a small piece and placed in glass brown jar that I use daily.  The rest I placed on a shelf in our pantry where the temp is regulated allowing all items to remain fresh for as long as 1 year. :o)</li>
            <li> Simply it&#x27;s amazing no Botox anymore... It is very soft to touch and melt in hand and I glow after applying... Truly incredible</li>
            <li> The way it looks in the picture, is the way it came to my house. No surprises, no mold, no funky smells ( said by other customers buying from other venders) no nothing, just 100% USDA organic Shea butter.  It is pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is just like  it is pictured and described.  It is the best I have ever purchased. It smells just like shea butter should smell, nutty. A first time buyer can buy this to compare other shea butters to see the difference. I give it 5 stars.  Great packaging.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is life changing. It makes your skin feel and look incredible. You can use it all over but I highly recommend your face too. It is also great for bites or scrapes. I will never go with out this Shea butter in my home. This brand is super high quality and is organic and raw!, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> great for making lotion bars,  looking forward to making my next batch.  arrived quickly with no hassles whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;i hope you do well in your business. good luck&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. You have a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with The Perfect Body Harmony Store customer service. They are so quick to respond and go out of their way to make their customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the ORGANIC RAW SHEA BUTTER as is but I am planning to make lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I read about many Shea Butter products and finely decided to try the organic raw shea butter-iyt is the best! I have bought lots of dufferent ones but this far exceeds any I&#x27;ve tried. Will keep buying and recommend it to anyone wanting a good product</li>
            <li> I scrutinized the reviews before I decided to purchase this product and I decided to order it. I absolutely love it. The best Shea Butter I ever purchased,</li>
            <li> Love it-Love it-Love it........</li>
            <li> Very happy about the product.</li>
            <li> Received on time, quality product.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is wonderful.  It has a good consistency and was easy to whip with a little coconut oil and cocoa butter to make a fantastic whipped all body &amp;#34;Body Butter&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s even great for the face. I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing shea butter and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love.  Keeps my 4c hair moisturized for days.</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE this stuff! This is the real deal. Packaging is fabulous &amp; this shea butter is exactly as they say. This leaves your skin so soft with zero residue. I plan on using this as a 3 part ingredient DIY lotion &amp; cannot wait! On top of this being an awesome product, this company goes above &amp; beyond to make sure you are happy with your purchase &amp; if for some crazy reason you are not, they will do what it takes to make it right. Do not hesitate to buy this! You&#x27;ll be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> Received my jar of raw shea butter from perfect body harmony enjoying the use of it and i will in the near future order more, the shea butter is really great thank you prefect body harmony.</li>
            <li> I love it... Melts like butter. Definitely will repurchase :)</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter I&#x27;ve used its not gritty like other butters and the piece of Shea was as described will def buy again</li>
            <li> I used this to make body cream.  It worked great. Combined it with Pomegranate Oil and Coconut Oil. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and purchased this to make body butter. It was wonderful... very creamy and absorbed quickly into my skin fast. My hands were so dry prior to using this shea butter. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The only shea butter I will order! Fresh and easy to work with!</li>
            <li> I love this organic raw shea butter. Its so smooth and smells so good..well smells like shea butter. I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I really liked this Raw Shea I mixed it with other oils I have. I use it on my skin and my nieces and granddaughter hair. I plan to purchase this Shea from here again when I need more to create my mix.</li>
            <li> THIS  WORKED  BEAUTIFULLY  IN  MAKING BODY CREAM.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I blindly bought this type of butter for the first time on Amazon based on reviews. I had bought some locally once but it was hard like how cocoa butter comes. This Shea butter was soft to touch but still firm. It was easy to use when measuring my ingredients for my body butter and smelled wonderful. It was also creamy and had great texture. No grit. I will definitely buy this again. I am looking to see if I can find a five pound supply for a good price. I did find one that needs to be melted and strained first so I may try the bulk one before buying this one again but only because I make a lot of product and need more for a bit of a better deal to keep my costs low for my organic products. But if you are buying this for personal use and dont plan to process it into anything else it is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency, &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; and color of the bar.  The outside bag keeps it very well protected and the inside bag has a zipper lock so it is very conveninet when I am scooping the product out of it.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great, but it is pricey.  Packaging is very nice.  The hard plastic container and the foil package both work beautifully.</li>
            <li> Cured my dry itchy rough winter hands! Quality product! Smells and feels amazing! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughters excema...smells and feels amazing! Definitely will continue to support this company!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  I have been battling cancer for 6 1/2 years and have been through surgeries, radiation and chemo.  During these treatments, while lifesaving, can drain your body, mind and spirit.  I tried another brand and it was gritty.  When you are in treatment your skin can be sensitive.  I read on a review that they felt it was expensive.  I don&#x27;t think so.  The other company I bought from was actually more expensive than this product.  This product is silky, smooth and hydrates my skin soooo nicely and it is nice to know there are no unwanted ingredients.  It has made me feel like a woman again which I cannot thank you enough for.  I had to order more because I know my daughters will steal it away.  Thank you for making such a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I made whipped body butter with this.  Pure goodness in a gold bag.</li>
            <li> The shea butter quality is superb.  I have never used a shea butter like this one.  It has a light smokey scent that vanishes quickly.  Much lighter than what I&#x27;m use to.  The texture of the shea butter is light, soft, and crumbly.  I absolutely love it.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  I found this to be slightly more pricey than the rest but well worth it.  I also ordered the cocoa butter and am not disappointed with it either.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make lotion bars.  I mixed it with beeswax and grape seed oil and the bars are nice, but I much prefer using it straight out of the bag!  It softens easily on warm skin, soaks right in and isn&#x27;t at all greasy. My skin feels fabulous! Using it all over - my hands and feet are usually dry and rough this time of year, catching on fabric etc., not anymore! The scent is odd at first, but after using for a couple of weeks, I like it. Just ordered 2 more bags!</li>
            <li> This is a great silky smooth shea butter. I find most too hard and when melted to grainy when solidified again. It also isn&#x27;t as heavy and thick as the usual shea butter that are sold in stores or by kiosks.</li>
            <li> This Shea is amazing. The winter is so hard on your hands and really any of your skin but especially the hands when you are constantly washing them after chasing kids all day. I had cracked itchy bleeding hands and one coating of this stuff overnight my hands were practically back to normal. Now I use it everyday and my hands couldn&#x27;t be happier. I also started using it on my daughters sensitive dry itchy skin and it is working out better than the store bought name brand lotions.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best quality shea butter I have tried, including usda certified organic well - known natural brands. I haven&#x27;t had a product this firm and NOT GRAINY at all! It smells fresh and earthy as you would expect. The color is truly ivory. And it absorbs into the skin quickly and without a tacky feeling. I feel like the &amp;#34;pure shea butter&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought in the past was a lie and this is the real stuff. Great price for such a fantastic quality. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product.. it works like magic</li>
            <li> Awesome. The very best. Super light in color. Smells awesome. And no by product. Perfect for making lotion.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. I have not used it yet but I really like the UV bag it is stored in and it does have a real organic smell. Plan to put this to use very soon.</li>
            <li> Love this truly organic product.  It melts right into the skin and in this dry cold weather, the skin is just soaking it up and craving it.  Anyone looking for the best organic shea butter, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best shea butter ever.  I whipped it up with some coconut oil and it is amazing.  Ivory color, not grainy at all.  EXCELLENT.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and gorgeous</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy Shea butter via Amazon because so many of the products have bad reviews re: quality or particulates in the Shea butter. When I saw all reviewers rated this well (before there was a 1 star review) I decided to take a chance. I&#x27;m pleased with the 14 ounces I got and it worked well for the body butter I made. The color and aroma are the same as other Shea butter I have used.  The bar inside the bag was good packaging because I could just chop it into the double boiler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is higher than many of Amazon&#x27;s other similar products, but there isn&#x27;t any waste. My only regret is now the product is listed as 16 ounces and I only got 14. It was listed as14 so I got what was expected, I just noticed the change when I came to write the review here.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the speed, packaging and quality. I have already used this in several lotions and soaps, and am very happyvwith the results.</li>
            <li> Great for lotion making</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased Shea Butter, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but what I received was exactly what I expected from the description.  I immediately opened it and made some body butter with it and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter.  This shea butter is beautiful and is well packaged.  I have used this already to make whipped body butter with magnesium oil.  This is an excellent product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product definitely lives up to it&#x27;s description. This product arrived packaged great and there is no question if you are receiving what you pay for. When ordering products that claim to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; it is hard to determine most times if this is actually what you are receiving as the product normally arrives in unmarked packaging and does not state anything. This is not the case with this product. The product arrives packages as shown with the words organic and unrefined printed on the packaging and if this is not enough for you the packaging also has batch numbers and product number on each package. Needless to say this product lives up to it&#x27;s description and is Excellent. I would definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is so smooth &amp; luxurious. It literally melts in your hands!!  It&#x27;s not grainy at all.  My face &amp; hands are unbelievably soft now -- finally!  I haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts either. I had super-dry, painful &amp; swollen hands before using this product. Now, if my hands start drying out, I just rub in a small amount, and immediately my hands look and feel better.  The smell is decent -- scented oils aren&#x27;t necessary.  This shea butter is packaged as a brick and will last a long time since a little goes a long way.  I only wish that I had found this product years ago.  I&#x27;m very impressed &amp; thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this brand of shea butter because I liked the low price and how so many other customers gave high, positive ratings. I was interested in trying raw shea butter that isn&#x27;t mixed together with other materials. My main purpose for buying this was to incorporate it into homemade lotion/cream recipes. It works great as an ingredient in mixtures and it works splendidly alone. I made a body lotion with almond oil, coconut oil, this shea butter, and some other things, but I think I like the way the shea butter works alone better. I have applied it to my face and love the way it makes my skin feel - I&#x27;m not left with greasiness or an oily feeling like what most department store moisturizers leave. I&#x27;ve applied it to my skin in areas that get shaved and found that it works amazingly for keeping my skin soft and non-itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the company keeps an open line of communication and seems to really stand behind their product. I received useful information on how to use this shea butter in an email. The package was sent quickly and the bag was intact and was double-layered to keep it fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of Shea butter that I have tried. It is far superior to the other one. It is light in color, melts easily, and is very clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just to warn others that might want to try this.  I had a severe allergic reaction and developed pimple like bumps on my legs, thighs and butt after the first night using this.  It has been a few days since I had stopped using it and is just finally starting to clear up.  Scary situation though.</li>
            <li> I used this in some homemade lotions I am making and working on perfecting to sell.  I tried a few different shea butters and this one was by far the best!  It&#x27;s so soft and luxurious.  It made my lotion the soft and luxurious.  Most of the others I tried were very hard and difficult to work with.  I will be buying a lot of this!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this Shea Butter. It is so soft and creamy with a very faint nutty smell which is fresh and earthy. I use it to make my organic whipped body butters. They came out so perfect! Very fluffy and frothy. When I put it on my skin it makes my skin extremely soft and supple. Its highly emollient and I recommend this to anyone who wants pure, real, raw organic &amp; extremely fresh Shea Butter. I&#x27;m sold! Will be ordering again. My only complaint is the price. Too high. Plz knock off a few bucks. Thanx... ♡</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the raw shea butter in bar form and I must say it has been outstanding to use on my skin. I use it from head to toe, literally. I live in a very dry climate so it is very difficult to maintain moist skin, but the shea butter is really helping with that problem. I no longer have rough dry feet, and my skin is not dry and scaly. I also use it as a moisturizer for my face in the evenings. I also found that once it has absorbed into my skin it does not easily wash off as other products do. I can tell the shea butter is still working and there hours later, even after multiple hand washings. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected. It is well packaged and shipped quickly from what I remember. I made homemade body lotion with coconut oil and I will never buy lotion again! The texture was smooth and mixed beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I use it to keep the Angular Chelitis at bay. If you don&#x27;t know what that is, it&#x27;s small sores that are located at the corners of the mouth. They come and go on me so my doctor suggested I try a natural product such as Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E or Vaseline. I tried all 4 and nothing worked except this Shea Butter. Don&#x27;t get the one in the Black Bag that says it&#x27;s from Burkina Faso Africa. That one is too grainy &amp; didn&#x27;t work as well as this one from the African country of Ghana in the gold bag. I will use up the one in the black bag and then reorder this one. I had this one first and then ordered the one in the black bag the next time and I&#x27;m so sorry that I did not stay with this one (in the gold bag). Really great product and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love being able to get  this item and it worked great in my home make lip balm</li>
            <li> Used with my EO&#x27;s to make a cream for family... works nicely..</li>
            <li> This is the first time I was buying raw shea butter so I paid close attention to the reviews to make sure that I&#x27;m getting a good quality and authentic product. I cannot be more pleased with this purchase. The butter is smooth and feels absolutely fantastic no matter what part of skin you choose to apply it to. I initially bought it for my baby cause he is plagued by baby eczema and has been suffering with extremely dry skin since birth. I have been using all kind of organic creams and oils on him with great success and the shea butter is just one more additional item in my arsenal that assists me to naturally fight his baby eczema (his pediatrician prescribed cortisone cream, which as a nurse I feel is criminal). Meanwhile I have also used it on my face and can only highly recommend it. The only regret that I have is that I have wasted a lot of money on chemically and toxin filled creams from the major beauty product manufactures rather than using real raw ingredients that are not only healthier but also significantly cheaper - oh well, better late then never.</li>
            <li> This is really a very good product. I had purchased shea butter from a different supplier some time ago and was happy with the quality but this one is much better not to say worlds better. I filled some of it in a dark brown glass container and sealed the other part in its original pouch where it is stored in a cool dark closet.&lt;br /&gt;The butter melts easily between my fingers and I can very easy and gentle apply it to the skin of my face, no rubbing or pulling just a gentle touching.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, thank you! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best shea butter I&#x27;ve come across. I always struggle with the morality of these purchases. I wish for products like this and the companies that provide them to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they&#x27;re exercising sound ethical practices by providing transparency regarding import standards and human rights and well-being attached to the refinement and exportation of this and other natural products like it.    Here are a couple of views on the refinement industry in West Africa:    \\&quot;A DREAM COME TRUE: Shea nut production in West Africa is more than a cash crop--it is an opportunity for women to cash in on their dreams and gain a sense of empowerment.\\&quot;    [...]    \\&quot;The Shea Butter Economy: Big Money and Exploitation\\&quot;    [...]    I hope this helps aid in the decision making process for those socially conscious and environmentally aware consumers considering buying this, or any other product for that matter. Our dollars are our true vote into society, and I encourage everyone to use them wisely!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My skin soaks it right up and it leaves no greasy residue. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and it&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this one warrants one.  I bought this shea butter due to the reviews.  Being a first time user of shea butter, I wanted the best cause it will be used for my hair and skin.  I am natural curl lady and wanted something to help with moisture retention.  Well, let me tell you this will be the only shea butter I will use.  2 things impressed me about the product.  First is the packaging.  It comes in a zip lock bag and outer bag with was impressive.  You can tell the company takes pride in their product.  The other thing that impressed me was the smoothness of the product.  It goes on smooth and your skin and hair will soak it up.  I used it on our entire family with no adverse reactions.  I have also received follow up emails from the company asking if I had any questions which was a nice touch of customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and customer service.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I&#x27;m so excited for their new sleek design and will be ordering more just in time for the summer! This new jar is so portable and convenient; it&#x27;s a must try for everybody.</li>
            <li> This is the best quality Shea Butter I could find.  Creamy and moisturizing, with a delightful fresh smell.  My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is absolutely amazing - I have purchased alot of what I thought was real Shea Butter from my local beauty supply and I have never had anything like this product - its pure unrefined Shea Butter that makes my skin feel so soft right after applying it - it doesn&#x27;t have a grainy feel to it - its just really creamy and smooth and has a nutty scent the way Shea Butter is supposed to smell - I will definitely be purchasing more of this</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer for hair and skin :)</li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time digging and looking into who to invest in when trying to purchase shea butter. I was initially turned away by the high cost but the more I read the other (terrible) reviews on other vendors&#x27;, less costly products, the more I was drawn back to this vendor. Since I previously purchased shea butter that turned out to be anything but (please be VERY careful about who you eventually purchase from. All shea butter is not &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34;), I was very particular about who I would purchase from next. As soon as i received this product, I understood why it had such perfect ratings (before the recently added 1-star rating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a quick rundown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent quality!&lt;br /&gt;-Soft, not grainy, no stench.&lt;br /&gt;-Melts very easily in your hands&lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a nice dark, storage bag (Shea butter loses some of its qualities when exposed to UV light)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely happy with my purchase and look forward to purchasing again.</li>
            <li> A very high quality product. Lower odor than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. This stuff is the best &amp;#34;deep moisturizer&amp;#34; I have ever used. I get very dry cracked skin in the winter time. Rub some of this on your feet and sleep in socks. Or use it in the morning after a shower and the warmth of your shoes &amp; socks will make it soak in during the day. Works great as a therapeutic deep moisturizing treatment for hands and feet. No more bleeding cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I read a million reviews for shea butter on Amazon before finally deciding on this one.  Not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever read the ingredients in your lotion?  Scary!  I wanted something natural.  Something I could put on my kids without worrying.  This product is soft, slightly greasy in the beginning, but it soaks in within a minute or two.  My feet are smooth, my elbows are soft and my hands aren&#x27;t chapped anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely sold on the scent.  It&#x27;s a little &#x27;earthy&#x27; for me.  I&#x27;m thinking of adding a couple drops of essential oil to a bit and see how that goes.  Luckily, the scent fades rather quickly and after a bit I don&#x27;t smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shared samples with friends, family and neighbors hoping they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I made my own massage cream using coconut oil and this shea butter... the massage therapist said it was one of the nicest mixes she has worked with in a while!  I&#x27;m totally sold!</li>
            <li> As a nurse and mother I wash my hands constantly and suffer from dry cracked skin. This raw shea butter has made such a difference in healing and protecting my skin.  It is all I use now!</li>
            <li> I love it, this brand is really good , I always buy it ,</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for the perfect shea butter for my homemade mixes. My coily natural hair loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell. I will buy from Perfect Body Harmony again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Holy mackeral this product is amazing. Beautiful Shea butter! Great consistency, no bad smell. Super moist and blends and melts perfectly. Used to make both lip balm and homemade lotion and both turned out perfectly! About to buy a second time</li>
            <li> I mix this with organic coconut oil and this makes a wonderful body cream for moisturizing my very dry, eczema prone skin.  If you can not take a shower in purified water, at least you can save your skin with this shea butter!  It is not grainy like other products so I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Well pleased.  I will be buying more.  I have used this for making soap, Lip balms, moisturizers, and soon will try for a deodorant.</li>
            <li> This item has a little grainy texture . A pale color and a little , tolerable sent . I used it to rub my skin. It is heavy ,but still it gave me a smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Love the price and quality of this product.  I use it primarily for my homemade body butter with essential oils.  Everyone I give samples too loves what it does for their skin.</li>
            <li> the second time I buy Shea BUTTER from this seller. ochen davolna, the quality is super, super dastavka. everything is fine. Thank you. recommend to all</li>
            <li> About a year or two ago I bought what I thought was shea butter from a seller on Amazon but what I had received does not compare to this product.  I am pregnant and have melted this shea butter  along with coconut oil and my skin feels supple and heavenly. . I must say that unlike the last shea butter I had bought from another seller which had a bright yellow color and was hard as a rock, this shea butter on the other hand was soft and the color truly was ivory. I have a much easier time rubbing this on my skin even without melting it. This shea butter literally crumbles in your hands and is incredibly malleable and creamy.  I absolutely love this product and so happy to have found it and will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son with eczema. This is the only product that has really helped his skin! Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;We are very satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Others have said it has a strong smell but I think the smell is very mild.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality and packaged to keep it that way. I use it for DIY body butters and creams and it was a great addition to the mix. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> First time using this product. So far so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and both times have been completely satisfied. The product is satiny smooth throughout. The smell is mild -- earthy and nutty.This shea butter is an essential ingredient in my homemade body butters, which I make for myself and for gifts. Everyone says it&#x27;s amazing! I tried using it by itself, and it would work as a hand moisturizer in a pinch. but I prefer mixing it with beeswax and other oils so that I can put it in a jar and scoop out by the fingerful. Also so that I get the benefits of the other ingredients (coconut, almond, jojoba, etc.) As an ingredient, this is terrific.</li>
            <li> Great smooth shea butter.</li>
            <li> My son got a deep scar on his forehead from being scratched by another child. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s getting much better. I also use it on my skin instead of lotion and it&#x27;s so silky and smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many Shea Butters and this is the best so far, no need to try any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melts in your hand.  Good communication from seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate packaging, I&#x27;ll be moving this Shea Butter into a different UV protected jar.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE This Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is weird (since we live in a fragrance world).&lt;br /&gt;The product is the softest and feels natural. It lasts on my skin for the day.</li>
            <li> Made some foot cream with this Shea butter. Very high quality. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good product. . I use it at nights before I go to bed.. leaves skin feeling like the way it should. . My only gripe is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell but it&#x27;s a very very good product. .will buy again. .</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter because it the best I have used so far.  This product is clean, and fresh, without a bad smell, and melts on my skin like butter.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. It was soft, rich, &amp; creamy. The company follows up and sends tips. They even accept questions. I will only use this shea butter. Their service and quality has made me a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great for the skin and my hair. This shea butter smells nutty and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Is great I use it for a moisturizer that I make my self is the second time I order and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Do you have a problem with stretch marks!?&lt;br /&gt;Look no further this stuff works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I do believe this is one of the best shea butters I have ever purchased.  Very easy to work with and make body butters. Will order again</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I had a wind/sun burn on my face, despite using sunscreen--I was told by a dermatologist that I have an allergy to the sun(!).  My face felt/looked like a combination of raw meat and a dry, cracked mudflat.  I was prescribed steroids and while I was waiting for the prescription to be filled, some friends told me about aloe vera.  I tried aloe vera from a store, but my face still burned--the bottle contained other ingredients that didn&#x27;t agree with my face.  So, I remembered my neighbor had lots of aloe vera plants and he kindly gave me one of them.  Meanwhile, I had been searching for natural, organic products and ordered Organic Raw Shea Butter.  Lucky for me, the butter came before my steroid prescription was ready.  One week later, using a combination of aloe vera plant and shea butter, my skin is restored!  I&#x27;m so grateful...</li>
            <li> I will reorder this again. Great product.  Family loves it.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer of this brand.  It is quality from the packaging to the quality of the product.  There are cheaper but I prefer quality over saving a few bucks.  It is soft and smells just as it should.  It is clean and it melts wonderfully for my homemade body butter recipe.  As long as this company sticks with what it has, I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I like this sheabutter i made my own lotion with other oils and it help me fade my strechmarks and leaves your skin. So. Soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> On time. Correct weight. Used in my first body butter. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - I recommend this for a body butter, luxurious and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Feels so good on hands and feet</li>
            <li> This shea butter is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, melts very easily.A great addition to your favorite moisturizer or alone the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> Received the product as described.</li>
            <li> Great product - very smooth, not gritty at all.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Last forever great purchase use it daily.</li>
            <li> Basically the best Shia butter I have ever used</li>
            <li> Wonderful will buy again! It made the best body butter.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it all winter!</li>
            <li> Good product promp shipping</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The shea butter is very easy to use in all of my homemade recipes using my essential oils, and a very light smell. I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this organic raw shea butter in the UV Bag.  A large bar of shea butter comes in a clear ziplock bag which is then put inside the UV bag to protect it.  The shea butter breaks apart from the bar easily and melts when rubbed in your hands.  It&#x27;s a great quality and feels so smooth on my skin and absorbs quickly. For easy use, I&#x27;ve been putting some of the crumbly shea butter in a small jar for daily use; that way the large bar stays protected in the bag and I&#x27;m not having to open up the UV bag and ziplock bag every day to get to the shea butter.  It&#x27;s worked out great and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brand.  I love it.</li>
            <li> very good product.  use it daily!!!</li>
