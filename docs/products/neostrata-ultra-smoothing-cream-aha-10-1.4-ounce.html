            <li>must have for everyone best wrinkle cream you will ever need</li>
            <li>The product is excellent.</li>
            <li>and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Have tried many products but like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Glycolic acid not printed on tube.it makes me wonder if it is in it.when it does not seem to do as good a job as it used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true glycolic acid girl...cannot use any retinol products so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Been using this for many years now and it delivers what it promises!</li>
            <li>The fine and not-so-fine \\&quot;character\\&quot; lines I have now, are also helped greatly.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Nice going Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is very emollient and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Got this the first time at the dermo office and am happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a product that does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>Neostrada facial products have been the best I have used.</li>
            <li>Somehow that one works a lot better for my skin, whatever ingredient is added.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a calming moisturizing cream with sun screen during the day.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years in the morning along with Retinoid in the evening and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li>more than i expect</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll let you know, love this use it at night.</li>
            <li>I really have noticed a reduction in fine lines and my skin looks and feels very healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now and the difference is huge</li>
            <li>The words &#x27;glycolic&#x27; and &#x27;AHA&#x27; caught my eye, as I&#x27;d read they were highly thought of for my kind of skin issue.</li>
            <li>So, significant savings.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it added anything special.  </li>
            <li>My facial skin is more even and smoother -- even the acne scars from many years ago.</li>
            <li>my doctor said wow your skin is so smooth</li>
            <li>using it for years  it has a very clean smell that use to last longer</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my brown sun spots/freckles but seems to even out my skin complexion overall, my face seems more even.</li>
            <li>so if you are super sensitive you need to build up usage.</li>
            <li>Never having had skin problems before, I didn&#x27;t really know where to start.</li>
            <li>After only a couple of days I saw significant drying in the affected skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered a large bottle from Amazon and have started using it on my face, with high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks to get used to because it is a little strong - but after 5 years I am still so satisfied that I use it every day.</li>
            <li>I have the same exact cream for daytime use with some SPF in it.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty bad breakout, and I am HAPPY with the speed of healing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done using the bottle and it seems to clear up my face.</li>
            <li>old cause</li>
            <li>Little goes a long way, pricing seems ok, just got the daytime stuff</li>
            <li>and if you can tolerate a moderate stinging (due to AHA), you can see significant results in a week.</li>
            <li>It is designed to irritate a little since it is full of AHA</li>
            <li>and I barely feel a thing.</li>
            <li>I wish I had know about this brand years back, but I have been using AHA acids since my early 30&#x27;s (55 now)</li>
            <li>It used to burn a little when I first used it</li>
            <li>The pimples looked less red and much drier.</li>
            <li>I recently had a pretty bad breakout on my upper back, presumably from working out through the summer in a very hot, very sweaty environment.</li>

            <li> After seeing if it would clear up, I tried a variety of obvious things - extra thorough cleaning, cortisone creams, extra moisturiser, witchhazel, tea tree oil, exfoliators, moving on after a couple of days of no change at all with each thing and feeling sensitive about wearing tank tops - the skin was looking pretty ugly.</li>
            <li> but my experience in conjunction with other reviews on here leads me to believe the major improvement is due to the NeoStrata.</li>

            <li> Much less in tube over the years.</li>
            <li> I feel like it works as an exfoliator cream that &#x27;burns&#x27; away your dead skin cells to give you a smoother face.</li>
            <li> This brightens my skin with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sun lover, have very few wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fail me.</li>
            <li> I hate to toss it out, but will only apply it on my neck and chest area, well away from my eye-skin after that horrible experience.</li>
            <li> THAT BAD,</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and this is a great price. On Neostrata it is listed at $44 and that is what I paid at the derm&#x27;s office. So, significant savings. This brightens my skin with very little irritation. It is designed to irritate a little since it is full of AHA so if you are super sensitive you need to build up usage. Nice going Amazon.</li>
            <li> I forgot to get the one with SPF  They should have offered both</li>
            <li> Neostrada facial products have been the best I have used. they are scientifically proven rather than cosmetically. I have dry skin and if you can tolerate a moderate stinging (due to AHA), you can see significant results in a week.</li>
            <li> I used this with my Olay regenerist cream and I don&#x27;t think it added anything special.  My skin seems to do well without it.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT IS NOT THAT GOOD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I EXPECTED MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT THAT BAD, THOUGH</li>
            <li> I have dark spot in my face and always wanted something that help me, finally I founded!!! this cream make miracle, my face is glowing and the dark spots are disappearing. Definitely I will buy it again.  Thank Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year. Definitely works for me! My facial skin is more even and smoother -- even the acne scars from many years ago. The fine and not-so-fine \\&quot;character\\&quot; lines I have now, are also helped greatly. Yes, it does have a distinctive smell, but it&#x27;s not horrid, plus disappears as it dries.</li>
            <li> Got this the first time at the dermo office and am happy to find it online. It&#x27;s the right combination of moisturizer and exfoliant for my perpetually difficult skin. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have the same exact cream for daytime use with some SPF in it. Somehow that one works a lot better for my skin, whatever ingredient is added.</li>
            <li> Did not have the Formulated with 2% citric acid  like promoted. the package did not have a seal. won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff my doctor said wow your skin is so smooth&lt;br /&gt;Lol</li>
            <li> Will sting your eyes.  It took two days for my eyes to recover from applying this cream in under-eye area.  It&#x27;s so expensive I hate to toss it out, but will only apply it on my neck and chest area, well away from my eye-skin after that horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I recently had a pretty bad breakout on my upper back, presumably from working out through the summer in a very hot, very sweaty environment. Never having had skin problems before, I didn&#x27;t really know where to start. After seeing if it would clear up, I tried a variety of obvious things - extra thorough cleaning, cortisone creams, extra moisturiser, witchhazel, tea tree oil, exfoliators, moving on after a couple of days of no change at all with each thing and feeling sensitive about wearing tank tops - the skin was looking pretty ugly. I started using Neutrogena&#x27;s medicated body wash about this time. Searching through my bathroom for anything I hadn&#x27;t thought of yet, I came across a sample of Neostrata I got from a drugstore last year. The words &#x27;glycolic&#x27; and &#x27;AHA&#x27; caught my eye, as I&#x27;d read they were highly thought of for my kind of skin issue. After only a couple of days I saw significant drying in the affected skin. The pimples looked less red and much drier. It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now and the difference is huge - I fully expect it to be unnoticeable to anyone but me within a month. It was a pretty bad breakout, and I am HAPPY with the speed of healing. Please note I was also using the body wash during this time, so maybe it was a combination effect but my experience in conjunction with other reviews on here leads me to believe the major improvement is due to the NeoStrata. I ordered a large bottle from Amazon and have started using it on my face, with high hopes. Looking forward to smoothing over years of hormonal chin skin and a couple of blemishes that just never went away. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a product that does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I use it at night. Just make sure you use a calming moisturizing cream with sun screen during the day.</li>
            <li> using it for years  it has a very clean smell that use to last longer i must be getting old cause i cant smell it after awhile.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years in the morning along with Retinoid in the evening and am so pleased with the results.  I really have noticed a reduction in fine lines and my skin looks and feels very healthy.  It takes a few weeks to get used to because it is a little strong - but after 5 years I am still so satisfied that I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and definitely worth the price.  I would definitely purchase again.  It absorbs well and my skin feels smoother.  I noticed the smoothing cream working immediately.  I like all the NeoStrata products and the smoothing cream didn&#x27;t fail me.</li>
            <li> I have asian skin, a few pimples here and there, old pimple scars, some dark sun spots, medium sized pores/blackheads, and semi oily skin. I&#x27;m almost done using the bottle and it seems to clear up my face. I feel like it works as an exfoliator cream that &#x27;burns&#x27; away your dead skin cells to give you a smoother face. Doesn&#x27;t do much for my brown sun spots/freckles but seems to even out my skin complexion overall, my face seems more even. It used to burn a little when I first used it but now my face has gotten used to it and I barely feel a thing. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. The smell isn&#x27;t bad. I use it almost every night. I think I will up my acidity level for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> After a week of using my skin is visibly smoother and glowing. I put it on at night after washing my face, let it soak in and then I put on my nightly moisturizer. Very happy with this product. I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> My dermo recommended using this once a day along with Retin A at night.  Definitely saw improvement with my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It&#x27;s a month since I have been using it and I can see changes in my skin. My skin texture is visible softer and smoother, my pores are also visible smaller.</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years now and it delivers what it promises! My skin is smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li> This product is very emollient and the price is very fair. Have tried many products but like this one the best.</li>
            <li> good aha cream and moisturizer more than i expect</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Love it. Great price</li>
            <li> must have for everyone best wrinkle cream you will ever need</li>
            <li> Much less in tube over the years. Glycolic acid not printed on tube.it makes me wonder if it is in it.when it does not seem to do as good a job as it used to. It is also much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, but purchasing it from my physician.  Now I am purchasing it from Amazon!  The product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true glycolic acid girl...cannot use any retinol products so this is perfect. I wish I had know about this brand years back, but I have been using AHA acids since my early 30&#x27;s (55 now) For some reason I seem to tolerate these products well. Little goes a long way, pricing seems ok, just got the daytime stuff so I&#x27;ll let you know, love this use it at night. I&#x27;m a sun lover, have very few wrinkles on my face.</li>
