    <ol>
            <li>return process to AmericaRX was a customer service joy, NOT!  </li>
            <li>I am delightfully amazed!!!!</li>
            <li>BUT the product is awesome.</li>
            <li>The color lasted well, and did plump my lips, not to a great degree, but I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These lip plumpers are great for the price.</li>
            <li>and it gets stuck in the lip gloss because its so sticky kinda agrrivating but its still a good product</li>
            <li>but this kind of tube and applicator does not get all the product, leaves a lot and is a bit spendy.</li>
            <li>It also has a tingle feeling, but the more I wear it</li>
            <li>This product does not make your lips any more plump.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many of these lip glosses but the brush on the one I just received doesn&#x27;t seem to keep its shape.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love my Physicians formula plump potion...</li>
            <li>OK &#x3D;</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love this plumping lip gloss....</li>
            <li>the shipping was amazing and the very first use there was a huge change in lips.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my lips and makes them smooth.</li>
            <li>I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li>Ok, so as a woman gets older her lips get thinner.</li>
            <li>i went from normal lips to plump and refreshing looking lips</li>
            <li>The first time I applied them to my lips, I felt a slight stinging which is good news!</li>
            <li>I was not crazy about the smell .  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all kept plumpers that didn&#x27;t actually plump because the color was nice, right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like it, it doesnt really give that much plump to my lips but its a good lip gloss the only thing that bothers me</li>
            <li>My mistake was opening to see if color was OK &amp; plumping actually worked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, skip this product, but most especially SKIP this vendor.  </li>
            <li>Its really sticky which I like.</li>
            <li>to the real deal..</li>
            <li>and.. well I don&#x27;t see much difference with my lips.</li>
            <li>Filled out the return, received Amazon&#x27;s notice that the vendor would get back to me.  </li>
            <li>It really improves the volume and texture of my lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since everyone is different and everyone reacts to things differently, I can honestly say this is  not the product for me - it might work for you and it might not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a typical lip gloss, doesn&#x27;t do what it is designed to do &amp; the smell is not too appealing..</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m getting older and</li>
            <li>I really smoothed it out, then it just looked clear to see if there was any plumping, nope!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like any normal tingly lip gloss but stickier.</li>
            <li>I live in city</li>
            <li>Response was an email with a return shipping label where I have to pay the shipping to return product I would have never bought in the first place if the photos  + the description actually contained the word shimmer or sparkle.</li>
            <li>This lip plumper worked fairly well, had very little stinging, and a very pale but pretty lip color.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying the clear soon.</li>
            <li>Is a low price item &amp; one would think that the vendor would really try to accommodate it&#x27;s customers</li>
            <li>This product is more like a thick lip gloss rather than a plumper.</li>
            <li>This purchase was probably one of the most FRUSTRATING purchases I&#x27;ve had on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with hopes of actually &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; my lips to give them a bit more of a younger look - it didn&#x27;t do such HOWEVER, I had extremely chapped and burning lips the other day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since I thought the reviews were good</li>
            <li> is i have really long hair</li>
            <li> Long story short, I slapped a sticky, thick glob of this on my lips and they were back to normal in just a few hours!</li>
            <li> The main problem for me was my upper lip is very thin and this lip gloss does the trick to plump it up as big as my lower lip....</li>
            <li> Not worth $9.</li>
            <li> and I need to track it down.</li>
            <li> The gloss is 5-star, color knocks it down to 4.</li>
            <li> I put it on, no stinging sensation, no plump, just a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> unlike other lip plumping lip glosses I have tried, it does not make your lips feel like they are being stung by a little swarm of concentrated bees!</li>
            <li> but this item is got not just a little shimmer to it, but a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color....</li>
            <li> my natually thick lips are getting thinner, not to mention I&#x27;m on a tight budget and can&#x27;t afford injections or implants.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but save yourself the $10 for gas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;d need photos - you&#x27;d think they know what they sent me.</li>
            <li> I was honestly shocked with the results of my dry, dehydrated, red, crusty lips and their recovery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> they stand behind every product they sell.</li>
            <li> The lipgloss is very thick, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of them don&#x27;t buy them!</li>
            <li> boo :(  </li>
            <li> disappointed in the quality.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a buyer who reads reviews and relies on them because I hate being scammed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Ok, so as a woman gets older her lips get thinner. Well, I&#x27;m getting older and my natually thick lips are getting thinner, not to mention I&#x27;m on a tight budget and can&#x27;t afford injections or implants. I bought this with hopes of actually &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; my lips to give them a bit more of a younger look - it didn&#x27;t do such HOWEVER, I had extremely chapped and burning lips the other day. Long story short, I slapped a sticky, thick glob of this on my lips and they were back to normal in just a few hours! I was honestly shocked with the results of my dry, dehydrated, red, crusty lips and their recovery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since everyone is different and everyone reacts to things differently, I can honestly say this is  not the product for me - it might work for you and it might not. Just keep in mind to age, diet, activity levels etc. as all that does actually make a difference when using products like this.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips tingle but they don&#x27;t give my lips volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 weeks now. I have the nude gloss. Its really sticky which I like. It also has a tingle feeling, but the more I wear it the tingle doesn&#x27;t bother me. It hydrates my lips and makes them smooth. My lips are already kinda big so it makes them a lil bigger. I will be buying the clear soon.</li>
            <li> smells like gasoline.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but save yourself the $10 for gas. Hhaha. I&#x27;m a buyer who reads reviews and relies on them because I hate being scammed. Indeed, the plumper is sticky, but why do they call it a plumper when it doesn&#x27;t even do what it says!?!??! I put it on, no stinging sensation, no plump, just a sticky mess. I use Lip X-treme, cheaper and actually works!</li>
            <li> I was not crazy about the smell .  Only used it twice</li>
            <li> This product is more like a thick lip gloss rather than a plumper. I did not notice any plumping effect at all. It&#x27;s very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a typical lip gloss, doesn&#x27;t do what it is designed to do &amp; the smell is not too appealing..</li>
            <li> The lipgloss is very thick, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of them don&#x27;t buy them! Personally it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the real deal.. This is a lip plumping formula. I have had it for about two weeks now and.. well I don&#x27;t see much difference with my lips. The first time I applied them to my lips, I felt a slight stinging which is good news! But after that I didn&#x27;t feel anything, which makes me wonder if my lips just got used to the formula, or if it&#x27;s not working anymore. I&#x27;m disappointed since I thought the reviews were good but I am not noticing a change with the size of my lips. boo :(  Two stars because the gloss does help in making the lips appear fuller, but that then again, that&#x27;s with any lipgloss. As a lip plumping product, no bueno.</li>
            <li> the shipping was amazing and the very first use there was a huge change in lips. i went from normal lips to plump and refreshing looking lips it was would look to others like i had went to a cosmetic surgeon and had work done.</li>
            <li> I had text notification on because it was a gift for my daughters bday I recieved text saying delivered 20min later I went to check and nothing was there. I checked everywhere when I contacted comp I got a run around told to look under bushes... WHAT? This is not easter and I&#x27;m not 5. Fyi I live in city no bushes around my house. Bottom line they said it was delivered and I need to track it down. If its not from amazon I&#x27;m not buying atleast they stand behind every product they sell.</li>
            <li> This lip plumper worked fairly well, had very little stinging, and a very pale but pretty lip color.  The color lasted well, and did plump my lips, not to a great degree, but I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not make your lips any more plump. Doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like any normal tingly lip gloss but stickier. Not worth $9.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of these lip glosses but the brush on the one I just received doesn&#x27;t seem to keep its shape.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the quality.....has something changed ?</li>
            <li> i like it, it doesnt really give that much plump to my lips but its a good lip gloss the only thing that bothers me is i have really long hair and when i go outside my hair blows every where and it gets stuck in the lip gloss because its so sticky kinda agrrivating but its still a good product</li>
            <li> I love my Physicians formula plump potion...I wish it was still available in stores.</li>
            <li> This purchase was probably one of the most FRUSTRATING purchases I&#x27;ve had on Amazon.  Is a low price item &amp; one would think that the vendor would really try to accommodate it&#x27;s customers but nooooo, not AmericaRX.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for Amazon&#x27;s guarantee program, I&#x27;d have been totally out the purchase price, shipping, plus return shipping back to AmericaRX.  I really only tried the product once but this item is got not just a little shimmer to it, but a lot.  The photos do NOT show the product that you actually receive.  Product is sparkly pinky coral &amp; goes on opaque fluorescent sparkly white.  I actually checked the bottom of the tube to verify that I received the correct color.  Yes, indeedy.  I really smoothed it out, then it just looked clear to see if there was any plumping, nope!  My mistake was opening to see if color was OK &amp; plumping actually worked.  Color OK &#x3D; NO, plumping &#x3D; NO.  We&#x27;ve all kept plumpers that didn&#x27;t actually plump because the color was nice, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The return process to AmericaRX was a customer service joy, NOT!  Filled out the return, received Amazon&#x27;s notice that the vendor would get back to me.  They did, about a day later they wanted photos with the product code, so I sent those onto them.  I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;d need photos - you&#x27;d think they know what they sent me. Response was an email with a return shipping label where I have to pay the shipping to return product I would have never bought in the first place if the photos  + the description actually contained the word shimmer or sparkle. No apology - &amp;#34;sorry it didn&#x27;t work out for you&amp;#34; etc.  Package is returned, +3 in shipping, days go by, almost a week later I receive an Amazon email notifying me that this very same item is being shipped to me. What? Why?  I double-check my emails, nothing from AmericasRX.  Then I check Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;return info&amp;#34; &amp; see that they responded within the case that since I&#x27;d opened the product they can&#x27;t accept a return.  Excuseme?  I wouldn&#x27;t know the details about this product not being as described if I hadn&#x27;t opened the package.  Now, if AmaricasRX had described this product as goes on fluorescent opaque sparkly white I wouldn&#x27;t have a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, skip this product, but most especially SKIP this vendor.  Yes, this is the longest review I think I&#x27;ve ever written!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t plump, but nothing does.  Also, color okay but this kind of tube and applicator does not get all the product, leaves a lot and is a bit spendy.</li>
            <li> Love this plumping lip gloss....unlike other lip plumping lip glosses I have tried, it does not make your lips feel like they are being stung by a little swarm of concentrated bees! The main problem for me was my upper lip is very thin and this lip gloss does the trick to plump it up as big as my lower lip....I am delightfully amazed!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color....BUT the product is awesome. It really improves the volume and texture of my lips. I like to use it as an overnight product. The gloss is 5-star, color knocks it down to 4.</li>
            <li> These lip plumpers are great for the price. I get instant results whether wearing alone or with lipstick. I have three at all times; one in the bathroom, one in my purse, and one just floating around the house and car.</li>
