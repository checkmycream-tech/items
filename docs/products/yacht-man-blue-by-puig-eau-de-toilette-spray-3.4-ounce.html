            <li>if you dont need strong scent it works good.</li>
            <li>Bottle is super cool, smells great!</li>
            <li>and unless it smells good it is fine.</li>
            <li>wow 4 dollar cologne for the win!</li>
            <li>This is a good and cheap cologne to help you get by.</li>
            <li>Great cover up, worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am strongly reconsidering restocking!</li>
            <li>good clean smell, delievered in one piece on time.</li>
            <li>It smell good, clean scent</li>
            <li>The price is very cheap</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent...</li>
            <li>They were very cheap too... about 5 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li>very cheap.</li>
            <li>very light scent...</li>
            <li>very mild and cost effective.</li>
            <li>nice for every day use, for instance i use it as my car freshener, and it works just fine</li>
            <li>, I love it</li>
            <li>you will love the smell, if you like drakkar noir, or rocco barocco parfume..</li>
            <li>It is an ok product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for the price i&#x27;ve paid..</li>
            <li>Best low cost fragance...</li>
            <li>He loves both fragrances and I love them on him.</li>
            <li>I love it on my boyfriend</li>
            <li>Cheap and discreet!</li>
            <li>and I now understand his love for this brand ..</li>
            <li>There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.</li>
            <li>I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Cheap.....Does not hold scent or really smell that great.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the others.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok and for the price</li>
            <li>This product has more water and alcohol than fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the scent and its durability.</li>
            <li>This is my second Yacht Man and its awesome.</li>
            <li>bottle pop top is not even functional.</li>
            <li>and I thought that it would be an excellent fragrance that would be good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I had never smelled this fragrance before, but when I saw it on sale for $3, and after reading the reviews, which indicated that this was the better smelling of all the Yacht Man varieties</li>
            <li>I do not believe the bottle I got is an authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have to write more words to have listed</li>
            <li>Me, personally l love the scent.</li>
            <li>I am sure peopke will be asking you what cologne your wearing.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>

            <li>i love it</li>

            <li>I love they smell of the cologne</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and I will be buying more see you soon</li>
            <li>For the price what more could anyone ask for.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Both of these scents are strong additions to your wear-every-day arsenal, and are suitable as gifts for acquaintances and workmates.  </li>
            <li>This cologne has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li>Hangs in there pretty good .</li>
            <li>It was my first time buying this cologne and the smell is so good that I will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PUIG COLOGNE SMELLS GOOD THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li>Most Excellent seller, highly reliable and clearly responsible.</li>
            <li>since blue is his favorite color he loved this!</li>
            <li>Not one of my favorite colognes, but it has a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>OK I know it&#x27;s extremely cheap but come on, within 10 to 20 seconds of spraying it on you</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
            <li>, it is neat like a flask almost, the smell is very light, but smells fresh and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Also came with lots of samples which is cool!</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and lasts for about 2 hours with 3 or so sprays.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get that if you want a really strong scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Is not too strong, but it longs all day.</li>
            <li>and it does not smell too strong.</li>
            <li>Perfume my watch seems focused, not as experienced as few can even speak of what I see its packaging could be more sophisticated, more beautiful and being in possession of a related name must have a navy nautical flavor</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift so it is fine not too concerned until</li>
            <li>but this one is fine too.</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Red is my favorite and is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  </li>
            <li>at less than $8 it&#x27;s a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>he wore it when we first met and it was in great condition and smelled exactly like when i first met him!</li>
            <li>the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li>Light aquatic scent that stays with you for hours.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last about 7-8 hours.</li>
            <li>I only gave it a two because it smells great...</li>
            <li>Not what I expected,smells cheap</li>
            <li>everything about this is cheap.</li>
            <li>With notes of tequila, lime and a hint of talc and linen, this cologne stacks up as a light</li>
            <li>For the price Id say a great buy and in the same ocean marine grouping as Nautica and  Tommy Bahama.</li>
            <li>Though it is relatively cheap, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>but I just like this cologne even though it is cheap.</li>
            <li>This cologne though has an outstanding fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This really smells nice on him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized there is no point buying cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>We recommended, some and smooth smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and airy with a rush of tobacco.</li>
            <li>a nice scent at very inexpensive price</li>
            <li>looks cheap.</li>
            <li>though it is cheap, may not buy again</li>
            <li>I have tried several other colognes for my husband that have good ratings, and we both agree this one smells so great!  </li>
            <li>This cologne is fantastic , smell clean, elegant and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>I feel very fresh when wearing this.</li>
            <li>Has a very clean, shower fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>The product is completely original, exactly as detailed in their publication.</li>
            <li>The scent may be a little too strong for some, but is still very good and legit.</li>
            <li>Nice smell but does not last very long but good for before bed or a quick splash to smell good for my wife.</li>
            <li>These product would be useful for nighttime usage since it&#x27;s strong and yet light on scent.</li>
            <li>it look like a original perfume you may buy in any department store, like Macy and Bloomingdale...</li>
            <li>I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li>, I dont know how long it lasts but for how great it smells</li>
            <li>It smells clean.</li>
            <li>clean.  </li>
            <li>This Yacht man blue is perfect for young kids that want to start impressing their crew.</li>
            <li>super cheap and</li>
            <li>specially keeping the discounted price in view.</li>
            <li>Bought it on an Amazon special for $3, bought 2.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li>if u need a quick fresh me up!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband, since I love Davidoff Cool Water so much and one of the reviews mentioned its similarity to it.  </li>
            <li>does last for 8 hours or so not as good as some name brand cologne but for the price this stuff works.</li>
            <li>Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li>You may need up to seven sprays if you want the scent to last a good portion of the day.</li>
            <li>The red bottle is also good for a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>not to good low perfume</li>
            <li>It smells ok if you can smell much of anything but lasts about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterall, perfumes are to smell good and last atleast 2 hours - This lasts 30 mins may be.</li>
            <li>If you want to have intense odor, you&#x27;ll have to put more quantity which is why it is 3.4 oz</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s someone like a powder and Cool Water type</li>
            <li>Good scent for male.</li>
            <li>The bottle and the box look cool..</li>
            <li>not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>This Yacht man blue has very light scent , very very light.</li>
            <li>Pretty good cologne but not not as strong as the red version.</li>
            <li>bottle is quite fancy looking but make sure you open the top correctly.</li>
            <li>very mild,and stays with you, I can not believe the low price of it, great value will be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li>More of a up close and personal smell with the ladies love and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Much more of a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent as opposed to the Yacht Man Red which is much more of a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>for a quick, I don&#x27;t care edt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>this not original!!the smell is not that what was once, and the cap quickly broke...</li>
            <li>my husband love it more than the red one........</li>
            <li>With 382 reviews about this blue yatch cologne, majority ot the users were very satisfied with their purchases..</li>
            <li>Good value for the money, large volume, the fragrance lasts a while and smells as good as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>So far the most I&#x27;ve used at once is four sprays.</li>
            <li>This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this product, this one is by far the strongest scent from the others.</li>
            <li>refreshing clean wearing daily scent that doesnt overpower.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s everything the description says it is very fresh clean classy smell.</li>
            <li>This is light and decent.</li>
            <li>i went crazy and bought some more i love to smell good ...</li>
            <li>Will use for quick runs to the store or after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Buttom line, smells great but does not last long.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a solid product, but it the smell is very light, but sometimes that works, am I right?</li>
            <li>It is mild and yet very soothing.</li>
            <li>think it just really smells of alcohol and fades quickly</li>
            <li>Cheap bottle, smells good but not last long.</li>
            <li>The open is also slightly unusual but it is ok not bad.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it lasted even long enough to still be able to smell it as you walk out of the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li>its very light, it requires about 3 sprays in order for you to actually smell it.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Recommended thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Its great for weekend wear or in a meeting where you want to be fresh but subtle.</li>
            <li>the fragance is neither mild nor strong and holds on only for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a somewhat classy smelling cologne for dirt cheap, this one will exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li>but I must admit Yacht Man Blue is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Does not last more than 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>first smell this cologne</li>
            <li>Out of 3 this was his 2nd favorite.</li>
            <li>But its ok overall</li>
            <li>soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>you will keep smelling fresh and lovely all day long</li>
            <li>I add these perfumes that are fun by the economic price</li>
            <li>so it will last a bit :)</li>
            <li>Not expensive perfume to give to a friend as a gift.</li>
            <li>smell is not really that nice...</li>
            <li>but it was my first time buying it and just wasn&#x27;t overall pleased with it</li>
            <li>This is a nice smell, but the perfume is extremely impermanent.</li>
            <li>Metal outdoes it slightly, but I enjoy the crisp sharpness of the Blue scent - not vinegary or ammonia-laced, just good quality for the price - and will buy it and Metal again.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as Yacht Man Red, but a close second.</li>
            <li>I really like it very much</li>
            <li>I like the smell,but it isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be,it is a very light smell that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>A bit of stronger smell that lasts long would have made it an ok</li>
            <li>For 3 bucks you&#x27;re pretty much getting what you pay for..</li>
            <li>I almost ripped off the cap until I realized how easy it was to open.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last long (~1 hour).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells good, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>good for price but scent does not last long.</li>
            <li>The price was easy to afford the flyer on, and I was pleased with the scent that Blue provides - crisp, doesn&#x27;t last very long at full strength but makes my laundry smell nice :)  more masculine than Red, and more complex than Black.  </li>
            <li>After this and you can only really get a strong read on it if you&#x27;re in any type of breeze, whether it be a fan or the wind.</li>
            <li>but no, i apply 5 sprays on and yes it does have a good spell i&#x27;ll give it that, but in 30 minutes you&#x27;ll have to put your nose directly on the area you sprayed to even get a slight smell.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent sized bottle for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>yes for the price it could be a very good gift but not really great!!!</li>
            <li>when applied it is a noticeable fragrance, very good for casual events.</li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD, BUT IT DOES NOT LAST LONG!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really don&#x27;t know much about colognes, but this one is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks you for everything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to talk it up so much they up the price</li>
            <li>THe wait wasn&#x27;t much as Amazon rectified the situation very promptly on holidays afterhours ...</li>
            <li>fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much you spray on by the time you leave you house</li>
            <li>$8.00 cologne really smells like a $5.00 cologne.</li>
            <li>i love it...as expected</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the smell sometimes flatters the whole room you are in....</li>
            <li>i know where to go thanks</li>
            <li>So, he reapplies when he wants.  </li>
            <li>thanks for your attention</li>
            <li>very flirty.</li>
            <li>ANAZON made them very affordable to all customers.</li>
            <li>Bought this cologne not expecting too much</li>
            <li>I ordered this product not knowing much about it and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>You have to practically put your nose real close to smell it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Got it for my dad for Christmas, much cheaper than the Walmart price.</li>
            <li>As the product description says it is &amp;#34;refreshing, fresh, masculine, sensual fragrance&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks Jose</li>
            <li>actually he wants it all......</li>
            <li>Sent fades fast</li>
            <li>smells better than expected but really does not take much fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;It destroys it&#x27;s cousin &#x27;Yacht Man Red&#x27; (read my review on that if you&#x27;d like) by coming across as a more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Nice fo everyday wearing.</li>
            <li>I am only able to smell it when I put my nose directly on the spot where I sprayed it</li>
            <li>First time I bought it in New York, it costed $35.00.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have purchased a new cologne for my husband online, I took a chance never smelling it but</li>
            <li>Such a fresh smell!</li>
            <li>LIGHT cool water imitation, but a great deal for only a few bucks!!</li>
            <li>first thing to be a little water down wasn&#x27;t too happy with the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>I have 5-Cuba scents, Polo Red, 2-Nautica scents, True Religion, and 2-Yacht Man scents.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, especially at the price it sells at.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to have little more intense odor though.</li>
            <li>Initial spray makes it seem like a full high priced cologne but after 20 min</li>
            <li>you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  </li>
            <li>and it smells decent,</li>
            <li>Along with this I have ordered the red one and I love the blue.</li>
            <li>And imust say this perfume is classic...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all the Amazon community.</li>
            <li>I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li>This lotion is inexpensive and almost does not last, I do not really like much, but if you want a better lotion should look for another option.</li>
            <li>My teen son uses the grey that is appropriate.  </li>
            <li>OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for going out anywhere, but an everyday use I feel is appropriate.  </li>
            <li>the red yacht is better the blue is mild the red to me last all day</li>
            <li>I cant highly recommend this because there will be none left when im ready to refill another order!</li>
            <li>i am new to nautica colonge .</li>
            <li>I got this for my dad for his birthday after many failures of trying to find something he likes (which was way harder than it should have been) and I can finally say I found something he&#x27;ll use and covers up the smell of engine oil from his job while not making me want to rip off my nose or giving me headaches.</li>
            <li>nice,but only last for may be 1 hour.its cheap so that what u gonna get for this price,i m not gonna buy this again</li>
            <li>A hidden strong personality.</li>
            <li>I recommended this one to anyone who likes a very mild but long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>you will end up destroying the whole top of the spray bottle if you try to open it.</li>
            <li>I have almost all of the yacht man colognes, they all have such a great long lasting scents and the blue is probably one of my favorites, but my number one is the red.</li>
            <li>but this one Is light and long lasting</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it doesn&#x27;t last very long, therefore it is a cheap</li>
            <li>Excellent scent that I would rank JUST behind Yacht Man Metal as my favorite of their line!  </li>
            <li>Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old person cologne.  </li>
            <li>Obviously i didn&#x27;t really like it...</li>
            <li>Not heavy cologne</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d spend at least $10 more on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast.</li>
            <li>it is really the same wiv d brand names</li>
            <li>I would not waste no money on this you spray it on  </li>
            <li>guess i wasted my monet and time even if its really cheap</li>
            <li>Obviously to use every day, since does not persist too much the aroma.</li>
            <li>it smells like teen spirit for atract women use it so soft so sweet and a litle bit bitter exactly the middle point</li>
            <li>Does not last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, there&#x27;s plenty of other better quality knock-offs for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>When sprayed initially it has absolutely no smell, but afterward a faint smell devolped, smelled more like perspiration!!!  </li>
            <li>If you guys are confused between blue and red i would say go for blue because the fragnance is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long on my husband, but it&#x27;s a big amount for a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>This a cologne I use regularly, the main reason why is because I don&#x27;t care about using all of it.</li>
            <li>the top is little loose</li>
            <li>, you can barely smell it even when you put your nose directly at the sprayed area.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild you can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li>The second time in New Jersey: $15</li>
            <li>I thought that It&#x27;s going to be good for daily casual use.</li>
            <li>Nice scent but very weak.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK product, not great by any means.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer a stronger fragrance like Drakkar Noir or Cool water.</li>
            <li>I live in Venezuela and really my complaint is for the way of packing the perfumes, really his sending was very costly, for future occasions with bag of globes and in one on coarse sewing</li>
            <li>Pretty decent late night club cologne.</li>
            <li>I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who&#x27;s exp dates are approaching.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last too long but it does have a nice fresh smell too it..not bad at all for the price</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell very much and it dissapears in a few hours...</li>
            <li>is not a very long fragance</li>
            <li>He finally had the nose for this one when he wore it a few times but went right back to the red.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really expect much less for the price.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product because of the less intense smell.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a long lasting one</li>
            <li>Okaysih smell and not long lasting</li>
            <li>The initial scent is good, too bad it does not last.</li>

            <li> This is a good and cheap cologne to help you get by.</li>
            <li> Great cover up, worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am strongly reconsidering restocking!</li>
            <li> good clean smell, delievered in one piece on time.</li>
            <li> It smell good, clean scent</li>
            <li> The price is very cheap</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent...</li>
            <li> They were very cheap too... about 5 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> very cheap.</li>
            <li> very light scent...</li>
            <li> very mild and cost effective.</li>
            <li> nice for every day use, for instance i use it as my car freshener, and it works just fine</li>
            <li> , I love it</li>
            <li> you will love the smell, if you like drakkar noir, or rocco barocco parfume..</li>
            <li> It is an ok product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok for the price i&#x27;ve paid..</li>
            <li> Best low cost fragance...</li>
            <li> He loves both fragrances and I love them on him.</li>
            <li> I love it on my boyfriend</li>
            <li> Cheap and discreet!</li>
            <li> and I now understand his love for this brand ..</li>
            <li> There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.</li>
            <li> I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheap.....Does not hold scent or really smell that great.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the others.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok and for the price</li>
            <li> This product has more water and alcohol than fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the scent and its durability.</li>
            <li> This is my second Yacht Man and its awesome.</li>
            <li> bottle pop top is not even functional.</li>
            <li> and I thought that it would be an excellent fragrance that would be good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I had never smelled this fragrance before, but when I saw it on sale for $3, and after reading the reviews, which indicated that this was the better smelling of all the Yacht Man varieties</li>
            <li> I do not believe the bottle I got is an authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have to write more words to have listed</li>
            <li> Me, personally l love the scent.</li>
            <li> I am sure peopke will be asking you what cologne your wearing.</li>

            <li> I love they smell of the cologne</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I will be buying more see you soon</li>
            <li> For the price what more could anyone ask for.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Both of these scents are strong additions to your wear-every-day arsenal, and are suitable as gifts for acquaintances and workmates.  </li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li> Hangs in there pretty good .</li>
            <li> It was my first time buying this cologne and the smell is so good that I will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PUIG COLOGNE SMELLS GOOD THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> Most Excellent seller, highly reliable and clearly responsible.</li>
            <li> since blue is his favorite color he loved this!</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite colognes, but it has a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> OK I know it&#x27;s extremely cheap but come on, within 10 to 20 seconds of spraying it on you</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
            <li> , it is neat like a flask almost, the smell is very light, but smells fresh and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Also came with lots of samples which is cool!</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and lasts for about 2 hours with 3 or so sprays.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get that if you want a really strong scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is not too strong, but it longs all day.</li>
            <li> and it does not smell too strong.</li>
            <li> Perfume my watch seems focused, not as experienced as few can even speak of what I see its packaging could be more sophisticated, more beautiful and being in possession of a related name must have a navy nautical flavor</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift so it is fine not too concerned until</li>
            <li> but this one is fine too.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red is my favorite and is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  </li>
            <li> at less than $8 it&#x27;s a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> he wore it when we first met and it was in great condition and smelled exactly like when i first met him!</li>
            <li> the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li> Light aquatic scent that stays with you for hours.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last about 7-8 hours.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a two because it smells great...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected,smells cheap</li>
            <li> everything about this is cheap.</li>
            <li> With notes of tequila, lime and a hint of talc and linen, this cologne stacks up as a light</li>
            <li> For the price Id say a great buy and in the same ocean marine grouping as Nautica and  Tommy Bahama.</li>
            <li> Though it is relatively cheap, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> but I just like this cologne even though it is cheap.</li>
            <li> This cologne though has an outstanding fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This really smells nice on him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized there is no point buying cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> We recommended, some and smooth smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and airy with a rush of tobacco.</li>
            <li> a nice scent at very inexpensive price</li>
            <li> looks cheap.</li>
            <li> though it is cheap, may not buy again</li>
            <li> I have tried several other colognes for my husband that have good ratings, and we both agree this one smells so great!  </li>
            <li> This cologne is fantastic , smell clean, elegant and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li> I feel very fresh when wearing this.</li>
            <li> Has a very clean, shower fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> The product is completely original, exactly as detailed in their publication.</li>
            <li> The scent may be a little too strong for some, but is still very good and legit.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but does not last very long but good for before bed or a quick splash to smell good for my wife.</li>
            <li> These product would be useful for nighttime usage since it&#x27;s strong and yet light on scent.</li>
            <li> it look like a original perfume you may buy in any department store, like Macy and Bloomingdale...</li>
            <li> I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li> , I dont know how long it lasts but for how great it smells</li>
            <li> It smells clean.</li>
            <li> clean.  </li>
            <li> This Yacht man blue is perfect for young kids that want to start impressing their crew.</li>
            <li> super cheap and</li>
            <li> specially keeping the discounted price in view.</li>
            <li> Bought it on an Amazon special for $3, bought 2.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> if u need a quick fresh me up!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband, since I love Davidoff Cool Water so much and one of the reviews mentioned its similarity to it.  </li>
            <li> does last for 8 hours or so not as good as some name brand cologne but for the price this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li> You may need up to seven sprays if you want the scent to last a good portion of the day.</li>
            <li> The red bottle is also good for a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> not to good low perfume</li>
            <li> It smells ok if you can smell much of anything but lasts about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterall, perfumes are to smell good and last atleast 2 hours - This lasts 30 mins may be.</li>
            <li> If you want to have intense odor, you&#x27;ll have to put more quantity which is why it is 3.4 oz</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s someone like a powder and Cool Water type</li>
            <li> Good scent for male.</li>
            <li> The bottle and the box look cool..</li>
            <li> not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> This Yacht man blue has very light scent , very very light.</li>
            <li> Pretty good cologne but not not as strong as the red version.</li>
            <li> bottle is quite fancy looking but make sure you open the top correctly.</li>
            <li> very mild,and stays with you, I can not believe the low price of it, great value will be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> More of a up close and personal smell with the ladies love and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Much more of a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent as opposed to the Yacht Man Red which is much more of a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> for a quick, I don&#x27;t care edt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> this not original!!the smell is not that what was once, and the cap quickly broke...</li>
            <li> my husband love it more than the red one........</li>
            <li> With 382 reviews about this blue yatch cologne, majority ot the users were very satisfied with their purchases..</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, large volume, the fragrance lasts a while and smells as good as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> So far the most I&#x27;ve used at once is four sprays.</li>
            <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this one is by far the strongest scent from the others.</li>
            <li> refreshing clean wearing daily scent that doesnt overpower.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s everything the description says it is very fresh clean classy smell.</li>
            <li> This is light and decent.</li>
            <li> i went crazy and bought some more i love to smell good ...</li>
            <li> Will use for quick runs to the store or after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Buttom line, smells great but does not last long.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a solid product, but it the smell is very light, but sometimes that works, am I right?</li>
            <li> It is mild and yet very soothing.</li>
            <li> think it just really smells of alcohol and fades quickly</li>
            <li> Cheap bottle, smells good but not last long.</li>
            <li> The open is also slightly unusual but it is ok not bad.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it lasted even long enough to still be able to smell it as you walk out of the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li> its very light, it requires about 3 sprays in order for you to actually smell it.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Recommended thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Its great for weekend wear or in a meeting where you want to be fresh but subtle.</li>
            <li> the fragance is neither mild nor strong and holds on only for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a somewhat classy smelling cologne for dirt cheap, this one will exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> but I must admit Yacht Man Blue is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Does not last more than 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> first smell this cologne</li>
            <li> Out of 3 this was his 2nd favorite.</li>
            <li> But its ok overall</li>
            <li> soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> you will keep smelling fresh and lovely all day long</li>
            <li> I add these perfumes that are fun by the economic price</li>
            <li> so it will last a bit :)</li>
            <li> Not expensive perfume to give to a friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> smell is not really that nice...</li>
            <li> but it was my first time buying it and just wasn&#x27;t overall pleased with it</li>
            <li> This is a nice smell, but the perfume is extremely impermanent.</li>
            <li> Metal outdoes it slightly, but I enjoy the crisp sharpness of the Blue scent - not vinegary or ammonia-laced, just good quality for the price - and will buy it and Metal again.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as Yacht Man Red, but a close second.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much</li>
            <li> I like the smell,but it isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be,it is a very light smell that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> A bit of stronger smell that lasts long would have made it an ok</li>
            <li> For 3 bucks you&#x27;re pretty much getting what you pay for..</li>
            <li> I almost ripped off the cap until I realized how easy it was to open.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last long (~1 hour).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> good for price but scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> The price was easy to afford the flyer on, and I was pleased with the scent that Blue provides - crisp, doesn&#x27;t last very long at full strength but makes my laundry smell nice :)  more masculine than Red, and more complex than Black.  </li>
            <li> After this and you can only really get a strong read on it if you&#x27;re in any type of breeze, whether it be a fan or the wind.</li>
            <li> but no, i apply 5 sprays on and yes it does have a good spell i&#x27;ll give it that, but in 30 minutes you&#x27;ll have to put your nose directly on the area you sprayed to even get a slight smell.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent sized bottle for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> yes for the price it could be a very good gift but not really great!!!</li>
            <li> when applied it is a noticeable fragrance, very good for casual events.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD, BUT IT DOES NOT LAST LONG!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really don&#x27;t know much about colognes, but this one is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks you for everything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to talk it up so much they up the price</li>
            <li> THe wait wasn&#x27;t much as Amazon rectified the situation very promptly on holidays afterhours ...</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much you spray on by the time you leave you house</li>
            <li> $8.00 cologne really smells like a $5.00 cologne.</li>
            <li> i love it...as expected</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> the smell sometimes flatters the whole room you are in....</li>
            <li> i know where to go thanks</li>
            <li> So, he reapplies when he wants.  </li>
            <li> thanks for your attention</li>
            <li> very flirty.</li>
            <li> ANAZON made them very affordable to all customers.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne not expecting too much</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not knowing much about it and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> You have to practically put your nose real close to smell it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Got it for my dad for Christmas, much cheaper than the Walmart price.</li>
            <li> As the product description says it is &amp;#34;refreshing, fresh, masculine, sensual fragrance&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks Jose</li>
            <li> actually he wants it all......</li>
            <li> Sent fades fast</li>
            <li> smells better than expected but really does not take much fragrance</li>
            <li> /&gt;It destroys it&#x27;s cousin &#x27;Yacht Man Red&#x27; (read my review on that if you&#x27;d like) by coming across as a more masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Nice fo everyday wearing.</li>
            <li> I am only able to smell it when I put my nose directly on the spot where I sprayed it</li>
            <li> First time I bought it in New York, it costed $35.00.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased a new cologne for my husband online, I took a chance never smelling it but</li>
            <li> Such a fresh smell!</li>
            <li> LIGHT cool water imitation, but a great deal for only a few bucks!!</li>
            <li> first thing to be a little water down wasn&#x27;t too happy with the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> I have 5-Cuba scents, Polo Red, 2-Nautica scents, True Religion, and 2-Yacht Man scents.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, especially at the price it sells at.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have little more intense odor though.</li>
            <li> Initial spray makes it seem like a full high priced cologne but after 20 min</li>
            <li> you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  </li>
            <li> and it smells decent,</li>
            <li> Along with this I have ordered the red one and I love the blue.</li>
            <li> And imust say this perfume is classic...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all the Amazon community.</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> This lotion is inexpensive and almost does not last, I do not really like much, but if you want a better lotion should look for another option.</li>
            <li> My teen son uses the grey that is appropriate.  </li>
            <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for going out anywhere, but an everyday use I feel is appropriate.  </li>
            <li> the red yacht is better the blue is mild the red to me last all day</li>
            <li> I cant highly recommend this because there will be none left when im ready to refill another order!</li>
            <li> i am new to nautica colonge .</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad for his birthday after many failures of trying to find something he likes (which was way harder than it should have been) and I can finally say I found something he&#x27;ll use and covers up the smell of engine oil from his job while not making me want to rip off my nose or giving me headaches.</li>
            <li> nice,but only last for may be 1 hour.its cheap so that what u gonna get for this price,i m not gonna buy this again</li>
            <li> A hidden strong personality.</li>
            <li> I recommended this one to anyone who likes a very mild but long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> you will end up destroying the whole top of the spray bottle if you try to open it.</li>
            <li> I have almost all of the yacht man colognes, they all have such a great long lasting scents and the blue is probably one of my favorites, but my number one is the red.</li>
            <li> but this one Is light and long lasting</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it doesn&#x27;t last very long, therefore it is a cheap</li>
            <li> Excellent scent that I would rank JUST behind Yacht Man Metal as my favorite of their line!  </li>
            <li> Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  </li>
            <li> It smells like an old person cologne.  </li>
            <li> Obviously i didn&#x27;t really like it...</li>
            <li> Not heavy cologne</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from Amazon</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d spend at least $10 more on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast.</li>
            <li> it is really the same wiv d brand names</li>
            <li> I would not waste no money on this you spray it on  </li>
            <li> guess i wasted my monet and time even if its really cheap</li>
            <li> Obviously to use every day, since does not persist too much the aroma.</li>
            <li> it smells like teen spirit for atract women use it so soft so sweet and a litle bit bitter exactly the middle point</li>
            <li> Does not last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, there&#x27;s plenty of other better quality knock-offs for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> When sprayed initially it has absolutely no smell, but afterward a faint smell devolped, smelled more like perspiration!!!  </li>
            <li> If you guys are confused between blue and red i would say go for blue because the fragnance is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long on my husband, but it&#x27;s a big amount for a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> This a cologne I use regularly, the main reason why is because I don&#x27;t care about using all of it.</li>
            <li> the top is little loose</li>
            <li> , you can barely smell it even when you put your nose directly at the sprayed area.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild you can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> The second time in New Jersey: $15</li>
            <li> I thought that It&#x27;s going to be good for daily casual use.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but very weak.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK product, not great by any means.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a stronger fragrance like Drakkar Noir or Cool water.</li>
            <li> I live in Venezuela and really my complaint is for the way of packing the perfumes, really his sending was very costly, for future occasions with bag of globes and in one on coarse sewing</li>
            <li> Pretty decent late night club cologne.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who&#x27;s exp dates are approaching.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long but it does have a nice fresh smell too it..not bad at all for the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell very much and it dissapears in a few hours...</li>
            <li> is not a very long fragance</li>
            <li> He finally had the nose for this one when he wore it a few times but went right back to the red.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t really expect much less for the price.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product because of the less intense smell.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a long lasting one</li>
            <li> Okaysih smell and not long lasting</li>
            <li> The initial scent is good, too bad it does not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong but very subtle once your nose notice it</li>
            <li> Smels like a soap, longevity is very poor about 1.5 houres, there are better products for the same price range, nautica, victorynox and some others.</li>
            <li> , only downfall is that is does NOT last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> Scent on this one does not last that long and is quite understated.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This scent doesn&#x27;t really last long</li>
            <li> The smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> last long (&amp;#60;1 hour)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li> did not last long after the spray, maybe this version</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Yacht man Blue was purchased on a whim, due to its low, low price.  </li>
            <li> The smell does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> There was also a slight leakage but thts fine but definitely not good quality.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is good , but it doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather buy the fake ones from Walgreens , which at least lasts on your body.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t last real long.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay forever like pricy fragrance till the 2-3 wash but is fine when you are out casual for a walk or get together with friends or family.</li>
            <li> It has the same quality what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close but not as long standing...</li>
            <li> and It does not smell for long, get another fragance</li>
            <li> This is clearly not build for mamba samba or party time.</li>
            <li> my review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to pass on this one for work out long outings, due to it not lasting long.</li>
            <li> I purchased it and several other Yacht Man cologne fragrances.</li>
            <li> For 24 American quarters (3.4 oz, Nov &#x27;11, $6), this cologne will probably beat out any other for that price.</li>
            <li> Tried this due to the low price.  </li>
            <li> Although i only paid $7.00 for it (including shipping), it was NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> last about half an hour</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see the value of a scent that does not last even for a half a day.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little extra and get something with some frangrance oils to it.</li>
            <li> scent fades away sooner than expected</li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It has that classy but subtle smell to it, which is why I am rating this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why other people give this 5 stars or 4 stars.</li>
            <li> he used other sprays</li>
            <li> Due to the diversity of its&#x27; use, I would consider this being a love/hate type of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> see other review.</li>
            <li> When i spray it on, my wife can smell it in the other room.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> Not really worth using, it&#x27;s like after shave.</li>
            <li> Terrible scent, does not smell good.</li>
            <li> Smell Is real weak and doesn&#x27;t last long at all&lt;br /&gt;I spread it for two days in a row and the same affect</li>
            <li> You just have to press down on that lever on the side of the cap.</li>
            <li> This stuff if fake it lasts for about 10 minutes its all alcohol and no long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the other scents from this brand, but this one is a waste.</li>
            <li> Max till 1 hour that too at the exact area where you applied this.. bought it for daily use purpose but highly disappointed..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through half a bottle already just trying to keep some sense of the fragrance on me--way too futile and a waste of time and product.  </li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last long  not worthy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i do not know what the problem is but looks like it might leak if the bottle is little bit tilted.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells a little like Coolwater.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I buy alot of cologne and this is a WASTE of money (even at 5 dollars)  </li>
            <li> i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job</li>
            <li> I got this for $3.47 and still feel like I wasted money on this...</li>
            <li> I do not like smelling like I have a green cloud around me.</li>
            <li> good afternoon I am writing to express my disappointment with the product http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B0X05U/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2, which acquired and then try note its poor quality, unfortunately I am in Venezuela</li>
            <li> but I wonder if they could do something to change the product because applying the fragance a few minutes</li>
            <li> stays on for a few hours .</li>
            <li> so I took a $5 chance and wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a waste of money(and time).  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> * IS A WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I THREW IT IN THE PALE</li>
            <li> This cologne is not strong.</li>
            <li> I like it even though it&#x27;s not really strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong cologne.</li>
            <li> i tame</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this fragance, it&#x27;s so ordinary</li>
            <li> This product is of poor quality, I buy a gift for my husband and not smell anything or is very old and the smell dissipated or is an imitation, so I&#x27;m upset buy two perfumes that are useless</li>
            <li> Smell very weak and won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I am gonna do with it.</li>
            <li> Just wasted my money!</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> really is the worst perfume that I bought, acquired with the idea of ​​giving it away and do not dare because I embarrassed a fragrance that does not last anything or 5 min.</li>
            <li> and I certainly wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> in this case, it is hard to beat at any price....</li>
            <li> The packaging looks not real as in it looks fake.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Blue by far was the worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I think he will like it, at least.</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t remain half hour Not happy!</li>
            <li> was not a good smell to me</li>
            <li> not good at all, it just water mix with color</li>
            <li> usually wear it casually</li>
            <li> cap comes broken</li>
            <li> only problem is the cap which I hate.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and evaporates in seconds.</li>
            <li> Its absolutely worthless hasn&#x27;t got any fragrance at all hardly stays on you not more than 15 minutes  ...</li>
            <li> Has to be a fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Sorry i bought this item.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice cologne, I love it</li>
            <li> We dednt resive irems</li>
            <li> This cologne is horrible.  The scent wears off 5 min after you spray it on.  Like they say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, large volume, the fragrance lasts a while and smells as good as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Scent on this one does not last that long and is quite understated.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I do like it and would order it again.</li>
            <li> I only use this cologne to finish it. I purchased it and several other Yacht Man cologne fragrances. Truly disappointed with this cologne. The scent does not last. you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li> it smells like teen spirit for atract women use it so soft so sweet and a litle bit bitter exactly the middle point I recomend that</li>
            <li> This scent doesn&#x27;t really last long and it smells decent, Wouldn&#x27;t really expect much less for the price.</li>
            <li> smells good but not overpowering the smell does last for 8 hours or so not as good as some name brand cologne but for the price this stuff works.</li>
            <li> nice for every day use, for instance i use it as my car freshener, and it works just fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and you will love the smell, if you like drakkar noir, or rocco barocco parfume..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
            <li> excellent fragance, the smell its very nice and the service of this seller are great</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD, BUT IT DOES NOT LAST LONG!!! GREAT FOR THE PRICE THOUGH! YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT $4.17!!!</li>
            <li> It is an ok product. yes for the price it could be a very good gift but not really great!!! The packaging looks not real as in it looks fake. There was also a slight leakage but thts fine but definitely not good quality. The fragrance is pretty good. Along with this I have ordered the red one and I love the blue. It is mild and yet very soothing. If you guys are confused between blue and red i would say go for blue because the fragnance is pretty good. Also, saw the same one in Target for $45 so this questions the originality of the product. I bought it as a gift so it is fine not too concerned until and unless it smells good it is fine. But yes one thing concerns me is the bottle. the top is little loose i do not know what the problem is but looks like it might leak if the bottle is little bit tilted. Probably they should change the packaging a bit. The open is also slightly unusual but it is ok not bad. If you looking for a cheap and good smelling fragrance then this is it!!!</li>
            <li> Light aquatic scent that stays with you for hours. Great for the price. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> WOW! It catch a lot of compliments. It was a very good day time sense. I am strongly reconsidering restocking!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell very much and it dissapears in a few hours... but it&#x27;s ok for the price i&#x27;ve paid..</li>
            <li> was not a good smell to me</li>
            <li> The smell does not last very long.  It smells like an old person cologne.  Obviously i didn&#x27;t really like it...</li>
            <li> Super very excellent.  The best product and a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> The scent may be a little too strong for some, but is still very good and legit.</li>
            <li> My husband smell great.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.Bottle and color looks good.Smell very weak and won&#x27;t last.I don&#x27;t even want to call it cologne.I don&#x27;t understand why other people give this 5 stars or 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Rather strong, but good.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last about 7-8 hours. I have 5-Cuba scents, Polo Red, 2-Nautica scents, True Religion, and 2-Yacht Man scents. I would place Yacht Man Blue up there with the rest. I have received compliments every time I spray the scent on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long but it does have a nice fresh smell too it..not bad at all for the price</li>
            <li> Cheap bottle, smells good but not last long.</li>
            <li> very mild and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Best low cost fragance...</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the price. It arrived in a sealed unopened box and when I opened it I was very impressed with the quality of the cologne. Would recommend this item .</li>
            <li> I also purchase Yacht Man Metal for my guy. He loves both fragrances and I love them on him. Amazon shopping as always, great selection of quality products, and always at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> It smell good and I would buy again</li>
            <li> Such a fresh smell! Not heavy cologne I love it on my boyfriend he used other sprays but this one Is light and long lasting</li>
            <li> Cheap and discreet! A hidden strong personality. I would recommend to anyone. First time I bought it in New York, it costed $35.00. The second time in New Jersey: $15</li>
            <li> This item is bad, smells bad, very weak scent. dont buy it. The price is very cheap but it&#x27;s not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion is inexpensive and almost does not last, I do not really like much, but if you want a better lotion should look for another option.</li>
            <li> This product it was a surprise, I&#x27;m very glad with my choose.&lt;br /&gt;It was a best buy, thanks you for everything</li>
            <li> yacht man has a beautiful smell.the fragrance makes you feel as if your in paradise or either smell like heaven but for a cologne like this.its a great price for a 3.4 ounce.</li>
            <li> have not used this yet it was a gift for a friend, but  my friend said its good and liked it</li>
            <li> This thing is literally so aweak that youll need to shove youre nose in wherever you sprayed it in order to smell it. It&#x27;s just like water and alcohol mixed together and just a hint of the perfume. I bought it directly from Amazon and I got it sealed so I&#x27;m not suspecting that it&#x27;s diluted. I recommend just getting an Adidas EDT which you can buy for jist an extra dollar and it smells strongers and stays longer.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Blue....knock out....</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite colognes, but it has a fantastic price. This a cologne I use regularly, the main reason why is because I don&#x27;t care about using all of it.</li>
            <li> For 24 American quarters (3.4 oz, Nov &#x27;11, $6), this cologne will probably beat out any other for that price. I&#x27;m not trying to talk it up so much they up the price but I&#x27;d spend at least $10 more on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It destroys it&#x27;s cousin &#x27;Yacht Man Red&#x27; (read my review on that if you&#x27;d like) by coming across as a more masculine scent. The scent is strong and lasts for about 2 hours with 3 or so sprays. After this and you can only really get a strong read on it if you&#x27;re in any type of breeze, whether it be a fan or the wind. I would recommend this for daytime use but you&#x27;ll see how it would work for nighttime use too. Due to the diversity of its&#x27; use, I would consider this being a love/hate type of cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give an impression of the scent, imagine wanting to only use &#x27;Blue&#x27; when wearing a dress shirt. It has that classy but subtle smell to it, which is why I am rating this 5 stars. You&#x27;ll be happy if you purchase it with this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quite fancy looking but make sure you open the top correctly. You just have to press down on that lever on the side of the cap. I almost ripped off the cap until I realized how easy it was to open. Don&#x27;t want you to have that same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you are looking for a somewhat classy smelling cologne for dirt cheap, this one will exceed your expectations. I&#x27;ll tell you when I eventually run out, I will buy again. Hopefully the price remains under $10 by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> smells great but i wish the smell could last a bit longer but cant complain for the price. last about half an hour</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad for his birthday after many failures of trying to find something he likes (which was way harder than it should have been) and I can finally say I found something he&#x27;ll use and covers up the smell of engine oil from his job while not making me want to rip off my nose or giving me headaches. YAY!</li>
            <li> This is a nice smell, but the perfume is extremely impermanent. It is very subtle and evaporates in seconds. Too bad, because I got two of these, and I now can&#x27;t return them. Not sure what I am gonna do with it. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Its a good product for a good price, I ordered Qty 2 and the packaging slip said qty 2 but on;y one was in the box ... bummer. While I was waiting for Amazon&#x27;s response placed a separate order for another qty for a gift as I do like the product. THe wait wasn&#x27;t much as Amazon rectified the situation very promptly on holidays afterhours ... what a service, excellent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance SUCKS!!!  I buy alot of cologne and this is a WASTE of money (even at 5 dollars)  Smells just like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> when i purchased this cologne, i was thinking probably the same thing as you. wow 4 dollar cologne for the win! but no, i apply 5 sprays on and yes it does have a good spell i&#x27;ll give it that, but in 30 minutes you&#x27;ll have to put your nose directly on the area you sprayed to even get a slight smell. So i hope i changed your mind on picking something else.</li>
            <li> thank you for this i tame i like it&lt;br /&gt;it was very nice thank you for every thing  good e time</li>
            <li> nice,but only last for may be 1 hour.its cheap so that what u gonna get for this price,i m not gonna buy this again</li>
            <li> the red yacht is better the blue is mild the red to me last all day</li>
            <li> This cologne is fantastic , smell clean, elegant and fresh. very mild,and stays with you, I can not believe the low price of it, great value will be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> Product of low quality</li>
            <li> not bad for the price. fast shipping.  I use it just for the gym when i don&#x27;t feel like showering in the morning.</li>
            <li> A great men&#x27;s cologne...got this as a  gift for my hubby 2 years ago and I now understand his love for this brand ..he uses it sparingly lol..Its that good</li>
            <li> I like this cologne.  I&#x27;ve tried Yacht Man Red, Yacht Man Blue, and Yacht Men Metal, and this one is my second-favorite.  Yacht Man Red is my favorite and is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent... it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  I would skip on the Yacht Man Metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAVORITE: [[ASIN:B0019RO78E Yacht Man Red by Myrurgia Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.40 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND-FAVORITE: [[ASIN:B001B0X05U Yacht Man Blue By Puig Eau-de-toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PASS: [[ASIN:B001RVMQX0 Yacht Man Metal by Myrurgia Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 3.40-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this Item.Zero value for money&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return this but Amazon not allowing.&lt;br /&gt;Worst perfume I brought.</li>
            <li> Excellent, my husband is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Nice fo everyday wearing. Has a good smell to it.thanks. David</li>
            <li> Nice scent but very weak. Not really worth using, it&#x27;s like after shave. Does not last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased all three colognes in the Yacht Man set!  I am extremely satisfied with this purchased,  You can smell very good for a nominal purchase.  All three colognes smell very good but I must admit Yacht Man Blue is my favorite.  Go For It!!!</li>
            <li> It has the same quality what I expected. When I bought this, my two friends gave orders for an additional</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wore this only after I told him he was using all of the Yacht Man Red up. He finally had the nose for this one when he wore it a few times but went right back to the red.</li>
            <li> very good price,great product</li>
            <li> good good product  and have nice quatilys and i know people will like it. they should try it and see them selves</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Has a good smell</li>
            <li> severely affecting my health&lt;br /&gt;Please contact the provider&lt;br /&gt;ASK&lt;br /&gt;at this moment that product I&lt;br /&gt;produced&lt;br /&gt;fever, shortness of breath&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> great smell,great price paid for this...you will like it I think..would buy again smells awesome..great buy I feel bottle is nice,too</li>
            <li> I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who&#x27;s exp dates are approaching. Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast. There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.</li>
            <li> Hi good afternoon. I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase. Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li> Cheap.....Does not hold scent or really smell that great.  It would be nice if it lasted even long enough to still be able to smell it as you walk out of the house in the morning.  Really disappointing.....can&#x27;t even smell on myself after a hour..... or forget that I have it on</li>
            <li> My husband loved it would buy again</li>
            <li> I have tried several other colognes for my husband that have good ratings, and we both agree this one smells so great!  So much better than the others.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of this cologne last December. The scent lasts long and smells great! They were very cheap too... about 5 dollars a bottle. I recommended this one to anyone who likes a very mild but long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> scent fades away sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I did not like the perfume is a good perfume and I did not I recommend to friends and  family and friends</li>
            <li> Does not last more than 30-45 minutes. Has to be a fake.</li>
            <li> havent received as yet gave 5 stars because i am used to this product awesome</li>
            <li> its good I liked it . specially keeping the discounted price in view.</li>
            <li> I bought it, and i like the fragrance, it&#x27;s not a long lasting one but it&#x27;s ok and for the price it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> This product has more water and alcohol than fragrance. I don&#x27;t care how much you spray on by the time you leave you house the smell will be evaporated. Spend a little extra and get something with some frangrance oils to it.</li>
            <li> it only stay on you for 5 mins,Is different from the ones sold in shops.i anti gonna buy this product online</li>
            <li> Nice fragance.... love it, is very light and nice fragance, very nice to wear on the weekend or simpkly to stay at home... is not a very long fragance</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the scent and its durability. I never used it after using it for couple of times. I&#x27;m looking for someone to dash it to. Just wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Excellent and responsible!</li>
            <li> LIKE WATER IT STINKS NOT SMELL!</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last long (~1 hour). So far the most I&#x27;ve used at once is four sprays. You may need up to seven sprays if you want the scent to last a good portion of the day. Going to try a different spray...</li>
            <li> This is my second Yacht Man and its awesome.</li>
            <li> see other review. $8.00 cologne really smells like a $5.00 cologne. Pass on this.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this perfume.  It smells clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased this before and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> at less than $8 it&#x27;s a perfect fit.  The red bottle is also good for a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  My teen son uses the grey that is appropriate.  It has a hint of watermelon scent that is nice.</li>
            <li> Women constantly compliment me when I wear this. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> excellent product very satisfied Cart</li>
            <li> not to good low perfume</li>
            <li> Most Excellent seller, highly reliable and clearly responsible. I highly recommend it to all the Amazon community. The product is completely original, exactly as detailed in their publication.</li>
            <li> If only this had staying power it would be a hit.  With that said it smells incredibly great and its so appealing for the \\&quot;younger\\&quot; man,</li>
            <li> not good at all, it just water mix with color</li>
            <li> i love it...as expected</li>
            <li> Perfume my watch seems focused, not as experienced as few can even speak of what I see its packaging could be more sophisticated, more beautiful and being in possession of a related name must have a navy nautical flavor</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product because of the less intense smell. It does not last for three 3  hours</li>
            <li> Loved it arrived on time</li>
            <li> OK I know it&#x27;s extremely cheap but come on, within 10 to 20 seconds of spraying it on you, you can barely smell it even when you put your nose directly at the sprayed area. I only gave it a two because it smells great...but if it doesn&#x27;t last what is the point...</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive hugo boss pefume....And imust say this perfume is classic...i fully recomend it for anybody who is thinking of buying it....it is really the same wiv d brand names</li>
            <li> Not what I expected,smells cheap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews there idiots it&#x27;s everything the description says it is very fresh clean classy smell. Doesn&#x27;t smell like someone bathed in it. More of a up close and personal smell with the ladies love and the price is unbeatable. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great Buy Product as described!</li>
            <li> you have to spray it about 10 times to smell it and after a hour it wears off</li>
            <li> This is a good and cheap cologne to help you get by. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either, it&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li> who needs a name brand  it smells great</li>
            <li> paid $4 couldn&#x27;t believe the price. smells alright.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this he wore it when we first met and it was in great condition and smelled exactly like when i first met him!</li>
            <li> Pretty good cologne but not not as strong as the red version.</li>
            <li> Smells really good I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> is good, but you receive that you pay ,very good service, thanks</li>
            <li> very cheap. bottle pop top is not even functional. you will end up destroying the whole top of the spray bottle if you try to open it. you must just simply pull the cap up to access the spray nozzle. everything about this is cheap. I got this for $3.47 and still feel like I wasted money on this...</li>
            <li> Was not as gd as its description. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PUIG COLOGNE SMELLS GOOD THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> excellent product with the great combination of eau-toilette spray and perfume... it look like a original perfume you may buy in any department store, like Macy and Bloomingdale...it recommendable....</li>
            <li> I bought it to try it out, but I did not like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had some problem. Its good they helped me back to resolve the problem. They have returned my money and I have returned the product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I got this fragrance becasue of its low price and I thought that it would be an excellent fragrance that would be good for everyday use. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. This fragrance does smell very nice but it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. I am only able to smell it when I put my nose directly on the spot where I sprayed it and I can&#x27;t smell it at all after about eight hours.</li>
            <li> With notes of tequila, lime and a hint of talc and linen, this cologne stacks up as a light refreshing clean wearing daily scent that doesnt overpower. Its great for weekend wear or in a meeting where you want to be fresh but subtle. For the price Id say a great buy and in the same ocean marine grouping as Nautica and  Tommy Bahama.</li>
            <li> This cologne was the balm meaning it was everything that I was anticipating, it had a soft scent that were not over bearing to the nose and received many compliments. Wonderful Item.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a prettty nice smell. It will not overpower you and run somebody off if those are the scents that you like. I do not like smelling like I have a green cloud around me. This is light and decent. Good for the price</li>
            <li> man, people you will not regret this purchase. compliments everywhere i go (no joke). the smell sometimes flatters the whole room you are in....</li>
            <li> Tried this due to the low price.  When i spray it on, my wife can smell it in the other room.  An hour later, the scent is all gone.  Don&#x27;t see the value of a scent that does not last even for a half a day.  I am going to get rid of it.  The initial scent is good, too bad it does not last.</li>
            <li> I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it. When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Smels like a soap, longevity is very poor about 1.5 houres, there are better products for the same price range, nautica, victorynox and some others. Cap of the bottle broke in 10 seconds i opened the box. Giving 2 stars because of low price so I didnot have big expectations anout it.</li>
            <li> i bought both sents and they smell great to me when i need more i know where to go thanks</li>
            <li> I really like it very much</li>
            <li> Nice scent; clean.  Doesn&#x27;t last long on my husband, but it&#x27;s a big amount for a fantastic price.  So, he reapplies when he wants.  Has a very clean, shower fresh smell.  I think it&#x27;s great.  Especially for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I had never smelled this fragrance before, but when I saw it on sale for $3, and after reading the reviews, which indicated that this was the better smelling of all the Yacht Man varieties, I decided to give it a try. After shipping and handling this bottle of water cost me $7.31!!  When sprayed initially it has absolutely no smell, but afterward a faint smell devolped, smelled more like perspiration!!!  What a waste! I do not believe the bottle I got is an authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bottle is super cool, smells great!</li>
            <li> Sent lasted only about 4 minutes I would never buy this spray again!...... I have to write more words to have listed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product think it just really smells of alcohol and fades quickly</li>
            <li> Does not last at all. Max till 1 hour that too at the exact area where you applied this.. bought it for daily use purpose but highly disappointed.. will not buy this again..</li>
            <li> I JUST DON&#x27;T FIND YACHT MAN BLUE COLOGNE FRAGRANCE TO LAST. BECAUSE TO ME AFTER 3HRS IS LIKE THE SCENT IS GONE!</li>
            <li> good afternoon I am writing to express my disappointment with the product http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B0X05U/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2, which acquired and then try note its poor quality, unfortunately I am in Venezuela but I wonder if they could do something to change the product because applying the fragance a few minutes the smell goes so I feel cheated ... thanks for your attention</li>
            <li> A really great product! Also came with lots of samples which is cool!</li>
            <li> With 382 reviews about this blue yatch cologne, majority ot the users were very satisfied with their purchases.. Me, personally l love the scent. Not too strong. just enough scent not to irritate the person next to you. I find  sexiness in the scent. Whether day or night tine this cologne is perfect.  I am sure peopke will be asking you what cologne your wearing. It is enticing.and. very flirty. I just purchased the red one. LET US SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I am very satisfied with my purchase. ANAZON made them very affordable to all customers. THANK YOU !!</li>
            <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Smells Great! Women love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff if fake it lasts for about 10 minutes its all alcohol and no long lasting perfume. I&#x27;m disappointed in the product never buying it again. Dont buy perfumes from Amazon !!!</li>
            <li> I know that i can&#x27;t get an excellent product for this price but the smell goes too fast!!!</li>
            <li> Though the bottle looks stylish, the spray doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Though it is relatively cheap, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good, doesn&#x27;t last long. I use it wen I take a poo.. Great cover up, worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I do not know why but I just like this cologne even though it is cheap. stays on for a few hours . I rather the steel smell but this one is fine too.</li>
            <li> This is solid. Hangs in there pretty good . I think chicks might dig it.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne not expecting too much and I certainly wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The price was right so I took a $5 chance and wasted my money.  It smells ok if you can smell much of anything but lasts about 10 minutes.  I&#x27;ve gone through half a bottle already just trying to keep some sense of the fragrance on me--way too futile and a waste of time and product.  On the plus side, the bottle is nice but that&#x27;s about it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, there&#x27;s plenty of other better quality knock-offs for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> This cologne smell so good i bet you if you buy this cologne you will fall inlove with it .i first smell this cologne i went crazy and bought some more i love to smell good ...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband, since I love Davidoff Cool Water so much and one of the reviews mentioned its similarity to it.  It&#x27;s close but not as long standing...still great for the price.</li>
            <li> got this cologne for my husband, sent it to his work, he loved it. good clean smell, delievered in one piece on time. bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not strong. Its not moderate. its very light, it requires about 3 sprays in order for you to actually smell it. Still for 3 bucks ! this cologne is amazing quality. Outstanding product. This cologne though has an outstanding fresh smell. Girls will be all over you mark my words.</li>
            <li> LIGHT cool water imitation, but a great deal for only a few bucks!!</li>
            <li> I order this item as a 3 part father&#x27;s day gift for my fiancee. Out of 3 this was his 2nd favorite. This really smells nice on him. Thanks Amazon for the great price and quality of this item!</li>
            <li> I thought that It&#x27;s going to be good for daily casual use. Fragrance is good , but it doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather buy the fake ones from Walgreens , which at least lasts on your body.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized there is no point buying cheap perfume. Yacht Man Blue by far was the worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not knowing much about it and thought I would give it a try. The product for the price is unbeatable. Great scent.</li>
            <li> This Yacht man blue is perfect for young kids that want to start impressing their crew. We recommended, some and smooth smell.</li>
            <li> It was ok, thought it could of smelled q lol better or had a lol stronger sent. But its ok overall</li>
            <li> I got 5 of these. The smell does not last long. A bit of stronger smell that lasts long would have made it an ok option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterall, perfumes are to smell good and last atleast 2 hours - This lasts 30 mins may be.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments yet about this cologne.I like it even though it&#x27;s not really strong. You have to practically put your nose real close to smell it. Will give it another week or two ,then update my review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to pass on this one for work out long outings, due to it not lasting long. Will use for quick runs to the store or after shower.&lt;br /&gt;Buttom line, smells great but does not last long.</li>
            <li> It was great. Nice doing business with you. Keep up the good works. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last at all. Although i only paid $7.00 for it (including shipping), it was NOT worth it. I should have saved my money.</li>
            <li> it smwlls so good on my fiance and he loves this gift i bought for him for a great price so thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is a waste of money(and time).  Guess that&#x27;s what I get for $3.  Once you spray this stuff on, it lasts for about 2 minutes and it&#x27;s gone.  No scent.  Guess that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re basically giving it away and charging for shipping.  Don&#x27;t know about the other scents from this brand, but this one is a waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong cologne. it stays for a very short time. Well i guess that&#x27;s what u get for the price huh.&lt;br /&gt;Not something that u would want to wear all the time, but something that can be worn for a short outing, because it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> excellent product and seller very responsible</li>
            <li> I like the smell,but it isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be,it is a very light smell that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Do not buy this junk</li>
            <li> Got for a gift he liked it.</li>
            <li> Bought it on an Amazon special for $3, bought 2. Nice smell but does not last very long but good for before bed or a quick splash to smell good for my wife.</li>
            <li> Terrible scent, does not smell good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this fragance, it&#x27;s so ordinary and It does not smell for long, get another fragance</li>
            <li> I would not waste no money on this you spray it on  it gos away in 2 MINUTES. YOU CAN&#x27;T TELL YOU GOT IT ON. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> soft and smooth. i am new to nautica colonge . would like to experience more from this brand i love it</li>
            <li> Great price for this cologne. The scent is light and airy with a rush of tobacco. Pretty decent late night club cologne.</li>
            <li> Got it for my dad for Christmas, much cheaper than the Walmart price. I think he will like it, at least. Pretty decent sized bottle for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last long  not worthy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> very light scent...perfect for night time I thought - but my hubby said it perfect for chill time he loves bringing it along when we get away on weekends.  It&#x27;s not too strong but very subtle once your nose notice it, you just won&#x27;t let go. you will keep smelling fresh and lovely all day long</li>
            <li> a nice scent at very inexpensive price</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased a new cologne for my husband online, I took a chance never smelling it but its great and we both love it</li>
            <li> i have spray i will use soon.</li>
            <li> Good scent. Good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, was fulfilled sent to the estimated dates, loved the price and quality. I recommend it to all, it smells yummy.</li>
            <li> looks cheap. cap comes broken</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gifts for family members and friends so I cannot rate this product at this time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition. when applied it is a noticeable fragrance, very good for casual events. Provides a nice scent for a couple hours</li>
            <li> THIS S*** IS A WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT BUY IT I SPRAYED IT ON AND IT SMELLOK AFTER ABOUT 30 MINS IT ANIT HAVE THE SAME SMELL IT FADED THE SMELL DONT LAST I THREW IT IN THE PALE</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells a little like Coolwater. it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but it cme in rapid time and wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild you can hardly smell it. I will not recommend it to anyone. Sorry i bought this item.</li>

            <li> it smells good but the problem is after a couple of minutes you can not even smell it.it flys.i guess i wasted my monet and time even if its really cheap</li>
            <li> Yacht man Blue was purchased on a whim, due to its low, low price.  It smell good, clean scent, only downfall is that is does NOT last very long at all.  Initial spray makes it seem like a full high priced cologne but after 20 min or so the scent fades to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> *Bought this along with the Red. These product would be useful for nighttime usage since it&#x27;s strong and yet light on scent.*</li>
            <li> For 3 bucks you&#x27;re pretty much getting what you pay for.. I think it&#x27;s a solid product, but it the smell is very light, but sometimes that works, am I right? Don&#x27;t get that if you want a really strong scent. This kinda gives you a ocean water kinda smell. 4-5 stars if it lasted longer, it does smell good.</li>
            <li> As the product description says it is &amp;#34;refreshing, fresh, masculine, sensual fragrance&amp;#34;.  Problem is it only last for about 30 seconds.  Probably will give this bottle to my grandson.  Recommend Playboy Miami Cologne if you are looking for low cost cologne.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife really liked the smell but it seem to fade away in a short while. I had to wear larger quantities for it to endure a bit longer. It&#x27;s an OK product, not great by any means.</li>
            <li> Smell Is real weak and doesn&#x27;t last long at all&lt;br /&gt;I spread it for two days in a row and the same affect</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a stronger fragrance like Drakkar Noir or Cool water. I was looking out for a cheaper costing fragrance and found this in amazon. the fragance is neither mild nor strong and holds on only for a couple of hours. it doesn&#x27;t stay forever like pricy fragrance till the 2-3 wash but is fine when you are out casual for a walk or get together with friends or family. This is clearly not build for mamba samba or party time.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the price!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks</li>
            <li> Its absolutely worthless hasn&#x27;t got any fragrance at all hardly stays on you not more than 15 minutes  ...i would suggest yacht man red or metal .</li>
            <li> Will buy again!!! Great Product...Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> Provided that I buy any item for Amazon.com I add these perfumes that are fun by the economic price and they help me a lot to the pocket. Obviously to use every day, since does not persist too much the aroma. Thanks Jose</li>
            <li> Price is always a consideration when purchasing  cologne.....whether for men or women....in this case, it is hard to beat at any price....shall purchase this again.....</li>
            <li> Nice sent for the price can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li> is a product of very good quality, brand and price. I recommend it to all people who are in search of something. Besides, it is very nice, I loved it.</li>
            <li> great price and great to keep in the car if u need a quick fresh me up! i do it. I cant highly recommend this because there will be none left when im ready to refill another order! lol. :)</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t remain half hour Not happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really don&#x27;t know much about colognes, but this one is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Is not too strong, but it longs all day. Was a good choice after all.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Not bad at all, especially at the price it sells at. I have no problem wearing this cologne as a morning scent before work. Much more of a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent as opposed to the Yacht Man Red which is much more of a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! Okaysih smell and not long lasting but it comes in 3.4 ml so it will last a bit :)</li>
            <li> This Yacht man blue has very light scent , very very light. if you dont need strong scent it works good.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS A GREAT-SEXY-SMELL, LADIES YOU WILL LOVE THIS SMELL ON YOUR BOYFRIEND, HUSBAND, OR LOVER. I GIVE IT 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> I like this product especially its design. I was expecting it to have little more intense odor though. If you want to have intense odor, you&#x27;ll have to put more quantity which is why it is 3.4 oz I guess.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy again</li>
            <li> otimo product I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, I highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> Excellent scent that I would rank JUST behind Yacht Man Metal as my favorite of their line!  The price was easy to afford the flyer on, and I was pleased with the scent that Blue provides - crisp, doesn&#x27;t last very long at full strength but makes my laundry smell nice :)  more masculine than Red, and more complex than Black.  Metal outdoes it slightly, but I enjoy the crisp sharpness of the Blue scent - not vinegary or ammonia-laced, just good quality for the price - and will buy it and Metal again.  Both of these scents are strong additions to your wear-every-day arsenal, and are suitable as gifts for acquaintances and workmates.  I guarantee you, no one you know has these scents - yet!  :)</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and light. My husband loved it</li>
            <li> good for price but scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP PRICE&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP FRAGANCY&lt;br /&gt;3 DOLLARS IS OKAY&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this one is by far the strongest scent from the others. It&#x27;s someone like a powder and Cool Water type but it&#x27;s nice after it sets on the skin. Didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing on clothing.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality for the price</li>
            <li> Good scent for male. Not expensive perfume to give to a friend as a gift. Can&#x27;t beat the price too.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice clean smell. It almost reminds me of water. I feel very fresh when wearing this. Not as good as Yacht Man Red, but a close second.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne, I dont know how long it lasts but for how great it smells it is a good cologne</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. Luxurious scent and inexpensive</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice, the scent is not over powering. It has a nice scent. It does&#x27;t last real long. i would recomend it.</li>
            <li> It seems they forgot to put any fragrance in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;All I smell is alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This product is of poor quality, I buy a gift for my husband and not smell anything or is very old and the smell dissipated or is an imitation, so I&#x27;m upset buy two perfumes that are useless, sorry my money to throw away.</li>
            <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these for my friends, they like it. The bottle and the box look cool.. It really is a good product for the price :)</li>
            <li> Great smell Love It!!</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt; Arrived on time</li>
            <li> I like the design, the item came on time but that was a gift to someone</li>
            <li> Bought this when it was a fire sale (3.00 + prime)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last long (&amp;#60;1 hour)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had to spray 5-10 times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for a quick, I don&#x27;t care edt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great smell for the time allowed.</li>
            <li> I live in Venezuela and really my complaint is for the way of packing the perfumes, really his sending was very costly, for future occasions with bag of globes and in one on coarse sewing</li>
            <li> smell is not really that nice... sprayer got stuck and would not spray correctly... though it is cheap, may not buy again</li>
            <li> this not original!!the smell is not that what was once, and the cap quickly broke...запах не тот как раньше был,и крышка быстро сломался</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne spray based on price, and quantity (3.4 oz).  I like the design, it is neat like a flask almost, the smell is very light, but smells fresh and refreshing.  The duration for what I have found the cologne to last is very short, and would need reapplied often.  I don&#x27;t use it for going out anywhere, but an everyday use I feel is appropriate.  I use it after a shower and feel even more refreshed.</li>
            <li> it was a birthday gift for my son. since blue is his favorite color he loved this! He also said they it smelled very pleasant and light</li>
            <li> Love this one. super cheap and the bottle is huge. only problem is the cap which I hate. it&#x27;s really annoying.</li>
            <li> first thing to be a little water down wasn&#x27;t too happy with the way it smelled. did not last long after the spray, maybe this version but it was my first time buying it and just wasn&#x27;t overall pleased with it</li>
            <li> smell really great......my husband love it more than the red one........actually he wants it all......great product.....great smell.....i actually follow all over the house......</li>
            <li> really is the worst perfume that I bought, acquired with the idea of ​​giving it away and do not dare because I embarrassed a fragrance that does not last anything or 5 min. I lost my money and not recommended</li>
            <li> They shipped it out when they said they would and I got the item when they said I would. I love they smell of the cologne and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I will be buying more see you soon</li>
            <li> Nice cologne and the scent of it last and it does not smell too strong. For the price what more could anyone ask for. Would recommend it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long but it smells ok but there is a lot of it so it will last a long time. I just need something to get me through my day after riding to work and it survives the bike ride.</li>
            <li> Smells great  and unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> Not to happy with the sent I wear it to the store or gym. Sent fades fast</li>
            <li> I have almost all of the yacht man colognes, they all have such a great long lasting scents and the blue is probably one of my favorites, but my number one is the red. I got this for three bucks which is unbeatable so I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and it was just what I expected. It was my first time buying this cologne and the smell is so good that I will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> smells better than expected but really does not take much fragrance but for the price is excellent</li>
            <li> I recommend it very good, it came very well protected and in perfect condition, also smells great. Recommended thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this perfume, its nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it doesn&#x27;t last very long, therefore it is a cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear it casually and it works for me, I will probably purchase again.</li>
