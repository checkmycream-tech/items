    <ol>
            <li>I get the best color using it</li>
            <li>The bronze tint is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Great Product &amp; Great Deal!!</li>
            <li>oh it smells good!</li>
            <li>and i loved it !</li>
            <li>I especially love this lotion because it smells good too.</li>
            <li>This would not be good for someone with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li>but as any experienced tanner knows you have to switch up your lotions to keep color.</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>Although this product has a tingle factor, it does not set you on fire, which is another one of the great things about it.</li>
            <li>Great customer service.  </li>
            <li>i am really happy with this lotion and recommend it to anyone looking for a tan asap.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews I felt confident that I&#x27;d like the lotion and guess what...I DO!!</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice though</li>
            <li>I am always nice and tan after!</li>
            <li>Great smell, beautiful color, and not too hot!!!</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>or when I put it in cooler it does not come out good.  </li>
            <li>Some brag about the smell of this lotion but its not that exceptional in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Happy shopping :-)</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I couldnt handle the higher tingles, so this one works great!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>great product it works very well has a nice bronzer in it and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I used about 1/2 of the bottle, it does tingle and get warm like its supposed to, but I felt like after the redness wore off there was no change in color at all.</li>
            <li>I did get some nice color after just one visit, for 12 minutes in a level 1 bed.</li>
            <li>Smells nice out of the bottle, and I did not notice any ATO.</li>
            <li>and this lotion doesn&#x27;t even get warm until about the 8 minute mark.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good though!</li>
            <li>Right now I am not getting this till you change!!!  </li>
            <li>Just from some reviews I seen you should look more into tingles than just</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>If you change let me know for sure.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but i cant complain because its not perfume :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Not too strong..</li>
            <li>and if you want a tingle, but a more mild tingle get this one...</li>
            <li>This one was cheap, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a tingle before, and I&#x27;m not an advanced tanner.</li>
            <li>The plus side- its cheap even just to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right tingle, barely any and bronzers work great.</li>
            <li>and you do not shower right after use or you welt up</li>
            <li>After that wore off I can see a change right away.</li>
            <li>You should go back to old way because it does not work as good.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever tingle lotion</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t unbearably hot</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t happen while I was in the tanning bed so much, but more like 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li>Its god if you are just starting to use tingles but not good if your experienced with tingles!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get you color as fast as the more high end tingles, such as Ionyx, Smoke, Bombshell, and Ruby.</li>
            <li>I can see the tingle, but cant really feel it.</li>
            <li>I really thought bottle was going to be what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>it either runs out too fast</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t really notice that i&#x27;ve gained any color using it.</li>
            <li>From reading the 1 star reviews, I was expecting this lotion to really burn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin, but this always makes my skin VERY red, more so after I&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to tingle lotions I may suggest this bottle to be your first.</li>
            <li>I think I maybe didn&#x27;t apply enough lotion (probably out of fear) and I may wait a couple minutes before actually getting in the bed just so the lotion has more time to start working.</li>
            <li>I tan in a 12 minute high pressure bed</li>
            <li>I wish the smell was a little better</li>
            <li>but I had hoped for a little more warmth.</li>
            <li>but I could tell a difference from my normal bronzers.</li>
            <li>I use this when Im first starting my tan for the summer.</li>
            <li>I usually mix this with another lotion that has more fragrance just to change up.</li>
            <li>I will stop buying if I can not get old bottle.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a mild tingle that doesn&#x27;t have an incredibly long lasting reddening effect.</li>
            <li>Its gives a HOT tan and not really a TINGLE that you think it would be.</li>
            <li>After a while, the tingle wasnt as intense because I was used to it, at this point is when I started to notice that the tops of my arms were starting to get white blotches all over them.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the lotion, I did try the other Swedish beauty products they sent me , but did not like it as much!</li>
            <li>I bought this from my salon to see if it would give me an all over boost because I was pretty maxed out with color from a previous lotion.</li>
            <li>the tingle isnt as bad as i thought which i liked alot !</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the tingle isnt as bad as i thought which i liked alot !</li>
            <li> even for the first time i saw results and i have a little bit more than a base tan, my arms and legs were red but a very tan red if that makes sense</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last long as the bottle isn&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li> remember though, the less hot, the less color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Swedish beauty for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I usually take awhile to go through a new cream, but this one I had for about 1 to 2 months and today it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> It never fails me to produce results, and for my skin type that&#x27;s hard to do!</li>
            <li> When I got out I still had the splotchy red patches and the rest of my body was slightly pinker.</li>
            <li> The bronzers are mild enough on my pale skin that I don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Pink Diamond for some time now.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The bronzers are minimal so there are no streaks.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a product for the weak or sensitive skinned, but it has cut the amount of times I have to tan in half.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the effect I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I never really felt that, it was more like an annoying itch.</li>
            <li> When you are outside it is  hard to get product out of little bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I do not like the little bottle that is spastic.  </li>
            <li> I am a serious tanner and have used a lot of extreme tingles.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the negative ones made me nervous</li>
            <li> Been using it forever, other than they sent the wrong product twice</li>
            <li> This is for the serious tanner.</li>
            <li> Not good for florida sun like this now.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It states only use if you already have a base tan.</li>
            <li> When I started tanning again after a few years hiatus, I tried another line, but it made me orange!!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and it smelled nasty</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product it works very well has a nice bronzer in it and smells great.  Would recomend this product to use</li>
            <li> This lotion has a mild tingle that doesn&#x27;t have an incredibly long lasting reddening effect. If you&#x27;re new to tingle lotions I may suggest this bottle to be your first. I find that the redness goes away quicker when I wash off the tanning residue from my skin once I get out of the bed. The color is a deep and longer lasting bronze than just an accelerator or bronzing lotion in my opinion. I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my salon to see if it would give me an all over boost because I was pretty maxed out with color from a previous lotion. I used about 1/2 of the bottle, it does tingle and get warm like its supposed to, but I felt like after the redness wore off there was no change in color at all. After a while, the tingle wasnt as intense because I was used to it, at this point is when I started to notice that the tops of my arms were starting to get white blotches all over them. Not exactly the effect I was hoping for. Tan is what I wanted.... leopard spotted is what I got. Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Swedish Beauty tingle tanning lotions for years. When I started tanning again after a few years hiatus, I tried another line, but it made me orange!!!! I came back to Swedish Beauty and found the results I was looking for. Great smell, beautiful color, and not too hot!!! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have used it for years but as any experienced tanner knows you have to switch up your lotions to keep color. And it&#x27;s tingle so it does give heat and you do not shower right after use or you welt up and it burns! Any tingle does that! Just from some reviews I seen you should look more into tingles than just oh it smells good! Tingle is not recommended for your face!</li>
            <li> Not too strong.. I can see the tingle, but cant really feel it. I couldnt handle the higher tingles, so this one works great!</li>
            <li> This is my first ever tingle lotion so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I read the reviews and the negative ones made me nervous but I went ahead and bought it. I started turning red the moment I put it on. Splotchy red. But I got in the tanning bed anyways. It wasn&#x27;t unbearably hot but I could tell a difference from my normal bronzers. When I got out I still had the splotchy red patches and the rest of my body was slightly pinker. The splotches went away in 30 minutes and I can tell I&#x27;m noticeably darker. It smells great and it&#x27;s not too uncomfortable. All in all I loved it.</li>
            <li> This product not only does what it say it will do. It also makes my skin look and feel amazing. This is for the serious tanner. This would not be good for someone with very fair skin. It states only use if you already have a base tan. Follow these directions or you will burn.</li>
            <li> I like the product but I do not like the little bottle that is spastic.  When you are outside it is  hard to get product out of little bottle.  I like the picture of this bottle you show.  I really thought bottle was going to be what I ordered.  You should go back to old way because it does not work as good.  I have buying this for years.  I will stop buying if I can not get old bottle.  When you use this  smaller bottle it either runs out too fast or when I put it in cooler it does not come out good.  Stay with what the product was please.  Not good for florida sun like this now.  I know and people have remarked about I look like I am in my forty&#x27;s and I am in my sixty&#x27;s..  If you change let me know for sure.  Right now I am not getting this till you change!!!  Thank you Lois Hawk</li>
            <li> I use this when Im first starting my tan for the summer. Its gives a HOT tan and not really a TINGLE that you think it would be. The bronze tint is AMAZING!! And the price on Amazon was 1/4 of what it was in the Tanning Salon..Great Product &amp; Great Deal!!</li>
            <li> Its god if you are just starting to use tingles but not good if your experienced with tingles! and it smelled nasty</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Pink Diamond for some time now. It never fails me to produce results, and for my skin type that&#x27;s hard to do! I especially love this lotion because it smells good too. Although this product has a tingle factor, it does not set you on fire, which is another one of the great things about it.</li>
            <li> Item came on time.  Great customer service.  I will buy it again.  Love the product.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I want to give this 3.5 stars, because for the amount I paid for it I got what I expected. I am a serious tanner and have used a lot of extreme tingles. This one was cheap, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. It doesn&#x27;t get you color as fast as the more high end tingles, such as Ionyx, Smoke, Bombshell, and Ruby. It also doesn&#x27;t last long as the bottle isn&#x27;t very big. I usually take awhile to go through a new cream, but this one I had for about 1 to 2 months and today it&#x27;s all gone. The scent is very nice though and if you want a tingle, but a more mild tingle get this one... remember though, the less hot, the less color. Happy shopping :-)</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a product for the weak or sensitive skinned, but it has cut the amount of times I have to tan in half. I love it.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I felt confident that I&#x27;d like the lotion and guess what...I DO!! It&#x27;s just the right tingle, barely any and bronzers work great. Yes I was red after getting out of the bed but that&#x27;s to be expected. After that wore off I can see a change right away. Definitely recommend to any and everyone!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin, but this always makes my skin VERY red, more so after I&#x27;ve showered. And I don&#x27;t really notice that i&#x27;ve gained any color using it. Smells pretty good though!</li>
            <li> I just got the lotion and went tanning once with it and i loved it ! even for the first time i saw results and i have a little bit more than a base tan, my arms and legs were red but a very tan red if that makes sense and i could see results. the tingle isnt as bad as i thought which i liked alot ! but you do feel the heat which i like. i am really happy with this lotion and recommend it to anyone looking for a tan asap. I wish the smell was a little better but i cant complain because its not perfume :)</li>
            <li> From reading the 1 star reviews, I was expecting this lotion to really burn. I never really felt that, it was more like an annoying itch. And it didn&#x27;t happen while I was in the tanning bed so much, but more like 10 minutes later. I&#x27;ve never used a tingle before, and I&#x27;m not an advanced tanner. I did get some nice color after just one visit, for 12 minutes in a level 1 bed. Smells nice out of the bottle, and I did not notice any ATO. The bronzers are minimal so there are no streaks. I think I maybe didn&#x27;t apply enough lotion (probably out of fear) and I may wait a couple minutes before actually getting in the bed just so the lotion has more time to start working. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has just enough tingle for me.  I don&#x27;t want to feel as though I am &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34;.  The bronzers are mild enough on my pale skin that I don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Been using it forever, other than they sent the wrong product twice I have no complaints about the lotion, I did try the other Swedish beauty products they sent me , but did not like it as much!</li>
            <li> I tan in a 12 minute high pressure bed and this lotion doesn&#x27;t even get warm until about the 8 minute mark. I know its only a tingle level 2 but I had hoped for a little more warmth. Some brag about the smell of this lotion but its not that exceptional in my opinion. I usually mix this with another lotion that has more fragrance just to change up. Once I finish the bottle, I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again. As an additional note, I also notice this leaves my skin tacky afterward. Not something I like. The plus side- its cheap even just to try.</li>
            <li> I got a burning rash that made my entire legs itch. This happened two hours after I got out of the tanning bed. Nothing happen ended while I tanned and did not help with my tan.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I am always nice and tan after!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Swedish beauty for a long time now. I get the best color using it</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter wanted. Thank you</li>
