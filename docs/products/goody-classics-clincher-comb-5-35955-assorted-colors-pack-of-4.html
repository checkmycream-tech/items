            <li>Thanks for a great product and a great price for them.</li>
            <li>These came in mail fast and in perfect working order!</li>
            <li>I loved them then and still love them.</li>
            <li>Worked great the first couple of times but then started sliding out of my hair just like all the others.</li>
            <li>VERY cheap product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>just like the 80&#x27;s  love&#x27;em</li>
            <li>I had a hell of a time trying to unlatch this death grip device from my precious curls.</li>
            <li>These are actually better because the teeth are closer and holds my fine hair tighter.  </li>
            <li>too  cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They are great for my short hair.</li>
            <li>They really keep the hair off my neck in the hot summer and look super cute!</li>
            <li>I ordered them because they are great if you have a cut that has different lengths to it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to keep my hair controlled in the hot summer instead of getting it cut off.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how old they are for the clip to break so easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly how I remember.</li>
            <li>but most broke when I tried to open them to use</li>
            <li>The first 2 clips that I opened broke.</li>
            <li>Worked great to roll my long hair into a french type roll, the ends hold really well.  </li>
            <li>Do not Waste ur money on this!! -.-</li>
            <li>Good concept, poor execution.</li>
            <li>Plastic seemed very aged like these were original from the 80&#x27;s or something.</li>
            <li>Snug fit and tight hold.  </li>
            <li>Back in the day, I got the longer ones but my hair is MUCH thinner than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Would not clip together and stay - kept falling apart because plastic was so old and not pliable.</li>
            <li>When I used this, it would slide down my hair within the first minute.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Shorter than expected</li>
            <li> These were sent to my granddaughter in Az, I didn&#x27;t see them but she said she liked them and they were delivered as was stated</li>
            <li> These clips stay in my hair, which is all I ask. :)  I have thinnish hair, so some clips just sliiiiiiiide out after a while.  These work for me.</li>
            <li> too  cheaply made. doesn&#x27;t grap the hair,  pulls down.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first couple of times but then started sliding out of my hair just like all the others.</li>
            <li> Exactly how I remember. Back in the day, I got the longer ones but my hair is MUCH thinner than it used to be.  I need to use product and not straighten my hair for these to work but my hair is very thin.  Otherwise, LOVE them!  They really keep the hair off my neck in the hot summer and look super cute!</li>
            <li> just like the 80&#x27;s  love&#x27;em</li>
            <li> Holds well.  My hair is thick and very long.  sometimes the weight gives me headaches if I have pony tails This distributes the weight and keep my hair out of my face, and looks nice.  It doesn&#x27;t slide off like others I have tried.  Best banana comb yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Goody Banana Clips back in the day when you could buy them in stores...Loved them then - Love them now. These are actually better because the teeth are closer and holds my fine hair tighter.  I ordered another brand a while back but most broke when I tried to open them to use - so I tossed those and ordered Goody.</li>
            <li> Plastic seemed very aged like these were original from the 80&#x27;s or something. Would not clip together and stay - kept falling apart because plastic was so old and not pliable.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, not very good for thick/curly hair. I had a hell of a time trying to unlatch this death grip device from my precious curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them. My hair is on the thicker side, and they come apart when I try to put them in my hair. I ordered them because they are great if you have a cut that has different lengths to it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to keep my hair controlled in the hot summer instead of getting it cut off.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these.  They are great for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Worked great to roll my long hair into a french type roll, the ends hold really well.  Soft pliable plastic as opposed to the hard plastic ones which do not work for me.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  You can&#x27;t find the 5&amp;#34; combs anywhere.  Thanks for a great product and a great price for them.</li>
            <li> The first 2 clips that I opened broke. VERY cheap product. I&#x27;m afraid to open the others. I can&#x27;t imagine how old they are for the clip to break so easily. Would NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do.  Just wish it came in other colors.</li>
            <li> My hair did not fit the clinchers.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this clips for my hair! They can look casual or classy! These came in mail fast and in perfect working order! Ty!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn &amp;#34;banana clips&amp;#34; in years, but these were perfect for the updo I wanted for my wedding. It saved a lot of time and pinning with just one clip.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and works great !</li>
            <li> Snug fit and tight hold.  I remember when these were called &amp;#34;banana clips&amp;#34; lol.  I loved them then and still love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to a ponytail and I used to use these banana clips when I was younger so I wanted to give this a shot.  I have a lot of hair that is thin and long.  When I used this, it would slide down my hair within the first minute.  Good concept, poor execution.</li>
            <li> I know that they are out of style but I love them!!</li>
            <li> Great can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> Do not Waste ur money on this!! -.-</li>
            <li> Banana clips are perfect for taming curl hair! They are my go to hair style. I always get complements when I we&#x27;re them.</li>
