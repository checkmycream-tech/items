            <li>Has lasted and lasted even in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>I needed a back up flat iron really fast</li>

            <li>My hair is thick and coarse and it pulls my hair; does not glide smoothly through my hair; while pulling the iron through my hair it will just stop gliding</li>
            <li>and then I get a crease in my hair; does not hold the temperature-keeps re-heating; I am disappointed because the Cortex I bought 5 years ago was a great iron</li>
            <li>but it was a different model number; I tried to find the same model number on your site but Amazon apparently doesn&#x27;t carry it.</li>

            <li> I have been using this straightener for about a year now. It is good if you&#x27;ve never had the pleasure of using a higher end flat iron. It kind of pulls at my hair though and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s breaking it. That being said it&#x27;s not terrible--my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be in bad shape or anything. Although I only use it about once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! Arrived in great time and I haven&#x27;t had an issue out of it at all. Been about a year now. Temperature is right on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron and within a few months, my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair had broken off tremendously. Within 6 months, the damage was irrevesible and I finally tracked the culprit to this \\&quot;demon\\&quot; flatiron. Like I said, \\&quot;Beware\\&quot; and use with caution!</li>
            <li> Not only does this straightener SNAG like crazy, but it broke within the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a CHEAP Andis straightener from WALMART that lasted me 5 years before trying these higher end brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These flat irons are also under lifetime warranty BUT you have to pay to ship the broken one back and another 29 bucks to get another. NOT worth it. I&#x27;d rather save my pennies and buy something decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They won&#x27;t waive the fee because I don&#x27;t have a receipt even though I got this flat iron as a GIFT. Who gives a receipt with a GIFT?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRAPPY, customer service for a REALLY crappy straightener. Two thumbs way down.</li>
            <li> this is a really good flat iron and really gets hot but I dont like the burnt hair smell that it leaves behind</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. works great and straightens my hair ALOT faster than most which is great because i have naturally thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works well. I would recommend this line of hair irons- they work quickly and give good results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful transaction, product works just fine as I expected, no issues here, would recommend seller to anyone, cortex is a versatile brand that works with all hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron if you like ceramic plates. I needed a back up flat iron really fast and it was a good price. I have no complaints at all with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like it works good. Have not had any problems with it so Far...</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong product with the right bar code on it,then I found out you didn&#x27;t have any in stock and then couldn&#x27;t find one for the same price,had to shop on ebay</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s amazing :) and gets extremely hot! Love it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for the wife and she loved it. She&#x27;s very particular with her hair care and she said its one of the best flat irons she has used. Item arrived brand new and in just a few days. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It was my first time ever ordering online , even from amazon . They keep me updated on were my flatirons were and when they were supposed to be delivered . They got here faster then what i expected and they were hide very well :) . I plan on ordering from yall again very soon and the flatirons worked great. Thumbs Up !</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and bouncy. Glides on smoothly. Curling hair is very easy. Heats up fast and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. It really leaves hair smooth and silky feeling when finished. Curved edges also allow you to make curls and turn ends under with ease.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 1/4\\&quot; width is just wide enough for most general use. Has lasted and lasted even in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron it is the best thing since slice bread I will recommend this to anyone thanks</li>
            <li> I have bought this iron twice and it works great! it is %100 ceramic ( I worked with ceramic irons for a few years, I can tell the difference) --- great product, bought the second time because the plate on the first one cracked after 2 years of use and many many drops.. Second time around I ordered it with Amazon PRIME (Free 2 day delivery) and it came in exactly on time first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of hair irons. Its usually the one I always buys. Couldn&#x27;t find it at the store so I bought it here. The iron works perfectly and I love it. The problem was as soon as I open the box it was like if it wasn&#x27;t glued right because the whole box broke open. I&#x27;m glad that the hair iron was and its in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse and it pulls my hair; does not glide smoothly through my hair; while pulling the iron through my hair it will just stop gliding and then I get a crease in my hair; does not hold the temperature-keeps re-heating; I am disappointed because the Cortex I bought 5 years ago was a great iron but it was a different model number; I tried to find the same model number on your site but Amazon apparently doesn&#x27;t carry it. This would probably work for someone with thinner and smoother hair just fin. It just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> The name  says cortex, but when i got it, it said cortico on the side and the flat iron snags the hair really bad. I hate it</li>
            <li> Did not receive the flat iron in the picture,and I used it but it didn&#x27;t live up to the Cortex style flat iron.</li>
            <li> Worked well in London and Paris, with adaptors.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I like it. It gives my hair the same effect as my paul mitchell but ALOT cheaper. It snags my hair once in a while but nothing damageing. I would buy again.</li>
