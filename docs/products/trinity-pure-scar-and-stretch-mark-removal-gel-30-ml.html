            <li>I am very happy I was lucky enough to receive this product @ a special price and will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I am using this for mild rosacea and reddness on my cheek area.</li>
            <li>I ordered this scar and blemish remover as a sample for review and evaluation and I just love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>This was not oily and quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>During that period of my life I was pretty accident prone and have the scars to prove it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most scar and stretch mark cream is actually cream, this is not.</li>
            <li>Lately I have been breaking out around my hairline, and on my jaw right next to my ears, which has not made me very happy at all.</li>
            <li>For instance, I have a large card on my left leg from a hide and seek mishap as a child, along with scars on my knees from wrecking my bicycle so many times.</li>
            <li>in all I like it and plan on using it until my spots are not as noticeable and do recommend it:)&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li>One of the few companies that genuinely formulates their products with highly quality and potent ingredients to help heal your skin...</li>
            <li>Ive been using Trinity Pure for about 2 weeks now and while I am noticing some differences its nothing drastic.</li>
            <li>have been using Trinity Pure for about a week now</li>
            <li>Its a surgery scar and very noticable.</li>
            <li>Knowing that it is all natural makes it worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but now Ian really thanking the one who show me this , and greatful to you , so thank you.</li>
            <li>I have always been very paranoid about that...feel like people are staring at it...</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t used it as much as I have,but it did lighten the color up some.</li>
            <li>I really havent seen any results yet.</li>
            <li>The darker scars are starting to lighten up and the scars that we&#x27;re not as prominent are starting to fade away.</li>
            <li>It has significantly made my scar lighter, and I have tried a bunch of different drugstore scar creams that haven&#x27;t worked nearly as well as this has.</li>
            <li>Once I apply it I apply my moisturizer like normal.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review, and just after a few days of use, the blemish on the side of my nose has finally disappeared!</li>
            <li>It even has made the marks on my face from older blemishes lighten considerably!</li>
            <li>and I noticed a major difference in how much they have faded since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I have a few areas of light scarring on my chin line from acne.</li>
            <li>My son has also been using it on his scars from where he cut open his knee,he wants it to not be as noticeable.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was the only product out there that really worked in fading my blemishes.</li>
            <li>it feels like natural.</li>
            <li>working slowly, need more time</li>
            <li>I also have some dark blemish spots on my forehead that I have been using it on too,but it doesn&#x27;t show up good until I get in the sun,so it makes it hard to notice if there is any change in that yet,but I am hoping there has been:)&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is natural and slightly tinted so it almost seems to make my blemishes and scars appear less visible while treating them, which I have never seen in another product before.</li>
            <li>I applied the Trinity PURE scar and blemish remover for a few days in a row, and now it is completely gone!</li>
            <li>I have alot of over-the-counter expensive creams that help with fine lines and improve hydration, but nothing seems to rid me of my blemishes, so I decided to give Trinity PURE a try.</li>
            <li>I will say that the blemish remover leaves my skin feeling great and i love that its not full of nasty chemicals so definitely pluses there.</li>
            <li>So far I have noticed a minor change so am encouraged.</li>

            <li> I mean seriously I&#x27;m very self conscious and was hoping to try something</li>
            <li> It is a dark cream, but once you rub it in it goes clear.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to write review</li>
            <li> I have had this scar a little over a year, so I am honestly surprised it did anything at all.</li>
            <li> I will admit I havent used it every single day</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, only one ounce, but a tiny bit is all you need at once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was not really smelly like others I have tried and it only took a little bit to apply.</li>
            <li> tried and tried so many products to get rid of a really bad acne scar on my cheek.</li>
            <li> Anyways...I have been trying to work on my skin for the last few years and to reverse the damage I caused.  </li>
            <li> As for the product itself, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a few different scars I have.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this only at night I do feel a slight improvement in my skin!  </li>
            <li> You only need a little product to get the job done!  </li>
            <li> so I will continue to use it as Ive not found any other product that has come close to even helping in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> The marks usually go away, but this product is definitely speeding up that process</li>
            <li> It does not work at all and u guys package it in a long container and the liquid is so very small that i only tried it 3day ..</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to review my purchases on Amazon but never get around to doing it due to lazyness.</li>
            <li> I also applied this product underneath my hair, along my hair line and behind my ears for only 2 nights in a row, and those are finally disappearing too!</li>
            <li> It is a liquid and it has a dark brown color to it.</li>
            <li> And made blemish scars on my face lighter and less visible.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks I can see a slight change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Seen a difference in skin appearance in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now for scar removal.</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on twice a day - everyday.</li>
            <li> Used it on some stretch marks amd it made them much less visible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this issue before and was getting very upset and frustrated.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Trinity not only for my stretch marks, but also for random scars I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure whether it helps on preventing on having the blemish from the beginning.</li>
            <li> and I have been trying a lot of things to get them to at least fade away if not go</li>
            <li> thats not fair and u sold it for 31.99 ....</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you the Trinity serum has almost completely faded my nasty scar away after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant and smell like chemicals.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This seems to work. Some of the redness around my nose is gone. It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant and smell like chemicals. It is very pleasant and not heavy at all. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Product has a pleasant smell and applies easily from the pump dispenser.  Results take up to 6 weeks to begin showing so I will post a follow up after we have had time to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is attractive and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions are honest and of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from acne scaring!  I never had any issues with my skin as a teenager.  Once I hit 30, it finally hit me!  I had pimples everywhere and I was not used to dealing with them so I picked at them (I know).  Anyways...I have been trying to work on my skin for the last few years and to reverse the damage I caused.  I was very happy to be able to try this scar and blemish remover to see if it would make a dent in my past scaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply and I like that this has a pump.  You only need a little product to get the job done!  This was not oily and quickly absorbed into my skin.  After 2 weeks of using this only at night I do feel a slight improvement in my skin!  I am so excited to see the difference after using this continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Ive been using Trinity Pure for about 2 weeks now and while I am noticing some differences its nothing drastic. I will admit I havent used it every single day but I am liking the results so I will continue to use it as Ive not found any other product that has come close to even helping in the slightest bit. I will say that the blemish remover leaves my skin feeling great and i love that its not full of nasty chemicals so definitely pluses there. All in all good product that im happy to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. Lately I have been breaking out around my hairline, and on my jaw right next to my ears, which has not made me very happy at all. It seemed like they would never go away no matter what I did! I&#x27;ve never had this issue before and was getting very upset and frustrated. I was lucky enough to receive this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review, and just after a few days of use, the blemish on the side of my nose has finally disappeared! It has been like a permanent fixture on my face for almost 9 months and I would always try to pick it off, but it would just heal up and come back like it was part of my skin! I applied the Trinity PURE scar and blemish remover for a few days in a row, and now it is completely gone! I was so happy when I woke up and noticed it healing in the way where I knew it was not coming back! I also applied this product underneath my hair, along my hair line and behind my ears for only 2 nights in a row, and those are finally disappearing too! I am truly thankful for and amazed with this product. I also love the fact that it is natural and slightly tinted so it almost seems to make my blemishes and scars appear less visible while treating them, which I have never seen in another product before. It even has made the marks on my face from older blemishes lighten considerably! The marks usually go away, but this product is definitely speeding up that process so I won&#x27;t have to wait 4 months or more for them to be gone! I have been telling everyone I talk to about my great results from this product because I believe it can help anyone wants to get rid of blemishes and lessen the appearance of scars. I definitely will continue using this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Immediate results after just one application.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Works well! Used it on some stretch marks amd it made them much less visible! And made blemish scars on my face lighter and less visible.</li>
            <li> working slowly, need more time</li>
            <li> Really nice product. Has a pleasant smell. Seen a difference in skin appearance in a few days. Just seemed like my scar is not as raised up and red as it was. Its a surgery scar and very noticable. But after using this product, I think the skin around it is finally starting to fade a bit because it doesnt seem as noticable or attention grabbing when I look in the mirror. Its working for me. Glad I got it.   Disclaimer: I was asked to post my unbiased opinion of this product in order to recieve a discount.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to write review</li>
            <li> I ordered this scar and blemish remover as a sample for review and evaluation and I just love that it is all natural! I am using this for mild rosacea and reddness on my cheek area. The serum goes on very easily and absorbs right away, it&#x27;s not sticky, greasy or oily. Once I apply it I apply my moisturizer like normal. I think the key with this is to just keep with it and use it every day. Knowing that it is all natural makes it worth the wait. I inquired to the company as to whether the results are permanent and they will be so I am so excited to see the end result. So far I have noticed a minor change so am encouraged. Overall I am happy with this and feel that it&#x27;s a trustworthy product!</li>
            <li> It does not work at all and u guys package it in a long container and the liquid is so very small that i only tried it 3day ..thats not fair and u sold it for 31.99 ....anyway i av return it back and i av not get the money back .</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream to help get rid of some acne scars and stretch marks. In the short amount of time I have been using this cream I am seeing great improvement in my skin.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff in incredible. My legs were covered in scars from last summer. m talking about being embarrassed to put on shorts type of scars.  I started using this scar and blemish remover 6 weeks ago and there is almost no scaring visible anymore. I am looking forward to putting the shorst back on this summer now. I am ordering my 2nd bottle for me and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Honestly did not see improvement, and it seemed to irritate my skin and cause breakouts, which did not help my cause!!!!</li>
            <li> I wonder about this magic product work , I have scares for more than 20 years and nothing work with it even laser but now Ian really thanking the one who show me this , and greatful to you , so thank you.</li>
            <li> One of the few companies that genuinely formulates their products with highly quality and potent ingredients to help heal your skin...They actually give a s*** about their customers and this is more than evident with their outstanding customer service. They even check up on you and ask for your feedback...I&#x27;m more than impressed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Trinity not only for my stretch marks, but also for random scars I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years. For instance, I have a large card on my left leg from a hide and seek mishap as a child, along with scars on my knees from wrecking my bicycle so many times. During that period of my life I was pretty accident prone and have the scars to prove it!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Trinity Pure for about a week now and I&#x27;m starting to see some results. The darker scars are starting to lighten up and the scars that we&#x27;re not as prominent are starting to fade away. As for the product itself, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be. Most scar and stretch mark cream is actually cream, this is not. It is a liquid and it has a dark brown color to it. It rubs in very easily and doesn&#x27;t stain or anything so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the color. The bottle is small, only one ounce, but a tiny bit is all you need at once.&lt;br /&gt;I have had great results with Trinity Pure and will continue to use it. I would recommend this to anyone with scarring, big or small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review and opinions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I am seeing a change in my skin.  I have a few areas of light scarring on my chin line from acne. I have always been very paranoid about that...feel like people are staring at it...so when given the chance to try this product at a discount I was excited.  After using it for 2 weeks I can see a slight change in my skin.  It is not as red in that area after I wash it and when my skin gets hot/face gets flushed.  It feels smoother too.  I am excited to see how it looks after using it for an extended period of time.  I feel like it will continue to improve over time.  :)</li>
            <li> I have some scars from acne and I have been trying a lot of things to get them to at least fade away if not go away.&lt;br /&gt;I found the Best Scar and Blemish Remover and had to try it out. I mean seriously I&#x27;m very self conscious and was hoping to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I went upstairs and washed my face and applied it. It was not really smelly like others I have tried and it only took a little bit to apply. After days of using it I have noticed some fading starting and I plan on continuing to use it so that the scars will hopefully go away. My son has also been using it on his scars from where he cut open his knee,he wants it to not be as noticeable. He hasn&#x27;t used it as much as I have,but it did lighten the color up some. I also have some dark blemish spots on my forehead that I have been using it on too,but it doesn&#x27;t show up good until I get in the sun,so it makes it hard to notice if there is any change in that yet,but I am hoping there has been:)&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like it and plan on using it until my spots are not as noticeable and do recommend it:)&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li> My skin scars very easily after a break out and I noticed a major difference in how much they have faded since I started using this product. (which was about a week ago) In addition to that, it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer. I have alot of over-the-counter expensive creams that help with fine lines and improve hydration, but nothing seems to rid me of my blemishes, so I decided to give Trinity PURE a try. I am not disappointed. In fact, it was the only product out there that really worked in fading my blemishes. I am very happy I was lucky enough to receive this product @ a special price and will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now for scar removal. The scar is in an area in which I cannot show, however I will say so far I am really impressed. I have been putting it on twice a day - everyday. It has significantly made my scar lighter, and I have tried a bunch of different drugstore scar creams that haven&#x27;t worked nearly as well as this has. I am excited to see several more weeks from now how much more it will fade. I have had this scar a little over a year, so I am honestly surprised it did anything at all. It is a dark cream, but once you rub it in it goes clear. It is also easy to rub in. I am really impressed with the quality of the product, and I am glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a few different scars I have. I think it is absolutely amazing! I do see fading in some of my acne scars which is what bothers me most, but I have also used this on a deeper scar and it helped with the redness that I had to the scar. I think this is a easy product to use and I love the application. It&#x27;s a great size and will come in handy for a long time! Oh and make sure to use it twice a day as instructed to keep the product working its magic!</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to review my purchases on Amazon but never get around to doing it due to lazyness. However this scar and blemish remover is so good I had to write a review for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried and tried so many products to get rid of a really bad acne scar on my cheek. Well let me tell you the Trinity serum has almost completely faded my nasty scar away after a few weeks of use. I dont know how. Maybe it truly is blessed by God. Believe me it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply twice a day before my moisturizer-in the morning and at night. The bottle states that you should always wear sunscreen so please be sure to do so :)</li>
            <li> I Do think it helped my redness go away. But I&#x27;m not sure whether it helps on preventing on having the blemish from the beginning. I really liked the texture of it and the smell . it feels like natural. I should try one more bottle. .</li>
            <li> I really havent seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> Ance Marks Disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;Enriching Vibe.&lt;br /&gt;No Breakouts/Reactions.&lt;br /&gt;Wish It Was Cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;WORTH YOUR MONEY.</li>
