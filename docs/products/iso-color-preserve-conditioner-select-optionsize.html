            <li> (i now use the color preserve shampoo with it) and my color lasts until it&#x27;s time to have it redone (when the roots get ridiculous !!!)  </li>

This is was a real \\&quot;find\\&quot;.</li>

            <li> Best hair detangler by far!  I leave it on after washing my hair for 5 minutes and I can comb straight through my hair.  My hair is normally extremely tangled after shampooing.  Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Gave it a 4 star since there was some delay in the shipment of this item from the seller. However, got the ISO shampoo and conditioner with good packaging and am very happy with the great price I got it for compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for dried, overtreated hair. Leaves my hair soft and not frizzy. Leave it in for 5 mins for best results.</li>

            <li> Been using for years. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Got this and the matching shampoo for my wife. It smells nice and does NOT strip the color prematurely from her hair. Feels really nice afterwards too. Buying again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years now.  Love it!  It smells great, doesn&#x27;t affect hair color, good price, doesn&#x27;t leave hair flat, and can be used on skin too!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Sister-in-law turned me on to it as she had friends that were hairstylists for a dance company. It really is a great shampoo and it&#x27;s hard to find in the salons for some reason. Would highly recommend to anyone. Thanks for the great transaction!</li>

            <li> I have used this conditioner on my hair for over 20 years.  It is a heavy conditioner that makes it easier to comb through my hair, and tames down the natural waves.  I have tried other brands, but this is the only one that works for me.</li>

            <li> Love that this is available on Amazon, and at a very reasonable price.  I alternate between ISO and another product for my highlighted, colored, hair.  Seems to be gentle on my hair and I like that is does foam up, where some others do not.</li>
