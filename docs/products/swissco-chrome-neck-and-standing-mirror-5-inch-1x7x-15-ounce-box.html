            <li>It&#x27;s not a hands free mirror in my opinion, it wobbles from side to side and will not stay in place, so my husband fastened a smooth piece of wood about 8 inches long areound the front of the mirror</li>

            <li>The way the mirror is designed it does not stay straight when you put in around your neck and it leans to one side.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews, the mirror is \\&quot;top heavy\\&quot; and falls over.  </li>
            <li>it makes fixing or cutting your own hair easy!</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this mirror to hang around my neck and then stand backwards against the large mirror in my bathroom so that I could see and style the BACK of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The hook part that goes around the neck is not long enough to use as a hands free mirror to see the back of one&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>It was intended for use by a 98 year old woman, and is of no use to her.</li>
            <li>When you are attempting to do the back of your hair, the mirror \\&quot;rolls\\&quot; to the right or left, it doesn&#x27;t stay still.  </li>
            <li>I really like the mirror, but it is a little top heavy.  </li>

            <li> and she was desperate.  </li>

            <li> product, LOUSY return policy!!</li>
            <li> Design of base does not promote stability.  </li>
            <li> This mirror has a terrible design.  </li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B0029U0YJ6 Swissco Chrome Neck &amp; Standing Mirror, 5-Inch, 1x/7x, 15-Ounce Box]]  Design of base does not promote stability.  Should have width to maintain a proper base to keep mirror from falling to one side.  The point of having a neck mirror is to provide hands-free viewing when styling hair.  This cannot be accomplished when the mirror does not stay in place and falls to one side.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the mirror.  The hook part that goes around the neck is not long enough to use as a hands free mirror to see the back of one&#x27;s head.  When one moves one&#x27;s arms, the mirror flops and it is not possible to see the back of one&#x27;s head.  Mirrors with a longer hook, work for this purpose.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is super. The only problem I find is that the mirror itself could be a little larger as some other mirrors that I already have.  But I do love it.</li>
            <li> The mirror  was shipped quickly and received in good condition.  The magnified side of the  mirror is wonderful for doing make-up. The only negative thing I can say is that the mirror is heavy and tends to slip out from around the neck when you are using it hands free.</li>
            <li> I really like the mirror, but it is a little top heavy.  When you are attempting to do the back of your hair, the mirror \\&quot;rolls\\&quot; to the right or left, it doesn&#x27;t stay still.  It is made really good, not like the plastic kinds that I have used in the past. If the bottom part was wider, that might help also.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE ITEM THAT I PURCHASED, IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> This mirror has a terrible design.  It is UNusable.  The arm for around the neck is TOO short.  The mirror itself is too small. I have had a similar mirror for years &amp; it worked just fine so I definately hope that someone can IMPROVE  on this particular mirror as I need a replacement badly.</li>
            <li> the part that goes around my neck is too short, keeps sliding off</li>
            <li> This mirror is NOT a &#x27;hands-free&#x27; mirror!  It is too small, it wobbles around, and it is not adjustable - so you cannot get the proper angle you need.  Worse yet, I did not realize that Amazon has such a crappy return policy... I bought this mirror because I cut my own hair... and the one I had for over 30 years finally broke - but my hair didn&#x27;t need cutting until now... so I hadn&#x27;t thought to try the mirror prior to now.  It doesn&#x27;t work... and, come to find out, I am 5 days past the return window...  fantastic.  What a total WASTE of money!!  I buy a LOT of gifts from Amazon... but not any more... 30 days is NOT sufficient for allowing for a return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOUSY product, LOUSY return policy!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this mirror to hang around my neck and then stand backwards against the large mirror in my bathroom so that I could see and style the BACK of my hair.  This mirror has no bar across the front area (where it lays against your chest) to keep the mirror IN PLACE while you are working on your hair.  It&#x27;s not a hands free mirror in my opinion, it wobbles from side to side and will not stay in place, so my husband fastened a smooth piece of wood about 8 inches long areound the front of the mirror so it will not WOBBLE while using it.  I had purchased a &#x27;plastic&#x27; mirror prior to this one and it DID have a plastic area across the chest so that it was more secure, but it snapped into during the second use.  The plastic ones will not hold up, but this one definitely needs something ADDED so that it will not sway to one side and the other.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The crook needs to be longer, but it is serviceable.  Really needs to be re-engineered.</li>
            <li> The mirror is of good quality.  I rated it two stars because it is unstable when used as a neck mirror.  It falls to one side when you move your arms.  The weight of the head and the small base make it useless as a neck mirror.  It is now laying on the counter waiting some modification to make it useful.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. It&#x27;s so sturdy, compared to the cheap, plastic ones. With lighting, you can trim the hair on the back of your head. It will assist in styling your hair - the back used to be the dark place that I never saw, and imagined was inhabited by trolls, who hated anything trendy or fashionable. Now I have eyes on the back of my head. I&#x27;m really pleased. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this!! it makes fixing or cutting your own hair easy!</li>
            <li> I have 3 of them in the my bathroom drawer! After awhile it gets loose at the bas and there is no way of tightening it.  I brought one to my beauty supply store and he said that this happens to the swissco mirrors</li>
            <li> This is a great hand mirror. For me it didn&#x27;t work either as a neck mirror or as a standing mirror, it just flops over to one side.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and it didn&#x27;t last a week before the hook had to be taped to even use it.  It ended up not being any better than the one it was bought to replace......and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> The way the mirror is designed it does not stay straight when you put in around your neck and it leans to one side. With that you can&#x27;t see the back of your hair which is the point of this mirror in the 1st place!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, the mirror is \\&quot;top heavy\\&quot; and falls over.  I bought this mirror for my mother, who has used neck mirrors forever to do her hair, her old one has been repaired so many times it&#x27;s unusable and she was desperate.  She has looked everywhere for a replacement and it seemed as if they weren&#x27;t made anymore UNTIL  I saw them on Amazon.  Despite the negative reviews on the mirror, she wanted to try it.  She&#x27;s not thrilled with the product..... just happy to have a mirror to help her do her hair.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror so that I can view the back of my hair when I curl it, however it slides around so I put a towel on my neck to keep it in place.  I had one before that had a flat neck piece &amp; it seemed to stay in place better.</li>
            <li> So easly to see the back of your hair!</li>
            <li> I have had this item before so I knew what I was looking for. However the mirror part loosens easily and does not stay in place. I am still able to use it but the mechanism that holds the mirror does not work well.</li>
            <li> This was not a good product.  The part that hooked around the neck should have had a bigger hook as it didn&#x27;t hang correctly, sent it back.</li>
            <li> Mirror is very sturdy and good quality mirrors.It is not to short and not too long.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is metal and not made from plastic.It is very easy to position where you want it. I would order again.</li>
            <li> The mirror is flimsy and does not hold when tightened. It was intended for use by a 98 year old woman, and is of no use to her. If there is a solution to correcting this problem, please advise.</li>
            <li> Perfect for styling the back of your hair and the magnifying side is perfect for seeing those wrinkles.  Worth the money and I can only hope I never drop it.</li>
