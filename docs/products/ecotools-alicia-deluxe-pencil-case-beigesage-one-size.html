            <li>It&#x27;s an ideal size for taking on vacation or business trips, and I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s even compact enough to be tossed in a purse.</li>
            <li>Handy to toss in a tote and make sure you can get pretty anywhere.</li>
            <li>Also a little compartment for earrings, etc:)  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure amazon will work to make it right.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a set I can jive with that is eco friendly AND attractive.</li>
            <li>So was excited to find it on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>First time, ok, they sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>the removable clear inner pocket is so brilliant!</li>
            <li>They are good at following thru on mistakes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE EcoTools products, and having purchased all of the other Alicia Silverstone bags (including 3 which I purchased from Amazon and was very pleased with), I decided to buy this pencil case as well - to create a set that I will take to college.</li>
            <li>I now have enough room for my brushes in one case and my make-up in another leaving my brushes to be able to retain their shape better and stay cleaner.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to let everyone know that it seems like the problem was fixed and only a day or two after placing my order I received this gorgeous pencil case!  </li>
            <li>and I have them all filled up and ready in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>It came in 3 days (which in my opinion is pretty quickly) and holds everything I want it to.</li>
            <li>not too bulky if you load it right.</li>
            <li>and they were right</li>
            <li>I wanted a compact bag that would leave me with enough room for all of my brushes and a few make-up accessories and this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for getting to me so quickly</li>
            <li>Amazon better get this fixed and send us the right thing free of cost ten times sooner then a week!</li>
            <li>What you are going to get is the simple zip top cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>To those who may be interested in this product I just wanted to say that I took a chance on ordering this using it as a pencil case.</li>
            <li>Pretty and lots of room for extras.</li>
            <li>These two flat compartments are great for, as the picture shows, Q-Tips, oil blotting sheets, or anything else that stays pretty flat.</li>
            <li>I wish that there was a picture on amazon of the case when it is open however after a quick search I was able to find external sites that gave me the information that I needed.  </li>
            <li>I came to my house really fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a ton of make-up, but it fits everything I need and is very compact.  </li>
            <li>For that purpose, it works very well.</li>
            <li>, it is removable, but it is very wobbly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>Right now I use it for a small makeup kit and love being able to see and easily find the small items through the clear vinyl.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit bulky once I get everything into it, though the measurements given on the product page are accurate even when it is full.</li>
            <li>i love the removable inside compartment and finally have a proper place to store brushes and pencils!!!</li>
            <li>Two more zippers open up to a total of three more flat compartments, since the top compartment is actually split into two by a seam running down the middle.</li>
            <li>Miss Silverstone is my hero because she contributes to animal rights efforts like farm sanctuary in orland and in new york.</li>
            <li>but this case will take up most of the space in any small or mid-sized purse.</li>
            <li>i ordered 2 pencil cases thinking it would be perfect for holding  makeup and after waiting a week it came today and guess what, IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM!!</li>
            <li>I think they have fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of the product since I just got this in the mail as part of the complete set</li>
            <li>Based on some of the initial reviews I really wanted to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the quality, and I can&#x27;t wait to use it for travel -</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s full and closed, the case will measure about ten inches</li>
            <li>This has proven very useful for carrying small items (makeup, pens) when commuting and traveling.</li>
            <li>It as a very sweet, delicate design on the outside that makes you want to take it everywhere with you!</li>
            <li>Pencil Case arrived much sooner than expected (thank you!).</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find a cosmetic bag like this- long, small but holds both brushes and other items.</li>
            <li>It fits all my brushes and other makeup items like my foundation, mascara, eyeliners, lipsticks and the middle plastic bag is also removable in case you only need to take that with you instead of the whole case.</li>

            <li> I use the elastic brush holders for lip stain, mini-mascara, and some small brushes.  </li>
            <li> When I received the replacement, it was still the same WRONG item.</li>
            <li> Now I have to waste my time returning the wrong item being shipped and no exchange offered, because the item is under review.  </li>
            <li> But they sent me the wrong item...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so I took a chance and ordered it anyway, despite the reviews saying that wrong item was received.  </li>
            <li> I keep getting the wrong item!  </li>
            <li> I asked for a pencil case and got a cosmetic bag, it&#x27;s very disappointing when you order something you need and get something that you didn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> (I know, pathetic).</li>

            <li> I wanted a compact bag that would leave me with enough room for all of my brushes and a few make-up accessories and this was perfect.  I wish that there was a picture on amazon of the case when it is open however after a quick search I was able to find external sites that gave me the information that I needed.  I now have enough room for my brushes in one case and my make-up in another leaving my brushes to be able to retain their shape better and stay cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is great for my vacation. I came to my house really fast.  Thanks for getting to me so quickly</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful case for my purse. I use it to hold cosmetics, hair ties, headache medicine, etc. It is a little bit bulky once I get everything into it, though the measurements given on the product page are accurate even when it is full. Pay attention to them - the numbers don&#x27;t seem big but this case will take up most of the space in any small or mid-sized purse. When it&#x27;s full and closed, the case will measure about ten inches *around* - using the measuring tape from top to bottom.   The third picture on the product page gives the best sense of the capacity of this case. In the main zippered compartment I keep a folding hairbrush, a powder compact, a sample-sized tube of moisturizer, a small concealer, and a few other bits and bobs. That compartment is attached to the case with Velcro, so it can be removed if one desires. Two more zippers open up to a total of three more flat compartments, since the top compartment is actually split into two by a seam running down the middle. These two flat compartments are great for, as the picture shows, Q-Tips, oil blotting sheets, or anything else that stays pretty flat. I use the elastic brush holders for lip stain, mini-mascara, and some small brushes.  I&#x27;m very impressed by the functionality of this case, as well as the price. If you need something to organize your purse, office desk, or even overnight bag, this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of the Deluxe Pencil cases for myself and daughter. I thought it would be great for our make up brushes.  After waiting what seems like forever for the order to be processed and arrive; I was super disappointed to find 2 cosmetic bags that I didn&#x27;t order.  Now I have to waste my time returning the wrong item being shipped and no exchange offered, because the item is under review.  Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one receiving the wrong item.  Bummed</li>
            <li> UGH! I am so agrivated! i ordered 2 pencil cases thinking it would be perfect for holding  makeup and after waiting a week it came today and guess what, IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM!! Amazon better get this fixed and send us the right thing free of cost ten times sooner then a week! If not its time to call a lawyer and SUE!!</li>
            <li> This has proven very useful for carrying small items (makeup, pens) when commuting and traveling. Right now I use it for a small makeup kit and love being able to see and easily find the small items through the clear vinyl. I also use the small zippered pockets for q-tips and vitamins or pills when I don&#x27;t want to lug around larger bottles. I might consider buying another one and using it just for small office supplies (pens and pencils), but we&#x27;ll see if that becomes necessary.</li>
            <li> I keep getting the wrong item!  They keep sending me the cosmetic bag, which I didnt order.  I&#x27;m sure amazon will work to make it right.  They are good at following thru on mistakes.</li>
            <li> I did not recieve the item I ordered.  They sent me a cosmetic case instead.  It looks like other people have had this issue as well, so why doesn&#x27;t Amazon take the item down until they have this issue fixed?  Do not bother ordering this item, you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find a cosmetic bag like this- long, small but holds both brushes and other items. So was excited to find it on amazon.com. But they sent me the wrong item...TWICE. First time, ok, they sent a replacement. When I received the replacement, it was still the same WRONG item. Do not order from amazon.com for this item. Their inventory is all messed up for this item. What you are going to get is the simple zip top cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> To those who may be interested in this product I just wanted to say that I took a chance on ordering this using it as a pencil case. I did receive the right product and it is great. I think they have fixed the problem. I noticed the dates of the reviews and the last one received her product and I have as well. Worth the price, good quaility and great pockets of space with zippers and removeable clear pouch! Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Received this item on time and the price was good. I love this case because it has sections and zippers for all of your make-up and brushes. not too bulky if you load it right. Cute style. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put my art supplies in it, not for make up and everybody in class asked me about it! It is perfect to put pens and pencils, brushes and I was able to use the compartments for my different types of erasers, a sharpener and some conte crayons! I&#x27;m sure it will be perfect for make up too!  It as a very sweet, delicate design on the outside that makes you want to take it everywhere with you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of make-up, but it fits everything I need and is very compact.  I have gotten compliments on it.  I love the color and fabric.  I really recommend this product as it is great for organizing.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this for school.  What we received however is the cosmetic case with a single zipper.  She likes it and it will work for her purposes (a pencil case) but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that what she got it is also being sold for four dollars cheaper and I&#x27;m essentially not getting what I paid for.  The only way around this was to send it back.  But the seller was already showing them as backordered, which put simply, was that we wouldn&#x27;t be getting one in time for school.  This could have all been resolved by the seller providing contact info.  I&#x27;m not saying they baited and switched me on purpose but I do find it suspect that I have no way to resolve the issue of them oweing me money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of the product since I just got this in the mail as part of the complete set and I am sooooo excited! I have never owned a makeup bag and just used plastic baggies all my life (I know, pathetic). I finally found a set I can jive with that is eco friendly AND attractive. Miss Silverstone is my hero because she contributes to animal rights efforts like farm sanctuary in orland and in new york. Anyway, LOVE the size of this and its lovely appeal! Thank you for creating a beautiful product! Also, this one in particular is really great - i love the removable inside compartment and finally have a proper place to store brushes and pencils!!! Also a little compartment for earrings, etc:)  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I&#x27;ll admit that I may have purchased this product on impulse. I absolutely LOVE EcoTools products, and having purchased all of the other Alicia Silverstone bags (including 3 which I purchased from Amazon and was very pleased with), I decided to buy this pencil case as well - to create a set that I will take to college. Although I don&#x27;t have a use for this bag at the moment, I know that it will come in handy. It&#x27;s an ideal size for taking on vacation or business trips, and I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s even compact enough to be tossed in a purse.</li>
            <li> I asked for a pencil case and got a cosmetic bag, it&#x27;s very disappointing when you order something you need and get something that you didn&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> Based on some of the initial reviews I really wanted to try this product.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so I took a chance and ordered it anyway, despite the reviews saying that wrong item was received.  I just wanted to let everyone know that it seems like the problem was fixed and only a day or two after placing my order I received this gorgeous pencil case!  I was really surprised by the quality, and I can&#x27;t wait to use it for travel - the removable clear inner pocket is so brilliant!</li>
            <li> I have been using all Ecotools products and I really loved them ,,, when it comes to the materials are so good and valuable ,, it is really worth your money ,,</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item to use as a pencil case, not a makeup bag. For that purpose, it works very well. It came in 3 days (which in my opinion is pretty quickly) and holds everything I want it to. The only problem I found with it is that in the description it said removable container (or something like that) and they were right, it is removable, but it is very wobbly. I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Pretty and lots of room for extras. Handy to toss in a tote and make sure you can get pretty anywhere.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! It fits all my brushes and other makeup items like my foundation, mascara, eyeliners, lipsticks and the middle plastic bag is also removable in case you only need to take that with you instead of the whole case. Would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Pencil Case arrived much sooner than expected (thank you!). This is a beautiful case (Beige/Sage) with plenty of storage/zippered compartments to keep everything organized and neat. I&#x27;ve stored eye pencils, brushes, foundation, concealer, blush, eyelash curler, etc. utilizing all the compartments, and this case still folds up neatly and stays shut with the Velcro tabs. I purchased the Ecotools Alicia Train Case (the colors coordinate) and store my pencil case within the train case. It fits perfectly within and keeps everything organized. I am extremely pleased with the pencil case! It&#x27;s better than anything I have seen in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought a series of these and they&#x27;ve been great. They come in every size and shape and for different uses and I have them all filled up and ready in my suitcase. I don&#x27;t even have to think about what I need to pack and just add my clothes on top and I&#x27;m ready to go. Love the pattern, the feel, and shapes of the series.</li>
            <li> The material and design is so cute and perfect.  It holds everything I need it to and I still have room.  I purchased the train case and makeup bag, also, and they&#x27;re all a perfect match.  Now all my makeup and travel necessities are neatly organized. Best part of all, it&#x27;s eco-friendly.  It couldn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
