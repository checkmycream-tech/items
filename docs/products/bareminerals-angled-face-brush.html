            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AS USUAL</li>
            <li> This brush is a little flimsier and not as soft as I remember.  It&#x27;s alright and does what it is supposed to do, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty nice, but I feel like the bristles are a little harsh. They don&#x27;t feel very soft against your skin.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great coverage</li>
            <li> Was looking for something for liquid makeup. This is too soft But great with my minerals.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for contouring and there&#x27;s just something about it that gets it done so quick. I have really sensitive skin and this brush is so soft. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is a must have for anyone who wears makeup. I love it and believe you will too! Buy it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> brush is a perfect size for everyday use and even travel.&lt;br /&gt;wish the bristles were a little softer but i still use this everyday.</li>
            <li> This is okay for a blush brush, but the handle and head is too small. I expected a full sized brush but it makes me have to apply a couple times to cover my desired areas.</li>
            <li> I wish the brush were a little bit bigger, but I do like the angle.  It makes it very easy to sweep on cheeks.  The bristles are incredibly soft.  I use it for blush, but it could also work for a powder.</li>
            <li> Brush is much to soft for makeup application</li>
            <li> Always choose to purchase Bare Escentuals from Amazon prime because of the great shipping reliability Bare Escentuals online can&#x27;t offer.</li>
            <li> This is the name brand product I am used to for the bargain price. I&#x27;ve been using these brushes with the bare minerals make up for years and haven&#x27;t tried any others to compare it to nor do I feel it necessary. As long as you clean the brushes on a regular basis (I do mine once a week with gentle face wash and warm water) they last forever. This is my first ever replacement of a brush since I received my first BM foundation over 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> The brush is a replacement for an oldet version. It is good quality and is working great .</li>
            <li> This is a very soft brush and applies products well. When I use this brush, It&#x27;s very easy to blend blushes/bronzers and I don&#x27;t have to spend very much time on it (thanks to the brush blending in the products well). I wasn&#x27;t sure about the brush because I had never tried bareminerals brushers before, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased, I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to travel with, very soft, perfect for blush or bronzer! Shipped fast. The handle is a little short, so if you are looking for a long handle, I wouldn&#x27;t go with this one!</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals brushes. They are soo soft and last forever!  Important to keep them clean.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the angle on this brush as it delivers just the right amount and you don&#x27;t have clown cheeks! Great for sculpting face .</li>
            <li> Wonderful !! I love using this bush better than the straight one!!! I also bought the blush angled one !!</li>
            <li> I use this for like a bare minerals face powder. It is awesome, applies evenly, and covers well! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this angled brush...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BE makeup products almost 20 years. Some items are not easy to find by themselves, but I have needed an angled brush for awhile. They do last a very long time, but a new one every 3-4 years (or an extra one) is nice. Thanks for the brush and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush!! Very soft and perfect for applying powders.Its small enough to take anywhere.  I would def recommend buying. Thanks</li>
