            <li>I love these rollers to death!!!  </li>
            <li>makes them have a very nice curl!</li>
            <li>and I had beautiful bouncy curls that stayed in all day.</li>
            <li>I watched a video on youtube where beautiful locks were achieved with this product.</li>
            <li>these curlers are awesome - heat up nicely &amp; make curls that hold.</li>
            <li>but it worked great on my hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping process was great everything   was in execellent order.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, these would have been great</li>
            <li>but they work great</li>
            <li>Also, the rag rollers themselves are not that great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these about a dozen times and I&#x27;m happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too happy as rollers do not stay on hair well.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t burn your fingers or scalp, so they will work great for children, elderly and everyone else in-between.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Their my favorite!!</li>
            <li>think if you let the rollers get very, very warm and experiment with them</li>
            <li>What I do love about this product, is that the storage case is wonderful and keeps everything organized.</li>
            <li>It may be good for shorter hair though.  </li>
            <li>I really loved the way it looked.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved my results.</li>
            <li>It was good.</li>
            <li>I use a curling wand now and it gives me really good curls.</li>
            <li>I suggest spraying your hair with a good hairspray before and after you put them in too.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my order.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with these rollers -</li>

            <li>I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>Farrah Fawcett flips, beach waves, and more!</li>
            <li>This was my lucky beauty week -- TWO products in a row so good that I got off my duff to write reviews about them!</li>
            <li>If this was a sturdier product, it would be amazing.</li>
            <li>They might work nicely on someone with shoulder length or shorter hair.</li>
            <li>wouldnt convince anyone to go searching for these not so all that rollers, but advise that you buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Instructions states to let the rods warm for 15 minutes before using.</li>
            <li>THEY PRODUCE A NICE CURL.</li>
            <li>let them warm for 15-20 mins (zip case up to retain the heat)</li>
            <li>The curls are beautiful and it is worth using on days when I have time.  </li>
            <li>They were very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I personally love the cute case it comes in!  </li>
            <li>These hot, cloth covered rollers are the best thing around for curling fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, unwilling to curl hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to carry around!</li>
            <li>They are VERY comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I bet I could sleep in them over night to lock in the curls even more.    </li>
            <li>Give these a shot -- even if you don&#x27;t love them for $15</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I saw a video of someone demonstrating these rollers on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have recommended this product to my friends along with the Amazon website information where I was able to find them after having looked on many sites.  </li>
            <li>I had curled most of my hair</li>
            <li>and I Still needed about 4-5 more rollers.</li>
            <li>I will try it , I love these rollers they do take time to heat up</li>
            <li>I really love the compact case and results these rollers give.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite way to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>Remington, give us an indicator--youre better than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do love the results.  </li>
            <li>I found that warmer rollers worked better for my hair).  </li>

            <li>Love these rollers..</li>
            <li>Love the look it gives.</li>
            <li>You will have much better results with a good set of hot rollers or a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>I loved the Clairol Benders hot sticks, but they are &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; on ebay now.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to give these a fair shot &amp; thought maybe if I use it in hair</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am always in search of an easy way to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Easy to roll the hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair curls easily but not with these things.</li>
            <li>EASY TO PACK ALSO</li>
            <li>Easy to roll your hair for a bouncy curl.  </li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rollers do not get super hot like old fashioned rollers, which makes my fingers and ears very happy.  </li>
            <li>my hair is fine and just about shoulder length.</li>
            <li>Because my fine hair does hold a curl under those circumstances.</li>
            <li>The revlon 3 barrel waver is much better to achieve that result quickly.</li>
            <li>Rollers are nice and easy to use - but gets only warm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say these are great for someone who has short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased these rollers after seeing a video on youtube, the young lady was really happy and excited about them, after seeing the finished product her hair looked amazing!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure your hair is freshly washed</li>
            <li>They are even comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>They work both on hair extensions, and your regular hair, great investment.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THEY ARE LIGHT WIEGHT OT INSTALL.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to sleep in (if you don&#x27;t want to use heat).   </li>
            <li>and they worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>These are quick and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I ordered these after watching a video that made them look so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine, as most may say, \\&quot;asian\\&quot; hair (please don&#x27;t get offended).  </li>
            <li>, I have long hair so these work very nice on my hair , I love that they are not too hot that they won&#x27;t damage the hair .</li>
            <li>Perhaps my hair was too clean?</li>
            <li>Makes hair look much more natural and keeps healthy.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers have positive comments while others, not so much&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It works well, and heats up fast :)</li>
            <li>And even when I kept replacing them in my hair and kept them in until they were cool (as per the directions)</li>
            <li>This take a full 30 minutes to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaving the rollers in for a couple of minutes (2-5) created nice, soft waves.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good curl, I would save your money and put it towards some different rollers or a curling wand.</li>
            <li>Instead, I got a head full of frizz from the lukewarm curlers</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t buy it when I saw them but $19 is not a bad price to pay for comfortable/versatile heat rollers.</li>
            <li>But once they&#x27;re good and hot they create fantastic curls in a fairly short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>the reviews from several sources said, these rollers do not get hot, more like luke warm.</li>
            <li>Quick to heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After watching a you tube tutorial demostration video about the greatness of these \\&quot;All That\\&quot; beach rollers, I was super hyped about ordering them.</li>
            <li>First, all of my hair fit onto the 16 rods.</li>
            <li>The rollers take forever to heat up and still dont get very hot at all even leaving the curlers in my hair for 30 minutes doesnt give me the \\&quot;beach wave\\&quot; result that the product itself is named after.</li>
            <li>Warm up fast and produces a better ringlet curl vs your traditional spiral.</li>
            <li>you are interested in \\&quot;different\\&quot; rollers that do not use heat, I would recommend Curlformers (search for it on google or youtube, also available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store).  </li>
            <li>My first set lasted about 4 years before the bending wires tangled up beyond repair, but at this price, I am not complaining!  </li>
            <li>I have naturally straight, fine hair, but these rollers give me nice waves that last all day.</li>
            <li>I love that you just fold them into your hair rather than fuss with metal pins like normal hot rollers -</li>
            <li>having seeing the desired result on a home made video proves that this product is not necessisarily misleading, but it is not for all hair types, textures and lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the case is HIGHLY portable and the rollers are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They just slipped right out.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t do this right?</li>
            <li>I have naturally blonde hair which is very fine.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well, but clip them in your hair right</li>
            <li>The curlers are so soft and easy to sleep on.  </li>
            <li>Well my hair is naturally wavy and curls extremely easily and once curled it stays.</li>
            <li>I love the rollers they are the best for my hair the curl stays in, I have long hair but thin, so they make my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>Product works very fast.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, and same result as the flexi rods except you don&#x27;t have to put thm in overnight.</li>
            <li>I will most likely use for my daughter as her hair grows or give it to someone as a gift that has shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish they came in a bigger curl size for more variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can create numerous looks that I absolutely love without the fear of breakage.</li>
            <li>I also love how it takes 10-15 short minutes to create each look and each look can be created while on the go.</li>
            <li>I personally need more rollers but I can work with what I have.</li>
            <li>They did not seem to get that hot.</li>
            <li>The only thing these rollers do for me is give me more body.</li>
            <li>Even wearing my regular $2 foam rollers overnight gave a better result than this product.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking about buying remington hot rollers</li>
            <li>yup its hot and burned myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2ndly, although the plates get hot, the rollers do not.</li>
            <li>only consolation i have in ths purchase is that for $20 I do not have a problem with regifting them to a close pal who may have better luck with them</li>
            <li>and more and the results were the same.</li>
            <li>Even after 30 minutes of heating, they don&#x27;t feel really hot to the touch, and the curl doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>They work OK for traditional curls.</li>
            <li>these reasonably priced rods (that don&#x27;t get very hot) were going to do much for me.      </li>
            <li>There are 14 small rollers which work great for short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They work extremely well on weaved hair, it takes the curl so nicely.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had gotten into hot rollers as a younger person...and not having the metal clips makes these pretty easy to handle...and they stow neatly in the case.</li>
            <li>I typically let them warm for 30 minutes to an hour which gets them really hot</li>
            <li>It provided me the flexibility to roll my hair quickly with hot rollers, complete the rest of my morning routine then remove and go.  </li>
            <li>Positive  </li>
            <li>the only problem was the time it took to get to my house, other than that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>They seem to be gentle on my hair though which I do like and not overly hot.</li>
            <li>My hair is always shiney and full of body after using this product which is a complete necessity for me.</li>
            <li>I have a disability that prevents me from being able to hold my arms up for a very long time.</li>
            <li>And they are so simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but my problem is my hair is quite fine and straight and sometimes they fall out (especially the ones on the bottom)!</li>
            <li>Even in high humidity, or rainy weather!  </li>
            <li>I tried these with straight hair, i&#x27;ve tried it with curly hair...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for having them in stock, and please keep selling them, they are awsome.    </li>
            <li>They lose their heat fast.    </li>
            <li>I really wanted to buy another variety by conair, but it seems they don&#x27;t make them anymore.</li>
            <li>I really wish these worked.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>it claims really says a lot.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>work really well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted these to work for my hair...</li>
            <li>These rollers are very convenient.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and you cant do that if you intend on covering your whole head with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wire that allows the roller to bend, is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>The rollers gave me really well defined curls.</li>
            <li>because that seems like it would just be WAY too much curl</li>
            <li>but they are certainly comfortable enough.  </li>
            <li>Hair becomes much manageable and flowy to the touch.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very curly.</li>
            <li>THESE WOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH THIN HAIR OR</li>
            <li>While it is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to warm up enough to create a \\&quot;great\\&quot; curl, unless you use very little hair in each roller.  </li>
            <li>My hair was becoming extremely dry</li>
            <li>so I ordered them, but they just didn&#x27;t work on my long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Then when I took them out my hair just looked kinky more than it did curled, so I had to change the plans of wearing it mostly down for the event I was headed to.</li>
            <li>I have great hair for curling and straightening, it&#x27;s pretty thick and very long, and I thought these rollers would answer my quest for curls...  </li>
            <li>Of course for looser curls, you would use more hair per roller, or leave in for less time.</li>
            <li>Luckily i could return them, but i still am short of all the shipping i paid for them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>Also, the rollers get hot enough to curl but stay cool enough as to not burn my fingers-big plus.  </li>
            <li>They do not get hot enough and just really don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very long thick hair and these worked great.</li>
            <li>I also feel like the soft texture is better for my hair than the hard plastic and metal pins of normal hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>While they ARE very easy, they are certainly not very quick, and 16 rollers were not enough to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>then I did or keeping them around if someone wanted to borrow them to try a new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have said, the curlers don&#x27;t heat up much--not even after plugging them in for a good half hour.    </li>
            <li>I find that leaving them in for around a 1/2 at least gives me a very strong curl.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah it never gets hot enough to burn you</li>
            <li>15 minutes does not get the rollers hot enough to curl your hair.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>Definitely think they&#x27;re pretty nifty.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you curls that last the whole day...</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Plus, these rods are so soft and bendy</li>
            <li>Get dress, take them out and you have curls that will last you the whole day depending on the weather.</li>
            <li>Leaving the rollers for much longer created big, bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always drop the pins or lose them and this completely eliminates that problem.  </li>
            <li>think this product is a complete hit or miss.</li>
            <li>It does create a soft curl, but it doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>WHO IS SENSITIVE,( KIDS, ELDERLY,THINNING HAIR)</li>
            <li>I got mine at Wal-mart on sale and so far they have served me well.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair, It is up to my shoulders, and I need more rollers.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t curl well enough for me, probably because they do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>You can wake up, &amp; in about 20 mins, 5 to heat up, 10 mins, to keep in your hair nd 2 to take out, you are ready to go, and the curls last a long time.</li>
            <li>Mine still work after a year of having them and ive only used them twice so far..</li>
            <li>These rollers barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li>These rollers work OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>They do take a long time to heat up - I usually plug them in right when I get up in the morning and then take a shower/get ready while they heat.  </li>
            <li>I personally use Tcb&#x27;s foaming Wrap-N-Set Lotion because it holds my curls while keeping my hair soft and giving it an extra shine.</li>
            <li>Great for my daughters thin hair, but not made for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I let them cook for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;Putting them in your hair is the easy part, but not worth the anticipation of waiting to see the final result.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>My curls came out after about an hour but with typical hot rollers they sometimes don&#x27;t even last until I get all of my rollers out!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend you just buy hot rollers, these were a waste of money....</li>
            <li>Normally, with other roller sets and irons, it takes about 15 minutes to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>Since they are not very expensive, I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one when the old ones are broken.  </li>

            <li> these curlers are awesome - heat up nicely &amp; make curls that hold.</li>
            <li> but it worked great on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping process was great everything   was in execellent order.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, these would have been great</li>
            <li> but they work great</li>
            <li> Also, the rag rollers themselves are not that great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these about a dozen times and I&#x27;m happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too happy as rollers do not stay on hair well.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t burn your fingers or scalp, so they will work great for children, elderly and everyone else in-between.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Their my favorite!!</li>
            <li> think if you let the rollers get very, very warm and experiment with them</li>
            <li> What I do love about this product, is that the storage case is wonderful and keeps everything organized.</li>
            <li> It may be good for shorter hair though.  </li>
            <li> I really loved the way it looked.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved my results.</li>
            <li> It was good.</li>
            <li> I use a curling wand now and it gives me really good curls.</li>
            <li> I suggest spraying your hair with a good hairspray before and after you put them in too.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order.      </li>

            <li> Farrah Fawcett flips, beach waves, and more!</li>
            <li> This was my lucky beauty week -- TWO products in a row so good that I got off my duff to write reviews about them!</li>
            <li> If this was a sturdier product, it would be amazing.</li>
            <li> They might work nicely on someone with shoulder length or shorter hair.</li>
            <li> wouldnt convince anyone to go searching for these not so all that rollers, but advise that you buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Instructions states to let the rods warm for 15 minutes before using.</li>
            <li> THEY PRODUCE A NICE CURL.</li>
            <li> let them warm for 15-20 mins (zip case up to retain the heat)</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful and it is worth using on days when I have time.  </li>
            <li> They were very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I personally love the cute case it comes in!  </li>

            <li> I have very fine, unwilling to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to carry around!</li>
            <li> They are VERY comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I bet I could sleep in them over night to lock in the curls even more.    </li>
            <li> Give these a shot -- even if you don&#x27;t love them for $15</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I saw a video of someone demonstrating these rollers on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I had curled most of my hair</li>
            <li> and I Still needed about 4-5 more rollers.</li>
            <li> I will try it , I love these rollers they do take time to heat up</li>
            <li> I really love the compact case and results these rollers give.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> Remington, give us an indicator--youre better than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do love the results.  </li>
            <li> I found that warmer rollers worked better for my hair).  </li>

            <li> Love these rollers..</li>
            <li> Love the look it gives.</li>
            <li> You will have much better results with a good set of hot rollers or a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> I loved the Clairol Benders hot sticks, but they are &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; on ebay now.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to give these a fair shot &amp; thought maybe if I use it in hair</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of an easy way to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Easy to roll the hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair curls easily but not with these things.</li>
            <li> EASY TO PACK ALSO</li>
            <li> Easy to roll your hair for a bouncy curl.  </li>
            <li> They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rollers do not get super hot like old fashioned rollers, which makes my fingers and ears very happy.  </li>
            <li> my hair is fine and just about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Because my fine hair does hold a curl under those circumstances.</li>
            <li> The revlon 3 barrel waver is much better to achieve that result quickly.</li>
            <li> Rollers are nice and easy to use - but gets only warm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say these are great for someone who has short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these rollers after seeing a video on youtube, the young lady was really happy and excited about them, after seeing the finished product her hair looked amazing!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure your hair is freshly washed</li>
            <li> They are even comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> They work both on hair extensions, and your regular hair, great investment.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEY ARE LIGHT WIEGHT OT INSTALL.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to sleep in (if you don&#x27;t want to use heat).   </li>
            <li> and they worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are quick and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after watching a video that made them look so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have straight fine, as most may say, \\&quot;asian\\&quot; hair (please don&#x27;t get offended).  </li>
            <li> , I have long hair so these work very nice on my hair , I love that they are not too hot that they won&#x27;t damage the hair .</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair was too clean?</li>
            <li> Makes hair look much more natural and keeps healthy.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers have positive comments while others, not so much&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> It works well, and heats up fast :)</li>
            <li> And even when I kept replacing them in my hair and kept them in until they were cool (as per the directions)</li>
            <li> This take a full 30 minutes to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaving the rollers in for a couple of minutes (2-5) created nice, soft waves.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good curl, I would save your money and put it towards some different rollers or a curling wand.</li>
            <li> Instead, I got a head full of frizz from the lukewarm curlers</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t buy it when I saw them but $19 is not a bad price to pay for comfortable/versatile heat rollers.</li>
            <li> But once they&#x27;re good and hot they create fantastic curls in a fairly short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> the reviews from several sources said, these rollers do not get hot, more like luke warm.</li>
            <li> Quick to heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After watching a you tube tutorial demostration video about the greatness of these \\&quot;All That\\&quot; beach rollers, I was super hyped about ordering them.</li>
            <li> First, all of my hair fit onto the 16 rods.</li>
            <li> The rollers take forever to heat up and still dont get very hot at all even leaving the curlers in my hair for 30 minutes doesnt give me the \\&quot;beach wave\\&quot; result that the product itself is named after.</li>
            <li> Warm up fast and produces a better ringlet curl vs your traditional spiral.</li>
            <li> you are interested in \\&quot;different\\&quot; rollers that do not use heat, I would recommend Curlformers (search for it on google or youtube, also available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store).  </li>
            <li> My first set lasted about 4 years before the bending wires tangled up beyond repair, but at this price, I am not complaining!  </li>
            <li> I have naturally straight, fine hair, but these rollers give me nice waves that last all day.</li>
            <li> I love that you just fold them into your hair rather than fuss with metal pins like normal hot rollers -</li>
            <li> having seeing the desired result on a home made video proves that this product is not necessisarily misleading, but it is not for all hair types, textures and lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the case is HIGHLY portable and the rollers are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They just slipped right out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t do this right?</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair which is very fine.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well, but clip them in your hair right</li>
            <li> The curlers are so soft and easy to sleep on.  </li>
            <li> Well my hair is naturally wavy and curls extremely easily and once curled it stays.</li>
            <li> I love the rollers they are the best for my hair the curl stays in, I have long hair but thin, so they make my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> Product works very fast.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, and same result as the flexi rods except you don&#x27;t have to put thm in overnight.</li>
            <li> I will most likely use for my daughter as her hair grows or give it to someone as a gift that has shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish they came in a bigger curl size for more variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They can create numerous looks that I absolutely love without the fear of breakage.</li>
            <li> I also love how it takes 10-15 short minutes to create each look and each look can be created while on the go.</li>
            <li> I personally need more rollers but I can work with what I have.</li>
            <li> They did not seem to get that hot.</li>
            <li> The only thing these rollers do for me is give me more body.</li>
            <li> Even wearing my regular $2 foam rollers overnight gave a better result than this product.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking about buying remington hot rollers</li>
            <li> yup its hot and burned myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2ndly, although the plates get hot, the rollers do not.</li>
            <li> only consolation i have in ths purchase is that for $20 I do not have a problem with regifting them to a close pal who may have better luck with them</li>
            <li> and more and the results were the same.</li>
            <li> Even after 30 minutes of heating, they don&#x27;t feel really hot to the touch, and the curl doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> They work OK for traditional curls.</li>
            <li> these reasonably priced rods (that don&#x27;t get very hot) were going to do much for me.      </li>
            <li> There are 14 small rollers which work great for short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> They work extremely well on weaved hair, it takes the curl so nicely.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten into hot rollers as a younger person...and not having the metal clips makes these pretty easy to handle...and they stow neatly in the case.</li>
            <li> I typically let them warm for 30 minutes to an hour which gets them really hot</li>
            <li> It provided me the flexibility to roll my hair quickly with hot rollers, complete the rest of my morning routine then remove and go.  </li>
            <li> Positive  </li>
            <li> the only problem was the time it took to get to my house, other than that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> They seem to be gentle on my hair though which I do like and not overly hot.</li>
            <li> My hair is always shiney and full of body after using this product which is a complete necessity for me.</li>
            <li> I have a disability that prevents me from being able to hold my arms up for a very long time.</li>
            <li> And they are so simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but my problem is my hair is quite fine and straight and sometimes they fall out (especially the ones on the bottom)!</li>
            <li> Even in high humidity, or rainy weather!  </li>
            <li> I tried these with straight hair, i&#x27;ve tried it with curly hair...</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for having them in stock, and please keep selling them, they are awsome.    </li>
            <li> They lose their heat fast.    </li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy another variety by conair, but it seems they don&#x27;t make them anymore.</li>
            <li> I really wish these worked.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> it claims really says a lot.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> work really well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work for my hair...</li>
            <li> These rollers are very convenient.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and you cant do that if you intend on covering your whole head with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wire that allows the roller to bend, is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The rollers gave me really well defined curls.</li>
            <li> because that seems like it would just be WAY too much curl</li>
            <li> but they are certainly comfortable enough.  </li>
            <li> Hair becomes much manageable and flowy to the touch.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very curly.</li>
            <li> THESE WOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH THIN HAIR OR</li>
            <li> While it is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to warm up enough to create a \\&quot;great\\&quot; curl, unless you use very little hair in each roller.  </li>
            <li> My hair was becoming extremely dry</li>
            <li> so I ordered them, but they just didn&#x27;t work on my long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Then when I took them out my hair just looked kinky more than it did curled, so I had to change the plans of wearing it mostly down for the event I was headed to.</li>
            <li> I have great hair for curling and straightening, it&#x27;s pretty thick and very long, and I thought these rollers would answer my quest for curls...  </li>
            <li> Of course for looser curls, you would use more hair per roller, or leave in for less time.</li>
            <li> Luckily i could return them, but i still am short of all the shipping i paid for them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Also, the rollers get hot enough to curl but stay cool enough as to not burn my fingers-big plus.  </li>
            <li> They do not get hot enough and just really don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long thick hair and these worked great.</li>
            <li> I also feel like the soft texture is better for my hair than the hard plastic and metal pins of normal hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> While they ARE very easy, they are certainly not very quick, and 16 rollers were not enough to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> then I did or keeping them around if someone wanted to borrow them to try a new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the curlers don&#x27;t heat up much--not even after plugging them in for a good half hour.    </li>
            <li> I find that leaving them in for around a 1/2 at least gives me a very strong curl.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah it never gets hot enough to burn you</li>
            <li> 15 minutes does not get the rollers hot enough to curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Definitely think they&#x27;re pretty nifty.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you curls that last the whole day...</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Plus, these rods are so soft and bendy</li>
            <li> Get dress, take them out and you have curls that will last you the whole day depending on the weather.</li>
            <li> Leaving the rollers for much longer created big, bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always drop the pins or lose them and this completely eliminates that problem.  </li>
            <li> think this product is a complete hit or miss.</li>
            <li> It does create a soft curl, but it doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> WHO IS SENSITIVE,( KIDS, ELDERLY,THINNING HAIR)</li>
            <li> I got mine at Wal-mart on sale and so far they have served me well.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, It is up to my shoulders, and I need more rollers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t curl well enough for me, probably because they do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> You can wake up, &amp; in about 20 mins, 5 to heat up, 10 mins, to keep in your hair nd 2 to take out, you are ready to go, and the curls last a long time.</li>
            <li> Mine still work after a year of having them and ive only used them twice so far..</li>
            <li> These rollers barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers work OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> They do take a long time to heat up - I usually plug them in right when I get up in the morning and then take a shower/get ready while they heat.  </li>
            <li> I personally use Tcb&#x27;s foaming Wrap-N-Set Lotion because it holds my curls while keeping my hair soft and giving it an extra shine.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughters thin hair, but not made for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I let them cook for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;Putting them in your hair is the easy part, but not worth the anticipation of waiting to see the final result.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> My curls came out after about an hour but with typical hot rollers they sometimes don&#x27;t even last until I get all of my rollers out!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend you just buy hot rollers, these were a waste of money....</li>
            <li> Normally, with other roller sets and irons, it takes about 15 minutes to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> Since they are not very expensive, I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one when the old ones are broken.  </li>
            <li> The heating element is not very big, which means you really have to use fairly small pieces of hair to get it to work, which only adds to the amount of time/effort you have to put in to get them to turn out.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the metal on the inside tends to bend under the fabric covering so they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a set for 6 months to a year depending on how much I use them.  </li>
            <li> it works on short and long hair &amp; does not damage the hair</li>
            <li> Curls last all day long!   </li>
            <li> I dont have thin or thick hair, it&#x27;s regular and curls very easily so for this product not to give the result</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and not very thick.</li>
            <li> Both time it got a little wavy (after heating it up for an hr) &amp; keeping curlers in for about 30 mind in the hair, but 10 mins in they completely fell apart!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do like softness  of the product, however very time consuming to use (at least for me)</li>
            <li> This is definately not a product for people with long hair either.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair down to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> It has been very hard to track a place that still sells these cloth hot curlers, I had been all over the web trying to find a place that still sells them.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t take very long for my hair to take the curl</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have that thick of hair - pretty average.)</li>
            <li> small but natural curls</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, due to my type of hair, the curls don&#x27;t hold very long</li>
            <li> My hair was slipping out of the roller</li>
            <li> Its not what I expected and</li>
            <li> is starting to wear out after almost everyday use.</li>
            <li> There is no light or indicator to tell you that the thing is actually on.</li>
            <li> Initial practice yielded uneven and kinky curls.</li>
            <li> These rollers did not really curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have long hair but its not extra thick.</li>
            <li> Yes, the roller heat up and yes, they curl, but only if you leave them in for a VERY long time (a couple of hours at least).</li>
            <li> My hair is not super soft or anything, my strands of hair are thick.</li>
            <li> BUT other than that no complaints</li>
            <li> These curlers only work is you take small one inch to two inches of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I let them stay on for 30 mins for loose waves and all night if I want tight curls.</li>
            <li> I was FLAT DEAD wrong (much like my hair after taking them out).</li>
            <li> If these are going to work you have to take small sections of the hair since they hardly heat and only the middle heats.</li>
            <li> Left them in for 15 mins, and had HARDLY A WAVE, let alone a curl.</li>
            <li> The drawback, however, is that the metal rods inside the rollers tend to bend out of shape VERY soon and become useless.  </li>
            <li> And the rollers themselves hardly stay closed and fall loosely out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the rollers didn&#x27;t work well for my hair as an African American.  </li>
            <li> (I had them in maybe 20 minutes, maybe even less).  </li>
            <li> I waited over half hour before I rolled them in.</li>
            <li> They are a pain/difficult to use--at least with long, straight/slick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was ify about purchasing this item because of my type of hair (thick, long, and chemically treated[Relaxed]).</li>
            <li> you have thick long hair, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t suggest for long OR thick hair.</li>
            <li> 1st problem was that the rollers would not stay tight in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I put them in tight.</li>
            <li> The rollers were very heavy and didn&#x27;t clasp closed</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has very long thick hair</li>
            <li> But when I mentioned this to the dumb bimbo on the phone she said that they don&#x27;t take products back that  have been &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My secret is to heat the rollers, put them on at night, leave them on all night, finger comb in the morning, and the curls will then last ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> All that time wasted and no curl.</li>
            <li> WOW,what a waste of money.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;1: NO LIGHT INDICATOR&lt;</li>
            <li> but these were a waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I rely heavily on customer reviews via the website I&#x27;m ordering from &amp; Youtube.</li>
            <li> The problems with other reviewers could have been that their hair was too thick</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll want to plug these in at least half an hour</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product does not work well with my hair, even though tutorials on You Tube for this product share the same texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li> You just plug this up and wait a few minutes, part your hair and roll it up!</li>
            <li> Tried a few times, it is sitting at the bottom of the drawer with the rest of Did not work for me items!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, its pointless.  </li>
            <li> So I purchased them and anxiously did my hair</li>
            <li> WHAT A TOTAL FAIL..</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would tame my thick frizzy hair...let me say, 1st of all, they don&#x27;t stay in.  </li>
            <li> the curl was not very good.</li>
            <li> The product itself was overpriced for the poor quality, shipping price was ridiculous (close to $9-bought from DealYard) who also has an extremely non-flexible return policy so I will probably end up cutting my losses and keep the product rather than pay to ship it back because I was disatisfied.</li>
            <li> : HARDLY RETAINS A WAVE LET ALONE</li>
            <li> My curls lasted for a at least 4-5 days with no problems.</li>
            <li> Negative  Takes a while to heat up,about 15 minutes.      </li>
            <li> After taking all the rollers out, my curls looked messy and were not great looking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small risk!</li>
            <li> but personally, i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought them hoping to get the same thing, however I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even stylists have asked me what my secret is.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, it&#x27;s very hard for my hair to curl, aside from using the TEDIOUS curling iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Like, the end result was just weirdly bumpy.      </li>
            <li> So overall the product was horrible and no one should purchase it.</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist I found this product difficult to use and did not curl the hair uniformly no matter</li>
            <li> ; She was a total idiot!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was very skeptical about purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked as my hair</li>
            <li> and the \\&quot;window\\&quot; for return is gone by 2 days, so I am stuck (was sick for 3 weeks:()</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I was highly doubtful</li>
            <li> another worthless gizmo.</li>
            <li> and I hate that Im going to go thru the hassle to return them.</li>
            <li> I just received and used these rollers for the 1st time and my 1st impression is that these are awful.</li>
            <li> Awful, awful, awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately the rollers didn&#x27;t work well for my hair as an African American.  This is definately not a product for people with long hair either.  It may be good for shorter hair though.  I will most likely use for my daughter as her hair grows or give it to someone as a gift that has shorter hair.  Not too much of a financial loss since it was only $20 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> This was my lucky beauty week -- TWO products in a row so good that I got off my duff to write reviews about them! I have very fine, unwilling to curl hair.  I also have a lot of hair.  So I was highly doubtful these reasonably priced rods (that don&#x27;t get very hot) were going to do much for me.      WOW. First, all of my hair fit onto the 16 rods. And it didn&#x27;t take very long for my hair to take the curl (I had them in maybe 20 minutes, maybe even less).  I really loved the way it looked.  If your hair will hold curl, I bet you would like these.  My curls came out after about an hour but with typical hot rollers they sometimes don&#x27;t even last until I get all of my rollers out!  Plus, these rods are so soft and bendy I bet I could sleep in them over night to lock in the curls even more.    Give these a shot -- even if you don&#x27;t love them for $15 it&#x27;s a small risk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I saw a video of someone demonstrating these rollers on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy them.  I love these rollers to death!!!  I&#x27;m shocked as my hair NEVER looked more glamorous.  And they are so simple and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair.  They work extremely well on weaved hair, it takes the curl so nicely.  My secret is to heat the rollers, put them on at night, leave them on all night, finger comb in the morning, and the curls will then last ALL DAY! Even in high humidity, or rainy weather!  The curlers are so soft and easy to sleep on.  Of course for looser curls, you would use more hair per roller, or leave in for less time. I am in love with these rollers.  I wish they came in a bigger curl size for more variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Being that I am an african american I was ify about purchasing this item because of my type of hair (thick, long, and chemically treated[Relaxed]). In the end I decided to give this product a try and i&#x27;m so glad I did! I absolutely love my rollers. They can create numerous looks that I absolutely love without the fear of breakage. I also love how it takes 10-15 short minutes to create each look and each look can be created while on the go. My hair is always shiney and full of body after using this product which is a complete necessity for me. Unfortunately, due to my type of hair, the curls don&#x27;t hold very long but that&#x27;s an easy fix. I personally use Tcb&#x27;s foaming Wrap-N-Set Lotion because it holds my curls while keeping my hair soft and giving it an extra shine. The only two downfalls to this product is the 10-15 minute wait necessary for heating up the rollers and the amount of rollers they give. I personally need more rollers but I can work with what I have. BUT other than that no complaints (:</li>
            <li> I just received and used these rollers for the 1st time and my 1st impression is that these are awful. I will give them another go and write up an update but at this point these did not work for me at all. I plan on returning them. I waited the 15 minutes before putting them in, I waited 20 minutes actually. After putting them in I waited the 15 minutes before taking them out. 1st problem was that the rollers would not stay tight in my hair. My hair is not super soft or anything, my strands of hair are thick. My hair was slipping out of the roller and I put them in tight. So when the 15 minutes was up there was no curl...at all! All that time wasted and no curl. They did not seem to get that hot. Also, they are a bit of a pain to put in and there were not enough rollers for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine, as most may say, \\&quot;asian\\&quot; hair (please don&#x27;t get offended).  Because of this, it&#x27;s very hard for my hair to curl, aside from using the TEDIOUS curling iron.  After You Tube tutorials and reviews of different products, I finally settled on this one.  Unfortunately, the product does not work well with my hair, even though tutorials on You Tube for this product share the same texture of my hair.  I believe it will work for others but personally, i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is Instant Curls! Instant Curls! Instant Curls! You just plug this up and wait a few minutes, part your hair and roll it up! Get dress, take them out and you have curls that will last you the whole day depending on the weather. You have to make sure your hair is freshly washed though so the curls will hold longer. But that is the rule with any rollers. They are even comfortable to sleep in. You will not regret buying this item. Oh yeah it never gets hot enough to burn you but I suggest you keep this out of reach of children.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would tame my thick frizzy hair...let me say, 1st of all, they don&#x27;t stay in.  I tried these with straight hair, i&#x27;ve tried it with curly hair...THEY DO NOT WORK.  I would recommend you just buy hot rollers, these were a waste of money....</li>
            <li> It has been very hard to track a place that still sells these cloth hot curlers, I had been all over the web trying to find a place that still sells them. All the sites I have been on tell me that they are no longer being sold.I even tried the UK with no luck. Then one morning I was on the web and tried Amazon.com well to my surprise I ordered them, and then I ordered another one. I love the rollers they are the best for my hair the curl stays in, I have long hair but thin, so they make my hair look fuller. Thank you so much for having them in stock, and please keep selling them, they are awsome.    gracie</li>
            <li> these curlers are awesome - heat up nicely &amp; make curls that hold. it works on short and long hair &amp; does not damage the hair</li>
            <li> WOW,what a waste of money.    Like other reviewers have said, the curlers don&#x27;t heat up much--not even after plugging them in for a good half hour.    They lose their heat fast.    They are a pain/difficult to use--at least with long, straight/slick hair.  My hair kept falling out of them.      All this would be okay but they don&#x27;t work at all.  Like, the end result was just weirdly bumpy.      Awful, awful, awful.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was very skeptical about purchasing this product. But, after using it one time -I&#x27;m sold! It was so easy to use. I rolled all my hair within a couple of minutes. Left them in about 5 minutes and I had beautiful bouncy curls that stayed in all day. My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and not very thick. The problems with other reviewers could have been that their hair was too thick but it worked great on my hair.</li>
            <li> These are probably the easiest and best rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned!  I have naturally straight, fine hair, but these rollers give me nice waves that last all day.</li>
            <li> I received my item in a timely manner.   Product looks just like the picture product.  The shipping process was great everything   was in execellent order.  The package was   not damage or dented. Great! I love that.    I am very pleased with my order.      SFox</li>
            <li> This product works great!! I love the juicy curls I receive after using this product. It works well, and heats up fast :)</li>
            <li> These are really easy to use. I have a disability that prevents me from being able to hold my arms up for a very long time. These are quick and easy to manipulate. small but natural curls</li>
            <li> The only thing these rollers do for me is give me more body. Its not what I expected and NO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCTS TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of an easy way to curl my hair. I really wanted to buy another variety by conair, but it seems they don&#x27;t make them anymore. Anyway, these would have been great had they stayed in  my hair. Perhaps my hair was too clean? They just slipped right out. And even when I kept replacing them in my hair and kept them in until they were cool (as per the directions) the curl was not very good. I know you are thinking maybe your hair just doesn&#x27;t curl. Well my hair is naturally wavy and curls extremely easily and once curled it stays. I can curl my hair with a curling iron and wear it all day and sleep on my hair and the next day the curls are still there.  I really wish these worked. Luckily i could return them, but i still am short of all the shipping i paid for them.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this product. The rollers take forever to heat up and still dont get very hot at all even leaving the curlers in my hair for 30 minutes doesnt give me the \\&quot;beach wave\\&quot; result that the product itself is named after. I would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for beach waves. The revlon 3 barrel waver is much better to achieve that result quickly. Even wearing my regular $2 foam rollers overnight gave a better result than this product.  I dont have thin or thick hair, it&#x27;s regular and curls very easily so for this product not to give the result it claims really says a lot. The product itself was overpriced for the poor quality, shipping price was ridiculous (close to $9-bought from DealYard) who also has an extremely non-flexible return policy so I will probably end up cutting my losses and keep the product rather than pay to ship it back because I was disatisfied. So overall the product was horrible and no one should purchase it.</li>
            <li> my hair is fine and just about shoulder length. These would not stay in the hair no matter what I did.....and the \\&quot;window\\&quot; for return is gone by 2 days, so I am stuck (was sick for 3 weeks:().........bummed....another worthless gizmo.</li>
            <li> I was more than satisfied with this product.  It provided me the flexibility to roll my hair quickly with hot rollers, complete the rest of my morning routine then remove and go.  The style and hold were wonderful.  I have recommended this product to my friends along with the Amazon website information where I was able to find them after having looked on many sites.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair which is very fine. When I tried to use this product the curls came out within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Rollers are nice and easy to use - but gets only warm. Bit of a pain to straightenn out and put back into case. Overall works</li>
            <li> work really well. Easy to travel with. Warm up fast and produces a better ringlet curl vs your traditional spiral.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with skepticism....  I watched a video on youtube where beautiful locks were achieved with this product. I bought them hoping to get the same thing, however I was disappointed. The rollers were very heavy and didn&#x27;t clasp closed well so they did not stay in my hair when rolled. After taking all the rollers out, my curls looked messy and were not great looking. I have great hair for curling and straightening, it&#x27;s pretty thick and very long, and I thought these rollers would answer my quest for curls...  What I do love about this product, is that the storage case is wonderful and keeps everything organized. Also, the rollers get hot enough to curl but stay cool enough as to not burn my fingers-big plus.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, or need more practice, but until I can figure out how to do it well, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, It is up to my shoulders, and I need more rollers. I had curled most of my hair and I Still needed about 4-5 more rollers. I would only recomened if you have thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about buying remington hot rollers then I saw these on youtube and I was like yeah I will try it , I love these rollers they do take time to heat up but they work great , I have long hair so these work very nice on my hair , I love that they are not too hot that they won&#x27;t damage the hair . Even if you dont heat them they still curl your hair .</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work for my hair...i saw a video online about them and they looked awesome! so I ordered them, but they just didn&#x27;t work on my long fine hair.  They might work nicely on someone with shoulder length or shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after watching a video that made them look so quick and easy to use. While they ARE very easy, they are certainly not very quick, and 16 rollers were not enough to do my whole head. (I don&#x27;t have that thick of hair - pretty average.) The heating element is not very big, which means you really have to use fairly small pieces of hair to get it to work, which only adds to the amount of time/effort you have to put in to get them to turn out. Then when I took them out my hair just looked kinky more than it did curled, so I had to change the plans of wearing it mostly down for the event I was headed to. Up it went (with a sigh) and I wished I had just curled my hair after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I really love the compact case and results these rollers give.  The drawback, however, is that the metal rods inside the rollers tend to bend out of shape VERY soon and become useless.  If this was a sturdier product, it would be amazing.</li>
            <li> Tried a few times, it is sitting at the bottom of the drawer with the rest of Did not work for me items!</li>
            <li> Curls hair but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you curls that last the whole day... Mine still work after a year of having them and ive only used them twice so far..</li>
            <li> These rollers are very convenient. Quick to heat. Easy to roll the hair. Your curls can come out corkscrew or big waves depending upon the method that you roll up the hair. Wonderfully easy to use. Convenient case for travel. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to do my hair.  Even stylists have asked me what my secret is.  I actually need to order another as the one I received as a gift two years ago is starting to wear out after almost everyday use.</li>
            <li> I just received these in the mail, and i tried them out on my sister and what can I freaking say....&lt;br /&gt;what a dissappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st off, it comes in the travel case just as you see. you open it, unravel the cord and plug it in. There is no light or indicator to tell you that the thing is actually on. The things take forever, FOREVER TO HEAT UP, and I questioned at one point if the thing was even on so I touched the silver plate and yup its hot and burned myself. Remington, give us an indicator--youre better than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2ndly, although the plates get hot, the rollers do not. I waited over half hour before I rolled them in. Left them in for 15 mins, and had HARDLY A WAVE, let alone a curl. Heats up in no time, my butt!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd, like I said no curl. And the rollers themselves hardly stay closed and fall loosely out of your hair. the bendable edges do no justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly, there isnt enought to cover my head!!! If these are going to work you have to take small sections of the hair since they hardly heat and only the middle heats. and you cant do that if you intend on covering your whole head with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just to recap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: NO LIGHT INDICATOR&lt;br /&gt;2: TAKES FOREVER TO HEAT UP IF AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;3: HARDLY RETAINS A WAVE LET ALONE A CURL&lt;br /&gt;4: ROLLERS DO NOT STAY IN PLACE&lt;br /&gt;5: NOT ENOUGH TO COVER YOUR ENTIRE HEAD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if my item is defected but these were a waste of money and I hate that Im going to go thru the hassle to return them. UGHHHH</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to the middle of my back and I have a lot of it!  I knew looking at the 16 rollers (one inch of hair per roller) would not be enough for my hair.  I brought two sets which worked out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about the set is that it literally takes 30 minutes to heat up.  15 minutes does not get the rollers hot enough to curl your hair.  These curlers only work is you take small one inch to two inches of hair at a time.  Otherwise, its pointless.  Normally, with other roller sets and irons, it takes about 15 minutes to curl my hair.  This take a full 30 minutes to curl my hair.  Also, the rag rollers themselves are not that great.  The wire that allows the roller to bend, is very flimsy.  I have a feeling that this set is not going to last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do love the results.  The curls are beautiful and it is worth using on days when I have time.  Otherwise, if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I would not use this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in \\&quot;different\\&quot; rollers that do not use heat, I would recommend Curlformers (search for it on google or youtube, also available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store).  They don&#x27;t use heat, and I sleep in them.  I love the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these about a dozen times and I&#x27;m happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers do not get super hot like old fashioned rollers, which makes my fingers and ears very happy.  I let them heat up for about 20 minutes (the directions suggest 10, but I found that warmer rollers worked better for my hair).  Leaving the rollers in for a couple of minutes (2-5) created nice, soft waves.  Leaving the rollers for much longer created big, bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you let the rollers get very, very warm and experiment with them you&#x27;ll find what works best for you.</li>
            <li> Not too happy as rollers do not stay on hair well.  Do like softness  of the product, however very time consuming to use (at least for me)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these rollers after seeing a video on youtube, the young lady was really happy and excited about them, after seeing the finished product her hair looked amazing! So I purchased them and anxiously did my hair and I absolutely loved my results. The rollers gave me really well defined curls. Their my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, and same result as the flexi rods except you don&#x27;t have to put thm in overnight. You can wake up, &amp; in about 20 mins, 5 to heat up, 10 mins, to keep in your hair nd 2 to take out, you are ready to go, and the curls last a long time. They work both on hair extensions, and your regular hair, great investment.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  While it is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to warm up enough to create a \\&quot;great\\&quot; curl, unless you use very little hair in each roller.  Then at that point, you don&#x27;t have enough rollers to cover the bulk of your hair.  So if you&#x27;re dealing with longer than shoulder length hair, I&#x27;d recommend getting two of these packs or just finding another solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with these rollers - I had no idea what to expect but saw that they were on sale so figured I&#x27;d give them a whirl.  They do take a long time to heat up - I usually plug them in right when I get up in the morning and then take a shower/get ready while they heat.  But once they&#x27;re good and hot they create fantastic curls in a fairly short amount of time.  I love that you just fold them into your hair rather than fuss with metal pins like normal hot rollers - I&#x27;d always drop the pins or lose them and this completely eliminates that problem.  I also feel like the soft texture is better for my hair than the hard plastic and metal pins of normal hot rollers.  I haven&#x27;t slept with them in yet because that seems like it would just be WAY too much curl but they are certainly comfortable enough.  I find that leaving them in for around a 1/2 at least gives me a very strong curl.</li>
            <li> It was good. i got what i wanted. the only problem was the time it took to get to my house, other than that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> WHAT A TOTAL FAIL..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching a you tube tutorial demostration video about the greatness of these \\&quot;All That\\&quot; beach rollers, I was super hyped about ordering them. I even read the reviews which proved to be an almost even split of likes and dislikes- but i took my chances anyw&lt;br /&gt;As the reviews from several sources said, these rollers do not get hot, more like luke warm. The bits of heat they do retain  is lost the moment they are removed from its heating bed.&lt;br /&gt;The product instructions say to let them heat for 15 miniutes-I let them cook for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;Putting them in your hair is the easy part, but not worth the anticipation of waiting to see the final result.&lt;br /&gt;In my mind, i thought i was going to get statement making bouncy spiral curls, like the beauty in the video. I was FLAT DEAD wrong (much like my hair after taking them out). These rollers barely curled my hair. What was left of the curl was gone within miniutes of attempting to syle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is a complete hit or miss. Many reviewers have positive comments while others, not so much&lt;br /&gt;Even having seeing the desired result on a home made video proves that this product is not necessisarily misleading, but it is not for all hair types, textures and lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick long hair, this product is not for you. You will have much better results with a good set of hot rollers or a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt convince anyone to go searching for these not so all that rollers, but advise that you buy at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;The only consolation i have in ths purchase is that for $20 I do not have a problem with regifting them to a close pal who may have better luck with them then I did or keeping them around if someone wanted to borrow them to try a new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total bummer..</li>
            <li> Initial practice yielded uneven and kinky curls. Take your time and experiment with the amount of hair on the roller and different products to hold the curl. They are VERY comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and it works wonders .. makes them have a very nice curl! I bought 2 of them I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Won&#x27;t hold a curl. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I tried multiple times to get this product to work. Let it sit and heat up for 20 to 30 min. and more and the results were the same. The curls fall out in about an hour. My hair curls easily but not with these things.</li>
            <li> I love curling my hair and curl it all the time. These rollers did not really curl my hair at all. They do not get hot enough and just really don&#x27;t work well at all. I use a curling wand now and it gives me really good curls. If you are looking for a good curl, I would save your money and put it towards some different rollers or a curling wand.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well, but clip them in your hair right or you&#x27;ll get a blah look. I suggest spraying your hair with a good hairspray before and after you put them in too.</li>
            <li> These rollers work OK, but not great. They don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to do the job. Even after 30 minutes of heating, they don&#x27;t feel really hot to the touch, and the curl doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair. It does create a soft curl, but it doesn&#x27;t stay. I&#x27;ll stick with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I rely heavily on customer reviews via the website I&#x27;m ordering from &amp; Youtube. This product is wonderful. Works exactly as promised. I love the curls that I get when I use this product. very compact &amp; great for travel. Product works very fast. Instructions states to let the rods warm for 15 minutes before using. I typically let them warm for 30 minutes to an hour which gets them really hot &amp; I wear them to bed. My curls lasted for a at least 4-5 days with no problems. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My friend loves them and i have done a review for these I dont want to have to keep doing</li>
            <li> Definitely think they&#x27;re pretty nifty. Great for my daughters thin hair, but not made for my thick hair. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them. They don&#x27;t curl well enough for me, probably because they do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Yes, the roller heat up and yes, they curl, but only if you leave them in for a VERY long time (a couple of hours at least). I have long hair but its not extra thick. I&#x27;d say these are great for someone who has short, fine hair. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest for long OR thick hair. and get two packs!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the product to do something similar to my hair as in the product description. Instead, I got a head full of frizz from the lukewarm curlers</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist I found this product difficult to use and did not curl the hair uniformly no matter which way I used them.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long thick hair and these worked great. They were very easy to use.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love these hot rollers.  Curl lasts all day.  Only drawback is that the metal on the inside tends to bend under the fabric covering so they don&#x27;t last very long.  I usually have a set for 6 months to a year depending on how much I use them.  Since they are not very expensive, I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one when the old ones are broken.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with these rollers can use anytime for anywhere. Does take a bit to get the hang of it but theres nothing easier than this! Totally recommend to purchase for those that don&#x27;t want toast their hair with curling, straightening irons, or perms. Hair becomes much manageable and flowy to the touch. Makes hair look much more natural and keeps healthy.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very curly.</li>
            <li> THEY WORK BUT NEEDED TO BE A TAD HOTTER. THEY PRODUCE A NICE CURL. THESE WOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH THIN HAIR OR WHO IS SENSITIVE,( KIDS, ELDERLY,THINNING HAIR) BECAUSE THEY ARE LIGHT WIEGHT OT INSTALL. EASY TO PACK ALSO</li>
            <li> The Remington Beach Waves curlers are awesome!     Positive  Work great!   Comfortable to sleep in (if you don&#x27;t want to use heat).   Curls last all day long!   Inexpensive! :)  Easy to carry around! I personally love the cute case it comes in!  Hair comes out looking beautiful!    Negative  Takes a while to heat up,about 15 minutes.      Love this product and I am glad I bought it and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.. Easy to roll your hair for a bouncy curl.  Your hair does not get tangled.  Love the look it gives.</li>
            <li> I loved the Clairol Benders hot sticks, but they are &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; on ebay now.  These hot, cloth covered rollers are the best thing around for curling fine hair.  They do not pull your hair out or cause heat damage because they covered with material.  My first set lasted about 4 years before the bending wires tangled up beyond repair, but at this price, I am not complaining!  There are 14 small rollers which work great for short, fine hair.  They don&#x27;t burn your fingers or scalp, so they will work great for children, elderly and everyone else in-between.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to use these rollers for spiral curls to get a different look.  They fall out, don&#x27;t stay in. They work OK for traditional curls.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give these rollers five stars but my problem is my hair is quite fine and straight and sometimes they fall out (especially the ones on the bottom)! I have to reinforce them with another hair clip. They seem to be gentle on my hair though which I do like and not overly hot. I like the convenience of the rollers in the zip case. Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after seeing a Youtube video and also because I was using a curling wand daily to curl my hair. My hair was becoming extremely dry so I tried these...I LOVE THEM! They are all that...I get up in the morning let them warm for 15-20 mins (zip case up to retain the heat) then I wrap my hair around to create beachy waves. I let them stay on for 30 mins for loose waves and all night if I want tight curls. I have retired my curling wand. Ross had this set but I didn&#x27;t buy it when I saw them but $19 is not a bad price to pay for comfortable/versatile heat rollers.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give these a fair shot &amp; thought maybe if I use it in hair that&#x27;s 2 days since washed &amp; use product it wld wrk. Because my fine hair does hold a curl under those circumstances. I tried it TWICE. Both time it got a little wavy (after heating it up for an hr) &amp; keeping curlers in for about 30 mind in the hair, but 10 mins in they completely fell apart!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return for a refund &amp; got an email back from seller saying they changed their policy &amp; no longer give refunds!! Well, perhaps the problem is their faulty item, not the policy.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from DealYard and they were not cooperative in taking this back because I plugged it in to see if it worked and it didn&#x27;t. But when I mentioned this to the dumb bimbo on the phone she said that they don&#x27;t take products back that  have been &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;. I told her they weren&#x27;t in my hair all I did was plug them in and they didn&#x27;t even heat up! She said that they were considered used because I took it out of the package!! My question to you is How do you know something works or not if you DON&#x27;T TAKE IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE AND TRY IT OUT?!?&amp;#34; She was a total idiot! I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from DealYard again!!!! But, Remington WAS helpful and they took it back and gave me a total refund!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has very long thick hair and they worked fantastic. They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t do this right?</li>
            <li> Yeap....you&#x27;ll want to plug these in at least half an hour bef0sore you need them. On the plus side, the case is HIGHLY portable and the rollers are easy to use. They can be used in different ways to create different kinds of curls: 80s big hair, 70s Farrah Fawcett flips, beach waves, and more!</li>
            <li> I got mine at Wal-mart on sale and so far they have served me well.  I wish I had gotten into hot rollers as a younger person...and not having the metal clips makes these pretty easy to handle...and they stow neatly in the case.</li>
