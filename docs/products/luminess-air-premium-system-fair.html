            <li>Just moments ago I spoke with a Wonderful, Amazing Customer Service Representative by the name of Eric.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Un Happy Customer for Luniness</li>
            <li>Not to mention, I got a great deal.</li>
            <li>It was a great customer service experience.</li>
            <li>Dinair however doesn&#x27;t spend money on infomercials like Luminess and they have great customer testimonials and reviews.</li>
            <li>Called into customer service to recieve more info about the product and spoke to Marilyn!!</li>
            <li>And I love my system!!</li>
            <li>Anjanette was very kind and helpful when I called in for information.  </li>
            <li>This Luminess Air Premium product is very nice.  </li>
            <li>I called Customer Service and the woman was very nice &amp; helpful.</li>
            <li>I phoned referencing an issue I perceived I would have to battle for and to the contrary;  I spoke with a very kind &amp; understanding representative by the name of Anita.  </li>
            <li>I spoke with Coreena, she was very good, kind, helpful and thoughtfull.</li>
            <li>What kind of customer service is that!  </li>
            <li>Eric put me at ease and he was so kind and generous!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product I love the finish ...</li>
            <li>Good product, great company.</li>
            <li>Glad to see there is still good customer service out there!!</li>
            <li>Good product, great company.</li>
            <li>Well to my shock it was a VERY pleasant and easy phone call!</li>
            <li>She was so helpful and pleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li>That was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with Luminess Air, I received the most excellent customer service, they were very kind</li>
            <li>Nikki displayed very good customer service skills and she listen and did an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>I would like to comend Porsha on her great customer service and I also love the makeup it is great</li>
            <li>but it looked like it might be good to use.</li>
            <li>I get comments from people all the time about how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I loved the customer service that I got from Porsha at Luminess Air.  </li>
            <li>Will never purchase anything from them ever again, not even a good paperweight.</li>
            <li>You are either good at customer service or you&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, it is important I always look my best.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>The coverage is really good whether using minimum or medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>As I said, the product is good.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Luminess Air makeup system and I actually loved the make-up .It</li>
            <li>So I was going to cancel the membership even though I loved the makeup everywhere else on my face</li>
            <li>My makeup is smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>Once it was working, I loved the makeup application, and even got the blush on just the way I like it.</li>
            <li>but if you want to make a statement this site is a good sounding board.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and my skin looked gorgeous</li>
            <li>Loved this system brought it.</li>
            <li>Keisha went fair beyond help.....</li>
            <li>Good evening,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Im fairly convinced that women  like Sharon and Anita will keep this company booming, but the makeup, speaks volumes for itself.  </li>
            <li>I know this is a good  product because I bought one for my self.  </li>
            <li>so is that good??).</li>
            <li>When I tried it out, it took 4 coats (each taking 15-20 drops) to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>that I loved:  </li>
            <li>this superior level of customer service</li>
            <li>what a wonderful surprise to call a company and be welcomed on the phone by someone who seemed excited to anticipate what she could help me with.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with what she was willing to do to make me a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>i am super impressed.</li>
            <li>and she was exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Using the quick step booklet, I shook up the color I thought would match my skin tone the best, and put about 5-6 drops into the well.</li>
            <li>I was able to find what I wanted and order it and got more information on how to get the best results with my product.  </li>
            <li>Please inform Anita I appreciate her exceptional service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a very satisfied customer.</li>

            <li>LOVE this makeup !</li>
            <li>I really love my Luminess Air!</li>
            <li>I love my Luminess Air Premium System and your nail products!</li>
            <li>Luminess Air, you have a precious gem for an employee named Cathy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with her service that I asked to speak with her supervisor, Sharon, who also was extremely pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, covers great and makes my skin look flawless!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>she was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>Then this fabulous, happy, NOT pushy lady and I were chatting away and even having a bit of a laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordered the Luminess Air Airbrush pro system &amp; the customer service operator was amazing.  </li>
            <li>I‚Äôll keep using your amazing products and ask all my friends to do so as well.</li>
            <li>She was kind and understanding.  </li>
            <li>I feel it sets the skin nicely before the makeup goes on.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t care to.</li>
            <li>Ordered my Luminess system about 3 weeks ago and I am just loving it.</li>
            <li>She was kind and patient ...</li>
            <li>Many times I was put on hold for a good 20 minutes or was hung up on all together.</li>
            <li>She was so nice and helpful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She is sooo nice and eager to help!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can guarantee that most of us do not spend this amount each month and if we do I can guarantee it is makeup that is good for our skin.  </li>
            <li>What is nice about that is you can dab concealer where you need it and the airbrush smooths and evens out everything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s boldly obvious that this feed had been seeded with Great Product and Awesome Customer Service!&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had a nice conversation.  </li>
            <li>I loved the customer service and I&#x27;m glad that she helped me.</li>
            <li>Ladies, you can buy a nice quality air brush compressor and artist tips for around $80 elsewhere on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and she was so nice.</li>
            <li>She shared with me her own experiences with Luminess and how to coordinate the colors.  </li>
            <li>Lakasha was very nice and friendly.  </li>
            <li>and they were very nice and friendly.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I just want to say that in this busy world of Rush, Rush, Rush, it‚Äôs really nice to know there‚Äôs a company out there that still makes the effort to provide both a Great Product and Great Customer Service,</li>
            <li>THE TV AD FOR $19.95 WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!</li>
            <li>Porsha gave my the right tone or shade of make-up to make my skin look beautiful</li>
            <li>Toni was very knowledgeable about their products and sincere about helping me be the best I can be.  </li>
            <li>it was very easy to use it</li>
            <li>She made my purchase very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle</li>
            <li>I really liked the luminess air makeup because it is very light on my skin</li>
            <li>I just started using Luminess Air the best product that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad to say that I will be able to do it because of my flawless looking skin thanks to my luminess air airbrush system.</li>
            <li>, professional made me feel wonderful</li>
            <li>I would recommend this system to anyone I know that loves natural looking flawless skin.</li>
            <li>How very delightful and unexpected it was to find myself on the receiving end of this lady.  </li>
            <li>but since it doesn&#x27;t fit, it won&#x27;t be much good to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course a good product costs money and nothing is free, you get what you pay for, but</li>
            <li>And because Eric knows the product line so well, he was able to easily identify the exact color combination/number that I need to achieve a  flawless look each and every time I use the Luminess Air Premium System.</li>
            <li>Ok, I could live with that because I just knew it was going to be wonderful.</li>
            <li>In very fine print at the bottom of the advertisement  states &#x27;</li>
            <li>They were very quick and understanding!</li>
            <li>Easy as that!</li>
            <li>Eric sends me to MISS SHARON (hi doll) and she was super kind as well!</li>
            <li>The person I even talked to (whose name is Manny) was VERY pleasant and professional!</li>
            <li>I model professionally and my skin tones always change during the seasons, I love the how you can mix shades to make the perfect blend.</li>
            <li>And yes I am loving the cheaper part, but the customer service was so great, she took so much time to help me.</li>
            <li>IF IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...</li>
            <li>Pull VERY lightly and keep your hand about 8 inches from your face.</li>
            <li>Luminess Air is very fortunate to have Zulain in their corner</li>
            <li>It is very light and even coverage, once you get used to using the airbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>her Manager Sharon and she was excited for Anita and very pleased.  </li>
            <li>anyway I could not believe what a great help she was and such a pleasant personality.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin and since the makeup is water based, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores or break me out.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She uses the same tone of voice, is patient, kind, and very good.  </li>
            <li>Also, the gentleman, Jose had OUTSTANDING customer service and took care of everything i needed.</li>
            <li>I really love their makeup.</li>
            <li>Thank you Porsha, I love my Luminess system package.</li>
            <li>For starters I have to say that I LOVE the Luminess Air system and products.</li>
            <li>and she truly made my day by making the experience so enjoyable.</li>
            <li>So, Thank you Keisha for making what i was expecting to be just another call on my list of to do&#x27;s to a call that made me appreciate the company for hiring you and that you as an employee are using your people skills to make someone (me) feel better after i hang up.  </li>
            <li>I spoke with Hope last week and she was awesome.  </li>
            <li>It does not cake into the creases of my middle-aged skin and creates a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation is the Luminess Air Ultra.</li>
            <li>so I can get the most out of the system.</li>

            <li>I appreciated the great customer service however at no time was</li>
            <li>I advised that an additional $34.06 will be billed to my account on top of the $69.99  </li>
            <li>on top of that I was told I have to pay to return and ship it</li>
            <li>To top it all off that 3 drops of make for one face ain&#x27;t 3 drops....</li>
            <li>Before you know it, you are in debt for a lot more money</li>
            <li>Cynthia went above and beyond for me; she was delightful and could not have been more helpful.  </li>
            <li>me to try because of the better skin match.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are airbrush systems out there that are better.</li>
            <li>I guess this is how most companies would make their money, but it bothered me that it wasn&#x27;t disclosed to me</li>
            <li>Once things were straightened out I was able to plan ; it made things a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this makeup</li>
            <li>So at this point I was fed up with this system that was supposed to be a really awesome Christmas present, so I ordered the Dinair airbrush system.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Their system gives me such a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that their foundation is my favorite foundation ever.</li>
            <li>Once I saw my wife use the machine she fell in love with it, she is a make up artist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to say it was one of my better decisions.  </li>
            <li>My girl &amp;#34;Toni&amp;#34; and her instructors, made my experience wonderful and helped me look like a younger, and better version of myself .  </li>
            <li>MY MOTHER WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH HER GIFT , AND I AM SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>I called Zulain at Luminess Air today to check to make sure my account was in order.</li>
            <li>Not only is she an awesome customer service rep, she deserves a raise, too.</li>
            <li>I could tell she was smiling and enjoying her job.</li>
            <li>You truly have a phenomenal personality.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love the finish.  </li>
            <li>AND NOW I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT I  CAN  DEPEND ON THESE HELPFUL WOMEN</li>
            <li>Paperwork stated that I owed 5 more payments.</li>
            <li>I do not get home most days until 6pm.</li>
            <li>This is fraud and will be reported to the Better Business Bureau and has been reported to my credit card company.</li>
            <li>I stopped payment and I am sure I will receive more threats.</li>
            <li>My experience with her was fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks, customer service was helpful.</li>
            <li>My experience today on the phone with Leszliee was refreshing.</li>
            <li>because I thought for sure this was going to be like jumping through hurdles</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Jeana Roth</li>
            <li>Anita in customer service was outstanding in clarifying questions about my makeup system and the terms.  </li>
            <li>Then she text me and said for me to phone to make sure mine was cancelled because it had said her issue was resolved and mine was part of her issue.</li>
            <li>I am sure if you are ordering more you get what you want but if you have a problem forget it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Luminess Air premium system and I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutley love what it does.  </li>
            <li>Ok, before I order these &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; things, I try and do some homework and read reviews.</li>
            <li>I had many questions.</li>
            <li>She did not pressure me to buy more products than I would need, &amp; on occasion would remind me the product was already in my starter kit.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely, Janine*</li>
            <li>I really love the product, but please don&#x27;t scam me out of my money.</li>
            <li>When purchasing, make sure you opt out of all the gimmicks they have</li>
            <li>She did say she would authorize the return of the latest makeup to be returned to me.  </li>
            <li>the most doesn&#x27;t want to work with the system itself.  </li>
            <li>I called to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed and wanted my money back.</li>
            <li>You use 3 to 4 (or more)</li>
            <li>Many friends are ordering #3 and they are sent #4.</li>
            <li>A problem originated with our US Postal Service (need I say more?)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re a blessing, I LOVE the system and</li>
            <li>how it works, it is the only makeup I can find to match my complexion perfectly!</li>
            <li>I love the make up</li>
            <li>The sale rep was very helpful and we came to a great agreement.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the Luminess Air way!!  :)</li>
            <li>Please tell her that I received the makeup and that I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>It is a 30 day free trial and there is nothing to lose!</li>
            <li>I love this product now.</li>
            <li>Since she is a user, she understood my needs -- better than I did -- and she shared some finer points and &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; ideas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Three more things Tonya did</li>
            <li>, I feel much more confident as I transition to airbrushed makeup.  </li>
            <li>Tonya deserves a lot of credit for enhancing my experience -- on so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With practice, I&#x27;m getting faster and more</li>
            <li>drops\\&quot; they say is sufficient I found that it requires more like 20 drops to do ANY covering whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a super easy, fast and flawless way to apply your make-up or even do your spray tans at home</li>
            <li>The most effective way I&#x27;ve found to clean the system is by running tap water into the bowl to flush out any leftover makeup residue and then adding the alcohol/water mixture and spraying it out into the sink.</li>
            <li>Katelyn&#x27;s customer service was excellent, she went above and beyond, had patience, provided insight to the system and different types of foundation, and was very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Please be AWARE this company is a scam!!!</li>
            <li>I was on the fence for a long time about air brush makeup and decide to take a leap and hope for the best.  </li>
            <li>Best customer service I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>&amp; she was patient, clever and very kind &amp; understanding.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love your makeup, the way it makes my skin look so nice and smooth and clean, no blotchy spots any more.  </li>
            <li>She is knowledgeable about the products, which is another rare thing!!  </li>
            <li>then I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Today I received my bi-monthly shipment with 2 different shades in it and some awesome free gifts to go with it.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE how light the makeup looks and feels.</li>
            <li>but she also included free samples of the Silk and Satin for me to try because of the better skin match.  </li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and have great skin because I have taken care of it.  </li>
            <li>He was so great and professional</li>
            <li>I really hope their product is as good as Luminess.</li>
            <li>and they were able to help choose my proper skin tone and mailed it right out, great service!!</li>
            <li>but when I did discover the right one I was absolutely loving it and still am.</li>
            <li>It gives me a flawless look, one that I&#x27;ve never got with any other foundation.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to correct the splatter by stippling the area with a makeup foundation brush.      </li>
            <li>It was so easy to use that I had no problems at all and the color I chose (</li>
            <li>I got my system in the mail today , easy to set up</li>
            <li>It took a lot of experimenting with the airbrush system and was not as easy as they want you to think.</li>
            <li>No worries about signing up with this membership, it&#x27;s as easy to get  out as it easy to sign up.</li>
            <li>The customer service rep easily cancelled my order with no hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li>She had some questions called luminess air customer service and they resolved the issue very quickly.</li>
            <li>It wasnt as easy as they make it look.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t wash off although with my facewash it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>She was professional but also warm, kind, &amp; personable.  </li>
            <li>another try cause it was worth it to me to to keep trying on shades till I found the right one!!!</li>
            <li>Porche, my customer care representative was very nice, fast with her fingers and took care of that for me with a smile in her voice.</li>
            <li>These ladies are the most professional and courteous persons I have ever dealt with when contacting a company with a concern.&lt;br /&gt;There should be more people like them on the customer service lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be honest, I&#x27;m the girl who watched Every Youtube video pertaining to Luminess Air (their videos, people&#x27;s reviews, video blogs, etc) before trying it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I was helped by Tonya W. who I must say is hands down the best customer service representative I have ever spoken to</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve got it down, this was the best makeup investment I&#x27;ve every made.</li>
            <li>The ad was so suductive that I didn&#x27;t look at the fine print.</li>
            <li>did not see the fine print when I purchased the product.</li>
            <li>FINE PRINT COST ME</li>
            <li>/&gt;The make-up worked fine for me but</li>
            <li>I asked Eric if i could speak to a supervisor because in the world today, people are so quick to critisize and never to compliment someones actions!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am ready contact Better Business Bureau!  </li>
            <li>AND I have been able to save money on my cosmetic purchases because I don&#x27;t use nearly as much!!</li>
            <li>Thank you Tiff-ny and Luminess Air for making this easy and fun!</li>
            <li>I feel so special now that I have the same equipment that makeup artists use to apply my makeup just as beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have a huge upcoming event about to take place in my life</li>
            <li>This is the email I sent to them trying to cancel my &amp;#34;club membership,&amp;#34; but I feel like it is an accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were helpful, polite and attentive.</li>
            <li>you must be a wonderful company  to work for to have such excellent employees who stand behind their product and guarantee it.</li>
            <li>Then go over it lightly with the darker shade until you reach the correct color.</li>
            <li>The product is NOT even great; yes, it does the basic job, but so do tons of foundations out there.</li>
            <li>See how important you feel receiving &amp;#34;off</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED A LIGHT COVERING AND HEAVIER.</li>
            <li>I felt the coverage was fantastic</li>
            <li>If the machine continues to allow me to apply makeup like I am now, fantastic.</li>
            <li>Not knowing this, I had only experienced the Ultra make-up line which came with the machine.  </li>
            <li>, may give the rest of my fact a light going over.</li>
            <li>a really cheap.</li>
            <li>~$370 if not return in 30days.&lt;br /&gt;And charged her CC twice during the free 30 day trail.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could ever enjoy putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>This two weeks ago have been looking absolutely fabulous</li>
            <li>I just received my free trail today....</li>
            <li>Zulain immediately offered a detailed explanation and made corrections while on the call and emailed me the corrected invoice</li>
            <li>I do not understand why you are paying a deposit on the system when you bought the system so cheap and the insurance on it is almost triple??????  </li>
            <li>but she helped me pick out my two free colors.</li>
            <li>When I think of all the fingernail polish with diamond crystals or nylon, my nails still cracked,broke &amp; I&#x27;m happy to say that after all my years of Sally Hansen &amp; similar products, this balances all those out .</li>
            <li>I even lost screw from stylus whilst cleaning and they replaced the stylus free of charge.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this system for my sisters birthday and was kinda hesitant towards purchasing call in to get help to figure my sisters shade and the call center was absolutely PHENOMENAL like really they help me pick this perfect system for my sister and also was a helping hand towards service</li>
            <li>She was patient and kind and was very helpful.</li>
            <li>The shades fit my complexion so well.</li>
            <li>The girl that helped me was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>When I called to place my order I was told it would be a free 30 day trial</li>
            <li>When I called to find out why since it was supposed to be free for thirty days</li>
            <li>She then directed me to their web site with detailed instructions on line.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the trail everything was good, they even gave me a $25 gift certificate which I can ONLY used to buy more make up nothing else....</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>and I love the staffs positive attitude!</li>
            <li>Very underhanded deceitful company Stay Away!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much!!!</li>
            <li>A very rare thing these days.</li>
            <li>This is one of those companies where you better read the fine print or they will be charging you  your first born child.  </li>
            <li>Along with the cleanup super easy.</li>
            <li>Besides the look it gives you it is so easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>I found the color that matches my complexion and it goes on quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Overall she was pleasant, kind and very informative.  </li>
            <li>She made it so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I just called in to Customer Service with a billing question and Tonya and Ms. Sharon were SUPER nice, professional, and informative.  </li>
            <li>I had a small problem and a Wonderful agent named Ophelia, helped me solved that problem.</li>
            <li>But after wearing the makeup for about one month I noticed a significant increase in breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>first of all I love the airbrush system.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the T and made sure I applied it exactly how they said to do it</li>
            <li>At first was totally in love with this product &amp; system, but boy have I changed my mind.  </li>
            <li>At first It was a bit overwhelming and I had questions about my bill.</li>
            <li>when i received the kit, i was so excited i immediately read the instructions and learned how to use it before i started.  </li>
            <li>The hardest part was learning how to clean the system thoroughly.</li>
            <li>If I just use the foundation, I clean the needle after every three uses, but flush the system well after each use.    </li>
            <li>Mix everything up in the clean palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>Finally, the coverage is nowhere near the flawless look they claim.  </li>
            <li>I have started to clean it with dawn dish soap</li>
            <li>It gives me a better, more natural appearance.  </li>
            <li>She had such a pleasant voice and and even nicer attitude, Luminess Air has a valuable employee in Cathy</li>
            <li>95% of the reviews were positive and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li>I love the air brush system and now that I&#x27;ve talked to Tigeria and have a better understanding, I&#x27;m sure I will be a customer for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>I always read reviews before I buy &#x27;special&#x27; deals like this one.</li>
            <li>but they helped me find the right shade!</li>
            <li>but it is SUPER Easy and definitely worth it!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>far as the product, It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Customer Service has been amazing so far and answered all my questions.</li>
            <li>Now I am a true Luminess Air #1 FAN.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how the good the product is as I sent it back as soon as the kept charging me.</li>
            <li>If this is true it should not be shown in picture.</li>
            <li>They get into your credit card and they keep charging my card monthly and even though paid in full and program was cancelled.  </li>
            <li>But, I eventually figured out how to use the airbrush to make my skin actually look good.</li>
            <li>She was very informative, patient, and even provided her extension just in case we had any more questions.</li>
            <li>it full price from a store(if they accept returns) rather than buying it from Luminess website.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It looks so nice and professional.  </li>
            <li>A FULL REFUND</li>
            <li>this sweet, sweet lady took the time to answer all of my questions and made me feel like my business counted to Luminess Air.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my husband is handy and he fixed it within seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need a product that is Simple Simon and allows me to apply my make up quickly, while still achieving good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Mairlynn explain everything great and encouraged me to try other products.  </li>
            <li>If you go to their website, the fine print at the bottom of the first page says:  &amp;#34;All</li>
            <li>She even heard my child in the background and asked me if that was my baby which made me feel that she was helping me with my question but took a quick moment to make it personable.  </li>
            <li>I am a continued loyal customer</li>
            <li>The advertisement states in bold print &#x27;lt</li>
            <li>I felt like it was was my lucky day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this for years and achieved excellent results - even with drug store foundations rather than the more upscale and expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li>I hope you are lucky as I was when Toni answered the cal.  </li>
            <li>she explained all I needed to know and such a very Great personal....</li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer.</li>

            <li>I just recently purchased my Luminous Air system, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my makeup.</li>
            <li>She was nice and was able to help me get my payments lower and not have make up sent to me every other month.</li>
            <li>She informed me that they would send me the correct light (that I ordered in the first place)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to say that she made me feel pretty  when I placed my order.</li>
            <li>So thanks to the fact that they took their sweet time (3 weeks!)</li>
            <li>After many months I just opened the new bottles they sent me</li>
            <li>Being able to give my self a new feeling of confidence with Luminess Air.</li>
            <li>When I watched the DVD it really helped me with the step by step and easy instructions.</li>

            <li>She laughed was more than pleasant, explained everything I was confused about &amp; when I was ready to buy something the pamphlet recommended she was HONEST( a very rare commodity when everyone is just worried about the bottom line &amp; she told me I didn&#x27;t really need to buy the other two bottles because the gel &amp; the shiny overcoat are already built into every color.</li>
            <li>While the concept is great it still needs a little bit a work.  </li>
            <li>Anita serviced the call calmly which gave me confidence</li>
            <li>I rarely buy things from tv</li>
            <li>It is almost fun to use if i can say that.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about Tonya and the experience I had.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the system properly is the most important step in maintaining optimal function.</li>
            <li>This makeup stays fresh all day and all night.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it for me.</li>
            <li>My mom and i liked what we saw on the commercial</li>
            <li>it is worth the price</li>
            <li>Also, not that im in any kind of hurry to have this machine in my home, it will take them regular shipping times to deliver it.</li>
            <li>Also, not that im in any kind of hurry to have this machine in my home, it will take them regular shipping times to deliver it.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In NO WAY is it worth that amount</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also impressed with the Luminess air system and although it is new to me, I am anxious to use it on a continuous basis.</li>
            <li>I also cleaned the airbrush machine exactly as it says to do so, step by step, in the quick start booklet.</li>
            <li>Thanks again to Eric and Miss Sharon for making me smile and have faith in customer service again!</li>
            <li>I realized how easy it went on my face and how flawless it looked, almost like natural beauty, after several tries.</li>
            <li>but I called customer service and received a replacement right away</li>
            <li>a $400 product that breaks just right after their \\&quot;trial period\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t get the right color to begin with</li>
            <li>Well, after I received my airbrush system from Luminess, it would not work right at all.</li>
            <li>Luminess helped me pick the right colors for her</li>
            <li>I received the system in the mail, I wanted to try it right</li>
            <li>The first few times that I tried it, the coverage wasn&#x27;t great and the color wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the way they went above and beyond to ensure that  my first experience with LuminessAir was not darkened by events of no fault of their own.</li>
            <li>and I can also say that when I&#x27;ve called in the past everyone has provided me with great service.</li>
            <li>When I started to see charges on my card and then read the fine print, I was astonished that they were going to charge nearly $400 for this system!  </li>
            <li>In very fine print, it states that if you want to return it, it has to be within 30 days of your initial PAYMENT.  </li>
            <li>(obviously it&#x27;s a little different than with brushes) but the foundation is Flawless!  </li>
            <li>Dont waste your money or time on this product, you are better off using the cheap $5 makeup from stores!</li>
            <li>the sweetest young lady (Karina) which I enjoyed talking with that answered all my questions and was very knowledgable about the products.</li>
            <li>Especially because I had no knowledge how to use makeup professionally and thought I was doing a good job for myself.</li>
            <li>Using Luminess Air&#x27;s gentle spray application, putting on makeup is actually exciting and fun again, like when I was a child.</li>
            <li>Basically the girl said she didn&#x27;t believe that that was what I was told the month before so actually calling me a liar in a very backhanded kind of way.  </li>
            <li>I had a problem with my order and called and talked to this very very nice lady named Leticia  (not sure just how to spell her name).  </li>
            <li>If the needle is loose the trigger will not work and the makeup will come shooting out on its own as soon as you put it</li>
            <li>especially how quickly I can get that done!!  </li>
            <li>If you spray several, light coats of make-up, and let it dry in between coats, you get a good, even, matte coverage.</li>
            <li>I just ordered the Luminess air airbrush machine and a ton of their makeup about a month and a half ago, and when I ordered it I decided to purchase the warranty plan (which I strongly recommend just to be on the safe side).</li>
            <li>, at first I was a little upset but the makeup look so good on her that I didn&#x27;t mind purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Throughout the entire conversation, Eric was patient, kind, polite and highly knowledgeable.</li>
            <li>I can truly say that Tonya (and the amazing system) has made me a lifelong Luminess Air customer</li>
            <li>When I first got the Luminess Air</li>
            <li>Then all that was left to do was store it away in its cute storage case until I needed it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure her and the Luminess Air team can do the same for all Ladies.  </li>
            <li>she recommended a different type of foundation that may work better with my skin type.  </li>
            <li>I would love to buy one for all of my female family  members and friends.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s going to take several layers, but the lighter the layers, the better the outcome.</li>
            <li>The Luminess Air product does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ve experienced a splatter is when I&#x27;ve gone too long without cleaning the needle.</li>
            <li>this is yours today for only $19.95 to try for 30 days with FREE Shipping!  </li>
            <li>I do have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about it as I was trying out different shades</li>
            <li>I have one of this product since the first infomercial</li>
            <li>I saw the infomercial and decided to order, and to my surprise, the product was exactly like they said it would be.</li>
            <li>my self esteem is higher than ever.</li>
            <li>First speaking with Brianna and then speaking with Janae&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it for 19.95 for 30 days like the commercial said, but they push u to upgrade for 10$ more, buy a 20$ warranty, add accessories and join clubs that all costs additional money.</li>
            <li>He assured me that i would not have to pay a penny more unless i decided not to send the product back after my 30 day trial period.</li>
            <li>If u decide to purchase this product, just be aware of what they take out of your account and keep track of your money because they will practically drain it without u being aware.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said that it should be OK for me to use this product and that she totally understood my concerns.  </li>
            <li>Very understanding too!  </li>
            <li>In August of last year I saw a very enticing and attractive ad on the net.</li>
            <li>sure enough they had charged me $84 already.  </li>
            <li>this is yours today for only $19.95 to try for 30 days with FREE Shipping!&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I first opened the package, everything was neatly put together.  </li>
            <li>I realized I had to sop up the makeup I had already put in the well, which did not make me very happy because I know how expensive the refills can be.</li>
            <li>It is not necessarily faster than the method I was using before, but I do get better coverage and like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks You Nikki for making my day!</li>
            <li>First the disclaimer:  </li>
            <li>I only use two coats and my skin looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I do love using airbrush foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very costly mistake!  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was hesitant when I first heard of airbrush makeup, because f my wife being picky about stuff</li>
            <li>I have a skin condition called roasia where your skin turns red, I was able to use the matt foundation to cover it up.  </li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>I had an issue with getting my correct tone at first</li>
            <li>Additionally, on a personal level, I woke to a rather challenging day</li>
            <li>before I actually tried it, When I did, it took more than one coat of the makeup to even provide any coverage.</li>
            <li>First I had seen this mentioned.</li>
            <li>when I spoke with Portia, she worked with her supervisor Sharon &amp; went above &amp; beyond rectifying the situation until I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my first time using the product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this system, I bought their nail polish system thru Livingsocial the first week of Feb.  </li>
            <li>If you have blemishes to cover, you will need to use a concealer first and then apply the airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li>First off, this product took 3 weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Yes I would recommend to my family,friends,and anyone  interested in purchasing the product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as simple as described or shown - with a LOT of practice it might get better</li>
            <li>On top of this when we ordered I had paid an extra %.95 for a rush delivery and my daughter had not</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;system\\&quot; broke on the first attempt to use it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I use the blush &amp; the eye shadow too - but you need to apply those FIRST before you apply the make-up.</li>
            <li>I AM WILLING TO DO THAT</li>
            <li>Thus, by helping me identify my exact color, Eric‚Äôs taken the ‚Äúguess work‚Äù out of the ‚Äúmix‚Äù, no pun intended.</li>
            <li>would get more from a regular person that wears makeup but doesn&#x27;t do it for a career).  </li>
            <li>First of all, it took three weeks to process and ship to my house.  </li>
            <li>The first system they sent was never recieved so they shipped me another one.  </li>
            <li>she knew exactly what she was doing in customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to use all of the make up that came with the first delivery.</li>
            <li>Fabulous makeup, looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is absolutely HORRID!</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>and it would be difficult to get to the post office, and she recommended that I ask someone to do it for me and that it is the best she can offer.  </li>
            <li>the makeup adheres to peach fuzz first</li>
            <li>i never was able to accomplish a face i would go outside with,</li>
            <li>Tried only once so far, and found you have to use a lot more product than the instructions list.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely takes use to!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a decent makeup system, good makeup product, but not far and away better than other foundation options.</li>
            <li>I have had little glitches and troubles with the airbrush but each time I&#x27;ve called they&#x27;ve had a very easy, quick solution for</li>
            <li>As far as application is concerned, the instructions tell you it is better to spray lightly, let it dry</li>
            <li>I probably would do more research though the next time I purchase a system that cost that much money.</li>
            <li>In addition to all of the mess you will be charged much more than the original price of $19.99 - you will be charged $59.99 for deposit on the system for around 5 months and then $34.06 every 2 months for your makeup.  </li>
            <li>You can tell she really enjoys what she does and is very much a people person.</li>
            <li>and if that weren&#x27;t enough he also offered to send me a different type of foundation (silk) to see if that didn&#x27;t better aid in covering my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Im sure I will be a long time customer.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievable what a difference a good customer service experience makes.</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest people buy it full retail price from walgreen or drugstore etc and can return it to the store directly if you&#x27;re not satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was having trouble getting my free polish and Ashley was not only a good listener</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I highly recommend the system and I am truly impressed with the Luminess Brand.</li>
            <li>The application is less than five minutes to do and you look amazing.</li>
            <li>these  2 Outstanding representatives took complete ownership  and made a very frustrating situation into a most memorable experience.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from watching an infomercial and after 20 minutes of making sure there were no new charges, I made the call.  </li>
            <li>However, since Luminess Air offered a trial period, I felt confident there was nothing to loose.     </li>
            <li>Big Kudos to the whole team for making all transactions easy.</li>
            <li>Cathy then offered to send me a brand new stylus, free of charge, 2-day delivery plus a few more offerings that I did not even request.  </li>
            <li>If you have wrinkles or large pores, get the minus-10 gel and the concealer; they really do help.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to talk to such a nice, positive young lady by the name of Nikki.</li>
            <li>and she was able to give me tips on how to better use the system to not accentuate the small lines in my forehead!!  </li>
            <li>Its people like you with so much patience that help Luminess coustomers feel beauitful every day.</li>
            <li>Plus, with the instruction booklet to take to the bathroom it made things so much easier.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And note that they are very sneaky about their payment process and they will NOT notify you of anything regarding your account.&lt;br /&gt;Really?</li>
            <li>Wonder who does their reliability testing - really?</li>
            <li>I will try to keep the word out, but thanks to Amazon for letting you make an informed decision.</li>
            <li>And it is very user</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.</li>
            <li>I had some blemishes that pop up and the luminess air system did very well to cover that</li>
            <li>Thanks Kathy/Cathy.</li>
            <li>Very deceiving company</li>
            <li>Thanks to them</li>
            <li>I had to use about 10- 12 drops to finish my whole damn face......</li>
            <li>it covered very well</li>
            <li>However, with an automatic refill every 60 days, I now have too much make-up and the caligraphy eyeliner did not seem to work</li>
            <li>She was very understanding and patient with me and answered all of my questions of the make system</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the real kicker - on the Luminess website</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the real kicker - on the Luminess website</li>
            <li>the agent was very helpful</li>
            <li>is really bad,2nd</li>
            <li>and she too was very helpful.</li>
            <li>She was very helpful explaining how to get savings from membership.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Ashley for restoring &amp; giving me hope for patience, laughter, &amp; understanding.</li>
            <li>Nowadays no one wants to go out of their way to do that...</li>
            <li>Thanks to Elizabeth and her supervisor for their help.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It should be gently pushed all the way in (about 1 inch showing) and the nuts tightened up.  </li>
            <li>how much she helped me</li>
            <li>Like REALLY ????</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really a buyer beware</li>
            <li>#2: The make-up itself has REAL staying power - it lasts until you take it off.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a much quicker &amp; cleaner way to apply make-up.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>All in all, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Chanty was very informative &amp; knowledgeable about all of their products.</li>
            <li>Luminess Air Premium System is Fabulous and Truly gives my skin the look of a movie star walking the Red Carpet!</li>
            <li>Thanks Luminess Air.</li>
            <li>I would really like to know the differences of the foundating that came with the kit vs the others.  </li>
            <li>think too much to airbrush all my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks LESZLIEE and thanks luminesss air.</li>
            <li>Thanks Cathy for all your help.</li>
            <li>She was very helpful with giving me some additional info</li>
            <li>I purchased the system about a month ago, and after experimenting with the colors and learning how to use the airbrush, I was ready to place an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>then when you wash it off, you can not believe how much makeup was on your face.  </li>
            <li>and I had to call multiple times because they kept trying to charge me more frequently and then set me up for automated shipments when I specifically said I did not want to set up automated shipments.</li>
            <li>Portia in customer service was extremely courteous &amp; took the time to look into my account as I explained to her that I was having issues with the foundation feeling sticky on my face, that I had called prior &amp; trial was to be extended while following suggestions from Luminess Air.  </li>
            <li>When I phoned them to clear this up, they told me that they had to hit my account for one more charge as the makeup was still in shipping and the order could not be stopped; after being told last month that the order was already in shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have been completely ripped off and I warn you WATCH OUT!!!</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money!!!</li>
            <li>The makeup itself is wonderful, however I have spent upwards of $600 in the last 10 months due to the Air Compressor and Stylus.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOVE my new Luminess Air Professional System!!!!  </li>
            <li>tear.\\&quot; I have had to purchase a completely new stylus ($80) and it was faulty upon the first use.</li>
            <li>She was my first phone call of the new day</li>
            <li>I live in a hot humid environment, so</li>
            <li>My makeup still looks natural and the coverage is just right.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but do to other reasons needed to cancel my membership today.</li>
            <li>Although I was not 100% satisfied and other complications happened I am thankful that Tonya helped me out with everything.</li>
            <li>I had the honor and pleasure of speaking with an extremely knowledgeable and lovely sales representative named &#x27;Angelica&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fixed a small problem and so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>I was left with either, blotchy skin that never looked quite clean, or skin that looked caked with makeup.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing and last all day long.</li>
            <li>Also the gun is simple to take apart to clean every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Within 2 minutes she had turned an unhappy customer into a VERY satisfied customer who ordered more products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How much do you normally spend on makeup?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making some changes in my professional life, and I need to look polished and to be consistent about it.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Customer Service&amp;#34; has gone out the window with the age of new technology, but she took care of me!  </li>
            <li>The machine is fine although the stylus trigger will become loose a lot and the needle clogs.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it--I discovered it is classic misleading marketing.</li>
            <li>As I get older am having some skin issues and found myself with questions about the products and application.  </li>
            <li>The light was not attached and loose in the compartment.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking from a managerial perspective, I highly recommend Lakesha for promotion and a pay compensation for her performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s widely advertised as $19.95 but - we discovered - in the fine print they charge you over $300.  </li>
            <li>I then started to get a little confident and put some of the liquid blush into the well of the airbrush.</li>
            <li>Complete scam!!</li>
            <li>I have not tried other brands, but strongly believe using another brand&#x27;s water based airbrush make up would not harm the system.   </li>
            <li>I recently called customer service as well to purchase other products and to see what was new and their customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 yrs old and really wasn&#x27;t expecting anyone but me to notice</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, but they were experienced with airbrushing.</li>
            <li>This is a SCAM as far as I am concerned and it is very upsetting.</li>
            <li>Thanks, not getting one, I will keep my old face.</li>
            <li>far, I would say that I really like the Luminess Air System.  </li>
            <li>if i added more makeup to my blemishes then my face would look uneven and blotchy.</li>
            <li>It takes some time overall, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>and then once they answer they have all the excuses of why they didn&#x27;t return your whole first payment when you only had the product for 3 days.</li>
            <li>(I suspect because it&#x27;s really only worth about $100).  </li>
            <li>She introduced me to other reasonably priced Luminess products that would resolve my objectives of (1) getting even coverage (Eraser), and (2) how to clean the equipment (TipTop</li>
            <li>While at this time in life this system is not right for me, Merilyn, one of the CS employees made my return easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was VERY anxious to try this system but decided to check the reviews first - and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>because as I said earlier, this was a brand new system and had never worked right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so grateful that she let me know about products that are currently on sale; she arranged to give me a one-time courtesy discount after I misunderstood the price of a particular item; and she also arranged for me to receive a very generous discount on the Luminess airbrush itself!  </li>
            <li>She was extremely helpful, knowledgable, cheerful and understanding.</li>
            <li>for the actual product.. At first it was a lot of fun experimenting with the different products..</li>
            <li>My machine still works like new.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Luminess Air</li>
            <li>but I am new to using it.  </li>
            <li>and she would have a new one sent at no charge.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a new makeup try..  </li>
            <li>I am a new customer and had questions that I wanted answered and she took the time to go over all information regarding my questions  </li>
            <li>And, because of her upbeat attitude and helpfulness, you now have a new, permanent customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my new Luminess air make up today and.</li>
            <li>She heard my concerns and directed me to new products which I look forward to using.</li>
            <li>So I was dreading to have to call Luminess air and having to explain to them what was going on and having to ask them if they would send me a new one because I have the warranty plan.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one</li>
            <li>I was supposed to receive an email with all of the details showing my new balance but never rec&#x27;d it.</li>
            <li>they are more apt to take the time to whip out their computers and vent their anger.  </li>
            <li>I spent 20 minutes trying to clean the machine, AGAIN, and eventually got it towork.</li>
            <li>If your skin is oily and moisturizer is not part of your regular regime substitute with a few drops of warm water.</li>
            <li>I cannot thank Ashley enough for breaking it all down &amp; helping me to get the two free bottles I couldn&#x27;t seem to get quite right.</li>
            <li>gave me a very natural coverage</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My dealings with LuminessAir was very professional</li>
            <li>I recommend this system to anyone who wants minimal to full coverage and wants to take the time to learn (by practicing) how to apply the airbrush makeup properly and also doesn&#x27;t mind taking care of the equipment.</li>
            <li>Months ago my trigger started acting up and procrastinating me took till today to call and get ready to bitch up and complain!</li>
            <li>Keisha WOW!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money or dollars!...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am completely amazed!</li>
            <li>but I have to say that I am completely amazed!</li>
            <li>and now she has more time and finishes faster than usual because of luminess....</li>
            <li>Natural as your gonna get!</li>
            <li>Manny even said &amp;#34;I completely understand your frustration and I am on your side!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I usually never comment when I am dissatisfied with a product</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,  TIME, AND NERVES!</li>
            <li>On top of the broken light, the polishes and remover are TINY!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the makeup goes - I do like it, but I&#x27;m not totally convinced that it&#x27;s a lot better than other foundations.  </li>
            <li>I have just ordered a new system for work and am keeping my old one for home use.</li>
            <li>my 3 year old daughter was laughing at me every time that i came out with a new shade trying to match my face.  </li>
            <li>next morning I woke up to go through my normal getting ready routine.</li>
            <li>I am in love and don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to other foundations!</li>
            <li>He not only resolved my technical issue, he also helped me identify the right color for my particular skin tone.</li>
            <li>It will make a huge mess in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>The stylus kept clogging so much that I purchased a new one, only to have it happen again and again, even after taking the thing apart and cleaning it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I tried Luminess Air, trial product with a stylus, thinking paying only less than $30 is worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>It got here so fast, was about $150 cheaper than Luminess terrible product, &amp; worked SO good, it was so easy!</li>
            <li>and she said that the web site clearly states on further payment unless customer returns within a certain number of days, 30 days??  </li>
            <li>I set the system on the highest speed to apply the foundation because the other speeds do not provide adequate power; there is a hesitation.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look so clear.</li>
            <li>you clean the gun properly, don&#x27;t half ass or rush.</li>
            <li>She spoke clearly &amp; with confidence.  </li>
            <li>I have moderate acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be discouraged early on.</li>
            <li>She is a professional makeup artist and loves the set.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have gotten several compliments that my skin looks very even.</li>
            <li>and I had surprised bills then had to figure things out.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>WOW.......</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>WOW.......</li>
            <li>Luminess offers a 30 day trial offer  if ordered from TV of course you are charged a non-refundable fee of $30.00.</li>
            <li>I apply it where it is absolutely necessary and, depending on how much sleep</li>
            <li>I got so busy</li>
            <li>I  am well respected professional and my payment record has been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SHE WAS EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND WELL EDUCATED IN PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE.</li>
            <li>I surprised my wife with the Luminess Airbrush system she had been wanting for her birthday.</li>
            <li>My machine does clog but it is absolutely vital</li>
            <li>I was adamant that I was NOT going to get talked into keeping it.</li>
            <li>AND THE KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON, A YOUNG LADY &amp;#34; TONI OR TONY WHO ASSISTED ME TO DAY</li>
            <li>Karen Young</li>
            <li>I will take this as far as I have to.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift from my 12 year old son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>That makes the spray change considerably so use this to adjust the flow and size of your brush.  </li>
            <li>(also some screw bits to tighten there) and stick out too far.  </li>
            <li>They are into us so far for around $300.00.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>far as the Luminess products go, so far they are all in the trash as we waited \\&quot;too long\\&quot; to request a return authorization (RA).  </li>
            <li>#1: It gives you completely even make-up coverage - after you get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, the cheap plastic bottles that store the products break and leaks.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve watched one You-tube video (but the lady doing it was a professional makeup artist -</li>
            <li>I spoke with Porsha and she was so professional.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to send your procduct back if was not for her sales experience and kindness.</li>
            <li>I told them I don&#x27;t think I will need it that frequently</li>
            <li>Throughout the conversation, Cathy was patient, professional and knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li>is busy on the phone now</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>With my busy work schedule, I have not even had time to try the product.</li>
            <li>if you have questions my sister went from being insecure about her skin to now having a gorgeous personality</li>
            <li>It took a couple of tries to get the right coloring but after some trial and error</li>
            <li>and they charge your account a first payment right away even though they&#x27;re supposed to give you 30-Days and even though they will tell you it will be reimbursed you would only get half of that</li>
            <li>I take a little time and clean it piece by piece.</li>
            <li>I spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials, reviews, and troubleshooting videos telling me to clean it &amp; showing me how to do so.</li>
            <li>the ‚Äúfine small print‚Äù stating they will charge your CC: ~5 payments&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply, it only take a few minutes to apply, and your make up looks natural.  </li>
            <li>[Clever, too, how they put the actual cost in words instead of numbers.]</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I saw the women on tv that were older like me and it made under the eyes look so much younger.</li>
            <li>Second, the back end of the brush (the part with the sticker on it that says watch DVD first) screws off and inside</li>
            <li>I waited a mere minute to speak with Anita over the phone and have been treated with exceptional service.  </li>
            <li>She not only assisted me in proper use which resulted in my final decision to keep the product, but also confirmed the billing and explained the future billing.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend Luminess Air to everyone for personal and business use..</li>
            <li>and, if greater coverage is needed, to apply another new thin layer.  </li>
            <li>It comes with the Air Stylus, and makeup removal towelettes, all in a cute Black and Pink carrying</li>
            <li>Just buff clean, dry &amp; in 60 seconds, polish is dry, no air bubbles,</li>
            <li>If you‚Äôre interested in trying a new way to apply makeup and have the time to sit down with it, read the manual, and watch the DVD‚Ä¶.I</li>
            <li>I was really expecting some long sales pitch, but she understood.</li>
            <li>and I know that when my life gets back to normal</li>
            <li>Easy application  hardly feels like anything is on your face.</li>
            <li>and she is sending me new colors as the ones that come in the initial kit</li>
            <li>but that I would need to send the one I have back to them in the packaging of the new unit they will send.  </li>
            <li>So you don&#x27;t follow instructions exactly right down to the size that the return authorization numbers should be on the front of the box</li>
            <li>I bashed a major appliance manufacturer and let me tell you, my satisfaction was off the charts.  </li>
            <li>I AM GOING TO REPORT THEM TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND EVEN FIND AN ATTORNEY TO FILE A SMALL CLAIM COURT PETITION !!</li>
            <li>Its totally not worth it now because i cant afford to have all the \\&quot;6 easy payments of 59.99\\&quot; taken out within days of each other.</li>
            <li>Thank you Ashley for restoring my faith in customer service because I was losing a lot of hope for &amp;#34;customer service in general &amp; was not handled by a computer.</li>
            <li>(If that is still too frequent, she said to just call back</li>
            <li>Since I have purchased the system I have not went back to my old foundation.</li>
            <li>I am a professional artist and don&#x27;t plan on ever using regular liquid foundation on my clients again.</li>
            <li>It was apparent....</li>
            <li>Apparently, when you buy a system from luminess you are required to join their club where they send you make up automatically and charge your credit card.  </li>
            <li>Well, needless to say on the line was a kind voice named Eric.</li>
            <li>I was confused about more than one thing and</li>
            <li>I learned that Manny is new and just started working there not to long ago.</li>
            <li>On top of that it was less expensive, they seem to have a MUCH wider selection of colors and they have a TON of other cool things/ways to use the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had trouble with the wand not working right</li>
            <li>i think this one makes my face look shiny (but I normally have dry skin -</li>
            <li>a general viewpoint they&#x27;re FRAUD; because they clearly state that they&#x27;ll refund your money if you don&#x27;t like it; but that refers to any additional amount you pay after the trial period, but at the same time you won&#x27;t get the initial money you paid for the product.</li>
            <li>A professional taught me an invaluable trick:  Only apply foundation where necessary!</li>
            <li>It is going back and if they choose not to accept this item back then it will be in mail limbo as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>And on top of that, their \\&quot;30-day risk free trial\\&quot; is a bunch of crap.  </li>
            <li>The application is simple enough, but customer service is always super helpful when I&#x27;ve needed a little extra direction with my system.  </li>
            <li>The machine is constantly breaking and the parts that break are not covered under warranty because they are considered \\&quot;general wear and</li>
            <li>She was understanding, professional, personable, knowledgeable and above all she actually cared about what I had to say and went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me.</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews first before I wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I had to redo my face the first couple of times but after a few days I got a hang of it.</li>
            <li>My luminess air system gets used about once a month, which I thought was weird that it started clogging all the time even though I clean it really well after each use.  </li>
            <li>Not only do the products do just what they claim to do but the customer service I received was over and beyond what I expected and normally receive from others these days.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are plastic and break easily and also upon ordering, or come already broken.</li>

            <li> Just moments ago I spoke with a Wonderful, Amazing Customer Service Representative by the name of Eric.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Un Happy Customer for Luniness</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I got a great deal.</li>
            <li> It was a great customer service experience.</li>
            <li> Dinair however doesn&#x27;t spend money on infomercials like Luminess and they have great customer testimonials and reviews.</li>
            <li> Called into customer service to recieve more info about the product and spoke to Marilyn!!</li>
            <li> And I love my system!!</li>
            <li> Anjanette was very kind and helpful when I called in for information.  </li>
            <li> This Luminess Air Premium product is very nice.  </li>
            <li> I called Customer Service and the woman was very nice &amp; helpful.</li>
            <li> I phoned referencing an issue I perceived I would have to battle for and to the contrary;  I spoke with a very kind &amp; understanding representative by the name of Anita.  </li>
            <li> I spoke with Coreena, she was very good, kind, helpful and thoughtfull.</li>
            <li> What kind of customer service is that!  </li>
            <li> Eric put me at ease and he was so kind and generous!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I love the finish ...</li>
            <li> Good product, great company.</li>
            <li> Glad to see there is still good customer service out there!!</li>
            <li> Good product, great company.</li>
            <li> Well to my shock it was a VERY pleasant and easy phone call!</li>
            <li> She was so helpful and pleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li> That was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Luminess Air, I received the most excellent customer service, they were very kind</li>
            <li> Nikki displayed very good customer service skills and she listen and did an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I would like to comend Porsha on her great customer service and I also love the makeup it is great</li>
            <li> but it looked like it might be good to use.</li>
            <li> I get comments from people all the time about how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I loved the customer service that I got from Porsha at Luminess Air.  </li>
            <li> Will never purchase anything from them ever again, not even a good paperweight.</li>
            <li> You are either good at customer service or you&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it is important I always look my best.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> The coverage is really good whether using minimum or medium coverage.  </li>
            <li> As I said, the product is good.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Luminess Air makeup system and I actually loved the make-up .It</li>
            <li> So I was going to cancel the membership even though I loved the makeup everywhere else on my face</li>
            <li> My makeup is smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> Once it was working, I loved the makeup application, and even got the blush on just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> but if you want to make a statement this site is a good sounding board.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and my skin looked gorgeous</li>
            <li> Loved this system brought it.</li>
            <li> Keisha went fair beyond help.....</li>
            <li> Good evening,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Im fairly convinced that women  like Sharon and Anita will keep this company booming, but the makeup, speaks volumes for itself.  </li>
            <li> I know this is a good  product because I bought one for my self.  </li>
            <li> so is that good??).</li>
            <li> When I tried it out, it took 4 coats (each taking 15-20 drops) to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> that I loved:  </li>
            <li> this superior level of customer service</li>
            <li> what a wonderful surprise to call a company and be welcomed on the phone by someone who seemed excited to anticipate what she could help me with.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed with what she was willing to do to make me a happy customer.  </li>
            <li> i am super impressed.</li>
            <li> and she was exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Using the quick step booklet, I shook up the color I thought would match my skin tone the best, and put about 5-6 drops into the well.</li>
            <li> I was able to find what I wanted and order it and got more information on how to get the best results with my product.  </li>
            <li> Please inform Anita I appreciate her exceptional service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> Love it my makeup looks great.  </li>
            <li> I love the abundance of joy she gave while helping me.</li>
            <li> I love my luminess air and their great customer service.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE free stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I love this system, my makeup is smooth and flawless.  </li>
            <li> I love how the makeup feels so light and gives me a flawless finish, I also use their blush and l love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It was so refreshing!</li>
            <li> I would like to first say what an awesome experience</li>

            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my system!</li>
            <li> Need to provide better containers!</li>
            <li> LOVE this makeup !</li>
            <li> I really love my Luminess Air!</li>
            <li> I love my Luminess Air Premium System and your nail products!</li>
            <li> Luminess Air, you have a precious gem for an employee named Cathy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with her service that I asked to speak with her supervisor, Sharon, who also was extremely pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, covers great and makes my skin look flawless!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> she was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> Then this fabulous, happy, NOT pushy lady and I were chatting away and even having a bit of a laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordered the Luminess Air Airbrush pro system &amp; the customer service operator was amazing.  </li>
            <li> I‚Äôll keep using your amazing products and ask all my friends to do so as well.</li>
            <li> She was kind and understanding.  </li>
            <li> I feel it sets the skin nicely before the makeup goes on.</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t care to.</li>
            <li> Ordered my Luminess system about 3 weeks ago and I am just loving it.</li>
            <li> She was kind and patient ...</li>
            <li> Many times I was put on hold for a good 20 minutes or was hung up on all together.</li>
            <li> She was so nice and helpful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She is sooo nice and eager to help!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can guarantee that most of us do not spend this amount each month and if we do I can guarantee it is makeup that is good for our skin.  </li>
            <li> What is nice about that is you can dab concealer where you need it and the airbrush smooths and evens out everything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s boldly obvious that this feed had been seeded with Great Product and Awesome Customer Service!&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had a nice conversation.  </li>
            <li> I loved the customer service and I&#x27;m glad that she helped me.</li>
            <li> Ladies, you can buy a nice quality air brush compressor and artist tips for around $80 elsewhere on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and she was so nice.</li>
            <li> She shared with me her own experiences with Luminess and how to coordinate the colors.  </li>
            <li> Lakasha was very nice and friendly.  </li>
            <li> and they were very nice and friendly.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I just want to say that in this busy world of Rush, Rush, Rush, it‚Äôs really nice to know there‚Äôs a company out there that still makes the effort to provide both a Great Product and Great Customer Service,</li>
            <li> THE TV AD FOR $19.95 WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!</li>
            <li> Porsha gave my the right tone or shade of make-up to make my skin look beautiful</li>
            <li> Toni was very knowledgeable about their products and sincere about helping me be the best I can be.  </li>
            <li> it was very easy to use it</li>
            <li> She made my purchase very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle</li>
            <li> I really liked the luminess air makeup because it is very light on my skin</li>
            <li> I just started using Luminess Air the best product that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad to say that I will be able to do it because of my flawless looking skin thanks to my luminess air airbrush system.</li>
            <li> , professional made me feel wonderful</li>
            <li> I would recommend this system to anyone I know that loves natural looking flawless skin.</li>
            <li> How very delightful and unexpected it was to find myself on the receiving end of this lady.  </li>
            <li> but since it doesn&#x27;t fit, it won&#x27;t be much good to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course a good product costs money and nothing is free, you get what you pay for, but</li>
            <li> And because Eric knows the product line so well, he was able to easily identify the exact color combination/number that I need to achieve a  flawless look each and every time I use the Luminess Air Premium System.</li>
            <li> Ok, I could live with that because I just knew it was going to be wonderful.</li>
            <li> In very fine print at the bottom of the advertisement  states &#x27;</li>
            <li> They were very quick and understanding!</li>
            <li> Easy as that!</li>
            <li> Eric sends me to MISS SHARON (hi doll) and she was super kind as well!</li>
            <li> The person I even talked to (whose name is Manny) was VERY pleasant and professional!</li>
            <li> I model professionally and my skin tones always change during the seasons, I love the how you can mix shades to make the perfect blend.</li>
            <li> And yes I am loving the cheaper part, but the customer service was so great, she took so much time to help me.</li>
            <li> IF IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...</li>
            <li> Pull VERY lightly and keep your hand about 8 inches from your face.</li>
            <li> Luminess Air is very fortunate to have Zulain in their corner</li>
            <li> It is very light and even coverage, once you get used to using the airbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> her Manager Sharon and she was excited for Anita and very pleased.  </li>
            <li> anyway I could not believe what a great help she was and such a pleasant personality.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin and since the makeup is water based, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores or break me out.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She uses the same tone of voice, is patient, kind, and very good.  </li>
            <li> Also, the gentleman, Jose had OUTSTANDING customer service and took care of everything i needed.</li>
            <li> I really love their makeup.</li>
            <li> Thank you Porsha, I love my Luminess system package.</li>
            <li> For starters I have to say that I LOVE the Luminess Air system and products.</li>
            <li> and she truly made my day by making the experience so enjoyable.</li>
            <li> So, Thank you Keisha for making what i was expecting to be just another call on my list of to do&#x27;s to a call that made me appreciate the company for hiring you and that you as an employee are using your people skills to make someone (me) feel better after i hang up.  </li>
            <li> I spoke with Hope last week and she was awesome.  </li>
            <li> It does not cake into the creases of my middle-aged skin and creates a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation is the Luminess Air Ultra.</li>
            <li> so I can get the most out of the system.</li>
            <li> many years ago I cannot wait to try it</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the make-up and</li>
            <li> I really am pleased with this product --- and the sales they have on products is when I buy.  </li>
            <li> She was attentive, efficient, kind, understanding and even made suggestions of some products that might be better for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can surely see why they are rated A+ with the BBB.</li>
            <li> I love the Luminess Pro Air System and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love my Luminess Air Makeup</li>
            <li> I am so in love with the luminess air system</li>
            <li> I really love my luminess air system I would recommended it to all and plan on giving it as a gift to my mom and my sister</li>
            <li> Love the coverage and look.  </li>
            <li> Can wait to try more products.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the great customer service however at no time was</li>
            <li> I advised that an additional $34.06 will be billed to my account on top of the $69.99  </li>
            <li> on top of that I was told I have to pay to return and ship it</li>
            <li> To top it all off that 3 drops of make for one face ain&#x27;t 3 drops....</li>
            <li> Before you know it, you are in debt for a lot more money</li>
            <li> Cynthia went above and beyond for me; she was delightful and could not have been more helpful.  </li>
            <li> me to try because of the better skin match.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are airbrush systems out there that are better.</li>
            <li> I guess this is how most companies would make their money, but it bothered me that it wasn&#x27;t disclosed to me</li>
            <li> Once things were straightened out I was able to plan ; it made things a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this makeup</li>
            <li> So at this point I was fed up with this system that was supposed to be a really awesome Christmas present, so I ordered the Dinair airbrush system.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Their system gives me such a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that their foundation is my favorite foundation ever.</li>
            <li> Once I saw my wife use the machine she fell in love with it, she is a make up artist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to say it was one of my better decisions.  </li>
            <li> My girl &amp;#34;Toni&amp;#34; and her instructors, made my experience wonderful and helped me look like a younger, and better version of myself .  </li>
            <li> MY MOTHER WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH HER GIFT , AND I AM SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I called Zulain at Luminess Air today to check to make sure my account was in order.</li>
            <li> Not only is she an awesome customer service rep, she deserves a raise, too.</li>
            <li> I could tell she was smiling and enjoying her job.</li>
            <li> You truly have a phenomenal personality.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love the finish.  </li>
            <li> AND NOW I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT I  CAN  DEPEND ON THESE HELPFUL WOMEN</li>
            <li> Paperwork stated that I owed 5 more payments.</li>
            <li> I do not get home most days until 6pm.</li>
            <li> This is fraud and will be reported to the Better Business Bureau and has been reported to my credit card company.</li>
            <li> I stopped payment and I am sure I will receive more threats.</li>
            <li> My experience with her was fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks, customer service was helpful.</li>
            <li> My experience today on the phone with Leszliee was refreshing.</li>
            <li> because I thought for sure this was going to be like jumping through hurdles</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Jeana Roth</li>
            <li> Anita in customer service was outstanding in clarifying questions about my makeup system and the terms.  </li>
            <li> Then she text me and said for me to phone to make sure mine was cancelled because it had said her issue was resolved and mine was part of her issue.</li>
            <li> I am sure if you are ordering more you get what you want but if you have a problem forget it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Luminess Air premium system and I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutley love what it does.  </li>
            <li> Ok, before I order these &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; things, I try and do some homework and read reviews.</li>
            <li> I had many questions.</li>
            <li> She did not pressure me to buy more products than I would need, &amp; on occasion would remind me the product was already in my starter kit.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely, Janine*</li>
            <li> I really love the product, but please don&#x27;t scam me out of my money.</li>
            <li> When purchasing, make sure you opt out of all the gimmicks they have</li>
            <li> She did say she would authorize the return of the latest makeup to be returned to me.  </li>
            <li> the most doesn&#x27;t want to work with the system itself.  </li>
            <li> I called to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed and wanted my money back.</li>
            <li> You use 3 to 4 (or more)</li>
            <li> Many friends are ordering #3 and they are sent #4.</li>
            <li> A problem originated with our US Postal Service (need I say more?)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re a blessing, I LOVE the system and</li>
            <li> how it works, it is the only makeup I can find to match my complexion perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love the make up</li>
            <li> The sale rep was very helpful and we came to a great agreement.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the Luminess Air way!!  :)</li>
            <li> Please tell her that I received the makeup and that I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> It is a 30 day free trial and there is nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I love this product now.</li>
            <li> Since she is a user, she understood my needs -- better than I did -- and she shared some finer points and &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; ideas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Three more things Tonya did</li>
            <li> , I feel much more confident as I transition to airbrushed makeup.  </li>
            <li> Tonya deserves a lot of credit for enhancing my experience -- on so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With practice, I&#x27;m getting faster and more</li>
            <li> drops\\&quot; they say is sufficient I found that it requires more like 20 drops to do ANY covering whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a super easy, fast and flawless way to apply your make-up or even do your spray tans at home</li>
            <li> The most effective way I&#x27;ve found to clean the system is by running tap water into the bowl to flush out any leftover makeup residue and then adding the alcohol/water mixture and spraying it out into the sink.</li>
            <li> Katelyn&#x27;s customer service was excellent, she went above and beyond, had patience, provided insight to the system and different types of foundation, and was very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Please be AWARE this company is a scam!!!</li>
            <li> I was on the fence for a long time about air brush makeup and decide to take a leap and hope for the best.  </li>
            <li> Best customer service I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> &amp; she was patient, clever and very kind &amp; understanding.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love your makeup, the way it makes my skin look so nice and smooth and clean, no blotchy spots any more.  </li>
            <li> She is knowledgeable about the products, which is another rare thing!!  </li>
            <li> then I was so excited!</li>
            <li> Today I received my bi-monthly shipment with 2 different shades in it and some awesome free gifts to go with it.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE how light the makeup looks and feels.</li>
            <li> but she also included free samples of the Silk and Satin for me to try because of the better skin match.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and have great skin because I have taken care of it.  </li>
            <li> He was so great and professional</li>
            <li> I really hope their product is as good as Luminess.</li>
            <li> and they were able to help choose my proper skin tone and mailed it right out, great service!!</li>
            <li> but when I did discover the right one I was absolutely loving it and still am.</li>
            <li> It gives me a flawless look, one that I&#x27;ve never got with any other foundation.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to correct the splatter by stippling the area with a makeup foundation brush.      </li>
            <li> It was so easy to use that I had no problems at all and the color I chose (</li>
            <li> I got my system in the mail today , easy to set up</li>
            <li> It took a lot of experimenting with the airbrush system and was not as easy as they want you to think.</li>
            <li> No worries about signing up with this membership, it&#x27;s as easy to get  out as it easy to sign up.</li>
            <li> The customer service rep easily cancelled my order with no hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li> She had some questions called luminess air customer service and they resolved the issue very quickly.</li>
            <li> It wasnt as easy as they make it look.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t wash off although with my facewash it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> She was professional but also warm, kind, &amp; personable.  </li>
            <li> another try cause it was worth it to me to to keep trying on shades till I found the right one!!!</li>
            <li> Porche, my customer care representative was very nice, fast with her fingers and took care of that for me with a smile in her voice.</li>
            <li> These ladies are the most professional and courteous persons I have ever dealt with when contacting a company with a concern.&lt;br /&gt;There should be more people like them on the customer service lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be honest, I&#x27;m the girl who watched Every Youtube video pertaining to Luminess Air (their videos, people&#x27;s reviews, video blogs, etc) before trying it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I was helped by Tonya W. who I must say is hands down the best customer service representative I have ever spoken to</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve got it down, this was the best makeup investment I&#x27;ve every made.</li>
            <li> The ad was so suductive that I didn&#x27;t look at the fine print.</li>
            <li> did not see the fine print when I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> FINE PRINT COST ME</li>
            <li> /&gt;The make-up worked fine for me but</li>
            <li> I asked Eric if i could speak to a supervisor because in the world today, people are so quick to critisize and never to compliment someones actions!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am ready contact Better Business Bureau!  </li>
            <li> AND I have been able to save money on my cosmetic purchases because I don&#x27;t use nearly as much!!</li>
            <li> Thank you Tiff-ny and Luminess Air for making this easy and fun!</li>
            <li> I feel so special now that I have the same equipment that makeup artists use to apply my makeup just as beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have a huge upcoming event about to take place in my life</li>
            <li> This is the email I sent to them trying to cancel my &amp;#34;club membership,&amp;#34; but I feel like it is an accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were helpful, polite and attentive.</li>
            <li> you must be a wonderful company  to work for to have such excellent employees who stand behind their product and guarantee it.</li>
            <li> Then go over it lightly with the darker shade until you reach the correct color.</li>
            <li> The product is NOT even great; yes, it does the basic job, but so do tons of foundations out there.</li>
            <li> See how important you feel receiving &amp;#34;off</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED A LIGHT COVERING AND HEAVIER.</li>
            <li> I felt the coverage was fantastic</li>
            <li> If the machine continues to allow me to apply makeup like I am now, fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not knowing this, I had only experienced the Ultra make-up line which came with the machine.  </li>
            <li> , may give the rest of my fact a light going over.</li>
            <li> a really cheap.</li>
            <li> ~$370 if not return in 30days.&lt;br /&gt;And charged her CC twice during the free 30 day trail.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could ever enjoy putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> This two weeks ago have been looking absolutely fabulous</li>
            <li> I just received my free trail today....</li>
            <li> Zulain immediately offered a detailed explanation and made corrections while on the call and emailed me the corrected invoice</li>
            <li> I do not understand why you are paying a deposit on the system when you bought the system so cheap and the insurance on it is almost triple??????  </li>
            <li> but she helped me pick out my two free colors.</li>
            <li> When I think of all the fingernail polish with diamond crystals or nylon, my nails still cracked,broke &amp; I&#x27;m happy to say that after all my years of Sally Hansen &amp; similar products, this balances all those out .</li>
            <li> I even lost screw from stylus whilst cleaning and they replaced the stylus free of charge.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this system for my sisters birthday and was kinda hesitant towards purchasing call in to get help to figure my sisters shade and the call center was absolutely PHENOMENAL like really they help me pick this perfect system for my sister and also was a helping hand towards service</li>
            <li> She was patient and kind and was very helpful.</li>
            <li> The shades fit my complexion so well.</li>
            <li> The girl that helped me was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> When I called to place my order I was told it would be a free 30 day trial</li>
            <li> When I called to find out why since it was supposed to be free for thirty days</li>
            <li> She then directed me to their web site with detailed instructions on line.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the trail everything was good, they even gave me a $25 gift certificate which I can ONLY used to buy more make up nothing else....</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> and I love the staffs positive attitude!</li>
            <li> Very underhanded deceitful company Stay Away!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much!!!</li>
            <li> A very rare thing these days.</li>
            <li> This is one of those companies where you better read the fine print or they will be charging you  your first born child.  </li>
            <li> Along with the cleanup super easy.</li>
            <li> Besides the look it gives you it is so easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> I found the color that matches my complexion and it goes on quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Overall she was pleasant, kind and very informative.  </li>
            <li> She made it so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> To top it off, I just called in to Customer Service with a billing question and Tonya and Ms. Sharon were SUPER nice, professional, and informative.  </li>
            <li> I had a small problem and a Wonderful agent named Ophelia, helped me solved that problem.</li>
            <li> But after wearing the makeup for about one month I noticed a significant increase in breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> first of all I love the airbrush system.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the T and made sure I applied it exactly how they said to do it</li>
            <li> At first was totally in love with this product &amp; system, but boy have I changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> At first It was a bit overwhelming and I had questions about my bill.</li>
            <li> when i received the kit, i was so excited i immediately read the instructions and learned how to use it before i started.  </li>
            <li> The hardest part was learning how to clean the system thoroughly.</li>
            <li> If I just use the foundation, I clean the needle after every three uses, but flush the system well after each use.    </li>
            <li> Mix everything up in the clean palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> Finally, the coverage is nowhere near the flawless look they claim.  </li>
            <li> I have started to clean it with dawn dish soap</li>
            <li> It gives me a better, more natural appearance.  </li>
            <li> She had such a pleasant voice and and even nicer attitude, Luminess Air has a valuable employee in Cathy</li>
            <li> 95% of the reviews were positive and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li> I love the air brush system and now that I&#x27;ve talked to Tigeria and have a better understanding, I&#x27;m sure I will be a customer for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I always read reviews before I buy &#x27;special&#x27; deals like this one.</li>
            <li> but they helped me find the right shade!</li>
            <li> but it is SUPER Easy and definitely worth it!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> far as the product, It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Customer Service has been amazing so far and answered all my questions.</li>
            <li> Now I am a true Luminess Air #1 FAN.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how the good the product is as I sent it back as soon as the kept charging me.</li>
            <li> If this is true it should not be shown in picture.</li>
            <li> They get into your credit card and they keep charging my card monthly and even though paid in full and program was cancelled.  </li>
            <li> But, I eventually figured out how to use the airbrush to make my skin actually look good.</li>
            <li> She was very informative, patient, and even provided her extension just in case we had any more questions.</li>
            <li> it full price from a store(if they accept returns) rather than buying it from Luminess website.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> It looks so nice and professional.  </li>
            <li> A FULL REFUND</li>
            <li> this sweet, sweet lady took the time to answer all of my questions and made me feel like my business counted to Luminess Air.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my husband is handy and he fixed it within seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a product that is Simple Simon and allows me to apply my make up quickly, while still achieving good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Mairlynn explain everything great and encouraged me to try other products.  </li>
            <li> If you go to their website, the fine print at the bottom of the first page says:  &amp;#34;All</li>
            <li> She even heard my child in the background and asked me if that was my baby which made me feel that she was helping me with my question but took a quick moment to make it personable.  </li>
            <li> I am a continued loyal customer</li>
            <li> The advertisement states in bold print &#x27;lt</li>
            <li> I felt like it was was my lucky day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for years and achieved excellent results - even with drug store foundations rather than the more upscale and expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> I hope you are lucky as I was when Toni answered the cal.  </li>
            <li> she explained all I needed to know and such a very Great personal....</li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Wanting to cover up my mild acne and blemishes, I ordered the airbrush system.  </li>
            <li> I just recently purchased my Luminous Air system, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my makeup.</li>
            <li> She was nice and was able to help me get my payments lower and not have make up sent to me every other month.</li>
            <li> She informed me that they would send me the correct light (that I ordered in the first place)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to say that she made me feel pretty  when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> So thanks to the fact that they took their sweet time (3 weeks!)</li>
            <li> After many months I just opened the new bottles they sent me</li>
            <li> Being able to give my self a new feeling of confidence with Luminess Air.</li>
            <li> When I watched the DVD it really helped me with the step by step and easy instructions.</li>
            <li> With much gratitude, and many thanks!</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say this system is G R E A T !</li>
            <li> Really like the coverage it provides....weightlessly!!  </li>
            <li> Then when you love Luminess, it‚Äôs yours for only five easy monthly payments of fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents when you order today!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Then when you love  Luminess, it‚Äôs yours for only five easy monthly payments of fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents when you order</li>
            <li> She laughed was more than pleasant, explained everything I was confused about &amp; when I was ready to buy something the pamphlet recommended she was HONEST( a very rare commodity when everyone is just worried about the bottom line &amp; she told me I didn&#x27;t really need to buy the other two bottles because the gel &amp; the shiny overcoat are already built into every color.</li>
            <li> While the concept is great it still needs a little bit a work.  </li>
            <li> Anita serviced the call calmly which gave me confidence</li>
            <li> I rarely buy things from tv</li>
            <li> It is almost fun to use if i can say that.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about Tonya and the experience I had.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the system properly is the most important step in maintaining optimal function.</li>
            <li> This makeup stays fresh all day and all night.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it for me.</li>
            <li> My mom and i liked what we saw on the commercial</li>
            <li> it is worth the price</li>
            <li> Also, not that im in any kind of hurry to have this machine in my home, it will take them regular shipping times to deliver it.</li>
            <li> Also, not that im in any kind of hurry to have this machine in my home, it will take them regular shipping times to deliver it.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In NO WAY is it worth that amount</li>
            <li> well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also impressed with the Luminess air system and although it is new to me, I am anxious to use it on a continuous basis.</li>
            <li> I also cleaned the airbrush machine exactly as it says to do so, step by step, in the quick start booklet.</li>
            <li> Thanks again to Eric and Miss Sharon for making me smile and have faith in customer service again!</li>
            <li> I realized how easy it went on my face and how flawless it looked, almost like natural beauty, after several tries.</li>
            <li> but I called customer service and received a replacement right away</li>
            <li> a $400 product that breaks just right after their \\&quot;trial period\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t get the right color to begin with</li>
            <li> Well, after I received my airbrush system from Luminess, it would not work right at all.</li>
            <li> Luminess helped me pick the right colors for her</li>
            <li> I received the system in the mail, I wanted to try it right</li>
            <li> The first few times that I tried it, the coverage wasn&#x27;t great and the color wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the way they went above and beyond to ensure that  my first experience with LuminessAir was not darkened by events of no fault of their own.</li>
            <li> and I can also say that when I&#x27;ve called in the past everyone has provided me with great service.</li>
            <li> When I started to see charges on my card and then read the fine print, I was astonished that they were going to charge nearly $400 for this system!  </li>
            <li> In very fine print, it states that if you want to return it, it has to be within 30 days of your initial PAYMENT.  </li>
            <li> (obviously it&#x27;s a little different than with brushes) but the foundation is Flawless!  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money or time on this product, you are better off using the cheap $5 makeup from stores!</li>
            <li> the sweetest young lady (Karina) which I enjoyed talking with that answered all my questions and was very knowledgable about the products.</li>
            <li> Especially because I had no knowledge how to use makeup professionally and thought I was doing a good job for myself.</li>
            <li> Using Luminess Air&#x27;s gentle spray application, putting on makeup is actually exciting and fun again, like when I was a child.</li>
            <li> Basically the girl said she didn&#x27;t believe that that was what I was told the month before so actually calling me a liar in a very backhanded kind of way.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with my order and called and talked to this very very nice lady named Leticia  (not sure just how to spell her name).  </li>
            <li> If the needle is loose the trigger will not work and the makeup will come shooting out on its own as soon as you put it</li>
            <li> especially how quickly I can get that done!!  </li>
            <li> If you spray several, light coats of make-up, and let it dry in between coats, you get a good, even, matte coverage.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Luminess air airbrush machine and a ton of their makeup about a month and a half ago, and when I ordered it I decided to purchase the warranty plan (which I strongly recommend just to be on the safe side).</li>
            <li> , at first I was a little upset but the makeup look so good on her that I didn&#x27;t mind purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Throughout the entire conversation, Eric was patient, kind, polite and highly knowledgeable.</li>
            <li> I can truly say that Tonya (and the amazing system) has made me a lifelong Luminess Air customer</li>
            <li> When I first got the Luminess Air</li>
            <li> Then all that was left to do was store it away in its cute storage case until I needed it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure her and the Luminess Air team can do the same for all Ladies.  </li>
            <li> she recommended a different type of foundation that may work better with my skin type.  </li>
            <li> I would love to buy one for all of my female family  members and friends.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s going to take several layers, but the lighter the layers, the better the outcome.</li>
            <li> The Luminess Air product does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve experienced a splatter is when I&#x27;ve gone too long without cleaning the needle.</li>
            <li> this is yours today for only $19.95 to try for 30 days with FREE Shipping!  </li>
            <li> I do have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about it as I was trying out different shades</li>
            <li> I have one of this product since the first infomercial</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial and decided to order, and to my surprise, the product was exactly like they said it would be.</li>
            <li> my self esteem is higher than ever.</li>
            <li> First speaking with Brianna and then speaking with Janae&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it for 19.95 for 30 days like the commercial said, but they push u to upgrade for 10$ more, buy a 20$ warranty, add accessories and join clubs that all costs additional money.</li>
            <li> He assured me that i would not have to pay a penny more unless i decided not to send the product back after my 30 day trial period.</li>
            <li> If u decide to purchase this product, just be aware of what they take out of your account and keep track of your money because they will practically drain it without u being aware.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said that it should be OK for me to use this product and that she totally understood my concerns.  </li>
            <li> Very understanding too!  </li>
            <li> In August of last year I saw a very enticing and attractive ad on the net.</li>
            <li> sure enough they had charged me $84 already.  </li>
            <li> this is yours today for only $19.95 to try for 30 days with FREE Shipping!&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I first opened the package, everything was neatly put together.  </li>
            <li> I realized I had to sop up the makeup I had already put in the well, which did not make me very happy because I know how expensive the refills can be.</li>
            <li> It is not necessarily faster than the method I was using before, but I do get better coverage and like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks You Nikki for making my day!</li>
            <li> First the disclaimer:  </li>
            <li> I only use two coats and my skin looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I do love using airbrush foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very costly mistake!  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was hesitant when I first heard of airbrush makeup, because f my wife being picky about stuff</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called roasia where your skin turns red, I was able to use the matt foundation to cover it up.  </li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> I had an issue with getting my correct tone at first</li>
            <li> Additionally, on a personal level, I woke to a rather challenging day</li>
            <li> before I actually tried it, When I did, it took more than one coat of the makeup to even provide any coverage.</li>
            <li> First I had seen this mentioned.</li>
            <li> when I spoke with Portia, she worked with her supervisor Sharon &amp; went above &amp; beyond rectifying the situation until I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my first time using the product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this system, I bought their nail polish system thru Livingsocial the first week of Feb.  </li>
            <li> If you have blemishes to cover, you will need to use a concealer first and then apply the airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li> First off, this product took 3 weeks to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend to my family,friends,and anyone  interested in purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as simple as described or shown - with a LOT of practice it might get better</li>
            <li> On top of this when we ordered I had paid an extra %.95 for a rush delivery and my daughter had not</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;system\\&quot; broke on the first attempt to use it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I use the blush &amp; the eye shadow too - but you need to apply those FIRST before you apply the make-up.</li>
            <li> I AM WILLING TO DO THAT</li>
            <li> Thus, by helping me identify my exact color, Eric‚Äôs taken the ‚Äúguess work‚Äù out of the ‚Äúmix‚Äù, no pun intended.</li>
            <li> would get more from a regular person that wears makeup but doesn&#x27;t do it for a career).  </li>
            <li> First of all, it took three weeks to process and ship to my house.  </li>
            <li> The first system they sent was never recieved so they shipped me another one.  </li>
            <li> she knew exactly what she was doing in customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use all of the make up that came with the first delivery.</li>
            <li> Fabulous makeup, looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service is absolutely HORRID!</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> and it would be difficult to get to the post office, and she recommended that I ask someone to do it for me and that it is the best she can offer.  </li>
            <li> the makeup adheres to peach fuzz first</li>
            <li> i never was able to accomplish a face i would go outside with,</li>
            <li> Tried only once so far, and found you have to use a lot more product than the instructions list.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely takes use to!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a decent makeup system, good makeup product, but not far and away better than other foundation options.</li>
            <li> I have had little glitches and troubles with the airbrush but each time I&#x27;ve called they&#x27;ve had a very easy, quick solution for</li>
            <li> As far as application is concerned, the instructions tell you it is better to spray lightly, let it dry</li>
            <li> I probably would do more research though the next time I purchase a system that cost that much money.</li>
            <li> In addition to all of the mess you will be charged much more than the original price of $19.99 - you will be charged $59.99 for deposit on the system for around 5 months and then $34.06 every 2 months for your makeup.  </li>
            <li> You can tell she really enjoys what she does and is very much a people person.</li>
            <li> and if that weren&#x27;t enough he also offered to send me a different type of foundation (silk) to see if that didn&#x27;t better aid in covering my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Im sure I will be a long time customer.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable what a difference a good customer service experience makes.</li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest people buy it full retail price from walgreen or drugstore etc and can return it to the store directly if you&#x27;re not satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having trouble getting my free polish and Ashley was not only a good listener</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I highly recommend the system and I am truly impressed with the Luminess Brand.</li>
            <li> The application is less than five minutes to do and you look amazing.</li>
            <li> these  2 Outstanding representatives took complete ownership  and made a very frustrating situation into a most memorable experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from watching an infomercial and after 20 minutes of making sure there were no new charges, I made the call.  </li>
            <li> However, since Luminess Air offered a trial period, I felt confident there was nothing to loose.     </li>
            <li> Big Kudos to the whole team for making all transactions easy.</li>
            <li> Cathy then offered to send me a brand new stylus, free of charge, 2-day delivery plus a few more offerings that I did not even request.  </li>
            <li> If you have wrinkles or large pores, get the minus-10 gel and the concealer; they really do help.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to talk to such a nice, positive young lady by the name of Nikki.</li>
            <li> and she was able to give me tips on how to better use the system to not accentuate the small lines in my forehead!!  </li>
            <li> Its people like you with so much patience that help Luminess coustomers feel beauitful every day.</li>
            <li> Plus, with the instruction booklet to take to the bathroom it made things so much easier.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> And note that they are very sneaky about their payment process and they will NOT notify you of anything regarding your account.&lt;br /&gt;Really?</li>
            <li> Wonder who does their reliability testing - really?</li>
            <li> I will try to keep the word out, but thanks to Amazon for letting you make an informed decision.</li>
            <li> And it is very user</li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.</li>
            <li> I had some blemishes that pop up and the luminess air system did very well to cover that</li>
            <li> Thanks Kathy/Cathy.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving company</li>
            <li> Thanks to them</li>
            <li> I had to use about 10- 12 drops to finish my whole damn face......</li>
            <li> it covered very well</li>
            <li> However, with an automatic refill every 60 days, I now have too much make-up and the caligraphy eyeliner did not seem to work</li>
            <li> She was very understanding and patient with me and answered all of my questions of the make system</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the real kicker - on the Luminess website</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the real kicker - on the Luminess website</li>
            <li> the agent was very helpful</li>
            <li> is really bad,2nd</li>
            <li> and she too was very helpful.</li>
            <li> She was very helpful explaining how to get savings from membership.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Ashley for restoring &amp; giving me hope for patience, laughter, &amp; understanding.</li>
            <li> Nowadays no one wants to go out of their way to do that...</li>
            <li> Thanks to Elizabeth and her supervisor for their help.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It should be gently pushed all the way in (about 1 inch showing) and the nuts tightened up.  </li>
            <li> how much she helped me</li>
            <li> Like REALLY ????</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really a buyer beware</li>
            <li> #2: The make-up itself has REAL staying power - it lasts until you take it off.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a much quicker &amp; cleaner way to apply make-up.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> All in all, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Chanty was very informative &amp; knowledgeable about all of their products.</li>
            <li> Luminess Air Premium System is Fabulous and Truly gives my skin the look of a movie star walking the Red Carpet!</li>
            <li> Thanks Luminess Air.</li>
            <li> I would really like to know the differences of the foundating that came with the kit vs the others.  </li>
            <li> think too much to airbrush all my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks LESZLIEE and thanks luminesss air.</li>
            <li> Thanks Cathy for all your help.</li>
            <li> She was very helpful with giving me some additional info</li>
            <li> I purchased the system about a month ago, and after experimenting with the colors and learning how to use the airbrush, I was ready to place an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then when you wash it off, you can not believe how much makeup was on your face.  </li>
            <li> and I had to call multiple times because they kept trying to charge me more frequently and then set me up for automated shipments when I specifically said I did not want to set up automated shipments.</li>
            <li> Portia in customer service was extremely courteous &amp; took the time to look into my account as I explained to her that I was having issues with the foundation feeling sticky on my face, that I had called prior &amp; trial was to be extended while following suggestions from Luminess Air.  </li>
            <li> When I phoned them to clear this up, they told me that they had to hit my account for one more charge as the makeup was still in shipping and the order could not be stopped; after being told last month that the order was already in shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have been completely ripped off and I warn you WATCH OUT!!!</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The makeup itself is wonderful, however I have spent upwards of $600 in the last 10 months due to the Air Compressor and Stylus.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOVE my new Luminess Air Professional System!!!!  </li>
            <li> tear.\\&quot; I have had to purchase a completely new stylus ($80) and it was faulty upon the first use.</li>
            <li> She was my first phone call of the new day</li>
            <li> I live in a hot humid environment, so</li>
            <li> My makeup still looks natural and the coverage is just right.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, but do to other reasons needed to cancel my membership today.</li>
            <li> Although I was not 100% satisfied and other complications happened I am thankful that Tonya helped me out with everything.</li>
            <li> I had the honor and pleasure of speaking with an extremely knowledgeable and lovely sales representative named &#x27;Angelica&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fixed a small problem and so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> I was left with either, blotchy skin that never looked quite clean, or skin that looked caked with makeup.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing and last all day long.</li>
            <li> Also the gun is simple to take apart to clean every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Within 2 minutes she had turned an unhappy customer into a VERY satisfied customer who ordered more products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How much do you normally spend on makeup?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making some changes in my professional life, and I need to look polished and to be consistent about it.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Customer Service&amp;#34; has gone out the window with the age of new technology, but she took care of me!  </li>
            <li> The machine is fine although the stylus trigger will become loose a lot and the needle clogs.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it--I discovered it is classic misleading marketing.</li>
            <li> As I get older am having some skin issues and found myself with questions about the products and application.  </li>
            <li> The light was not attached and loose in the compartment.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking from a managerial perspective, I highly recommend Lakesha for promotion and a pay compensation for her performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s widely advertised as $19.95 but - we discovered - in the fine print they charge you over $300.  </li>
            <li> I then started to get a little confident and put some of the liquid blush into the well of the airbrush.</li>
            <li> Complete scam!!</li>
            <li> I have not tried other brands, but strongly believe using another brand&#x27;s water based airbrush make up would not harm the system.   </li>
            <li> I recently called customer service as well to purchase other products and to see what was new and their customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 yrs old and really wasn&#x27;t expecting anyone but me to notice</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, but they were experienced with airbrushing.</li>
            <li> This is a SCAM as far as I am concerned and it is very upsetting.</li>
            <li> Thanks, not getting one, I will keep my old face.</li>
            <li> far, I would say that I really like the Luminess Air System.  </li>
            <li> if i added more makeup to my blemishes then my face would look uneven and blotchy.</li>
            <li> It takes some time overall, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> and then once they answer they have all the excuses of why they didn&#x27;t return your whole first payment when you only had the product for 3 days.</li>
            <li> (I suspect because it&#x27;s really only worth about $100).  </li>
            <li> She introduced me to other reasonably priced Luminess products that would resolve my objectives of (1) getting even coverage (Eraser), and (2) how to clean the equipment (TipTop</li>
            <li> While at this time in life this system is not right for me, Merilyn, one of the CS employees made my return easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was VERY anxious to try this system but decided to check the reviews first - and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> because as I said earlier, this was a brand new system and had never worked right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful that she let me know about products that are currently on sale; she arranged to give me a one-time courtesy discount after I misunderstood the price of a particular item; and she also arranged for me to receive a very generous discount on the Luminess airbrush itself!  </li>
            <li> She was extremely helpful, knowledgable, cheerful and understanding.</li>
            <li> for the actual product.. At first it was a lot of fun experimenting with the different products..</li>
            <li> My machine still works like new.  </li>
            <li> I am new to Luminess Air</li>
            <li> but I am new to using it.  </li>
            <li> and she would have a new one sent at no charge.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a new makeup try..  </li>
            <li> I am a new customer and had questions that I wanted answered and she took the time to go over all information regarding my questions  </li>
            <li> And, because of her upbeat attitude and helpfulness, you now have a new, permanent customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got my new Luminess air make up today and.</li>
            <li> She heard my concerns and directed me to new products which I look forward to using.</li>
            <li> So I was dreading to have to call Luminess air and having to explain to them what was going on and having to ask them if they would send me a new one because I have the warranty plan.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive an email with all of the details showing my new balance but never rec&#x27;d it.</li>
            <li> they are more apt to take the time to whip out their computers and vent their anger.  </li>
            <li> I spent 20 minutes trying to clean the machine, AGAIN, and eventually got it towork.</li>
            <li> If your skin is oily and moisturizer is not part of your regular regime substitute with a few drops of warm water.</li>
            <li> I cannot thank Ashley enough for breaking it all down &amp; helping me to get the two free bottles I couldn&#x27;t seem to get quite right.</li>
            <li> gave me a very natural coverage</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My dealings with LuminessAir was very professional</li>
            <li> I recommend this system to anyone who wants minimal to full coverage and wants to take the time to learn (by practicing) how to apply the airbrush makeup properly and also doesn&#x27;t mind taking care of the equipment.</li>
            <li> Months ago my trigger started acting up and procrastinating me took till today to call and get ready to bitch up and complain!</li>
            <li> Keisha WOW!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money or dollars!...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am completely amazed!</li>
            <li> but I have to say that I am completely amazed!</li>
            <li> and now she has more time and finishes faster than usual because of luminess....</li>
            <li> Natural as your gonna get!</li>
            <li> Manny even said &amp;#34;I completely understand your frustration and I am on your side!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I usually never comment when I am dissatisfied with a product</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,  TIME, AND NERVES!</li>
            <li> On top of the broken light, the polishes and remover are TINY!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the makeup goes - I do like it, but I&#x27;m not totally convinced that it&#x27;s a lot better than other foundations.  </li>
            <li> I have just ordered a new system for work and am keeping my old one for home use.</li>
            <li> my 3 year old daughter was laughing at me every time that i came out with a new shade trying to match my face.  </li>
            <li> next morning I woke up to go through my normal getting ready routine.</li>
            <li> I am in love and don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to other foundations!</li>
            <li> He not only resolved my technical issue, he also helped me identify the right color for my particular skin tone.</li>
            <li> It will make a huge mess in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> The stylus kept clogging so much that I purchased a new one, only to have it happen again and again, even after taking the thing apart and cleaning it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I tried Luminess Air, trial product with a stylus, thinking paying only less than $30 is worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> It got here so fast, was about $150 cheaper than Luminess terrible product, &amp; worked SO good, it was so easy!</li>
            <li> and she said that the web site clearly states on further payment unless customer returns within a certain number of days, 30 days??  </li>
            <li> I set the system on the highest speed to apply the foundation because the other speeds do not provide adequate power; there is a hesitation.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look so clear.</li>
            <li> you clean the gun properly, don&#x27;t half ass or rush.</li>
            <li> She spoke clearly &amp; with confidence.  </li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged early on.</li>
            <li> She is a professional makeup artist and loves the set.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have gotten several compliments that my skin looks very even.</li>
            <li> and I had surprised bills then had to figure things out.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> WOW.......</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> WOW.......</li>
            <li> Luminess offers a 30 day trial offer  if ordered from TV of course you are charged a non-refundable fee of $30.00.</li>
            <li> I apply it where it is absolutely necessary and, depending on how much sleep</li>
            <li> I got so busy</li>
            <li> I  am well respected professional and my payment record has been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SHE WAS EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND WELL EDUCATED IN PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE.</li>
            <li> I surprised my wife with the Luminess Airbrush system she had been wanting for her birthday.</li>
            <li> My machine does clog but it is absolutely vital</li>
            <li> I was adamant that I was NOT going to get talked into keeping it.</li>
            <li> AND THE KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON, A YOUNG LADY &amp;#34; TONI OR TONY WHO ASSISTED ME TO DAY</li>
            <li> Karen Young</li>
            <li> I will take this as far as I have to.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my 12 year old son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> That makes the spray change considerably so use this to adjust the flow and size of your brush.  </li>
            <li> (also some screw bits to tighten there) and stick out too far.  </li>
            <li> They are into us so far for around $300.00.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> far as the Luminess products go, so far they are all in the trash as we waited \\&quot;too long\\&quot; to request a return authorization (RA).  </li>
            <li> #1: It gives you completely even make-up coverage - after you get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the cheap plastic bottles that store the products break and leaks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve watched one You-tube video (but the lady doing it was a professional makeup artist -</li>
            <li> I spoke with Porsha and she was so professional.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to send your procduct back if was not for her sales experience and kindness.</li>
            <li> I told them I don&#x27;t think I will need it that frequently</li>
            <li> Throughout the conversation, Cathy was patient, professional and knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li> is busy on the phone now</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> With my busy work schedule, I have not even had time to try the product.</li>
            <li> if you have questions my sister went from being insecure about her skin to now having a gorgeous personality</li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries to get the right coloring but after some trial and error</li>
            <li> and they charge your account a first payment right away even though they&#x27;re supposed to give you 30-Days and even though they will tell you it will be reimbursed you would only get half of that</li>
            <li> I take a little time and clean it piece by piece.</li>
            <li> I spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials, reviews, and troubleshooting videos telling me to clean it &amp; showing me how to do so.</li>
            <li> the ‚Äúfine small print‚Äù stating they will charge your CC: ~5 payments&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply, it only take a few minutes to apply, and your make up looks natural.  </li>
            <li> [Clever, too, how they put the actual cost in words instead of numbers.]</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I saw the women on tv that were older like me and it made under the eyes look so much younger.</li>
            <li> Second, the back end of the brush (the part with the sticker on it that says watch DVD first) screws off and inside</li>
            <li> I waited a mere minute to speak with Anita over the phone and have been treated with exceptional service.  </li>
            <li> She not only assisted me in proper use which resulted in my final decision to keep the product, but also confirmed the billing and explained the future billing.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend Luminess Air to everyone for personal and business use..</li>
            <li> and, if greater coverage is needed, to apply another new thin layer.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the Air Stylus, and makeup removal towelettes, all in a cute Black and Pink carrying</li>
            <li> Just buff clean, dry &amp; in 60 seconds, polish is dry, no air bubbles,</li>
            <li> If you‚Äôre interested in trying a new way to apply makeup and have the time to sit down with it, read the manual, and watch the DVD‚Ä¶.I</li>
            <li> I was really expecting some long sales pitch, but she understood.</li>
            <li> and I know that when my life gets back to normal</li>
            <li> Easy application  hardly feels like anything is on your face.</li>
            <li> and she is sending me new colors as the ones that come in the initial kit</li>
            <li> but that I would need to send the one I have back to them in the packaging of the new unit they will send.  </li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t follow instructions exactly right down to the size that the return authorization numbers should be on the front of the box</li>
            <li> I bashed a major appliance manufacturer and let me tell you, my satisfaction was off the charts.  </li>
            <li> I AM GOING TO REPORT THEM TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND EVEN FIND AN ATTORNEY TO FILE A SMALL CLAIM COURT PETITION !!</li>
            <li> Its totally not worth it now because i cant afford to have all the \\&quot;6 easy payments of 59.99\\&quot; taken out within days of each other.</li>
            <li> Thank you Ashley for restoring my faith in customer service because I was losing a lot of hope for &amp;#34;customer service in general &amp; was not handled by a computer.</li>
            <li> (If that is still too frequent, she said to just call back</li>
            <li> Since I have purchased the system I have not went back to my old foundation.</li>
            <li> I am a professional artist and don&#x27;t plan on ever using regular liquid foundation on my clients again.</li>
            <li> It was apparent....</li>
            <li> Apparently, when you buy a system from luminess you are required to join their club where they send you make up automatically and charge your credit card.  </li>
            <li> Well, needless to say on the line was a kind voice named Eric.</li>
            <li> I was confused about more than one thing and</li>
            <li> I learned that Manny is new and just started working there not to long ago.</li>
            <li> On top of that it was less expensive, they seem to have a MUCH wider selection of colors and they have a TON of other cool things/ways to use the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the wand not working right</li>
            <li> i think this one makes my face look shiny (but I normally have dry skin -</li>
            <li> a general viewpoint they&#x27;re FRAUD; because they clearly state that they&#x27;ll refund your money if you don&#x27;t like it; but that refers to any additional amount you pay after the trial period, but at the same time you won&#x27;t get the initial money you paid for the product.</li>
            <li> A professional taught me an invaluable trick:  Only apply foundation where necessary!</li>
            <li> It is going back and if they choose not to accept this item back then it will be in mail limbo as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> And on top of that, their \\&quot;30-day risk free trial\\&quot; is a bunch of crap.  </li>
            <li> The application is simple enough, but customer service is always super helpful when I&#x27;ve needed a little extra direction with my system.  </li>
            <li> The machine is constantly breaking and the parts that break are not covered under warranty because they are considered \\&quot;general wear and</li>
            <li> She was understanding, professional, personable, knowledgeable and above all she actually cared about what I had to say and went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews first before I wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I had to redo my face the first couple of times but after a few days I got a hang of it.</li>
            <li> My luminess air system gets used about once a month, which I thought was weird that it started clogging all the time even though I clean it really well after each use.  </li>
            <li> Not only do the products do just what they claim to do but the customer service I received was over and beyond what I expected and normally receive from others these days.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are plastic and break easily and also upon ordering, or come already broken.</li>
            <li> At first I felt it was hardly covering</li>
            <li> I am just your average consumer, not a makeup artist or professional cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure I can afford to stay, but I do know that thanks to Jose</li>
            <li> Applying foundation the traditional way did not completely cover those areas without looking caked on.</li>
            <li> something new might seem a little nerve racking</li>
            <li> These machines are extremely high priced and work off of the same idea as a small compressor you buy to air up your car tires and plugs into your cigarette lighter.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, they had sent the lesser version of the LED light, which was broken!  </li>
            <li> The makeup is super thin and even tho the directions said to use 4-8 drops, i would end up using 20+ drops.</li>
            <li> it is after 30 days&amp;#34;) and could care less if you write a Review!!!</li>
            <li> but the employees are rude and very unhelpful.  </li>
            <li> I have called them at least 3 times attempting to cancel the whole deal.  </li>
            <li> They sent me out the two correct color eye shadows free of charge - and I got to keep the two wrong colors.</li>
            <li> instead I got Jose who not only met my expectations but far exceeded any customer service rep I have dealt with in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was using the samples for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a way to create the look I have wanted for a long time.</li>
            <li> my hour long make up routine into just 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> you will see a long needle.  </li>
            <li> I am not really rating their equipment or their machine as I am not yet proficient enough to make a review.</li>
            <li> FOR IT WAS SO LONG AGO.</li>
            <li> I squeezed the trigger a little too hard the first couple passes!</li>
            <li> For me, I had never used airbrush before and using airbrush is such a difference than any other makeup I had used.</li>
            <li> Not only will it be cost you a ton of money - you have to buy the system, which needs to be taken apart and fixed on a regular basis - but the cost of the actual makeup is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> It does not rub off on your clothes after its dry.</li>
            <li> Cynthia uses this product and, when asked, stated that if you have oily skin, use the matte finish; if dry skin, use Silk or Satin; and if combination skin, use Ultra.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use the makeup because the unit doesn&#x27;t work, have so much unused makeup that it is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> , the foundation is not what I was used to, I always had a cream foundation and even the mineral powders so using something that appears so thin did seem strange at first.</li>
            <li> After a few swipes, I definitely looked like a porcelain doll with red cheeks that were a bit too rosy.</li>
            <li> The make up they sent wasn&#x27;t dark enough</li>
            <li> After I paid 30 dollars for shipping for the broken, junk machine they sent me at first.</li>
            <li> After I paid 30 dollars for shipping for the broken, junk machine they sent me at first.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced Luminess ripping me off money which I did not consent to in the first place.  </li>
            <li> This can come loose</li>
            <li> but, no matter what, I would end up with exaggerated fine lines, pores, too dark and cakey looking coverage.  </li>
            <li> so for my birthday i finally broke down and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I am cancelling this account and highly DO NOT RECOMMEND LUMINESS AIR.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was a little bummed.</li>
            <li> LETS ALL STOP THIS BAD ADVERSISEMENT AND PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS OK LADYS</li>
            <li> I was so shocked and pleased</li>
            <li> So far for $300.00 it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of small claims but after this it will be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I called and had absolutely no problem with customer service.</li>
            <li> My skin has occasional blemishes and uneven tone.</li>
            <li> The needle needs cleaning after approximately every three uses, but depends on how much make up I use.</li>
            <li> It feels like you have absolutely no makeup on</li>
            <li> When I called I expected to berated and berated into keeping the machine...</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order your Luminess Air Starter Kit.</li>
            <li> While the makeup does what it says it will, do not buy this unless you have thousands to spent on makeup each year.</li>
            <li> All together I spent about $165.</li>
            <li> Which of course I did NOT receive my discount, just got charged the $29.95 monthly fee + the shipping fee for the makeup refills, which was expected.</li>
            <li> Thank you to all who spent the time and energy posting your experiences.  </li>
            <li> and she took the time to make me laugh and turned my otherwise questionable day into a day that is now going to be with a smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT AM REALLY NOT GETTING ANYWHERE</li>
            <li> Am so tired of getting ready to put makeup on for work and then having to scramble because my system won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Just a few words can&#x27;t describe the way Helga and April went above and beyond to create a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> The customer service is absolutely the most dreadful process ever.</li>
            <li> The spring handle area doesn&#x27;t work, so I have to take it apart and put it back together not just every single use to get it to work but half way through a use, otherwise it just is limp and doesn&#x27;t spray any foundation at all.  </li>
            <li> Not only did they send me the less expensive version of the light, but it arrived broken, and then they want me to run an extra errand and pay to have their mistake returned to them.  </li>
            <li> I have never used any other airbrush system</li>
            <li> Sorry for the lengthy information, but hope it helps anyone who is interested in trying an airbrush system.</li>
            <li> I hope you have read all the other reviews you had here and avoid getting into this.</li>
            <li> and when I put it on in the mornings it stays on all day unlike other makeups I have tried.</li>
            <li> The application takes no longer than applying other makeup.  </li>
            <li> She said she is waiving 3 payments for me due to being out of work</li>
            <li> I have spent over$300.00 on !@#$%.</li>
            <li> I wanted to let you know that I called customer service because of a billing issue that occur due to my fault.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that they didn&#x27;t tell me that I had to figure out is that they set up a plan for you to pay for makeup monthly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some of you can utilize this depending on your complexion and other issues.</li>
            <li> and they have no remorse, are not willing to reimburse you if you do not like the product (&amp;#34;because</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t stop now, small claims court will have to be the next step.  </li>
            <li> THEY DID NOT THEN JUST THE OTHER DAY SEPT.5TH OR</li>
            <li> I choose to rate for I also want to know how other&#x27;s feel as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have acne problems and any other</li>
            <li> I will never wear any other make up again.</li>
            <li> i figured it was a small investment to finally see if the system worked as i dreamed and imagined it would.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way the makeup looked and felt on my skin, but the actual unit &amp; stylus are awful.  </li>
            <li> Paperwork informed me that if I didn&#x27;t pay or refused item that I would be subject to restocking fee, other fees, maybe lawyer fees, on and on.</li>
            <li> i was flabberghasted that i had to not turn into super witch and be mad.</li>
            <li> I have called at least 3 times to cancel and sent numerous e-mails.  </li>
            <li> I called to get help with my issue, I have really drawn eyes underneath from years of suffering with chronic pain, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I almost did not buy the System because of the negative reviews but finally decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li> Luminess just cleans it up and sends it out to the next sucker.</li>
            <li> This same complaint happened to me today.</li>
            <li> This is an average airbrush system with a hefty price.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have some hyper pigmentation and blemishes and if I applied enough to get the coverage I wanted it would end up looking cakey and thick</li>
            <li> I CALLED IN TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ENDED UP SPEAKING WITH A TIFFNY WHO EXPLAINED AND BROKE EVERYTHING DOWN TO ME AND MY MOTHER.</li>
            <li> Unlike all the other warranty&#x27;s who beat around the bush and come up with a million reasons why their warranty doesn&#x27;t cover that problem (even though you paid for the warranty!)</li>
            <li> The application products are quite costly and half of it spills down the sink because the bottles leak while you are using them.</li>
            <li> Lots of hidden fees.</li>
            <li> and it arrived in less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have never used an air brush makeup system and typically stick to using a spot concealer and a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I never want to see another Luminess product again, much less pay for one.</li>
            <li> I never want to see another Luminess product again, much less pay for one.</li>
            <li> please target has it for less</li>
            <li> The phone call was less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t remember that I had also signed up for an every two month additional refill (the price is so much less thru the club).</li>
            <li> I read numerous reviews, some good some bad, but the majority were bad.</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews are true.</li>
            <li> I also had trouble matching the colors to my skin and when the color seemed to match with a test it would look way too dark with the finished look and the lighter colors would look blotchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> strongly advise anybody contemplating dealing with these guys to reconsider and save yourself a lot of grief.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was skeptical because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe how little it takes to cover my complexion.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money!</li>
            <li> and she even got me the  system a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral of the story, I test the machine each morning with a little water in the sprayer before I put 6 drops of foundation in the well.</li>
            <li> I have had my luminess air system for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I was not able to get these results from other makeup..</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH the product!</li>
            <li> It is terribly ineffective and the makeup is very substandard!!!!!</li>
            <li> It will all be going back to them, but I&#x27;m sitll out a lot of $$ for a product and company that overall just SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Cannot express enough my frustration and wasted money and time!!!</li>
            <li> I stupidly fell for the commercial and bought the whole system.  </li>
            <li> I received a package with more foundation and a charge to my credit card and was confused and frustrated.</li>
            <li> but if you really want to hit them where it hurts, go to their Facebook page and lay it out cold.</li>
            <li> but I noticed the foundation &#x27;set&#x27; on my skin after a few minutes and by the time i leave for work i feel i look polished.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I explained to Eric my situation and he trouble shooted with me a bit but to no avail it still didnt work.</li>
            <li> Here are a few tips if you&#x27;ve got problem skin, as I do.</li>
            <li> The few Times I&#x27;ve slept in the makeup has proven this theory.</li>
            <li> I called customer service to inquire about a few questions I had.</li>
            <li> By any means save yourself from the trouble and hassle it takes to get anything done with Luminess Air company.</li>
            <li> My advice don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> TO FEEL AS THO YOU ARE WEARING DRIED PASTE GLUE.</li>
            <li> The narrow brush would not refill with additional eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> She put me on hold for a few minutes</li>
            <li> , I kept forgetting to return it and ended up missing the 30 day mark...</li>
            <li> and  don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> had a few questions...</li>
            <li> If you apply them AFTER you apply the make-up - they are too harsh &amp; looked caked on.</li>
            <li> I was extremely careful and delicate with the the machine.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but it has an additional part which does not fit my machine.  </li>
            <li> and I had an orange glow after it dried.  </li>
            <li> Dinair has a citrus airbrush cleaner that you can use to maintain the system as well as additional tools, i.e., a docking jar, rinse jars and cleaner brushes, to name a few.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of that, I expressed my frustration.  </li>
            <li> SUCH FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> SUCH FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> it took too long to put on, looked horrible and wiped right off with tissue!!  </li>
            <li> As I was taking the needle out ever so carefully, the little piece behind the spray lever just...fell out.</li>
            <li> this was a huge disappointment and seems illegal.  </li>
            <li> Please ignore all the other reviewers who denigrate Customer Service!!!  </li>
            <li> Please ignore all the other reviewers who denigrate Customer Service!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to try the Lunminess system.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was skeptical about purchasing their product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> The con of this system is the foundation bottle is small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My wedding was this past weekend, the make up artist use the luminess air make up system... for my luck</li>
            <li> A WASTE OF $149!</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm not really sure how to comment on that, as I know mine was purchased from the Luminess Air website.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was not able to breathe.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, money, or effort!</li>
            <li> Save yourself from all this trouble!</li>
            <li> and she said they are going to continue to take out the payments of $59.99 all because I was a few days late in returning it.</li>
            <li> This system does not work, it is the worst product you can purchase , I got so many pimples and did not like the way it looked on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its is SOOOOOO expensive all told -- about $400 (which they don&#x27;t say in the commercial).  </li>
            <li> - you can go online and buy a countertop air compressor (usually marketed for nail art) and air brush for about $100.  </li>
            <li> it was past the 30 days.</li>
            <li> OPENED THE BOX YESTERDAY AND FOUND THE GREEN PACKING SLIP!</li>
            <li> Ordering the makeup is a revolving circle where your not sure if your order goes through for a while.</li>
            <li> It was A NASTY email in which they told me that if I did not pay within 48 hours, I would not be able to purchase a house, car or obtain credit.</li>
            <li> the makeup vials are extremely small.  </li>
            <li> makeup is very heavy.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worse to see these true disappointed reviews.</li>
            <li> And it is impossible to match to your natural skin tone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what people mean when they say it is so lightweight</li>
            <li> The makeup is horrible quality and would never last a normal person all day.  </li>
            <li> If the makeup is looking blotchy, you&#x27;re either pulling too hard on the trigger, too close to your face, or both.</li>
            <li> , THEY ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND THEY ARE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE HEAD</li>
            <li> I just want to say thank you for all of your hard work.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked it lately to see if any complaints have been filed</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re confusing and misleading the customers with their scam commercials.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the lady was so unhelpful and RUDE.</li>
            <li> they basically told me that sucks your out of luck and there is nothing they could do about it.</li>
            <li> but that is NOT my complaint.</li>
            <li> My complaint is with the company service.</li>
            <li> ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this review on a complaint website.</li>
            <li> and I even tried the blush (which somehow i screwed up on the placement on one cheek - but was running late for work</li>
            <li> I didnt think Id like it because of all the negative reviews Ive read up on.  </li>
            <li> I think it maybe too thick</li>
            <li> I ordered this and they are rude and mean....</li>
            <li> No more infomercial purchases for me!</li>
            <li> anyone out there having serious doubts about buying this product, I say go for it, but beware the retailer you are purchasing it from.</li>
            <li> The billing was a ridiculous process</li>
            <li> she takes her work seriously &amp; loves what she does.  </li>
            <li> The reason I want to ensure you are aware of: if you order this online through their website: [...] - this is a $$$ 400 dollar product!.</li>
            <li> Multiple people who had used the Dinair airbrushing system told me that this had to be defective or either a really bad system.</li>
            <li> Still does me no good.</li>
            <li> HATED the bronzer as well was way to golden and resulted in a weird splotchy looking gold marks.</li>
            <li> the terms &amp; conditions mean I agree to pay $69.99 a month for 5 months!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!!</li>
            <li> I do agree customer service is a little cold</li>
            <li> and I wont even get back all my money I paid for a stupid trail.</li>
            <li> I was not happy and spoke to the company aout returning the machine for a refund.</li>
            <li> Further, to match my complexion I use 4 drops of No. 2 and 2 drops of No. 3 make-up base.  </li>
            <li> Well, the customer service at Luminess is even worse than their products...</li>
            <li> Well, the customer service at Luminess is even worse than their products...</li>
            <li> no damage to the nail underneath &amp; it works for all the ladies with thin week nails it doesn&#x27;t have to stay that way.</li>
            <li> When it did arrive it was broken.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all with Luminesse Air</li>
            <li> My make up came in a flimsy bag and one of the liquid bottles was broken.  </li>
            <li> The compressor was broken when we tried to start the program.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse when I checked my bank account they had already taken out a payment</li>
            <li> This is a false advertising company.</li>
            <li> false advertising</li>
            <li> but this time sadly my airbrush machine wasn&#x27;t working properly &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This time my eyeshadow didn&#x27;t look like i was \\&quot;trying\\&quot; for the dramatic look during the day</li>
            <li> I was afraid to call after I read some reviews that people complained about their service</li>
            <li> inconvenient to say the least)</li>
            <li> Then when I finally got it I tried it and hated it.</li>
            <li> Just buy one and the make up separately, then you don&#x27;t have to buy this terribly over priced system and deal with this company&#x27;s apparent sneaky tactics.</li>
            <li> I purchase Luminess Air through a Groupon deal and I am very disappointed in the way the company repeatedly charged my credit card when it was only suppose to be a one time deal.</li>
            <li> the Luminess Air Family.&lt;br /&gt;Denize M. Shy</li>
            <li> I got the system and began to use it and needless to say I did not have any adverse reactions to it.  </li>
            <li> Based on the price of the machine, I unfortunately had to call to get an RA #</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I guess this isn‚Äôt a product you can just rub off it</li>
            <li> Who would want to just get another one of these terrible things and have the same problems?</li>
            <li> Who would want to just get another one of these terrible things and have the same problems?</li>
            <li> AND I WAS SKEPTICAL</li>
            <li> had called to get an RA number to return the product as I felt it was too expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have come across a hardship</li>
            <li> I ordered an \\&quot;eye shadow duo\\&quot; and they sent me the wrong colors.</li>
            <li> THE WORST FINANCIAL MISTAKE</li>
            <li> #%$$$$$$$ COMPLETELY ILLEGAL.</li>
            <li> They have sent me random products and said I didn&#x27;t opt out so that that means I agreed.</li>
            <li> is that the shade is wrong.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING !</li>
            <li> worst purchase i have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> The instructions for cleaning the machine are poor, and really bad to follow.</li>
            <li> sticky, uncomfortable and looks just bad.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would have a problem today</li>
            <li> I got this system as a gift for Christmas and was completely unhappy with the results both times i tried it.  </li>
            <li> It is a dirty shame</li>
            <li> I am out $104.05 on erroneous billing from Luminess without my consent!  </li>
            <li> their a rip off and FALSE advertisement!!</li>
            <li> They make the experience so unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I called and spoke with Kathy/Cathy( didn&#x27;t think to ask how she spelled it, my bad)</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the customer service.</li>
            <li> horribly noisy, messy, and ineffective and their makeup products are perhaps the worst you have ever tried.</li>
            <li> horrible product, horrible service, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to use it I was disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> In addition they have the worst customer service, horrible rude employees.</li>
            <li> This is a worthless system and makeup.</li>
            <li> Then I email customer service who treats me like an idiot and tells me to do what I&#x27;m already doing, then tells me to call customer service which tells me there is nothing they can do.  </li>
            <li> hope this note spares somebody the grief we are dealing with.  </li>
            <li> DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE AND HORRIBLE SELFISH ARROGANT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  </li>
            <li> My bad!  </li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed in this company.  </li>

            <li> The product is horrible and doesn&#x27;t cover at all</li>
            <li> I called the company today and got a nasty woman who, after giving me an RA number, I asked if she had anything to say about their business practice.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product. It worked nothing like the commercial portrayed and the equipment was faulty. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> While at this time in life this system is not right for me, Merilyn, one of the CS employees made my return easy.  She was kind and understanding.  I was expecting to be bullied and instead she tried to help me understand that there are ways to fix my problem and I know that when my life gets back to normal I WILL be wearing Luminess Air.</li>
            <li> I saw the informercial on tv and after a while I decided to try purchase the luminess. I rarely buy things from tv but it looked like it might be good to use. It did take a while to get to me but when it did I read the directions and watched the dvd. It was informative but I still had questions I went to u tube and they have a bunch of tutorial you can watch. It takes some getting used to, the foundation is not what I was used to, I always had a cream foundation and even the mineral powders so using something that appears so thin did seem strange at first. It took a couple of tries to get the right coloring but after some trial and error I did find the perfect combo for my skin. I use the primer as well I feel it sets the skin nicely before the makeup goes on. I found for me the lighter touch works well. At first I felt it was hardly covering but I noticed the foundation &#x27;set&#x27; on my skin after a few minutes and by the time i leave for work i feel i look polished.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how little it takes to cover my complexion.After many months I just opened the new bottles they sent me I was using the samples for a long time. My luminess did conk out on me after about 2 weeks but I called customer service and received a replacement right away I was afraid to call after I read some reviews that people complained about their service (had I read those reviews before I would never have bought the product) but I called and had absolutely no problem with customer service. They were helpful, polite and attentive. Every time i&#x27;ve called them they&#x27;ve been great. I get comments from people all the time about how good my skin looks. I&#x27;m 50 yrs old and really wasn&#x27;t expecting anyone but me to notice but they have. All in all it does take some getting used to but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It is almost fun to use if i can say that. I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> My favorites is the Bronzer and Primer products.I model professionally and my skin tones always change during the seasons, I love the how you can mix shades to make the perfect blend. Also, the gentleman, Jose had OUTSTANDING customer service and took care of everything i needed.</li>
            <li> I really love their makeup.</li>
            <li> This product worked for 2 months and then stopped working.  This problem also happened with my sister.  I called the company and they  could do nothing for me or my sister.  What kind of customer service is that!  Beware it will sooner or later stop working for you too.</li>
            <li> Thank you Porsha, I love my Luminess system package. You have been so great with helping me with all my purchases. Its people like you with so much patience that help Luminess coustomers feel beauitful every day. I give you ,,,5 times 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Johanna Stokes</li>
            <li> When I first got the Luminess Air I just had to give it a try. When I watched the DVD it really helped me with the step by step and easy instructions. Plus, with the instruction booklet to take to the bathroom it made things so much easier. While using it I realized how easy it went on my face and how flawless it looked, almost like natural beauty, after several tries. Along with the cleanup super easy. Then all that was left to do was store it away in its cute storage case until I needed it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a super easy, fast and flawless way to apply your make-up or even do your spray tans at home then you will want to check out the Luminess Air. After you try this it will be your baby!</li>
            <li> This is a worthless system and makeup. I have blemishes that i wanted covered up and this does not cover up at all, if i added more makeup to my blemishes then my face would look uneven and blotchy. The makeup is super thin and even tho the directions said to use 4-8 drops, i would end up using 20+ drops. Dont waste your money or time on this product, you are better off using the cheap $5 makeup from stores!</li>
            <li> I loved the customer service that I got from Porsha at Luminess Air.  I&#x27;m super excited to say that she made me feel pretty  when I placed my order. This is a way to create the look I have wanted for a long time. Being able to give my self a new feeling of confidence with Luminess Air. To those who have not tried it, stop waiting and place your order. Porsha gave my the right tone or shade of make-up to make my skin look beautiful and I&#x27;m sure her and the Luminess Air team can do the same for all Ladies.  Thanks Again</li>
            <li> For starters I have to say that I LOVE the Luminess Air system and products. I have never used any other airbrush system and I honestly don&#x27;t care to. The system and the products truly speak for themselves, I bought the the starter system a couple of months ago and since then every time I go out people say &amp;#34;Wow! you look great, did you do something different?!&amp;#34;. Beyond the amazing products what truly impressed me was the level of customer service I received when I called them for help. I was helped by Tonya W. who I must say is hands down the best customer service representative I have ever spoken to and she truly made my day by making the experience so enjoyable. She was understanding, professional, personable, knowledgeable and above all she actually cared about what I had to say and went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me. It is unbelievable what a difference a good customer service experience makes. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about Tonya and the experience I had. I can truly say that Tonya (and the amazing system) has made me a lifelong Luminess Air customer and I actually look forward to having to order again! Needless to say, I highly recommend the system and I am truly impressed with the Luminess Brand.</li>
            <li> I just started using Luminess Air the best product that I have used so far.  I would recommend this to all of my friends and their customer service is great.</li>
            <li> I bought the Luminess Air system in November and I am very happy with it. I received a package with more foundation and a charge to my credit card and was confused and frustrated. I called the number on the invoice to get further information and find out how to return the products.  I spoke with Katelyn and she took time to explain a &amp;#34;member club&amp;#34; that I was enrolled in (I didn&#x27;t know I was in a club). She provided details on the benefits how I could order additional products at a discount rate and change the frequency and amount of makeup I would receive.  Through further conversation about my skin etc.. she recommended a different type of foundation that may work better with my skin type.  She is sending me a courtesy sample so I can try it.  Katelyn&#x27;s customer service was excellent, she went above and beyond, had patience, provided insight to the system and different types of foundation, and was very pleasant.  She turned an upset customer into a happy informed customer and I greatly appreciate it!</li>
            <li> hello out there luminess people! My name is Tammy Opalenik and i wanted to write about my wonderful experience in customer service today! I had received the Luminess system from my aunt as a gift! I LOVE IT!!!! Months ago my trigger started acting up and procrastinating me took till today to call and get ready to bitch up and complain! Well, needless to say on the line was a kind voice named Eric. I explained to Eric my situation and he trouble shooted with me a bit but to no avail it still didnt work. Eric says, &amp;#34;we&#x27;ll just send u out a replacement gun&amp;#34; WHA WHA WHAAAAAAAAAAAT? i was flabberghasted that i had to not turn into super witch and be mad. Eric put me at ease and he was so kind and generous! I asked Eric if i could speak to a supervisor because in the world today, people are so quick to critisize and never to compliment someones actions! Eric sends me to MISS SHARON (hi doll) and she was super kind as well! you must be a wonderful company  to work for to have such excellent employees who stand behind their product and guarantee it. i am super impressed. Just thought you should know. Thanks again to Eric and Miss Sharon for making me smile and have faith in customer service again! God bless you all!</li>
            <li> I always read reviews before I buy &#x27;special&#x27; deals like this one. I&#x27;ll definitely pass. Thank you all for taking the time to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> I used it and my husband said &amp;#34;You look 10 years younger&amp;#34;. Easy to use. I would love to buy one for all of my female family  members and friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Initially, I was a little bummed. I have moderate acne and very oily skin. The first few times that I tried it, the coverage wasn&#x27;t great and the color wasn&#x27;t right. I just needed some practice. Now that I&#x27;ve got it down, this was the best makeup investment I&#x27;ve every made. Here are a few tips if you&#x27;ve got problem skin, as I do. If the makeup is looking blotchy, you&#x27;re either pulling too hard on the trigger, too close to your face, or both. Pull VERY lightly and keep your hand about 8 inches from your face. I also got the water proof sealant and layer it between colors to keep the oil from my skin from messing up my look. GET THE POWDER. It helps to set the makeup and keep you from looking shiny. If you have wrinkles or large pores, get the minus-10 gel and the concealer; they really do help. Also, it&#x27;s going to take several layers, but the lighter the layers, the better the outcome. I really only use about 10 drops. Finally, if you are in between colors, start with the lighter shade that you are closest to and use that to get the coverage that you want. Then go over it lightly with the darker shade until you reach the correct color. It takes some time overall, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. I get compliments now on my skin and that&#x27;s never happened for me before. Don&#x27;t be discouraged early on. Just keep practicing and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I would like to comend Porsha on her great customer service and I also love the makeup it is great I will continue to be a&lt;br /&gt;loyal customer to Luminess Air</li>
            <li> Keisha WOW! what a wonderful surprise to call a company and be welcomed on the phone by someone who seemed excited to anticipate what she could help me with.  It was so refreshing! She even heard my child in the background and asked me if that was my baby which made me feel that she was helping me with my question but took a quick moment to make it personable.  So, Thank you Keisha for making what i was expecting to be just another call on my list of to do&#x27;s to a call that made me appreciate the company for hiring you and that you as an employee are using your people skills to make someone (me) feel better after i hang up.  I have been a customer since 4/2009</li>
            <li> My luminess air system gets used about once a month, which I thought was weird that it started clogging all the time even though I clean it really well after each use.  The spring handle area doesn&#x27;t work, so I have to take it apart and put it back together not just every single use to get it to work but half way through a use, otherwise it just is limp and doesn&#x27;t spray any foundation at all.  Then I email customer service who treats me like an idiot and tells me to do what I&#x27;m already doing, then tells me to call customer service which tells me there is nothing they can do.  Terrible product, terrible service.  Will never purchase anything from them ever again, not even a good paperweight.</li>
            <li> I spoke with Hope last week and she was awesome.  You are either good at customer service or you&#x27;re not.  She uses the same tone of voice, is patient, kind, and very good.  I was very impressed with her.  If Luminess air had 10 of her they could let go 100 employees.  I&#x27;m also impressed with the Luminess air system and although it is new to me, I am anxious to use it on a continuous basis. I&#x27;m anxious to try the Lunminess system.</li>
            <li> I am just your average consumer, not a makeup artist or professional cosmetologist. However, my job requires a lot of public speaking. Therefore, it is important I always look my best. My skin has occasional blemishes and uneven tone. Applying foundation the traditional way did not completely cover those areas without looking caked on. Even when I used a primer and concealer I was left with either, blotchy skin that never looked quite clean, or skin that looked caked with makeup. Neither of which is very attractive.    The Luminess Air product does exactly what it says it can do. I am very pleased with the results. I purchased the three-speed compressor and starter kit for medium skin tones. Initially, I was skeptical about purchasing their product based on the reviews. However, since Luminess Air offered a trial period, I felt confident there was nothing to loose.     It took some practice to learn how to use the system. The hardest part was learning how to clean the system thoroughly. Cleaning the system properly is the most important step in maintaining optimal function. The most effective way I&#x27;ve found to clean the system is by running tap water into the bowl to flush out any leftover makeup residue and then adding the alcohol/water mixture and spraying it out into the sink. The needle needs cleaning after approximately every three uses, but depends on how much make up I use. For instance, if I use the moisturizer/primer, boost-it, blush, foundation, and eye shadow the needle needs cleaning after each use. If I just use the foundation, I clean the needle after every three uses, but flush the system well after each use.    I have been using the Luminess Airbrush system daily for about four or five months. I set the system on the highest speed to apply the foundation because the other speeds do not provide adequate power; there is a hesitation. The only time I&#x27;ve experienced a splatter is when I&#x27;ve gone too long without cleaning the needle. It is easy to correct the splatter by stippling the area with a makeup foundation brush.      Using the airbrush system has not reduced the amount of time it takes to apply makeup in the morning. However, I do not have to touch up anything except lipstick throughout the day. This makeup stays fresh all day and all night. The few Times I&#x27;ve slept in the makeup has proven this theory. I also LOVE how light the makeup looks and feels. It does not cake into the creases of my middle-aged skin and creates a more youthful appearance. My favorite foundation is the Luminess Air Ultra. I have not tried other brands, but strongly believe using another brand&#x27;s water based airbrush make up would not harm the system.   The con of this system is the foundation bottle is small. I get one months use out of a 4 oz bottle at a cost of $ 51.45 shipping and handling included. However, the pros way outnumber the con. Since I did not need to return the product, I cannot provide feedback on their return process and customer service.   Sorry for the lengthy information, but hope it helps anyone who is interested in trying an airbrush system. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I hope you have read all the other reviews you had here and avoid getting into this. The product is NOT even great; yes, it does the basic job, but so do tons of foundations out there. The reason I want to ensure you are aware of: if you order this online through their website: [...] - this is a $$$ 400 dollar product!. And note that they are very sneaky about their payment process and they will NOT notify you of anything regarding your account.&lt;br /&gt;Really? a $400 product that breaks just right after their \\&quot;trial period\\&quot;? Wonder who does their reliability testing - really? made in USA??? that&#x27;s shocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money or dollars!... I will try to keep the word out, but thanks to Amazon for letting you make an informed decision.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it--I discovered it is classic misleading marketing. The infomercial says it&#x27;s $19.95 [or $29.95] for a 30 day trial. Note: that&#x27;s only for a 30-day day TRIAL.  If you go to their website, the fine print at the bottom of the first page says:  &amp;#34;All this is yours today for only $19.95 to try for 30 days with FREE Shipping!  Then when you love Luminess, it‚Äôs yours for only five easy monthly payments of fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents when you order today!&amp;#34;  Do the math: that&#x27;s ~$300! [Clever, too, how they put the actual cost in words instead of numbers.]</li>
            <li> Ordered my Luminess system about 3 weeks ago and I am just loving it. I do have to say at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about it as I was trying out different shades but when I did discover the right one I was absolutely loving it and still am. I have not watched the dvd yet but will be doing so today so I can get the most out of the system. It feels like you have absolutely no makeup on and when I put it on in the mornings it stays on all day unlike other makeups I have tried. Just a lil bit of powder during the day and I am good to go.Today I received my bi-monthly shipment with 2 different shades in it and some awesome free gifts to go with it. I just LOVE free stuff!!! I called customer service to inquire about a few questions I had. I spoke with the sweetest young lady (Karina) which I enjoyed talking with that answered all my questions and was very knowledgable about the products. Also while she was working on my order she was chatting with me keeping me entertained while I was waiting on the line. You can tell she really enjoys what she does and is very much a people person. That&#x27;s what I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! P.S. For all of you that say you don&#x27;t like the make-up I say give it another try cause it was worth it to me to to keep trying on shades till I found the right one!!! And Karina if u read this keep up the good work girl and the great attitude!!! Thanx for all your help!!!</li>
            <li> I bought my Luminess system in December 2010. I use it every day.  The application takes no longer than applying other makeup.  I follow the instructions for cleaning and maintenance. My machine still works like new.  It makes your complexion look great!</li>
            <li> I just ordered my Luminess airbrush system last week for my birthday I have one of this product since the first infomercial many years ago I cannot wait to try it</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial and decided to order, and to my surprise, the product was exactly like they said it would be. I really love this product. I get alot of compliments, I look absolutely flawless amd my self esteem is higher than ever.</li>
            <li> My wife did not like it  and they keep on charging</li>
            <li> This is one of those companies where you better read the fine print or they will be charging you  your first born child.  Lots of hidden fees.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 years now.  I love the make-up and especially how quickly I can get that done!!  The coverage is really good whether using minimum or medium coverage.  The machine is fine although the stylus trigger will become loose a lot and the needle clogs.  I really am pleased with this product --- and the sales they have on products is when I buy.  The best ones yet are at Christmas.  So watch for emails for the sales that will save a lot of money!!!!  Customer service is excellent!!  I have never had any problem when calling.  I last spoke with a girl named Toni and she was exceptional.  She was attentive, efficient, kind, understanding and even made suggestions of some products that might be better for my skin.  I was so pleased with her service that I asked to speak with her supervisor, Sharon, who also was extremely pleasant.  I can surely see why they are rated A+ with the BBB.</li>
            <li> I want to thank Angelica in customer service who truly showed a caring heart.  My dad passed away on Friday and when I called about concerns regarding payments she did not hesitate to seek advice from her supervisor who graciously gave me credit.  I love the Luminess Pro Air System and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> 217 Complaints with the BBB in Texas, because they do not honor their trial period.  Reports of machine breaking after 3 uses, horrible customer service.  Made me squeamish -- I bought a Denair.  Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> I would like to first say what an awesome experience I had when I called customer service. First speaking with Brianna and then speaking with Janae&#x27;. These ladies are the most professional and courteous persons I have ever dealt with when contacting a company with a concern.&lt;br /&gt;There should be more people like them on the customer service lines.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product, It is simply amazing. I love it.  And it is very user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to say that Ms. Sharon (supervisor) you are awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;All the best to you and the Luminess Air Family.&lt;br /&gt;Denize M. Shy</li>
            <li> I purchased my Luminess System a while back and it was the best thing that I have done. It makes my skin look flawlass and someone who doesn&#x27;t like to touch up her makeup, it stays on all day. It covers every blemish that I have and you know how we all like that. Now it is time consuming but it is so worth it for me. I look great, I feel great, and I get comments from people asking me where I purchase my makeup. I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> My mom and i liked what we saw on the commercial so i decided to order the LuminessAir airbrush system. The entire conversation with the sales person was him trying to force me into upgrading and racking up money for the product. I wanted to try it for 19.95 for 30 days like the commercial said, but they push u to upgrade for 10$ more, buy a 20$ warranty, add accessories and join clubs that all costs additional money. I did upgrade but said no to everything else. I verified that all i would be paying was 34.91 for the product and all thats included, plus a handling fee. He assured me that i would not have to pay a penny more unless i decided not to send the product back after my 30 day trial period. However, they started taking the 59.99 payments out from my account 2 days after i ordered the thing! I havent even received it in the mail yet and they&#x27;re stealing my money without my permission. Its totally not worth it now because i cant afford to have all the \\&quot;6 easy payments of 59.99\\&quot; taken out within days of each other. If u decide to purchase this product, just be aware of what they take out of your account and keep track of your money because they will practically drain it without u being aware.</li>
            <li> This is the worst customer service I have ever received.  I really like the product but the employees are rude and very unhelpful.  I have called at least 3 times to cancel and sent numerous e-mails.  On my last phone conversation I was hung up on.  They don&#x27;t want to hear anything you have to say.  I work for a Fortune 500 company training Customer Service.  If any of our employees spoke to our customers the way they do they would no longer be employed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase anything from this company.  As I said, the product is good.  The employees are terrible.  They make the experience so unpleasant.  I really don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.</li>
            <li> Worst kit ever! Don&#x27;t waste your money! Trigger was broke! Makeup is awful! Way over priced! Not worth your money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was skeptical because I have very sensitive skin.  My dermatologist said that it should be OK for me to use this product and that she totally understood my concerns.  I got the system and began to use it and needless to say I did not have any adverse reactions to it.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase and I would do it all over again. I have a huge upcoming event about to take place in my life and I am glad to say that I will be able to do it because of my flawless looking skin thanks to my luminess air airbrush system.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love My Luminess Air products.&amp;#34;  My skin is flawless with the &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; line by Luminess Air.

PORSHA girl..... &amp;#34;Serving beauty with a smile.&amp;#34;  You GO PORSHA!!!</li>
            <li> I order this and it arrived in less than 2 weeks which was a wonderful surprise and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  It was so easy to use that I had no problems at all and the color I chose (#3) was a perfect match for my skin.  I have oily, oily, oily skin and I found after 8 hrs of wearing their foundation not even my T-zone was oily...such a miracle.  Based on the price of the machine, I unfortunately had to call to get an RA # and that is when I met Jose, he was so polite in asking me what I thought and when I expressed my 2 concerns (price/fine lines), he spoke with his manager and offered to take 2 months ($120) off if I kept it and an additional 30 days to continue to try it and if that weren&#x27;t enough he also offered to send me a different type of foundation (silk) to see if that didn&#x27;t better aid in covering my fine lines.  When I called I expected to berated and berated into keeping the machine...instead I got Jose who not only met my expectations but far exceeded any customer service rep I have dealt with in the past.  I&#x27;m still not sure I can afford to stay, but I do know that thanks to Jose I will make every effort to find a way to keep it.  Thank you Jose and Luminess Air</li>
            <li> I love my Luminess Air Makeup I had a small problem and a Wonderful agent named Ophelia, helped me solved that problem. She was kind and patient ... This is a wonderful product I love the finish ... I am a continued loyal customer</li>
            <li> My wedding was this past weekend, the make up artist use the luminess air make up system... for my luck, It was 98 degrees that day so you can imagine how worried I was about my make up will turn out... it turn out flawless all the way through the reception... I am so in love with the luminess air system I already order it and I can&#x27;t wait to get it... I defnetly recommend...</li>
            <li> I got my system in the mail today , easy to set up I followed the dvd it was very easy to use it gave me a very natural coverage I had some blemishes that pop up and the luminess air system did very well to cover that up I really love my luminess air system I would recommended it to all and plan on giving it as a gift to my mom and my sister</li>
            <li> I would not suggest buying from this company, if you want an airbrush makeup machine find it somewhere else. You&#x27;ll get stuck paying extra fees that cannot be refunded, and even if you try calling customer service they will tell you it&#x27;s out of their hands. By any means save yourself from the trouble and hassle it takes to get anything done with Luminess Air company.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Luminess Air makeup system and I actually loved the make-up .It doesn&#x27;t run if you cry or in the rain. You literally have to remove it yourself. It does not rub off on your clothes after its dry. I ordered it because I saw the women on tv that were older like me and it made under the eyes look so much younger. I called to get help with my issue, I have really drawn eyes underneath from years of suffering with chronic pain, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing wrong. So I was going to cancel the membership even though I loved the makeup everywhere else on my face it just wasn&#x27;t working for under my eyes. I called and spoke with Kathy/Cathy( didn&#x27;t think to ask how she spelled it, my bad) and she was GREAT. So now I am keeping the system and the membership. She told me what I needed to do to fix my problem and she even got me the  system a little cheaper. And yes I am loving the cheaper part, but the customer service was so great, she took so much time to help me. She made me feel like a customer not a number. You don&#x27;t find that in this day and time. Thanks Kathy/Cathy. Now I am a true Luminess Air #1 FAN.</li>
            <li> I purchased this system for my niece and she loves it. She is a professional makeup artist and loves the set. I also purchased a lesser set for myself. I haven&#x27;t used mine yet but my niece loves hers. Thank you for making it affordable!</li>
            <li> Tried only once so far, and found you have to use a lot more product than the instructions list.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely takes use to!</li>
            <li> Please be AWARE this company is a scam!!! The product is horrible and doesn&#x27;t cover at all and they will rip you off any way they can. They would only return 1/4 of your money if you decide to return the product. They won&#x27;t return S&amp;H, you have to pay to return it and they charge your account a first payment right away even though they&#x27;re supposed to give you 30-Days and even though they will tell you it will be reimbursed you would only get half of that payment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t try call them to resolve any issue because they will leave you holding forever and then once they answer they have all the excuses of why they didn&#x27;t return your whole first payment when you only had the product for 3 days. As I was told it was because the product had a scratch, even though I only used it once and never again. That scratch cost me $50!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RIDICULOUS!!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my Luminess air, I saw the commercial and it lives up to its promises. I have sensitive skin and it did not cause any reaction at all.  Love the coverage and look.  I called customer service to have payments explained to me, Mairlynn explain everything great and encouraged me to try other products.  Can wait to try more products.  Recommend this.</li>
            <li> They offer 3 monthly payments $59.95 they are on the 6th and I can&#x27;t get them to stop. I wrote in about the $29.95 a month they were also taking out for makeup that i DO NOT use. I have been completely ripped off and I warn you WATCH OUT!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to Luminess Air it is a pricey product but I am new to using it.  I recently was laid off and called Luminess Air to tell them it was a hardship to be billed $69.99 for 5 months (this is not mentioned in the infomercial at all) Lakasha was very nice and friendly.  Very understanding too!  She said she is waiving 3 payments for me due to being out of work and she is sending me new colors as the ones that come in the initial kit were not my shade for my skin type.  I appreciated the great customer service however at no time was I advised that an additional $34.06 will be billed to my account on top of the $69.99  I am out $104.05 on erroneous billing from Luminess without my consent!  Very deceiving company and they do not disclose this.  I am cancelling this account and highly DO NOT RECOMMEND LUMINESS AIR. Thanks to them I have to dispute with my bank.  Very underhanded deceitful company Stay Away!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the trail everything was good, they even gave me a $25 gift certificate which I can ONLY used to buy more make up nothing else....on top of that I was told I have to pay to return and ship it and I wont even get back all my money I paid for a stupid trail. To top it all off that 3 drops of make for one face ain&#x27;t 3 drops.... I had to use about 10- 12 drops to finish my whole damn face...... My advice don&#x27;t waste your time I wish I had read the reviews first before I wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> In August of last year I saw a very enticing and attractive ad on the net. The ad was so suductive that I didn&#x27;t look at the fine print. The mahine and the make-up came to my home and I practiced working with the products for about 5 week. The machine did not fuction in a proper manner and the make-up begain to irrate my skin. I was not happy and spoke to the company aout returning the machine for a refund. I was told that I could pay to send back the machine but, no refund. I have spent over$300.00 on !@#$%.</li>
            <li> A total rip off! Do not waste your money! Before you know it, you are in debt for a lot more money then you bargained for. Don&#x27;t know how the good the product is as I sent it back as soon as the kept charging me. I ended up with nothing and it still cost me $50!!</li>
            <li> ONLY BUY THIS SYSTEM IF YOU WANT YOUR MAKE UP TO FEEL AS THO YOU ARE WEARING DRIED PASTE GLUE. I HAVE TRIED A LIGHT COVERING AND HEAVIER. NOTHING WORKS. I ATTEMPTED MIXING SHADES AS INSTRUCTED. THE RESULT WAS A MARBLE EFFECT ON MY FACE. A WASTE OF $149!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from watching an infomercial and after 20 minutes of making sure there were no new charges, I made the call.  After I got on the automated line, they took all my info (that should&#x27;ve been a red flag!) and then told me that they are charging a $60 non refundable fee, but not what it was for.  At this point I hung up the phone and didn&#x27;t expect anything else.  It was only supposed to be $25 plus shipping for 30 day trial.  I got the package in the mail yesterday in my mail so I couldn&#x27;t refuse it.  I opened pkg for the details on what they charged me.  Then I went to my credit card stmt, Amex, and sure enough they had charged me $84 already.  I called the company today and got a nasty woman who, after giving me an RA number, I asked if she had anything to say about their business practice.  She put it all back on me, that I should have called them after I heard the $60 on the phone, and my point is that I didn&#x27;t think I had an order since I hung up before completing my order, or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE AND HORRIBLE SELFISH ARROGANT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Stay away!</li>
            <li> Customer service is a joke!  I&#x27;m currently multitasking, on hold.  It&#x27;s officially been 23:49 min/sec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the makeup &amp;#34;cakes&amp;#34; on your face. Awful!</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order your Luminess Air Starter Kit. The advertisement states in bold print &#x27;lt this is yours today for only $19.95 to try for 30 days with FREE Shipping!&#x27;. In very fine print at the bottom of the advertisement  states &#x27;Then when you love  Luminess, it‚Äôs yours for only five easy monthly payments of fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents when you order today!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see the fine print when I purchased the product. Now I am paying US$59.99 every month. This is automatically deducted from your credit card</li>
            <li> I love it! My makeup is smooth and flawless. Customer Service has been amazing so far and answered all my questions. Good product, great company.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I exspcted to receive everything shown in the advertisement. I did not receive the carry case shown in picture. Was told by company it was not included . If this is true it should not be shown in picture.</li>
            <li> I received a Luminess Air ‚ÄòBeauty System‚Äô for Christmas this year. I have never used an air brush makeup system and typically stick to using a spot concealer and a tinted moisturizer.  I need a product that is Simple Simon and allows me to apply my make up quickly, while still achieving good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package, everything was neatly put together.  I laid the contents on out on the counter in my bathroom. Using the quick step booklet, I shook up the color I thought would match my skin tone the best, and put about 5-6 drops into the well. I then turned the machine on and started spraying. I felt the coverage was fantastic and I was very happy with the result. I then started to get a little confident and put some of the liquid blush into the well of the airbrush. Well, let me tell you‚Ä¶. THAT is going to take some practice to apply. I squeezed the trigger a little too hard the first couple passes! Unfortunately, I guess this isn‚Äôt a product you can just rub off it you over-apply. I started to try to rub the excess blush off with a cotton cloth, and the pigment started to intensify. After a few swipes, I definitely looked like a porcelain doll with red cheeks that were a bit too rosy. I decided that was enough experimenting for the day and cleaned my face of makeup. I also cleaned the airbrush machine exactly as it says to do so, step by step, in the quick start booklet. Machine was then put away to be used the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I woke up to go through my normal getting ready routine. When it was time to apply makeup, I put some of the foundation into the well of the airbrush machine and‚Ä¶.oh no! Nothing came out! I pulled the trigger back again and again, but nothing resulted. I realized I had to sop up the makeup I had already put in the well, which did not make me very happy because I know how expensive the refills can be. I spent 20 minutes trying to clean the machine, AGAIN, and eventually got it towork. Once it was working, I loved the makeup application, and even got the blush on just the way I like it. I have used it about 15 times since and have not had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, I test the machine each morning with a little water in the sprayer before I put 6 drops of foundation in the well. If the machine continues to allow me to apply makeup like I am now, fantastic. I think it looks great and I have gotten several compliments that my skin looks very even. It is not necessarily faster than the method I was using before, but I do get better coverage and like the way it feels on my skin. If that means I have to spend an extra 5-10 minutes on my makeup routine, so be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone out there having serious doubts about buying this product, I say go for it, but beware the retailer you are purchasing it from. I seems like a lot of people who have reviewed the product here are not happy with buying it through an infomercial and using the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trail. I‚Äôm not really sure how to comment on that, as I know mine was purchased from the Luminess Air website.  If all you have the time/skill set/patience for is a makeup sponge with liquid foundation out of bottle, then this may not be for you. If you‚Äôre interested in trying a new way to apply makeup and have the time to sit down with it, read the manual, and watch the DVD‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be disappointed. I know that in the 2-3 weeks I‚Äôve been using it, I‚Äôm very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it! I could not be happier about it. I didn&#x27;t know what color to use for my skin but they helped me find the right shade!</li>
            <li> Product worked well,called customer service and they were very nice and friendly. Have problems on my face going thru menopause .and it covered very well</li>
            <li> I wanted to let you know that I called customer service because of a billing issue that occur due to my fault.  I was so surprised to talk to such a nice, positive young lady by the name of Nikki. She was extremely helpful, knowledgable, cheerful and understanding. Nikki displayed very good customer service skills and she listen and did an outstanding job. I felt like it was was my lucky day. Thanks You Nikki for making my day!</li>
            <li> Read all disclosures before you purchase.  This is a SCAM.  They will not refund your purchase when wanting to return when you are not staisfied.  I cancelled any further payments but they continue, it does not go away.  Beware!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s widely advertised as $19.95 but - we discovered - in the fine print they charge you over $300.  Getting the return authorization took about 15 minutes, 2 representatives, and a hold.  Don&#x27;t purchase!!!</li>
            <li> First the disclaimer:  I have only used the Luminess Air System for about 1 month.  I almost did not buy the System because of the negative reviews but finally decided to try it.  As far as application is concerned, the instructions tell you it is better to spray lightly, let it dry and, if greater coverage is needed, to apply another new thin layer.  I only use two coats and my skin looks so much better.  I have not yet had a problem with the machine or stylus.  However, with an automatic refill every 60 days, I now have too much make-up and the caligraphy eyeliner did not seem to work correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the the Customer Service Department and spoke with Cynthia.  Cynthia went above and beyond for me; she was delightful and could not have been more helpful.  With respect to my oversupply of make-up, Cynthia suggested we decidedto delay any further refills until December (to allow me to catch up) and then change the automatic refills from 2 months to 4 months.  (If that is still too frequent, she said to just call back and she will lengthen the periods between automatic shipment of refills.)  Further, to match my complexion I use 4 drops of No. 2 and 2 drops of No. 3 make-up base.  Cynthia volunteered to make a further change in my automatic refills so that ever 4 months, I get the larger size of the No. 2 make-up-base and the smaller size of the No. 3.  Cynthia uses this product and, when asked, stated that if you have oily skin, use the matte finish; if dry skin, use Silk or Satin; and if combination skin, use Ultra.  Not knowing this, I had only experienced the Ultra make-up line which came with the machine.  My second problem involved the caligraphy eyeliner.  The narrow brush would not refill with additional eyeliner.  Cynthia immediately said it is defective and she would have a new one sent at no charge.  She put me on hold for a few minutes but when she came back, not only had she done that but she also included free samples of the Silk and Satin for me to try because of the better skin match.  I cannot give enough favorable comments about Cynthia.  Please ignore all the other reviewers who denigrate Customer Service!!!  Donna B.for me to try because of the better skin match.

            <li> I bought this thinking that it would give me a flawless look all it did was make my face look if my makeup was dripping almost like it was melting</li>
            <li> I purchased the Luminess Air system in February 2012. The makeup itself is wonderful, however I have spent upwards of $600 in the last 10 months due to the Air Compressor and Stylus. The machine is constantly breaking and the parts that break are not covered under warranty because they are considered \\&quot;general wear and tear.\\&quot; I have had to purchase a completely new stylus ($80) and it was faulty upon the first use. The machine clogs constantly even when cleaned as directed. The customer service is absolutely the most dreadful process ever. While the makeup does what it says it will, do not buy this unless you have thousands to spent on makeup each year. It is definitely not worth the price and I have not been impressed at all by this company.</li>
            <li> The worst company.  They get into your credit card and they keep charging my card monthly and even though paid in full and program was cancelled.  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are airbrush systems out there that are better. For me, I had never used airbrush before and using airbrush is such a difference than any other makeup I had used. Especially because I had no knowledge how to use makeup professionally and thought I was doing a good job for myself. It took a lot of experimenting with the airbrush system and was not as easy as they want you to think. But, I eventually figured out how to use the airbrush to make my skin actually look good. The other thing that they didn&#x27;t tell me that I had to figure out is that they set up a plan for you to pay for makeup monthly. You have to call and figure out what you want and change what they want to try and charge you for. I guess this is how most companies would make their money, but it bothered me that it wasn&#x27;t disclosed to me and I had surprised bills then had to figure things out. Once things were straightened out I was able to plan ; it made things a lot easier. Overall, I do love using airbrush foundation. I probably would do more research though the next time I purchase a system that cost that much money.</li>
            <li> I bought luminess air system for my wife for our anniversary and she loves it. She even got a friend of hers to buy it. She didn&#x27;t get the right color to begin with but she call customer service and they were a big help.</li>
            <li> Hello. I just called luminess air because I had questions about the product and it&#x27;s billing. I spoke with a rep. Her name is Evelyn. And she answered my questions about my color matching for my skin type. I really liked the luminess air makeup because it is very light on my skin and it feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup. She told me the makeup is water based so it will not clog my pores. She was very understanding and patient with me and answered all of my questions of the make system and it&#x27;s billing. I really enjoyed this makeup it is worth the price and I would recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s was a pleasure doing business with luminess air on behalf of Evelyn.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my system! It gives me a flawless look, one that I&#x27;ve never got with any other foundation. I initially purchased it after seeing a commercial not knowing what I got myself into. Then I spoke to someone in customer service and explained to her that there was no way in hell that I could afford it!! The lady was so understanding and got me a great rebate. All together I spent about $165.</li>
            <li> My wife bought the product and did not read everything she need to.  This company is preying on the public and this is one of the biggest ripoff scams on the market.  I am reporting them to the BBB.  Stay away from this company.</li>
            <li> This is the email I sent to them trying to cancel my &amp;#34;club membership,&amp;#34; but I feel like it is an accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week before Christmas I ordered the Luminess Heiress system, and paid over $30 for the fastest shipping option so it would be here in time for Christmas. I also signed up for this &amp;#34;Club&amp;#34; membership to receive a discount on my purchase as it said it would. Which of course I did NOT receive my discount, just got charged the $29.95 monthly fee + the shipping fee for the makeup refills, which was expected. That is not what this is about. Well, after I received my airbrush system from Luminess, it would not work right at all. Multiple people who had used the Dinair airbrushing system told me that this had to be defective or either a really bad system. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, but they were experienced with airbrushing. I read numerous reviews, some good some bad, but the majority were bad. I spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials, reviews, and troubleshooting videos telling me to clean it &amp; showing me how to do so. I knew it didn&#x27;t need cleaning  because as I said earlier, this was a brand new system and had never worked right. BUT I tried cleaning it anyways. As I was taking the needle out ever so carefully, the little piece behind the spray lever just...fell out. No videos or websites knew how to put that thing back in, this wasn&#x27;t supposed to come out according to them. So at this point I was fed up with this system that was supposed to be a really awesome Christmas present, so I ordered the Dinair airbrush system. It got here so fast, was about $150 cheaper than Luminess terrible product, &amp; worked SO good, it was so easy! Just like your website said for your product, although your product did not work at all. After I decided I wanted the Dinair system and decided that Luminess was a scam, I called to explain what had happened with the product and that I would like to return it and be refunded. Who would want to just get another one of these terrible things and have the same problems? Well, the customer service at Luminess is even worse than their products...WOW. After spending hours on the phone, they tell me they will just send me another system because I can&#x27;t get my money back. Here&#x27;s the real kicker - on the Luminess website AS WELL AS THEIR INFORMERCIAL - they offer a 30-day Money Back Guarantee! WOW.......but here they are sending me ANOTHER one of these pieces of junk. SUCH FALSE ADVERTISING. Also, not that im in any kind of hurry to have this machine in my home, it will take them regular shipping times to deliver it. After I paid 30 dollars for shipping for the broken, junk machine they sent me at first. I WILL be posting this review on EVERY review website I can find, and especially on Dinair&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO PLEASE....lose my information. I never want to see another Luminess product again, much less pay for one. This is an awful company.d. Who would want to just get another one of these terrible things and have the same problems?

            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase the luminess system! Not only will it be cost you a ton of money - you have to buy the system, which needs to be taken apart and fixed on a regular basis - but the cost of the actual makeup is ridiculous! And it is impossible to match to your natural skin tone! I made the mistake of staying up watching info-mercials one night and fell for all the promises luminess makes. The billing was a ridiculous process and I had to call multiple times because they kept trying to charge me more frequently and then set me up for automated shipments when I specifically said I did not want to set up automated shipments. Many times I was put on hold for a good 20 minutes or was hung up on all together. So those are my complaints with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the actual product.. At first it was a lot of fun experimenting with the different products.. blush, illuminizer, moisturizer, eyeshadow.. But after wearing the makeup for about one month I noticed a significant increase in breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup is very heavy. I&#x27;m not sure what people mean when they say it is so lightweight, I felt like I was wearing a mask. I think the reason I starting breaking out on a regular basis is because the makeup is too think and my skin was not able to breathe. It has also stained a lot of my shirts, around the neck area because it sprays everywhere when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new makeup try..  this is NOT the one to try. Don&#x27;t waste your time, money, or effort!</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! It;s AWFUL!!!  It is terribly ineffective and the makeup is very substandard!!!!! When you try to cancel, they still keep sending you makeup products &amp; charging you for them. Their presentation is fraudulent; their delivery system is horribly noisy, messy, and ineffective and their makeup products are perhaps the worst you have ever tried. Worst of all, when you try to cancel, they still keep sending you products and charging you for them! I had to cancel my credit card to hopefully avoid further charges. IT&#x27;S A SCAM !!!-- DON&#x27;T ORDER FROM THEM!!!  Save yourself from all this trouble! It&#x27;s a very costly mistake!  They state you can return this with no problem; then they try to charge you $257.00 for a \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot;. It&#x27;s all fraudulent! DO NOT ORDER THIS; YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DID!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was hesitant when I first heard of airbrush makeup as an alternative to my usual liquid and pressed foundations. I have to say that I am completely amazed! Once I got used to using my airbrush I was in makeup heaven. My skin has never looked better AND I have been able to save money on my cosmetic purchases because I don&#x27;t use nearly as much!! I am in love and don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to other foundations!</li>
            <li> Luminess offers a 30 day trial offer  if ordered from TV of course you are charged a non-refundable fee of $30.00. Here the problem you don&#x27;t know of you are getting a used machine they don&#x27;t disclose that. These machines are extremely high priced and work off of the same idea as a small compressor you buy to air up your car tires and plugs into your cigarette lighter. they cost $30.00. So when you get your &amp;#34;new &amp;#34; machine someone could have already used it for 30 days. You have no clue what they have done to it. Luminess just cleans it up and sends it out to the next sucker. Look at their return policy closely-very strict. So you don&#x27;t follow instructions exactly right down to the size that the return authorization numbers should be on the front of the box they won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;accept it and your stuck!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon would not allow me to post this unless I rated the product, so without having ever used it myself, but based on the ratings, I assigned it one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY anxious to try this system but decided to check the reviews first - and am I glad I did.  Thank you to all who spent the time and energy posting your experiences.  There is a website called \\&quot;Rip Off.com.\\&quot;  I haven&#x27;t checked it lately to see if any complaints have been filed but if you want to make a statement this site is a good sounding board.  I bashed a major appliance manufacturer and let me tell you, my satisfaction was off the charts.  I&#x27;m not a Facebook participant (too private a person) but if you really want to hit them where it hurts, go to their Facebook page and lay it out cold. How dare they overbill, mislead and provide horrible customer service coupled with an inferior product!  Use your regular foundation mixed with a dab of moisturizer (thins it out and application is easier) and apply as you chose; finger, sponge, brush, or damp sponge. EZ and the results are commensurate with your practice and ability. If your skin is oily and moisturizer is not part of your regular regime substitute with a few drops of warm water. Mix everything up in the clean palm of your hand. I&#x27;ve been doing this for years and achieved excellent results - even with drug store foundations rather than the more upscale and expensive department store brands. A professional taught me an invaluable trick:  Only apply foundation where necessary! Perhaps some of you can utilize this depending on your complexion and other issues. The goal is to appear as though you are not wearing any foundation. I apply it where it is absolutely necessary and, depending on how much sleep I&#x27;ve had the night before, may give the rest of my fact a light going over. Blend, blend, blend.</li>
            <li> I have had my luminess air system for a little over a year and I love it. Their system gives me such a flawless look. Not to mention that their foundation is my favorite foundation ever. Since I have purchased the system I have not went back to my old foundation. I don&#x27;t even use my brushes/sponges anymore. I recently called customer service as well to purchase other products and to see what was new and their customer service is amazing. They describe each product so well. I would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> The system works great but the bottles that hold the baseline, primer, Etc. a really cheap. The application products are quite costly and half of it spills down the sink because the bottles leak while you are using them. Need to provide better containers!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was hesitant when I first heard of airbrush makeup, because f my wife being picky about stuff but I have to say that I am completely amazed! Once I saw my wife use the machine she fell in love with it, she is a make up artist so she used it and helped her a lot, gets their make up done and then their hair she does it all and now she has more time and finishes faster than usual because of luminess....Thank god for this great invention.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this product ‚Äìafter seeing it on TV 2/14. Could not&lt;br /&gt;read the ‚Äúfine small print‚Äù stating they will charge your CC: ~5 payments&lt;br /&gt;for ~$370 if not return in 30days.&lt;br /&gt;And charged her CC twice during the free 30 day trail. This is a false advertising company. Send your Complaints to the FTC- FCC &amp; if you are California resident to The California Consumer Protection agency. If we could give a _ ZERO _ to this company we would.</li>
            <li> Called into customer service to recieve more info about the product and spoke to Marilyn!! She was very informative, patient, and even provided her extension just in case we had any more questions. She made my purchase very easy. Expecting great results from this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and they are rude and mean.... I never dealt with anyone like this save time and stress n don&#x27;t speak to managers they do not help.... please target has it for less</li>
            <li> SCAM SCAM SCAM &amp;#60; RIP OFF  RIP OFF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it full price from a store(if they accept returns) rather than buying it from Luminess website. Its a scam of charging you over $330 over a six month period. And your initial trial period amount of 29.99 or 19.99 will NOT be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, the way they&#x27;ve worded their T&amp;C it says that you&#x27;ll NOT get a refund for the trial cost or the shipping costs etc. They&#x27;ll only let you off the hook for the next 6 payments of $59.99&lt;br /&gt;From a general viewpoint they&#x27;re FRAUD; because they clearly state that they&#x27;ll refund your money if you don&#x27;t like it; but that refers to any additional amount you pay after the trial period, but at the same time you won&#x27;t get the initial money you paid for the product. They&#x27;re confusing and misleading the customers with their scam commercials.&lt;br /&gt;Although, I&#x27;m saying all this, I just ordered one on groupon for $99(normally 179), cuz she wanted to try the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest people buy it full retail price from walgreen or drugstore etc and can return it to the store directly if you&#x27;re not satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;The luminess website itself is a big scam, stay away from it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had! I tried the &amp;#34;risk free&amp;#34; 30 day trial on their website that was supposed to be $29.99 and it ended up costing me $80 after all said and done plus a $59.99 for the deposit!!!. Then when I finally got it I tried it and hated it. I got so busy, I kept forgetting to return it and ended up missing the 30 day mark... I called to see if I could still return it and get my money back and the lady was so unhelpful and RUDE. She wouldn&#x27;t refund me at all and she said they are going to continue to take out the payments of $59.99 all because I was a few days late in returning it. Don&#x27;t ever buy from them. They are the worst company in the world!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could ever enjoy putting on makeup. Using Luminess Air&#x27;s gentle spray application, putting on makeup is actually exciting and fun again, like when I was a child. I look forward to it every morning. I feel so special now that I have the same equipment that makeup artists use to apply my makeup just as beautifully. On the weekends, It&#x27;s a blast playing around with this system to see what it can do when I&#x27;m not in a hurry!!!</li>
            <li> I called customer service and talked to an agent about my color match. the agent was very helpful and I was to match my complextion.  I have a skin condition called roasia where your skin turns red, I was able to use the matt foundation to cover it up.  ii like the way the makeup looks on me cause it covered my red marks.. I was not able to get these results from other makeup.. I would refer this makeup system to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> great customer service laeszliee helped me out better then i can imagine</li>
            <li> I have just had the best experience with Toni at Luminess Air!  Not only do the products do just what they claim to do but the customer service I received was over and beyond what I expected and normally receive from others these days.  I talked with a  wonderful girl named Toni.  I was on the fence for a long time about air brush makeup and decide to take a leap and hope for the best.  I&#x27;ll have to say it was one of my better decisions.  As I get older am having some skin issues and found myself with questions about the products and application.  I hope you are lucky as I was when Toni answered the cal.  She was incredible...she listened to my needs.  Toni was very knowledgeable about their products and sincere about helping me be the best I can be.  Bravo to Luminess Air Products and the way they train there staff!  Lots of business could learn from them, including mine. as customer service is sometimes lacking.  My girl &amp;#34;Toni&amp;#34; and her instructors, made my experience wonderful and helped me look like a younger, and better version of myself .  Thank you Luminess Air!</li>
            <li> I brought my Luminess Air system about 5 months ago for a wedding and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because of my sensitive skin. I tried it and my skin looked gorgeous it&#x27;s really awesome and I&#x27;m still using it. Would recommend to anyone I know. LOVING IT!!</li>
            <li> This system does not work, it is the worst product you can purchase , I got so many pimples and did not like the way it looked on my skin. Stay away from this and  don&#x27;t waste your money.... In addition they have the worst customer service, horrible rude employees. I am returning the product ,</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Luminess Air Club and I just spoke with Toni, a Luminess Representative.  She was so nice and helpful.  A real joy.  I will try to talk to her again.  Everyone I have ever talked to there has been wonderful.  I am so happy I found this makeup!  It is the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It is a coplete fraud,  I was charged over $80 when the advertisement says 24.99 and when I asked for my fully refund that was advertised they don&#x27;t return everything and we have to pay shipping to return.  I will personally never recommend this product 1st is really bad,2nd this is a fraud all they do is charge your account without asking.</li>
            <li> If there is an evaluation section of this company&#x27;s business ethics, I would give zero.  I tried Luminess Air, trial product with a stylus, thinking paying only less than $30 is worthwhile.  Turned out this company was charging me over $200 on my credit card, so I called a customer service rep. and she said that the web site clearly states on further payment unless customer returns within a certain number of days, 30 days??  and she also said that the statement comes with a product, which I didn&#x27;t keep,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received:  customer gets charged ....... dollars and mine is $209.  And she threatened me that a collection agency will be after me.  I  am well respected professional and my payment record has been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ready contact Better Business Bureau!  Watch out for this company&#x27;s unethical conduct.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I BAUGHT SOME MAKEUP FOR MY MOTHERS 65TH BIRTHDAY AND I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BECAUSE OF HER AGE. BUT SHE LOVES HER GIFT. I DIDN&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE BILLING OR CLUB , AND I CALLED IN TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ENDED UP SPEAKING WITH A TIFFNY WHO EXPLAINED AND BROKE EVERYTHING DOWN TO ME AND MY MOTHER. SHE WAS EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND WELL EDUCATED IN PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE. MY MOTHER WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH HER GIFT , AND I AM SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! This is my daily use for applying my make up and it&#x27;s just made my hour long make up routine into just 15 minutes. I had an issue with getting my correct tone at first but I called customer service and they were able to help choose my proper skin tone and mailed it right out, great service!!</li>
            <li> Loved this system brought it. This two weeks ago have been looking absolutely fabulous a must buy!!!!! For beginners and vets. Easy application  hardly feels like anything is on your face. Natural as your gonna get!</li>
            <li> I surprised my wife with the Luminess Airbrush system she had been wanting for her birthday. Luminess helped me pick the right colors for her and she loves using it!</li>

            <li> Anjanette was very kind and helpful when I called in for information.  I am a new customer and had questions that I wanted answered and she took the time to go over all information regarding my questions  I also asked to speak to a supervisor and she too was very helpful.</li>
            <li> Lakesha is amazing with customer service !!!!&lt;br /&gt;She is sooo nice and eager to help!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this makeup ! It&#x27;s light, covers great and makes my skin look flawless!&lt;br /&gt;You have to try it!</li>
            <li> first of all I love the airbrush system.  I had a problem with my order and called and talked to this very very nice lady named Leticia  (not sure just how to spell her name).  anyway I could not believe what a great help she was and such a pleasant personality.  I know her ext. number is 1133 and that who I will always call from now on.  she was simply amazing.  I never write reviews but I had to write and tell her company that they have this wonderful person working for them.  thank you again for your great product and great personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lois at&lt;br /&gt;wsugarman1@cox.net</li>
            <li> This airbrush system is so wonderful and I love it so much. It makes my face look so clear. I actually think it takes years off of your face. Besides the look it gives you it is so easy and quick to apply. The application is less than five minutes to do and you look amazing. The makeup stays on all day. I would recommend this to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Kristina S.</li>
            <li> I have used a luminess air system for three years now and I think it&#x27;s awesome. I do agree customer service is a little cold but I have never been thru a trial w them. The results are amazing and last all day long. I am a professional artist and don&#x27;t plan on ever using regular liquid foundation on my clients again. This is  the fastest application w the best coverage! My machine does clog but it is absolutely vital you clean the gun properly, don&#x27;t half ass or rush. The gun needs to be cleaned thoroughly after every use! Also the gun is simple to take apart to clean every once in awhile. If mine gets clauged up I take a little time and clean it piece by piece. I have just ordered a new system for work and am keeping my old one for home use. I recommend this system to anyone who wants minimal to full coverage and wants to take the time to learn (by practicing) how to apply the airbrush makeup properly and also doesn&#x27;t mind taking care of the equipment.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this system unless you thoroughly read the terms and conditions.  To get them to stop charging my card on a monthly basis, I had to threaten them.</li>
            <li> I called Zulain at Luminess Air today to check to make sure my account was in order. I found out I had a balance that was incorrect. Zulain immediately offered a detailed explanation and made corrections while on the call and emailed me the corrected invoice and we went over it. She then offered me her extension to call her with any future questions or concerns or orders. I have worked in customer service for over 30 years and I pride myself on giving excellent customer care, I have to say I met my match today with Zulain. Luminess Air is very fortunate to have Zulain in their corner and I can also say that when I&#x27;ve called in the past everyone has provided me with great service. I was afraid I would have a problem today but Zulain took care of me and this is what will keep me a returning faithful customer. Thank You Zulain.</li>
            <li> Good evening,&lt;br /&gt;I just got off the phone with Lesley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had called to get an RA number to return the product as I felt it was too expensive and I wasn&#x27;t told that the trial started when I ordered the product, NOT when I received it. I was adamant that I was NOT going to get talked into keeping it. Then this fabulous, happy, NOT pushy lady and I were chatting away and even having a bit of a laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesley was absolutely awesome. Within 2 minutes she had turned an unhappy customer into a VERY satisfied customer who ordered more products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She made my day. Not only is she an awesome customer service rep, she deserves a raise, too. Lesley was not pushy at all. I could tell she was smiling and enjoying her job. And, because of her upbeat attitude and helpfulness, you now have a new, permanent customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Lesley&lt;br /&gt;You Rock&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Butler</li>
            <li> Called Luminess &amp; spoke with Tonya. She was very helpful explaining how to get savings from membership. Best customer service I have had in a long time. Im sure I will be a long time customer.</li>
            <li> I just had the pleasure of talking with Lakesha regarding the product.  She not only assisted me in proper use which resulted in my final decision to keep the product, but also confirmed the billing and explained the future billing.  Additionally, on a personal level, I woke to a rather challenging day and she took the time to make me laugh and turned my otherwise questionable day into a day that is now going to be with a smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did personally thank her on the phone, I would like to also do so here, &amp;#34;THANK YOU AGAIN!  You truly have a phenomenal personality.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking from a managerial perspective, I highly recommend Lakesha for promotion and a pay compensation for her performance.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased my Luminous Air system, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my makeup. I like the fact that you can spray it on, and I like the color.  I found the color that matches my complexion and it goes on quickly and easily. I have very fair, sensitive skin and since the makeup is water based, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores or break me out.  I really love the finish.  I get tons of compliments from my friends and coworkers. Thank you, Luminous Air!</li>
            <li> I JUST WANT TO SAY, HATS OF TO THIS WONDERFUL MAKE UP SYSTEM, LUMINESS AIR!  AND THE KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON, A YOUNG LADY &amp;#34; TONI OR TONY WHO ASSISTED ME TO DAY, I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET SOME PLACE, SHE, TONY, ASSURED ME TO TAKE MY ORDER WOULD ONLY TAKE A MOMENT, SHE WAS SO REASSURING,  AND UNDERSTOOD JUST WHAT I WAS ASKING ABOUT,  SHE SET ME UP AND NOW I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT I  CAN  DEPEND ON THESE HELPFUL WOMEN SUCH AS TONY,  AND HER SUPERVISOR, SHARON, TO ALL WAYS BE THERE FOR CUSTOMERS  LIKE MY SELF, WHEN NEEDING A MAKE UP REORDER. I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Please understand that once you order this system you will be spending a bunch of extra money each month and it will shock you! I ordered this system back in December and had pneumonia at the time so it was a couple of weeks before I actually tried it, When I did, it took more than one coat of the makeup to even provide any coverage. (I don&#x27;t even have flaws that need coverage) I am 61 years old and have great skin because I have taken care of it.  After my skin started to itch I knew this was not for me and especially after the messiness of this system.  It will make a huge mess in your bathroom. In addition to all of the mess you will be charged much more than the original price of $19.99 - you will be charged $59.99 for deposit on the system for around 5 months and then $34.06 every 2 months for your makeup.  How much do you normally spend on makeup?  I can guarantee that most of us do not spend this amount each month and if we do I can guarantee it is makeup that is good for our skin.  I do not understand why you are paying a deposit on the system when you bought the system so cheap and the insurance on it is almost triple??????  What a RIPOFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and they have no remorse, are not willing to reimburse you if you do not like the product (&amp;#34;because it is after 30 days&amp;#34;) and could care less if you write a Review!!! I want to make sure no one else falls into this marketing TRAP!!!!  Karen Young</li>
            <li> I just received this product. Purchased two weeks ago. Paperwork stated their was a 30 day return policy from the date of purchase. That means the 15 days of 30 are up on the return. Need a return number and can&#x27;t get customer service. Paperwork stated that I owed 5 more payments. First I had seen this mentioned. Decided that I didn&#x27;t want this product. Did not take it out of the box. Paperwork informed me that if I didn&#x27;t pay or refused item that I would be subject to restocking fee, other fees, maybe lawyer fees, on and on. Stated that the company would not take it back if I didn&#x27;t have a return number. Customer service open only until 5:00pm. I do not get home most days until 6pm. I don&#x27;t like the threats this company makes. I can&#x27;t get their return number. It is going back and if they choose not to accept this item back then it will be in mail limbo as far as I am concerned. This is fraud and will be reported to the Better Business Bureau and has been reported to my credit card company. I stopped payment and I am sure I will receive more threats. I would encourage everyone to stay away not unless they want to play games with this company. I will take this as far as I have to. I have a lawyer too. Let the games begin.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble getting my free polish and Ashley was not only a good listener but she helped me pick out my two free colors. She laughed was more than pleasant, explained everything I was confused about &amp; when I was ready to buy something the pamphlet recommended she was HONEST( a very rare commodity when everyone is just worried about the bottom line &amp; she told me I didn&#x27;t really need to buy the other two bottles because the gel &amp; the shiny overcoat are already built into every color. When I think of all the fingernail polish with diamond crystals or nylon, my nails still cracked,broke &amp; I&#x27;m happy to say that after all my years of Sally Hansen &amp; similar products, this balances all those out . Just buff clean, dry &amp; in 60 seconds, polish is dry, no air bubbles, no damage to the nail underneath &amp; it works for all the ladies with thin week nails it doesn&#x27;t have to stay that way. I cannot thank Ashley enough for breaking it all down &amp; helping me to get the two free bottles I couldn&#x27;t seem to get quite right. She was my first phone call of the new day &amp; she was patient, clever and very kind &amp; understanding. Thank you Ashley for restoring my faith in customer service because I was losing a lot of hope for &amp;#34;customer service in general &amp; was not handled by a computer. Thanks again Ashley for restoring &amp; giving me hope for patience, laughter, &amp; understanding. You cannot get any of that from a computer. Have a very pleasant day and thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Tracy Tucker</li>
            <li> Tiff-ny at Luminess Air was the most helpful customer service rep EVER!!! My experience with her was fabulous! Thank you Tiff-ny and Luminess Air for making this easy and fun!</li>
            <li> Portia in customer service was extremely courteous &amp; took the time to look into my account as I explained to her that I was having issues with the foundation feeling sticky on my face, that I had called prior &amp; trial was to be extended while following suggestions from Luminess Air.  I called back &amp; was still having the same issue, once again they worked with me &amp; sent me the matte foundation to try, which I just received 11/20 &amp; trial extended to 12/1.  Today I noticed that my credit card had been billed &amp; that&#x27;s when I spoke with Portia, she worked with her supervisor Sharon &amp; went above &amp; beyond rectifying the situation until I was satisfied.  Nowadays no one wants to go out of their way to do that...but I have to say that Portia&#x27;s customer service is A+++, as well as Sharon which reflects how Luminess Air conducts their business.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!</li>
            <li> Save your money. When I purchased the luminess system, I had.no idea it was a club that continues to charge your credit card. Totally disgusted.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Elizabeth and her supervisor for their help.  Your makeup and cream are great! I really love my Luminess Air! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I got my new Luminess air make up today and. I love the way it looks, customer service was helpful. I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> My experience today on the phone with Leszliee was refreshing. She was so helpful and is a valued employee to the Luminess company. She heard my concerns and directed me to new products which I look forward to using.</li>
            <li> Love it my makeup looks great.  I even lost screw from stylus whilst cleaning and they replaced the stylus free of charge.  The only problem I have had is so t h clogging.  I also wish makeup came in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Luminess Air, I received the most excellent customer service, they were very kind, professional made me feel wonderful, it&#x27;s my first time using the product and it&#x27;s excellent, I highly recommend Luminess Air to everyone for personal and business use..</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Luminess air airbrush machine and a ton of their makeup about a month and a half ago, and when I ordered it I decided to purchase the warranty plan (which I strongly recommend just to be on the safe side). Well I went to go put on my awesome makeup but this time sadly my airbrush machine wasn&#x27;t working properly &#x3D;( the make-up wasn&#x27;t coming out properly it was coming out it clumps.... So I was dreading to have to call Luminess air and having to explain to them what was going on and having to ask them if they would send me a new one because I have the warranty plan. Well to my shock it was a VERY pleasant and easy phone call! Unlike all the other warranty&#x27;s who beat around the bush and come up with a million reasons why their warranty doesn&#x27;t cover that problem (even though you paid for the warranty!) Luminess air wasn&#x27;t like that at all! They were very quick and understanding! The person I even talked to (whose name is Manny) was VERY pleasant and professional! Manny even said &amp;#34;I completely understand your frustration and I am on your side! I apologize for the inconvenience and your replacement is on the way!&amp;#34; Easy as that! The phone call was less than 10 minutes. They didn&#x27;t question me or anything. I was so shocked and pleased because I thought for sure this was going to be like jumping through hurdles but it wasn&#x27;t. I even asked to speak with Manny&#x27;s supervisor so I could tell her how please I was with their company and Manny&#x27;s performance. After I spoke with her I learned that Manny is new and just started working there not to long ago. WOW! He was so great and professional you would have thought he had been working there for years! I was and still am VERY pleased and amazed with the Luminess Air make-up and now their great customer service! I will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> I called into customer service today and spoke with Tonya Wilbur. She was so helpful and pleasant to deal with. I have very sensitive skin and she helped me find the perfect shade and makeup to use. Glad to see there is still good customer service out there!! Thank you SO much!!!</li>
            <li> I stupidly fell for the commercial and bought the whole system.  I don&#x27;t like it and of course can&#x27;t return it.  Its is SOOOOOO expensive all told -- about $400 (which they don&#x27;t say in the commercial).  Save yourself alot of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this system, I bought their nail polish system thru Livingsocial the first week of Feb.  it is now April 9 and although they have my money I don&#x27;t have what I paid for.  I called three times and just get the run around with non-existent tracking numbers, etc.  they said in Feb my order was being prepared to be shipped!  Horrible customer service and Livingsocial was also no help so BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my 12 year old son for Christmas.  He thought he was buying me a $30 gift, not realizing that was only the trial price.  When I started to see charges on my card and then read the fine print, I was astonished that they were going to charge nearly $400 for this system!  In NO WAY is it worth that amount - you can go online and buy a countertop air compressor (usually marketed for nail art) and air brush for about $100.  I called Luminess and they were AWESOME - they gave me the opportunity to keep the system for what I had already been charged (about $110) and they wrote off the rest. (I suspect because it&#x27;s really only worth about $100).  Anyway, that made me very happy.  I have had little glitches and troubles with the airbrush but each time I&#x27;ve called they&#x27;ve had a very easy, quick solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the makeup goes - I do like it, but I&#x27;m not totally convinced that it&#x27;s a lot better than other foundations.  In fact, I&#x27;ve recently tried the BB foundation by Maybelline and I really like it.  If you have blemishes to cover, you will need to use a concealer first and then apply the airbrush makeup.  What is nice about that is you can dab concealer where you need it and the airbrush smooths and evens out everything.  It is very light and even coverage, once you get used to using the airbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of helpful tips about the airbrush:  The tip of the airbrush has a twisting part that you can loosen or tighten.  That makes the spray change considerably so use this to adjust the flow and size of your brush.  Second, the back end of the brush (the part with the sticker on it that says watch DVD first) screws off and inside you will see a long needle.  This can come loose (also some screw bits to tighten there) and stick out too far.  It should be gently pushed all the way in (about 1 inch showing) and the nuts tightened up.  If the needle is loose the trigger will not work and the makeup will come shooting out on its own as soon as you put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent makeup system, good makeup product, but not far and away better than other foundation options.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but do to other reasons needed to cancel my membership today. Porche, my customer care representative was very nice, fast with her fingers and took care of that for me with a smile in her voice. I was really expecting some long sales pitch, but she understood. Big Kudos to the whole team for making all transactions easy. No worries about signing up with this membership, it&#x27;s as easy to get  out as it easy to sign up.</li>
            <li> First off, this product took 3 weeks to arrive.  When it did arrive it was broken.  The trigger on the stylus wouldn&#x27;t engage.  Luckily my husband is handy and he fixed it within seconds.&lt;br /&gt; Once I figured out how to use it I was disappointed with the results. The product claims to minimize the look of pores and wrinkles but seemed to have an opposite effect on me, exaggerating both.  I also had trouble matching the colors to my skin and when the color seemed to match with a test it would look way too dark with the finished look and the lighter colors would look blotchy.&lt;br /&gt; Finally, the coverage is nowhere near the flawless look they claim.  Maybe if you have flawless skin.  I have some hyper pigmentation and blemishes and if I applied enough to get the coverage I wanted it would end up looking cakey and thick and it would feel sticky.  I followed the directions to the T and made sure I applied it exactly how they said to do it but, no matter what, I would end up with exaggerated fine lines, pores, too dark and cakey looking coverage.  I&#x27;m bummed. I was hoping this was going to be as great as they claimed it was.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with blemishes or skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love your makeup, the way it makes my skin look so nice and smooth and clean, no blotchy spots any more.  Unfortunately I have come across a hardship and I can not afford it at this time, I called to cancel my auto ship and I got connected with a lady named Cathy I explained my troubles to her and said that I needed to cancel and she offered me another alternative. Not only did she help me to postpone any shipments but she got my last payment waved. She had no idea how blessed she made me feel and how much she helped me and I just wanted to commend her for her willingness to go above and beyond. She had such a pleasant voice and and even nicer attitude, Luminess Air has a valuable employee in Cathy and I hope you never let her go  Thank you again Cathy and I pray God blesses you.  Sincerely, Jeana Roth</li>
            <li> Anita in customer service was outstanding in clarifying questions about my makeup system and the terms.  Aside from being the best makeup I have ever used, the support and service I have received have been phenomenal! I waited a mere minute to speak with Anita over the phone and have been treated with exceptional service.  I could rave on all day- cheering for this company and their product- Im fairly convinced that women  like Sharon and Anita will keep this company booming, but the makeup, speaks volumes for itself.  Thank you! Thank you! - Jae</li>
            <li> I ordered the makeup and agreed to the terms and conditions even though I did not read them. My bad!  I called to cancel when I got the order confirmation and saw the terms &amp; conditions mean I agree to pay $69.99 a month for 5 months!  The customer service rep easily cancelled my order with no hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This Luminess Air Premium product is very nice.  I bought this systems for a gift .  I know this is a good  product because I bought one for my self.  When you spray on your make up It looks so nice and professional.  It&#x27;s so easy to apply, it only take a few minutes to apply, and your make up looks natural.  It comes  with a DVD that shows you how to use this air brush system and It&#x27;s affordable.  Yes I would recommend to my family,friends,and anyone  interested in purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> I got this system as a gift for Christmas and was completely unhappy with the results both times i tried it.  None of the foundation colors matched mt skin tone and did nothing in terms of coverage. HATED the bronzer as well was way to golden and resulted in a weird splotchy looking gold marks. because i got it as a gift by the time i could figure out how to return it (you have to reach them by phone... they do not answer your emails nor tell you where to send it back to without calling. inconvenient to say the least) it was past the 30 days. they basically told me that sucks your out of luck and there is nothing they could do about it. worst purchase i have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not really rating their equipment or their machine as I am not yet proficient enough to make a review. It isn&#x27;t as simple as described or shown - with a LOT of practice it might get better but that is NOT my complaint. My complaint is with the company service. At no time was I told that I would be put on a membership thing where makeup would be supplied on a regular basis. I do not use makeup a lot and this would never work for me. It said to write to cancel so both my daughter and I emailed the company to cancel. We were told we had to phone so my daughter phoned for both of us and when she was done thought she had it settled. Then she text me and said for me to phone to make sure mine was cancelled because it had said her issue was resolved and mine was part of her issue. I phoned to see if mine was cancelled and was told it was not I would have to phone back almost a month later to cancel. I told her my daughter had had hers cancelled and we ordered at the same time. She looked up my daughters account and there was nothing cancelled. This is a SCAM as far as I am concerned and it is very upsetting. On top of this when we ordered I had paid an extra %.95 for a rush delivery and my daughter had not and I got mine AFTER my daughter got hers. When I phoned about this I was told there was nothing they could do about it because we ordered on line? If I had ordered by phone they would have done something ? ? Like REALLY ???? Anyways I just want you to know their custom service is no service at all. I am sure if you are ordering more you get what you want but if you have a problem forget it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Luminess Air premium system and I absolutely love this product.  I have very fair sensitive skin so I was a bit concerned initially.  Once I received my system I began using it immediately and I absolutley love what it does.  My makeup still looks natural and the coverage is just right.  I would recommend this system to anyone I know that loves natural looking flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought this system for my sisters birthday and was kinda hesitant towards purchasing call in to get help to figure my sisters shade and the call center was absolutely PHENOMENAL like really they help me pick this perfect system for my sister and also was a helping hand towards service I recommend to to give it shot call in ask for help if you have questions my sister went from being insecure about her skin to now having a gorgeous personality just try it out you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Luminess Air is running a ripoff operation.  My wife signed up for a \\&quot;system\\&quot; and some products.  The \\&quot;system\\&quot; broke on the first attempt to use it.  I have called them at least 3 times attempting to cancel the whole deal.  The charges of $59.99 just keep on coming.  I just got off the phone with them again and they say they have cancelled our contract.  I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get them to stop with the monthly deductions.  I may have to close my bank account apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly advise anybody contemplating dealing with these guys to reconsider and save yourself a lot of grief.  My wife claims she never ordered anything from them but she must have agreed to a trial or something that automatically reverted to a \\&quot;membership\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a buyer beware example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this note spares somebody the grief we are dealing with.  They are into us so far for around $300.00.&lt;br /&gt;If this doesn&#x27;t stop now, small claims court will have to be the next step.  So far for $300.00 it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of small claims but after this it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Luminess products go, so far they are all in the trash as we waited \\&quot;too long\\&quot; to request a return authorization (RA).  Keep in mind that if you are already in this and want to cancel, get your \\&quot;RA\\&quot; immediately or they won&#x27;t accept any returns.  I hope the recycle people are happy with all this sh---t they are getting.</li>
            <li> I called Luminess Air about a misunderstanding and Tonya Willbur helped me with my situation. She was patient and kind and was very helpful. Although I was not 100% satisfied and other complications happened I am thankful that Tonya helped me out with everything. If you need customer assistance asked for Tonya! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Ok, before I order these &amp;#34;Seen on TV&amp;#34; things, I try and do some homework and read reviews. It&#x27;s boldly obvious that this feed had been seeded with Great Product and Awesome Customer Service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worse to see these true disappointed reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cheapest Luminess Air Brush system they offer. What I can say is this: #1: It DOES NOT \\&quot;take 10 years off you\\&quot; as their info-mercial &amp; ads say it does. #2: It DOES NOT give you a \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; completion again, as their info-mercial &amp; ads say it does. What it does do is this: #1: It gives you completely even make-up coverage - after you get the hang of using it. #2: The make-up itself has REAL staying power - it lasts until you take it off. #3: It&#x27;s a much quicker &amp; cleaner way to apply make-up. If you spray several, light coats of make-up, and let it dry in between coats, you get a good, even, matte coverage. I really like it. It works well for me &amp; I use it every day. I use the blush &amp; the eye shadow too - but you need to apply those FIRST before you apply the make-up. If you apply them AFTER you apply the make-up - they are too harsh &amp; looked caked on. The air-brush make up acts as a foundation &amp; a powder when you use it last. I ordered an \\&quot;eye shadow duo\\&quot; and they sent me the wrong colors. I called Customer Service and the woman was very nice &amp; helpful. They sent me out the two correct color eye shadows free of charge - and I got to keep the two wrong colors. If you are going to buy this product - buy the cheapest one they offer. There is no need to spend the extra money on the fancier ones - they do the same thing as the cheapest one. All in all, I really like it. If you take the time to get used to using it, and you follow my tips, you will be happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> WHERE DO I START? THE TV AD FOR $19.95 WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! FALSE ADVERTISING ! THE WORST FINANCIAL MISTAKE I HAVE EVER MADE!  FINE PRINT COST ME AROUND $400.00 ! ! !

            <li> Toni was a FANTABULOUs Person thank u  for all ur great work  u Rock</li>
            <li> Ordered the Luminess Air Airbrush pro system &amp; the customer service operator was amazing.  Chanty was very informative &amp; knowledgeable about all of their products. I had many questions. She was patient with me &amp; was eager to assist. She was professional but also warm, kind, &amp; personable.  She spoke clearly &amp; with confidence.  She did not pressure me to buy more products than I would need, &amp; on occasion would remind me the product was already in my starter kit.  She deserves 10 stars for a job well done.  It was apparent....she takes her work seriously &amp; loves what she does.  Shirl</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS FOR 29.95$ which of course they didnt mention on the TV add the machine cost an Extra 300$ then wanted to take it out of my account 70$ each month!! their a rip off and FALSE advertisement!! We all need to spread the word in every state on facebook for people not to buy this product it doesnt work that great either!!! LETS ALL STOP THIS BAD ADVERSISEMENT AND PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS OK LADYS</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say this system is G R E A T ! Very easy to handle and it does wonders. Everytime I called customer service they are always helpful and understanding. I want to thank Shannon and Dawn for all there help getting me this system and being helpful. Wonderful ladies! Thank you and if you dont have this system, please get one!</li>
            <li> Luminess Air Premium System is Fabulous and Truly gives my skin the look of a movie star walking the Red Carpet! Additionally, their ‚ÄúCustomer Service‚Äù is a flawless as their make-up system! Just moments ago I spoke with a Wonderful, Amazing Customer Service Representative by the name of Eric. Throughout the entire conversation, Eric was patient, kind, polite and highly knowledgeable. He not only resolved my technical issue, he also helped me identify the right color for my particular skin tone. Once describing my skin‚Äôs complexion, Eric realized that my skin tone is the same as that of Beyonce and Jenifer Lopez. And because Eric knows the product line so well, he was able to easily identify the exact color combination/number that I need to achieve a  flawless look each and every time I use the Luminess Air Premium System. Thus, by helping me identify my exact color, Eric‚Äôs taken the ‚Äúguess work‚Äù out of the ‚Äúmix‚Äù, no pun intended. In conclusion, I just want to say that in this busy world of Rush, Rush, Rush, it‚Äôs really nice to know there‚Äôs a company out there that still makes the effort to provide both a Great Product and Great Customer Service, 24/7/365! Thanks Luminess Air. I‚Äôll keep using your amazing products and ask all my friends to do so as well. Sincerely, Janine*</li>
            <li> THIS COMPANY CHARGED ME 4 TIMES IN ONE MONTH AFTER I HAD RETURNED THE PRODUCT BACK TO THEM, THEY SAID THEY WOULD REFUND THE MONEY BACK TO MY CARD BACK IN APRIL WHICH INFACT THEY DID NOT THEN JUST THE OTHER DAY SEPT.5TH OR AROUND THAT DATE A COLLECTION AGENT CONTACTS ME BY PHONE SAYING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED INFACT IT WAS BACK ON FEB. 6TH THEY DID NOT CONTACT ME TO INFORM ME OF THIS NOW THEY ARE TRING TO TELL ME IF I HAVE THE TRACKING NUMBER THEY WOULD GIVE ME A FULL REFUND, I NO LONGER HAVE THE TRACKING NUMBER FOR IT WAS SO LONG AGO. THIS COMPANY IS RUID THEY FRAUDLY TOOK OFF MY CREDIT CARD AN NOW ARE TRING TO AFTER ALL THIS TIME TRY TO SAY THEY DO NOT HAVE MY PRODUCT INWHICH THEY DO HAVE, THEY ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND THEY ARE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE HEAD MANAGE/ OWNER AN THEY KEPT ON PASSING THE PHONE AROUND TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THERE OFFICE I HAD TO TELL MY STORY TO THEM 4 DIFFERNT TIMES TO 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE TODAY. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY... IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEA OF WHAT ELSE I CAN DO I HAVE ALREADY WROTE TO THE BBB BUT AM REALLY NOT GETTING ANYWHERE PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this review on a complaint website. This same complaint happened to me today. I was charged 3 times this month. I called them and cancelled today. I am shocked at the customer service. I really love the product, but please don&#x27;t scam me out of my money. It is a dirty shame but I will be buying from a different company. I really hope their product is as good as Luminess.</li>
            <li> I was just about to order one of these and decided to read all your reviews.  Thanks, not getting one, I will keep my old face.</li>
            <li> This is an average airbrush system with a hefty price. After a few uses, the cheap plastic bottles that store the products break and leaks. This has happened to the eye shadow, blush, concealer and foundation I purchased. When purchasing, make sure you opt out of all the gimmicks they have or else you will be billed for it monthly. They have sent me random products and said I didn&#x27;t opt out so that that means I agreed. How I know i did not order it is that the shade is wrong.</li>
            <li> At first was totally in love with this product &amp; system, but boy have I changed my mind.  I liked the way the makeup looked and felt on my skin, but the actual unit &amp; stylus are awful.  I am on my 3rd Stylus, even upgraded to the $100.00 stylus and it broke in two days.  Am so tired of getting ready to put makeup on for work and then having to scramble because my system won&#x27;t work.  Phoned to be taken out of the \\&quot;makeup club\\&quot; and they just hit my account with charges and even though the makeup won&#x27;t be used, they still have to send it and i still have to be charged for it as makeup is a non-returnable item.  So i have bottles &amp; bottles of unopened makeup I can&#x27;t use that&#x27;s cost me a fortune.  Not happy at all with Luminesse Air&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to repost my even further disappointmetn with this company.  After having myself taken out of the makeup club, they hit my account yet again for makeup i have never received.  It also caused my checking account to be overdrawn.  When I phoned them to clear this up, they told me that they had to hit my account for one more charge as the makeup was still in shipping and the order could not be stopped; after being told last month that the order was already in shipping.  Basically the girl said she didn&#x27;t believe that that was what I was told the month before so actually calling me a liar in a very backhanded kind of way.  She did say she would authorize the return of the latest makeup to be returned to me.  Still does me no good. Can&#x27;t use the makeup because the unit doesn&#x27;t work, have so much unused makeup that it is ridiculous.  It will all be going back to them, but I&#x27;m sitll out a lot of $$ for a product and company that overall just SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> It took seeing the commercials for over a month and going to a womens conference on makeup before deciding to try this product out.  So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t gotten used to the system  yet.  I watched the DVD that came with the system (the only problem there is it was for the basic system and not the upgraded one I decided to try) and I&#x27;ve watched one You-tube video (but the lady doing it was a professional makeup artist - would get more from a regular person that wears makeup but doesn&#x27;t do it for a career).  But I&#x27;ve decided the only way I&#x27;m going to master this is continual use.  So I&#x27;m starting that this week.  This time my eyeshadow didn&#x27;t look like i was \\&quot;trying\\&quot; for the dramatic look during the day and I even tried the blush (which somehow i screwed up on the placement on one cheek - but was running late for work so just decided to try and brush it up - my boss thought i was red from being out in the sun).  I would really like to know the differences of the foundating that came with the kit vs the others.  I live in a hot humid environment, so i think this one makes my face look shiny (but I normally have dry skin - so is that good??).</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews are true. I usually never comment when I am dissatisfied with a product but I had to say something. I was extremely careful and delicate with the the machine.  In one night I realized it was not for me.  The tones did not match my skin. I returned the machine after 1 week. 2 weeks passed an I had not received a credit. I called customer service and the promptly told me I would not receive my $49.00 back cause there was a scratch on the stylus.  THAT IS A LIE AN THIS IS A BOGUS RIP OFF COMPANY AND I HOPE THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS SOON.</li>
            <li> I have never had such customer service! RIPP-OFFS!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,  TIME, AND NERVES! NOT WORTH the product! Luiminess company in Stafford TX, scams! Cannot express enough my frustration and wasted money and time!!!</li>
            <li> While the concept is great it still needs a little bit a work.  I have had trouble with the machine clogging, I rinse it out very well when I am finished.  I have started to clean it with dawn dish soap (diluted)and it seems to get some of the residue out.  Also, I have tried several types of airbrush makeup and they all look orange.  The one I found that I like the most doesn&#x27;t want to work with the system itself.  I think it maybe too thick but it said for the airbrush system.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of money invested in this machine and the makeup and if I had it to do over again....I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Wanting to cover up my mild acne and blemishes, I ordered the airbrush system.  First of all, it took three weeks to process and ship to my house.  When I tried it out, it took 4 coats (each taking 15-20 drops) to get good coverage. The makeup looked cakey and orange and felt gross.  After letting it \\&quot;dry\\&quot; for 30 minutes, I put a drop of water on my fingertip to see how well the makeup would hold up. When the drop of water touched the makeup, it literally dripped off my face.  The makeup is horrible quality and would never last a normal person all day.  It may work for indoor pictures, but that&#x27;s about it.  Definitely not worth the money.  And on top of that, their \\&quot;30-day risk free trial\\&quot; is a bunch of crap.  In very fine print, it states that if you want to return it, it has to be within 30 days of your initial PAYMENT.  So thanks to the fact that they took their sweet time (3 weeks!) processing and shipping it, I had only 7 days to decide I didn&#x27;t want it and send it back.  By the way, they won&#x27;t pay for return shipping, so I was out $15 on this deal.  SCAM!</li>
            <li> I spoke with Porsha and she was so professional.  She answered all of my questions and gave me dates to expect my payments to come out.  We had a nice conversation.  Overall she was pleasant, kind and very informative.  And I love my system!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I purchase Luminess Air through a Groupon deal and I am very disappointed in the way the company repeatedly charged my credit card when it was only suppose to be a one time deal.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasure speaking with you on the telephone.  I commend your employee on her politeness and caring customer service.  How very delightful and unexpected it was to find myself on the receiving end of this lady.  I will definitely use and recommend your company and products.  I love my Luminess Air Premium System and your nail products!</li>
            <li> I choose to rate for I also want to know how other&#x27;s feel as well.&lt;br /&gt; I feel like they are a joke only cause my total was $139.00 then I get in the mail I owe a total of $400 wtf!!&lt;br /&gt;I was never told there was another fee.&lt;br /&gt;The make-up worked fine for me but the price um NO! Ripe off!!!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer eyeshadow and blush not to be air brush.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer that to be my own.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think too much to airbrush all my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un Happy Customer for Luniness</li>
            <li> Awful product!!! Do NOT waste your money!!! I tried this system once it came out cakey on my skin doesnt cover like it claims. I called to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed and wanted my money back. They told me to send it back before my trial period was over, which I did. Not only did they charge  an additional 60$ on my credit card for the product. Now they are refusing to return my money after they already show the product was return, claiming I needed to call to tell them let them known I had return the product and it was in the mail. As though they can&#x27;t read my name and address on the return label. Never once was I told this by their representative. This is all after only using the product once. They obviously will do anything to keep your money! Complete scam!! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend order the luminess air make-up, at first I was a little upset but the makeup look so good on her that I didn&#x27;t mind purchasing it. She had some questions called luminess air customer service and they resolved the issue very quickly. They were excellent. From a mans point of view I would recommend luminess air make-up to everyone. Thanks</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money. No matter how you follow the video&#x27;s and book. You use 3 to 4 (or more) times the drops they say to use. The bottles are plastic and break easily and also upon ordering, or come already broken. Hope they send you what you order.  Many friends are ordering #3 and they are sent #4. The instructions for cleaning the machine are poor, and really bad to follow. Ordering the makeup is a revolving circle where your not sure if your order goes through for a while.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Luminess for my Birthday in June and It arrived within the 10 business days promised. At first It was a bit overwhelming and I had questions about my bill. I called their US customer service line and got to speak to one of the Supervisors, Shannon. She was a doll, helped me understand my bill and even gave me some helpful tips on how to use my airbrush system. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I had to redo my face the first couple of times but after a few days I got a hang of it. I love how the makeup feels so light and gives me a flawless finish, I also use their blush and l love it! &amp;#34;Happy Birthday to ME&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this system, my makeup is smooth and flawless.  The application is simple enough, but customer service is always super helpful when I&#x27;ve needed a little extra direction with my system.  Good product, great company.</li>
            <li> Lakeisha was so helpful!! I love the abundance of joy she gave while helping me. She made it so quick and easy. I loved the customer service and I&#x27;m glad that she helped me. Not to mention, I got a great deal. The shades fit my complexion so well. Luminess air is my favorite system ever!!!</li>
            <li> Tigeria,&lt;br /&gt; I spoke with a customer service representative for Luminess Air named Tigeria this morning.  I was confused about more than one thing and this sweet, sweet lady took the time to answer all of my questions and made me feel like my business counted to Luminess Air.  A very rare thing these days. &amp;#34;Customer Service&amp;#34; has gone out the window with the age of new technology, but she took care of me!  I was able to find what I wanted and order it and got more information on how to get the best results with my product.  She is knowledgeable about the products, which is another rare thing!!  I love the air brush system and now that I&#x27;ve talked to Tigeria and have a better understanding, I&#x27;m sure I will be a customer for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it,..false advertising and you have to pay to return it for a refund in an unreasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> The first system they sent was never recieved so they shipped me another one.  I used it for 3 weeks and didnt like it. It wasnt as easy as they make it look.  I call to return it and I find out that they flagged my system as not returnable! Now they are saying I have two systems and the lady refused to tell me whether or not I will be charged TWICE or not.  I finally got a return # so I am going to return it and let my bank deal with it if they keep charging me.</li>
            <li> I spoke with Coreena, she was very good, kind, helpful and thoughtfull. She helped me get the correct color choice for my skin tone and it matched perfectly. I love my luminess air and their great customer service.</li>
            <li> Just a few words can&#x27;t describe the way Helga and April went above and beyond to create a customer for life!!! A problem originated with our US Postal Service (need I say more?) these  2 Outstanding representatives took complete ownership  and made a very frustrating situation into a most memorable experience. I appreciate the way they went above and beyond to ensure that  my first experience with LuminessAir was not darkened by events of no fault of their own.</li>
            <li> Apparently, when you buy a system from luminess you are required to join their club where they send you make up automatically and charge your credit card.  You must call them before this happens or you are stuck with the payment.  My make up came in a flimsy bag and one of the liquid bottles was broken.  The make up spilled all over.  Buyer beware!!!!!!</li>
            <li> horrible product, horrible service, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> The girl that helped me was fantastic.  Her name was Porscha.  She was awesome.  Curtious, helpful.</li>
            <li> My stylus broke after a couple of months.  After trying to fix my stylus with their instructions, it would work for a while then broke again.  They sent me a new one but it has an additional part which does not fit my machine.  I think the part was made to help with the stylus problems but since it doesn&#x27;t fit, it won&#x27;t be much good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service was only mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try another machine if you can find one that works.</li>
            <li> Ladies, you can buy a nice quality air brush compressor and artist tips for around $80 elsewhere on Amazon. Just buy one and the make up separately, then you don&#x27;t have to buy this terribly over priced system and deal with this company&#x27;s apparent sneaky tactics.</li>
            <li> I just want to say thank you for all of your hard work.  You&#x27;re a blessing, I LOVE the system and how it works, it is the only makeup I can find to match my complexion perfectly! Lakeisha was so helpful, she took the time to color match my foundation perfectly! Thank you for working with me! I will always be a happy Luminess Air customer! With much gratitude, and many thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased Luminess Air and when my credit card statement came, I was charged $69.99 for the trial security deposit and another $34.91 for ordering the system.  Warning!  If you decide to return the system, you will only be reimbursed the $69.99 security deposit.  I had the system for 3 days and decided to return it and am out $34.91 for 3 days use.  What a rip off!!  No more infomercial purchases for me!</li>
            <li> I received the system in the mail, I wanted to try it right then I was so excited! And I loved it!!!! So I knew I was going to use the trial and keep it!!! But a week later had some problems with my car and knew I wouldn&#x27;t have the money : ( So I called to get the RA #, and talked to a very nice woman named LESZLIEE who helped me figure out how I could keep the system!!! She talked to me as a friend not a customer and understood the problems I was having, together we figured a way that to keep the machine!!! I was so happy!!! I love the make up and I love the staffs positive attitude! thanks LESZLIEE and thanks luminesss air. Customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> My dealings with LuminessAir was very professional I phoned referencing an issue I perceived I would have to battle for and to the contrary;  I spoke with a very kind &amp; understanding representative by the name of Anita.  Anita serviced the call calmly which gave me confidence she knew exactly what she was doing in customer satisfaction.  She completed the call with my total amazement in a matter of minutes.  Awesome!  I ask for her Manager Sharon and she was excited for Anita and very pleased.  Please inform Anita I appreciate her exceptional service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a very satisfied customer. Linda R.</li>
            <li> I have had my system since December 2014 I have yet to use all of the make up that came with the first delivery. This being said I now have 11 bottles of makeup and called to see what could be done about it. The sale rep was very helpful and we came to a great agreement. She was nice and was able to help me get my payments lower and not have make up sent to me every other month. I am so please with my Luminess now that I can afford it... Thanks Cathy for all your help.</li>
            <li> I had the honor and pleasure of speaking with an extremely knowledgeable and lovely sales representative named &#x27;Angelica&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was floored by her level of customer service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars across the board Angelica!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BTW, there&#x27;s only one way and that&#x27;s the Luminess Air way!!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon J.</li>
            <li> I want to thank katelyn for being the kindest and best sales person I have ever talked to. I was ready to send your procduct back if was not for her sales experience and kindness. She is the best. Please tell her that I received the makeup and that I absolutely love it. I will be calling her to order more products!!!</li>
            <li> I love my Luminess air!!!!!!! I didnt think Id like it because of all the negative reviews Ive read up on.  I cant express enough that people have to remember that when people who purchase products that  upset them....they are more apt to take the time to whip out their computers and vent their anger.  This is why I decided to take the time and give the product some good recognition!  Luminess Air is awesome!!! No, I do not work for the company  nor am I affiliated with them in any personal way.  I love the product.  For those of you who do not read and realize that there is a care that goes along with the product in order to keep it maintained, well, then you get what you ask for.  I maintain mine and follow the directions.  Customer service is excellent experience for me.  Of course a good product costs money and nothing is free, you get what you pay for, but well worth it.  I have not experienced Luminess ripping me off money which I did not consent to in the first place.  And for those of you with complications in this dept, maybe one should think that perhaps they misunderstood and should had asked questions.  It is a 30 day free trial and there is nothing to lose! I love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> The compressor was broken when we tried to start the program. It wouldn&#x27;t even start! DON&#x27;T Buy it! Buy another airbrush system and NOT this one!</li>
            <li> After seeing the infomercial on Luminess Air I decided to try it.  When I called to place my order I was told it would be a free 30 day trial and I would be charged $29.95 plus S&amp;H every two months.  I opted for fed-ex delivery which was $14.95.  Imagine my surprise when the post office delivered it to my house.  To make matters worse when I checked my bank account they had already taken out a payment and I still hadn&#x27;t rec&#x27;d it.  When I called to find out why since it was supposed to be free for thirty days I was told it was a security deposit.  Ok, I could live with that because I just knew it was going to be wonderful. I was so WRONG!!! The make up they sent wasn&#x27;t dark enough and I had an orange glow after it dried.  I called to get a darker color which arrived promptly but I then had an even darker orange glow.  At this point I decided the system wasn&#x27;t for me and called to cancel. The rep I talked to said they can&#x27;t resell the system so if I wanted I could keep it they and would zero my balance out. I had also ordered the tanning system that I didn&#x27;t use, was charged for, and was told that I wouldn&#x27;t get any of that money back only the security deposit. I had found a similar product on Amazon and decided to keep the system for spray tanning. I was supposed to receive an email with all of the details showing my new balance but never rec&#x27;d it. I called again the following day and that rep told me I would have gotten all of my money back except $60 but since it was considered a final sale it was done.  Don&#x27;t believe anything they tell you. I will do my shopping with Amazon from now on and if they don&#x27;t have it I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> If the company continues to automatically withdraw payments from your account go to the bank and stop the payments.</li>
            <li> I love this product now. I had trouble with the wand not working right so I called customer service and Dawn fixed a small problem and so far it&#x27;s working great. I also didn&#x27;t remember that I had also signed up for an every two month additional refill (the price is so much less thru the club). I told them I don&#x27;t think I will need it that frequently and Dawn changed it to every 4 months. She was very helpful with giving me some additional info and she was so nice. It was a great customer service experience. By the way I went in the ocean with it on and it didn&#x27;t wash off although with my facewash it washes off easily. That was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have acne problems and any other make up i use makes me break out but this has done wonders for my skin! I will never wear any other make up again.</li>
            <li> Fabulous makeup, looks so natural.  The customer service rep Tonya is Excellent!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product based on my experience. Their customer service is absolutely HORRID! I also believe it is actually the makeup itself that clogs the machine. The stylus kept clogging so much that I purchased a new one, only to have it happen again and again, even after taking the thing apart and cleaning it thoroughly. I then decided to discontinue using Luminess and I purchased the Dinair system, which has been around longer. Dinair however doesn&#x27;t spend money on infomercials like Luminess and they have great customer testimonials and reviews. Dinair has a citrus airbrush cleaner that you can use to maintain the system as well as additional tools, i.e., a docking jar, rinse jars and cleaner brushes, to name a few. On top of that it was less expensive, they seem to have a MUCH wider selection of colors and they have a TON of other cool things/ways to use the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I alternated between both machines and at the same time alternating between the two company&#x27;s makeup in them. The Luminess product clogged both machines, no matter which I used. The Dinair product NEVER clogged -- in either machine. My daughter wound up purchasing the Dinair product based on my review and experience. Hopes this helps someone. Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> it took too long to put on, looked horrible and wiped right off with tissue!!  my 3 year old daughter was laughing at me every time that i came out with a new shade trying to match my face.  at least we had fun laughing at the results.  i do hate that i&#x27;m out $50 though!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOVE my new Luminess Air Professional System!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 days now and Really like the coverage it provides....weightlessly!!  I will be honest, I&#x27;m the girl who watched Every Youtube video pertaining to Luminess Air (their videos, people&#x27;s reviews, video blogs, etc) before trying it for the first time.  95% of the reviews were positive and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  I learning how to contour my face the way I like with the system (obviously it&#x27;s a little different than with brushes) but the foundation is Flawless!  To top it off, I just called in to Customer Service with a billing question and Tonya and Ms. Sharon were SUPER nice, professional, and informative.  I even wound up asking How-To questions while I was talking to Tonya because she was just so informative and helpful and she was able to give me tips on how to better use the system to not accentuate the small lines in my forehead!!  From the billing dept?!  AWESOME!!!  I would TOTALLY recommend this system to anyone and also say, &amp;#34;trying something new might seem a little nerve racking but it is SUPER Easy and definitely worth it!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my Luminess Air stylus and called their Customer Service for help.  Cathy was the Customer Service Agent.  She was patient, took the time to walk me through fixing it on the phone with me; however, I could not do it.  She then directed me to their web site with detailed instructions on line.  After a few minutes of that, I expressed my frustration.  Cathy then offered to send me a brand new stylus, free of charge, 2-day delivery plus a few more offerings that I did not even request.  I was so impressed with what she was willing to do to make me a happy customer.  Throughout the conversation, Cathy was patient, professional and knowledgeable.  Luminess Air, you have a precious gem for an employee named Cathy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say how wonderful my experience was with Tonya, the gracious, patient, intelligent customer service representative for Luminess Air!  I purchased the system about a month ago, and after experimenting with the colors and learning how to use the airbrush, I was ready to place an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had lots of questions.  Tonya was so helpful!  She shared with me her own experiences with Luminess and how to coordinate the colors.  Since she is a user, she understood my needs -- better than I did -- and she shared some finer points and &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; ideas.  She introduced me to other reasonably priced Luminess products that would resolve my objectives of (1) getting even coverage (Eraser), and (2) how to clean the equipment (TipTop cleaner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three more things Tonya did that I loved:  I&#x27;m so grateful that she let me know about products that are currently on sale; she arranged to give me a one-time courtesy discount after I misunderstood the price of a particular item; and she also arranged for me to receive a very generous discount on the Luminess airbrush itself!  This meant so much!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this superior level of customer service, I feel much more confident as I transition to airbrushed makeup.  Tonya deserves a lot of credit for enhancing my experience -- on so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I would say that I really like the Luminess Air System.  It gives me a better, more natural appearance.  I&#x27;m making some changes in my professional life, and I need to look polished and to be consistent about it.  With practice, I&#x27;m getting faster and more adept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, people are saying, &amp;#34;You look good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ordered the Luminess Air Gel Nail Polish Elite Kit.  When it arrived, they had sent the lesser version of the LED light, which was broken!  The light was not attached and loose in the compartment.  On the sheet included with my order, it said to check the manual (which was not sent to me) or to call their customer care number.  I called and spoke to a woman named Cathy.  She informed me that they would send me the correct light (that I ordered in the first place) but that I would need to send the one I have back to them in the packaging of the new unit they will send.  I asked how the return shipping would be provided and she told me that I would not only have to take it to the post office to mail it, but that I would have to pay for the return shipping.  When pressed, she said they would reimburse the shipping cost (up to $5.00) if I faxed or emailed the receipt to them.  I am VERY disappointed in this company.  Not only did they send me the less expensive version of the light, but it arrived broken, and then they want me to run an extra errand and pay to have their mistake returned to them.  I mentioned that I have a newborn and it would be difficult to get to the post office, and she recommended that I ask someone to do it for me and that it is the best she can offer.  When I asked to speak to her manager, she told me she was a supervisor and \\&quot;everyone is busy on the phone now anyway.\\&quot;  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. On top of the broken light, the polishes and remover are TINY!  When pictured they seem to be much larger than what you actually receive.  I can definitely see why this company feels the need to make all sales final!  Otherwise, everyone would be returning their products.</li>
            <li> Luminuss Air is charging my credit card for things I didn&#x27;t receive!! On 1/21/2013, my credit card was charged $24.97 for my 30 day trial of Luminuss Air. On 1/28/2013, 7 days later and before I received my trial, Luminuss Air charged my credit card an additional $59.99 for products I never received. On 3/19/2013, I received an e-mail that said that I owed them $319.95 and pay within 24 hours or they would report me to credit agencies. It was A NASTY email in which they told me that if I did not pay within 48 hours, I would not be able to purchase a house, car or obtain credit. I guarantee that I have received nothing but the trial. With my busy work schedule, I have not even had time to try the product. Beware, don&#x27;t give your credit card information to this company! They will screw you!</li>
            <li> I had wanted the luminess system for years.  so for my birthday i finally broke down and ordered it.  i was watching an infomercial offering a 19.99 thirty day trial.  i figured it was a small investment to finally see if the system worked as i dreamed and imagined it would.  after ordering the sytem i was checking my bank account online and found that there were multiple charges to luminess air..  i thought they made a mistake so i called their customer service as was told that the 64.00 charge was a security deposit plus tax.  i was NEVER informed of a security deposit.  only the payment plan which i agreed to of 54.00 per month starting AFTER the trial period had ended.  this was a huge disappointment and seems illegal.  when i received the kit, i was so excited i immediately read the instructions and learned how to use it before i started.  once the machine was on and in put the \\&quot;4 drops\\&quot; they say is sufficient I found that it requires more like 20 drops to do ANY covering whatsoever.  you have to put the makeup everywhere in order for it to not be obvious, and in doing so you will use up a massive amount of makeup and feel like a sticky bun. and...for those of you with peach fuzz, this is not for you.  the makeup adheres to peach fuzz first and you look like a paintbrush, not airbrushed.  its a garbage system. the makeup feels just like any regular \\&quot;no-transfer\\&quot; makeup.  sticky, uncomfortable and looks just bad.  then when you wash it off, you can not believe how much makeup was on your face.  i never was able to accomplish a face i would go outside with, just kept trying.  the makeup vials are extremely small.  this is junk.  save your money.</li>
