            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>

            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise a great dryer</li>
            <li>Great for doing my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I was so bummed when it went out, I was happy to see that they had it for sale on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But it works great.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to have my very own &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>Hair dryers like this with the brush type attachment aren&#x27;t very popular</li>
            <li>it has been a very nice unit...</li>
            <li>but this dryer with the comb piece is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I now own 3 of those!</li>
            <li>Okay, so this dryer is absolutely AWESOME.</li>
            <li>this one is the one I love the best.  </li>
            <li>My mother used to have a hair dryer like this when I was a kid, it was bright orange</li>
            <li>If you like this style of dryer, a good value</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this hair dryer twice and gotten really good results.</li>
            <li>and I have good memories of it.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a good pair of earplugs.</li>
            <li>the price was so good to keep on hand</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>MY HAIR FEELS GOOD AFTER,.</li>
            <li>good value</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, has dual voltage and a good brush, good heat, doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>what good is that if I am buying it for the brush?</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly hair</li>
            <li>My friend loved it and her hair is not as curly as mine.</li>
            <li>And I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>the plus side: the price is good.  </li>
            <li>This Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic styler with 3 attachments works really good.</li>
            <li>Each one I&#x27;ve had has lasted for a good number of years and has seen it&#x27;s share of abuse.</li>
            <li>It is a good hair dryer and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer works exceptionally well</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the heat and how quick do i get the result i want.</li>
            <li>excellent product, works great, great price, Target didn&#x27;t have it on the shelf locally but they sell it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was very glad to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt&amp;#60;&amp;#60; AND IM VERY PLEASED WITH ITS POWER.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the great service when purchasing it .....</li>
            <li>the most important one the roller brush doesn&#x27;t even stay on for three minutes!!!</li>
            <li>The body of the dryer is quite good and does an excellent job, but the attachments are pure garbage, making the product a loser.  </li>
            <li>the price was good and fair nothing more to say</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the blow dryer!</li>
            <li>and I have been using this hairdryer for more than 30 years!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>It functions great, drys well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The dryer is great and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - heat variance is great.  </li>
            <li>Great hair dryer and brush is good for my curly hair, helps straighten without the frizz and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used this before and find it to be just as amazing now.</li>
            <li>but it was amazing.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t actually own it YET.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is excellent and I use it every day for a fast hair drying experience.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m all grown up and doing hair on my own</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a lot of control over the end result of my efforts (to be honest with you</li>
            <li>What more can I say then if it works then good for you...</li>
            <li>and was overjoyed to discover I could order the style he liked .</li>
            <li>the vent flip is nice for cleaning.</li>
            <li>WHEN THE WARM AIR GOT TO THEM.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use another type of dryer but this kind.  </li>
            <li>Nice, compact, convienient.</li>
            <li>It does a really nice job on her hair and even somewhat straightens it if she uses the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>The item was delivered in the manufacturers box with now wrapping of any kind.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered by a girl in her own car.  </li>
            <li>love this dryer, perfect for when you want your hair straight.</li>
            <li>Really good value for money, although it would be better if it had more than two heat settings.</li>
            <li>Output is great and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic powerful dryer that distributes heat evenly drying hair to perfect with no flyaways.</li>
            <li>Love, love!</li>
            <li>Love the product and love the price!</li>
            <li>However, with that said, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20-$30 annually or semiannually to replace it because of the great straigthening results.</li>
            <li>It is a good item, however it is a HUGE hassle to get replacement combs.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair dryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of glad</li>
            <li>This makes blowdrying my hair so easily!</li>
            <li>Love, love love it!</li>
            <li>old fashion type hair dryer which is still the best type for many people.</li>
            <li>I have never used another hair dryer where I didnt have to straighten my hair after to make it look more smooth and straight, but this hair dryer leaves it perfect</li>
            <li>The brush and comb attachment leaves you with very smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>I also made for a very smooth and shiny finish to my hair.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is easy to use and the comb options are nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this type of hair dryer for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li>and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better straightening blow dryer for under $50.     </li>
            <li>1875 Ionic Styler/ Dryer - Quieter than most hair dryers</li>
            <li>works excellent now; however, only one attachment can be used.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and then it worked ok.</li>
            <li>(I made sure not to cover any vents.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I like this hairdryer because so far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found to smooth my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I was glad when I got this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried to snap the brush in place, it continues to come off while I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dryer.</li>
            <li>this product would have been much better if it came with just one permanent brush instead of three snap-ons.</li>
            <li>Sometimes simpler is better.</li>
            <li>This is an okay dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>am extremely satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love drying and styling my hair this way and hope they never discontinue this model.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty purchase of the year.</li>
            <li>lovely do you sell dvd</li>
            <li>This product seems to work better on wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this model of hair dryer for many years.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair dryer of all time.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has the brush attachment.</li>
            <li>You can use these so much better than with a separate brush and hair dryer, particulary, if you are doing it youself.  </li>
            <li>I threw the box away before using it because I didn&#x27;t think there would be an issue since I have used this dryer so many times.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist used this on my hair, and I loved the results so much I bought my own.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift for my sister and she love it.</li>
            <li>It does not stay on no matter how many times I reattach.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a morning changer :-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this style dryer for many years and never wanted to change until now.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>and I was worried that I would not be able to find one with a comb attachment.  </li>
            <li>Glad you still carry it and that they still make it.</li>
            <li>I love how it styles however</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one if these blow dryers for many years until it gave up.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s time to replace it with a better one.</li>
            <li>have been using this style of hair dryer for many years.  </li>
            <li>It does not even attach to the body any longer (so that it can fall off one more time).  </li>
            <li>More correctly, I drilled four holes in the brush attachment, so that the bolts are, in effect, squeezing the attachment so that it is clamping itself to the body of the dryer (and cannot come out of the slots it is supposed to ride in).  </li>
            <li>I love this styler in theory.  </li>
            <li>I love this blowdryer because it has the brushes with it.  </li>
            <li>So I can get more body in my hair while drying it.  </li>
            <li>I love connair hair dryers and Stylers and have Been using them since i Was a kid.</li>
            <li>, I love it as I do not like the blower types.</li>
            <li>Love to use the brush attachment for this dryer.  </li>
            <li>and, boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>maybe because I thought paying more meant better quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Conair 1875 hair dryer for years and have always been pleased however, they&#x27;ve updated this model and now the brush attachment falls off.</li>
            <li>This one is exactly like the first one I had and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so glad that i purchase it</li>
            <li>But once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The second one works perfect.</li>
            <li>read many reviews, here and elsewhere before I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I enjoy using my conair styler!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Use an antifrizz product, It is better that way.</li>
            <li>I will buy more ...</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I wish the brush attachment was even stiffer and more substantial.  </li>
            <li>Yes, make the brush even stiffer with more bristles</li>
            <li>hence the 4 star:-)</li>
            <li>I love these hair dryers, but the brush keeps falling off this one.</li>
            <li>I have used the Conair model for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love my conair 1875 watt</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer because of the shape.  </li>
            <li>The end is just like you hairbrush, so drying your hair is more efficient.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is more designed for men than women.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Works great, the clips sometimes fall off but other than that its great.</li>
            <li>When the conair gets hot the combs, or brush keeps falling off!!!</li>
            <li>Comb attachment works great and gets hair very straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I have been searching for a dyer and brush two in love for a long time</li>
            <li>The good: This styler dryer has saved me so much time and frustration!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is pretty good at not frying it out and manages to do it in a manageable time (about 30 minutes, but I have a LOT of hair).</li>
            <li>The brush won&#x27;t stay on, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good, but I bought it for the brush feature.</li>
            <li>one is nice, has 2 heat settings and a cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>When my old hair dryer broke, I was delighted to be able to purchase this model again!</li>
            <li>okay - but doest seem as strong as i need for my hair.</li>
            <li>I prefer the fine comb, which straightens better.</li>
            <li>I am trying vidal Sassoon now which I am sure will be fine.</li>
            <li>This dryer allows me to blowout my own hair beautifully with awesome shiny flips in 15 min just by taking wet sections &amp; brushing them till dry.</li>
            <li>This is my second dryer - very good dryers.  </li>
            <li>have only used it twice but very good so far.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend this item.</li>
            <li>Competitor, Andis, makes an great ceramic dryer and replacement combs are VERY easy to find in stores and online, however my Andis dryers have not lasted as long, I end up spending more replacing the dryers themself than the combs.  </li>
            <li>Conair needs to pay attention to their customer reviews/complaints, and make the brush a better fit for the dryer.</li>
            <li>The insert, or grooves need to be deeper so the attachments will stay on more secure.</li>
            <li>My wife is using it as a really good and fast dryer /</li>
            <li>it works great on my thick hair, dries quickly, and using the comb attachment gives me the control I need for drying my own hair, without having it fly all over the place.  </li>
            <li>I had a wonderful previous model for many years that died</li>
            <li>I loved this dryer to begin with, it works very quickly and smoothed out my curly hair really well.</li>
            <li>But other than that is is one of the best hair dryers I have used.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to straighten out my hair.  </li>
            <li>It straightens your hair easily without pulling, handles well in your hand.</li>
            <li>Its easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to use both at home and for travel.   </li>
            <li>Its easy to handle too</li>
            <li>We take it everywhere with us, the power converging is making it easy to travel with it.</li>
            <li>The styler has plenty of power and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fluffs hair without using a separate brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip</li>
            <li>However, it is easy to grip</li>
            <li>but  can&#x27;t find them as easily at the retail stores.  </li>
            <li>It comes off too easy.</li>
            <li>ie it runs and heats just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li>2 of the attachments work fine.</li>
            <li>It was working fine, but the teeth in the combs started breaking</li>
            <li>I used to have a 3 speed, lower wattage dryer that worked fine until it died.</li>
            <li>because i have fine hair</li>
            <li>I love it so much - I bought tHree!!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is a great buy, and it works well, if you are looking to simply \\&quot;dry\\&quot; your hair.</li>
            <li>and I need the brush to get that smooth finish that I like.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use the brush.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd dryer like this I have and it is great.</li>
            <li>I also noticed this styler is available at CVS, Walgreens and Harmons.  </li>
            <li>CHEAP, FLIMSY, DID NOT HOLD UP.</li>
            <li>They last 1-2 years and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great - hubby uses it daily!!!</li>
            <li>The brush attachment started falling off after one use and there is no way to secure it.  </li>
            <li>Great product that smoothes your hair instantly.</li>
            <li>I have never had to make a exchange with amazon but this time it worked smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you smooth out your hair, you must have this dryer-period.</li>
            <li>I got this one, because I was so happy with the same brand, etc.</li>
            <li>I hope to always find this product available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The ionic dryer allows for great movement with the replacable brush heads to create different styles</li>
            <li>Wife likes the brush with the bristles - most stylers do not have this - have used this brand over several years&lt;br /&gt;and has proven to be a good product</li>
            <li>However, this time the brush isn&#x27;t fitting right.</li>
            <li>So, all-in-all, I love this dryer for all the right reasons.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, you saved the day again!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and I never have to set my hair.</li>
            <li>The brush clips on fine when the dryer is cool.</li>
            <li>This a pretty good hair blower for the money I pied, and the styling brushes really work.</li>
            <li>My complaints are the brush falling off, like most everyone else mentions, and the fact that it gets so hot.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is fine; it doesn&#x27;t overheat and yet it still drys quickly.</li>
            <li>But I still think it is worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>From the reviews I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>amaaaaaazing i love it, so easy and fast specially when i divide my hair to quarters</li>
            <li>With the popularity of straight hair, it is so easy with the brush attachment!</li>
            <li>I have it attached by hair bands and it less than ideal.</li>
            <li>Sender shipped extremely quickly and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>While using it this week (and I do not use it every day), it started making a very funny sound and stopped working.  </li>
            <li>They ALWAYS melt on top side where brush attaches and get super hot.  </li>
            <li>I love the dryer the attachment kit to large want buy again</li>
            <li>I immediately went right on to Amazon to search for a replacement and received it yesterday!  </li>
            <li>Excellent version of this hard to find in stores hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great for getting knots out of wet hair.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is great on time i finished in 15 min my hair being soaking wet.</li>
            <li>Some reviews said the brush falls off, I did not find this to be true.</li>
            <li>To remedy this, I use the cool shot button after drying each section of hair.  </li>
            <li>I will say you need to make sure you use a heat protectant because the heat very concentrated and close to the hair.</li>
            <li>It is true that the brush does not want to stay attached, but I reattached it with duct tape and it never fell off again.</li>
            <li>I had this same hair dryer for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good basic dryer.  </li>
            <li>I took my old brush and put it on my new blow dryer and it works great.</li>
            <li>I broke the old one because the new one works great and was inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get my hair so straight, so quickly, than with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It creates a smooth style with just the right amount of volume.  </li>
            <li>It makes a high pitched noise on both hot and warm.</li>
            <li>Seriously would super glue it if I thought it would work!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly as it straightens.</li>
            <li>For a male with short hair it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this one was defective, or they all wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it dries my hair quickly and has the brush attachment for the ability to style while drying</li>
            <li>It has variable speed and temperature and gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>The attachments do not seem to securely attach to the body of the unit and the fan does not seem to blow as strong as the older model.  </li>
            <li>Seller expressed regret and helped make arrangements to return quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conair has been manufacturing this same brush design and styler for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>quick and efficient....</li>
            <li>Ok, it didn&#x27;t really die, but it started overheating right away</li>
            <li>This one is the perfect size for styling while you dry and it leaves my hair soft and in much better condition than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this model, and was very satisfied both time.</li>
            <li>were far superior to others as far as the brush attachment staying secure on the dryer.  </li>
            <li>The machine is great as allwAys but the accessory falls down.</li>
            <li>The whole process goes very quickly this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great if you have long straight hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>That said, this is a great tool to quickly dry curly hair and make it straight.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and dries hair quickly and frizz free.</li>
            <li>works for natural black hair perfectly!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little dryer with lots of power.  </li>
            <li>accurate description , thanks</li>
            <li>wow this styler is all that and more.</li>
            <li>So far, my favorite is this one,</li>
            <li>and he wasn&#x27;t having much success styling his hair using a \\&quot; nozzle\\&quot; style hair dryer without a brush attachment .  </li>
            <li>So powerful and with the brush attachment</li>
            <li>The drier itself is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have had hair dryers like this in the past that work beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I should give this zero stars, but only because I bought this kind of blow dryer specifically for the brush attachment and the brush does not stay on at all.</li>
            <li>My old con air that gave up the roast after 30 years was light, fit my had</li>
            <li>So glad I can buy several online and that they are still available.</li>
            <li>&quot; is that every time I use it the dryer is so powerful my lights go out</li>
            <li>Nice to know Conair actually cares about quality...</li>
            <li>Wish there was a way to get the strong air power without the temperature getting so high.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works great and doesn&#x27;t short out / over heat like many of the other brands do.</li>
            <li>also dries hair super fast!</li>
            <li>Very nice and heavy duty product.</li>
            <li>Is very gentle on her hair, much better than her old one.</li>
            <li>It slipped right off, popped right off, drove me nuts.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>The brush literally just falls right off.</li>
            <li>I am a right arm amputee</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I kept the old dryer attachments and that they fit this new model.</li>
            <li>The first few uses this dryer worked great.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to put some product in your hair and separate it into sections properly to ensure a good blow dry.  </li>
            <li>When the brush wears out it is just about as cheap to order a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>It came highly recommended by my cousin and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>In comparison, I found that the Vidal Sassoon model shorts easily and pops, and its brush bristles are complete garbage.     </li>
            <li>This is the only kind of dryer I can ever use to blow my hair straight</li>
            <li>, I found out you can also easily order replacement combs by calling them directly.  </li>
            <li>this makes drying fast and leaves my hair straight and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>, this makes it easier for me to dry my own hair.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use, old school hair dryer.</li>
            <li>While you are using the styling brush, it gets warm and consequently loose.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I may buy another and give it another chance, but not cool to have to replace it so quickly!</li>
            <li>So if you can help me with this problem I would very much appreciate it.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a bursh and it is very fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wattage makes your drying time very fast.   </li>
            <li>By the way, I am a 68 year old guy, who is very happy to have enough hair to dry.</li>
            <li>This dryer is one of the better dryers I have used with a big BUT.</li>
            <li>The conair hair dryer with brush attachment has been my favorite hairdryer for the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>and it works great on really thick hair too.  </li>
            <li>This is my 5th or 6th Conair and I love it as it is the only dryer that I know that is attached to the brush</li>
            <li>i had one exactly like this one</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot if you want a fast dryer.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>it dryes fast, and leaves my hair with a straight, soft, and healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li>I had to hot</li>
            <li>Brush falls off when hot.</li>
            <li>$19.99 for something that I use every day and will last almost a decade is a worthwhile purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my most recent orders must if been defective.</li>
            <li>I get consistent results each time I use it, too.</li>
            <li>I put it back on effortlessly and it stays and then most times it keeps falling off every 2 seconds (no exaggeration here).  </li>
            <li>Its an exact replica of what I had, so I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li>I have used Conair products for many years and have never had one that was such a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty it would lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t drop it a bunchof times.</li>
            <li>It works great on his thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is my first dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for the same model that served me well for many years.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have encountered one where the hair brush does not stay on.  </li>
            <li>The first person I spoke with told me I could buy another attachment for $4.50.  </li>
            <li>I finally had to switch to the comb attachment which stays on better, but does not give me the look I want.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>My hair dryer of many years broke recently</li>
            <li>so I looked and now I have my favorite back.</li>
            <li>During the first use I had to use duck tape on both sides to get it to stay attached and have been using it with the tape since.  </li>
            <li>The VS would get so hot that it would almost burn my scalp</li>
            <li>Lastly, the Conair is also a bit more compact which makes it much easier to tuck in my travel bag and go!  </li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t stay on always when it heats up it does get hot.</li>
            <li>It helps straighten my hair so much!</li>
            <li>I really love this dryer and think I may purchase another one for back up purposes.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer gets so hot</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it gets to hot for the plastic on the brush or what, but that is why I purchased it, because I wanted one with a brush attachment.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I have bought the same one many times and never had any problems before.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s design has not changed since I bought it for the first time over 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I am able to use the old brush on the new dryer, just hope it lasts.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lightweight, cost was reasonable, no problems with purchase or delivery, choice of colors rather limited, overall very satisfied</li>
            <li>I have tightly coilded hair and I love how easy and fast I can get through my hair with this thing.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer, really pulls my thick, curly hair straight!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s travel-size friendly, but still a hefty (not heavy, but ...durable feeling) dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes drying my thick, wavy hair much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>Awesome if the brush attachment stayed but useless to have a brush attachment that falls off like this so much.  </li>
            <li>i love it because it works very well on the low heat setting.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast and I love the attachment I get to brush my hair that the same time.</li>
            <li>The most helpful negative review that Amazon shows at the top is a 3 star</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery thanks to Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty fast, too.</li>
            <li>Like other purchasers, I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment and think it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>My hair plus years of accumulated dust pretty much plugged up my first one causing it to overheat and shut off, so it really wasn&#x27;t the fault of the hair dryer itself in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent dryer brush to get your hair straight and dry in very little time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering buying my third one of these because it&#x27;s always been easy to use when straightening my semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>it wont last forever, but is an easy to use tool.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly without leaving my naturally curly hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>The large brush would not remain clipped on the blower.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would never consider another Conair product in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I have been using this same Conair model hairdryer for years, it dries my medium length straight not to think hair very quickly</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;ve got a hot-glue-gun handy: I&#x27;d buy a different brush if I were you--make sure it&#x27;s a straight brush like this one, and not a rounded brush because those do not dry wet hair.</li>
            <li>and I think that the company has pretty high quality products.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair is still very thick, and this hairdryer dries my curly hair better than most dryers.  </li>
            <li>Hair dries fast</li>
            <li>and does it job fast.  </li>
            <li>It works really well at what it does.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.  </li>
            <li>It heats up too much and turns off by itself.</li>
            <li>I just end up buying the package for the combs, which does not make too much sense.</li>
            <li>Using this dryer got my hair close to straight</li>
            <li>Thanks to another reviewer her</li>
            <li>It gets really tiring when I have to hold the dryer in one hand the bursh in another.    </li>
            <li>The straight bristle brush gets at your roots and gives volume, and also straightens/de-frizzes straight-wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much faster than pistol and hand brush styling.</li>
            <li>He decided to cheap out and cut his own hair a few days later, but forgot to put the guard on the clippers.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Beyond that it dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>very anyoing.</li>
            <li>Hairdressers use the separage hair dryer and separate brush method, but when doing it yourself, having a contained unit is so much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li>I really like using this type Blow Dryer.  </li>
            <li>Mainly,the attachments are made of a much thinner plastic,so they tend to flex while using and pop off.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and this dryer</li>
            <li>Not all the different style brushes actually fit on the dryer...</li>
            <li>I love it, left my natural 3c Curly afro hair straight and sleek.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and have been using this type of dryer for over 20 years to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>the one defect is the brush does not stay on very well</li>
            <li>I really like the brush feature because it adds fullness to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Conair Hair Dryer is for my mentallly-challenged son and meets his needs very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer -</li>
            <li>the comb attachment goes through my hair a LOT smoother and without so much tangling between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Gets my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>this product works very well</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that I could get style and volume from this device, but it didn&#x27;t do too much of anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast service but not the order that will linger at my front door and in my living room for a day or two.</li>
            <li>This dryer works really well, but the attachments won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>BLOW DRIES AND STRAIGHTENS THE HAIR VERY FAST.VERY</li>
            <li>and I get so upset because of how straight my hair is getting</li>
            <li>your hair straight in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Besides that, all works as expected or better....</li>
            <li>Ionic just what I needed thanks</li>
            <li>MUCH happier with that one.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I noticed that it didn&#x27;t get NEARLY as hot as my old Vidal Sassoon dryer.  </li>
            <li>I like the flat blower because I find the&lt;br /&gt;it easier to handle &amp; more direct focus on each area of the head.</li>
            <li>My hair is not thick or too curly, so this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but I am going to return this product as soon as I can!</li>
            <li>They never short and the brush bristles rarely fall out!</li>
            <li>It also style my hair the way I wanted and make my hair more softer than other ones.</li>
            <li>It may be fine for someone with long hair, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not possible to clean off the elements when there are incased like that.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I think I&#x27;ll wait and buy it at a store, where I can try on the attachments to make sure they fit tight.  </li>
            <li>Have used Conair styler/dryers forever, and fully expected to love this new one.  </li>
            <li>It dries my natural hair very quickly using the low heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I personally prefer a dryer that straightens your hair without overdrying while still leaving your hair full of body.</li>
            <li>his old dryer burned out and we replaced it for over $30 with this exact model.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that the cool button does NOT hold in place like it says on the box...</li>
            <li>I noticed this the first time I used it,and I had the old brush from the burned out Conair for comparison.</li>
            <li>It keeps shutting off constantly in order to cool off.</li>
            <li>No good it was good for 30 days</li>
            <li>The first heat setting is kind of subtle, too...</li>
            <li>It had been handled gently, banged on nothing, and except for the flames shooting out looked brand new.  </li>
            <li>It really bugs me that I will have to buy a new hairdryer just to get the combs.  </li>
            <li>- the customer just has to purchase new parts - really, are you kidding me???  </li>
            <li>I need a brush attachment that has firm bristles to get through my thick hair and this one was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular hair dryer for years</li>
            <li>I think the main reason for it is the shape of this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I only use the wide comb attachment, but its nice to have options.</li>
            <li>I have had several of these hair dryers as the do not last more than a year or so.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I especially like the attachments which work well with my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Besides that though I would most definitely recommend trying the dryer I might be the only one with that issue.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve had the older version of Conair and didn&#x27;t have that issue.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I purchased this blow-dryer was for the brush attachment in the picture.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it dries hair pretty quickly and keeps it straight.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>LACKS POWER WHEN USING HIGH SPEED SETTING.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair styler.</li>
            <li>The styler however shuts off when i turn it up to the high setting, apart from that</li>
            <li>Also, when drying on high heat it shuts off after 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  </li>
            <li>But note that hair might get little greasy because of hot air but that is fine and can be managed.  </li>
            <li>I use the fine comb, but it also comes with a wide comb attachment and a brush attachment, which I never used.  </li>
            <li>Consider using a tourmaline flat iron after if you are going for the ultimate sleek effect or use a curling iron if you want to curl ends a little more to give hair more a salon-styled effect.</li>
            <li>I still need to use a flat iron to really get my hair smooth, but the ironing goes quicker if I dry my hair this way first.</li>
            <li>and this styker just blow all my natural out giving me a straight blown out look.</li>
            <li>I have a Vidal Sasoon, but the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough so the brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the top layer of hair</li>
            <li>It has gone from a normal hairdryer roar to sounding like a lawnmower, which is quite disconcerting when being used beside one&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>It is worth according with the price and it is similar as the picture.</li>
            <li>gets my hair really stright and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that the comb attachments break pretty quickly (I have thick hair), especially the fine tooth one.  </li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t more companies make these hatchet dryers with stiff brush</li>
            <li>Its perfect to brush out my curls for when I want to straighten my hair or add fake loose curls.</li>
            <li>I have relatively straight and fine hair, so it dried my hair with no problems, but it didn&#x27;t look like I had styled my hair at all.</li>
            <li>It turns my long, wavy hair into smooth, straight hair after only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I returned the two dryers I ordered and they resent me 2 new ones.</li>
            <li>and get a new one yearly.</li>
            <li>The new one has softer heat.  </li>
            <li>I just bought a replica because I needed a new comb attachment.</li>
            <li>I told him the product was brand new</li>
            <li>New</li>
            <li>It looks brand new</li>
            <li>If I ever need a new dryer I know where to go.</li>
            <li>On this new one however the brush keeps falling off as I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I keep 3 brand new back-ups on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li>I have to always buy a new hair dryer when the brush gets flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only negative thing about this dryer is that the brush comes off very easily while drying!</li>
            <li>Has plenty of power for a quick dry, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s VERY loud and high-pitched</li>
            <li>and I do have to dry the hair behind my ears, which means the noise is aimed right in my ear canal, and that ain&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>This was exactly the same model or close to it</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the brush fell off the first time I used it and will not stick back in the grooves.</li>
            <li>My first lasted for years with daily use.</li>
            <li>When purchasing your item I was not made aware that it was not under the Australian standards</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m excited to try the other attachments).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna by the same exact one again.</li>
            <li>the only two that sale replacements are the Andis and the Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li>I already have the same exact blow dryer that I got years ago.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t make my hair static like other regular hair blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I put the bolts outside of the airstream at each end of the attachment so that they don&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li>It is better than some other similar ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Different combs and gets really hot.</li>
            <li>It does help get my hair straighter faster, but I think the high setting and even the low setting blow my hair around to much  to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li>so it can get dried out easily.</li>
            <li>They are fast, light-weight and not too noisy (considering how powerful they are) but the big drawback is that the combs don&#x27;t last long; once the first tooth falls out, others follow rapidly.  </li>
            <li>, It works so well to get my hair smooth and give it a little bit of body.  </li>
            <li>Started making a roaring sound and little air coming out.....</li>
            <li>The things I really like about it are that it gets my hair dry fairly quickly, it gets my hair straight-ish(saves time when straightening with a Chi afterward), and I also appreciate the fact that it has lived this long and is still working.</li>
            <li>I am able to essentially flat iron and dry my hair at the same time!</li>
            <li>i have longthick natural hair.</li>
            <li>Oh, and in my opinion the brush is so soft</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that a hairdryer is a priority enough to spend too much money.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue is that it seems to trip my GFI frequently, and hair builds up inside the dryer (no matter if you try to pull it out each use) and starts to burn and smell.  </li>
            <li>Even though I have to frequently replace this dryer, I continue to use it for it&#x27;s ease.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly</li>
            <li>Its not too loud.</li>
            <li>rid of frizzies pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t hang out in the humid bathroom for too long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>others have stated, it is loud, but so are all dryers of this type.</li>
            <li>but it is quite loud, as another user noted in a review.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item because my old Conair lasted 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li>It works with a loud noise.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after my old conair hand held dryer went out.</li>
            <li>His old one \\&quot; died\\&quot; on him</li>
            <li>The brush attachments allow for the (almost) look of a professional blow out.</li>
            <li>But unlike my mother&#x27;s Conair dryer it does not straighten my hair as well nor does it leave it feeling soft like my mother&#x27;s Conair dryer</li>
            <li>By-by curls, hello soft waves.</li>
            <li>It is serving me well so far</li>
            <li>However, the biggest problem by far is the noise.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is LOUD.  </li>
            <li>, so I say, let buyer beware, and be sure to read all the really negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is very noisy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this style of dryer since I was 14 years old.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that (by comparison to my old VS dryer)</li>
            <li>Without this dryer, I&#x27;m completely screwed...</li>
            <li>The box was not sealed and smelled so heavy of cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>They give lift to my short straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The price has increased considerably over the years.  </li>
            <li>complete outrage</li>
            <li>and I am going natural</li>
            <li>, brush is soft like hair...</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and because of this model&#x27;s shape; I can squeeze it in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to use than a regular blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li>Love the dryer, especially since it is one of the few with a comb attachment which I need to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I still love this style of hair dryer as my hair is thick and curly.  </li>
            <li>What breaks down eventually is that it tends to overheat and blow out the heating coil, so I try to use the button that blows on cool as often as I can.</li>
            <li>and then I have to wait until it cools down before I can even use the cool</li>
            <li>I had the first one for over a year and used it every single day.  </li>
            <li>This cools the hair down quickly and also cools the dryer so it won&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li>To much trouble to return, and my old brush attachment is pretty much worn out.</li>
            <li>and it REALLY cuts down on the straitener time it would normally take with a normal dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously like magic.  </li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t really care for this one initially because it seemed less powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is the fourth Conair hair dryer (exactly like this) that I&#x27;ve owned and the quality of this dryer was not the same as the others.  </li>
            <li>I had memories of my first blow dryer, which was a Conair Max, or something similr, which was a smaller form factor and which I could use just like a hairbrush, but this was definitely not it.</li>
            <li>The brush attachment doesn&#x27;t fit as tight, and keeps coming off due to the pull of my long long hair, but if I hold my hand on the brush as I run my hair through it, it will stay most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other stylers and still have not found the right one for me.</li>
            <li>the dryer is very heavy and the brush (not round) is huge.</li>
            <li>have short hair, but the high setting automatically turns off after about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>for someone that can not use a round brush and blow dry my hair this is my favorite tool.</li>
            <li>exactly  what I expected</li>
            <li>but I searched to find it because I have had every other kind of hair dryer in the past and</li>
            <li>It is a little on the noisy side which I don&#x27;t mind, I find the high heat settings to be quite hot.</li>
            <li>I emailed Conair, and they sent me a new brush, which appears to be made of a different type of plastic, which stays on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of buying a new one only because I need attachments.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that with the new one that I got off amazon, the three attachments don&#x27;t always stay attached to the hairdryer and sometimes when I&#x27;m drying my hair they will fall off..</li>
            <li>But it does really dry fast.</li>
            <li>Some have complained that the brush comes off easily?  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it daily it may last much longer.</li>
            <li>and I had to take several breaks just to cool down.</li>
            <li>The major problem with this dryer, though, is the brush attachment.</li>
            <li>This dryer just isn&#x27;t hot enough, so my hair lacked post blow dry lustre.</li>
            <li>These types of hair dryers are impossible to find in any stores, most dryers found in stores are the kind that are round  and shaped like a tube which  doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair dried quickly and was left soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s not a matter of my hair being too thick.  </li>
            <li>The low speed doesn&#x27;t do anything, and the high speed blows my short hair to kingdom</li>
            <li>Wish I could find one like my old one that finally died after 10 years.</li>
            <li>so I decided to get the same one, hoping that they fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>But now a month later it makes a loud noise and shuts off.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace another Conair styler which was almost identical,but which burned out after nearly 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li>This is the only hairdryer that can style my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Loud enough to wear earplugs!  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised that a company like Conair would put this on the market with this obvious flaw.</li>
            <li>: Use a heat guard creme or spray as well as serum first to cut down on heat damage and creater softer, shinier hair.</li>
            <li>This one has a stiff brush which is essential to really grasp the hair so that it dries straight.</li>
            <li>The high setting is not as powerful (heat temp) as other hair dryers I have owned and previously purchased.</li>
            <li>Would like to see a less hot</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it feels so much like a brush due to the design</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the original one I bought at least 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>-may be speculating with the possibility of you keeping that and still buying that OTHER item you were REALLY looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The quality of this new one is a BIG step down from it&#x27;s older brother.</li>
            <li>instead of buying replacement head from Conair for half the price of the new dryer, I just bought a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, I just bought this thing, and the brush attachment is nearly eighth of an inch wider than the body (where it attaches), which simply means, I can no longer use the brush.  </li>
            <li>It did not dry well and even after styling it was still frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I always hated blow drying and brushing my hair at the same time, so this is awesome to combine the two.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I turned it on, it would buzz very loudly and sort of vibrate and shake while I attempted to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I need the brush attachment right on the hair dryer to straighten my hair and the last few dryers I purchased from Conair</li>
            <li>I normally section my hair off into four sections and work from the back forward to dry it.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I use this kind of dryer to straighten my hair; unfortunately, the brush attachment falls off s soon as the dryer warms, rendering it totally useless.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint is the tines on the comb do break and I order 4 or so extra from Conair to always have some available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this hairdryer for as long as I can remember and continue to buy it when my old one breaks or starts to overheat.  </li>
            <li>I  have long naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Also, if it gets too hot, it automatically shuts off, and won&#x27;t turn on until it cools for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>but i had it for awhile before using it the first time, dont waste your money</li>
            <li>It is usually the only thing I need to fix my hair, no curling irons or straightening irons, unless I want to do something extra special or different.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this item a few months ago from Sears (I needed it right away), and it is my third Conair in the last 10-15 years.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for having products that are hard if not impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I can completely blow out my long curly hair in about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>My hair has a slight wave, but isn&#x27;t straight without a tool.</li>
            <li>My old 1875 dryer would take 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this style hair dryer for at least 10 years, and there is something about this type (and this model specifically) of dryer that causes it to die quickly.  </li>
            <li>I get tired of holding down the cool button, but don&#x27;t want to expose my hair to such direct heat, since the whole purpose of this style of dryer is to run the brush through your hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making me a bit crazy this time, but all previous ones I had were great.</li>
            <li>(they last me about 2 years per) unfortunately the new one I received the brush piece does not stay on dryer securely at all and every time I use</li>
            <li>I really like it as it has a comb attachment &amp; makes it much easier to dry my thick hair, especially in the back.</li>

            <li> very happy with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect.</li>
            <li> very good for one handed lifting and drying hair.  </li>
            <li> Very good dryer, but the attachments will NOT stay on.  </li>
            <li> Very good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Item is very loved by my GF...</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair dryer.</li>

            <li> My husband is very happy and I am very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> it looks great, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Had it for awhile and it still works great.</li>
            <li> So buying them on Amazon was a great deal.  </li>
            <li> This dryer seemed like a great idea.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer before and it was great.</li>
            <li> Great for taming and smoothing hair</li>
            <li> always looked great when he used it.  </li>
            <li> I rate them 5 stars for GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li> ; works great</li>
            <li> Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I do get a great blow out with the straightening comb or the detangling comb.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> So whenever I find these or see a great buy, I stock up on them.  </li>
            <li> BTW the blower still works great</li>
            <li> great and</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer with the brush attached.  </li>
            <li> That one still works great.</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s hair dryers continue to be great for frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This one works great.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise a great dryer</li>
            <li> Great for doing my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed when it went out, I was happy to see that they had it for sale on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> But it works great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to have my very own &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Hair dryers like this with the brush type attachment aren&#x27;t very popular</li>
            <li> it has been a very nice unit...</li>
            <li> but this dryer with the comb piece is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I now own 3 of those!</li>
            <li> Okay, so this dryer is absolutely AWESOME.</li>
            <li> this one is the one I love the best.  </li>
            <li> My mother used to have a hair dryer like this when I was a kid, it was bright orange</li>
            <li> If you like this style of dryer, a good value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair dryer twice and gotten really good results.</li>
            <li> and I have good memories of it.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a good pair of earplugs.</li>
            <li> the price was so good to keep on hand</li>
            <li> and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR FEELS GOOD AFTER,.</li>
            <li> good value</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, has dual voltage and a good brush, good heat, doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> what good is that if I am buying it for the brush?</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair</li>
            <li> My friend loved it and her hair is not as curly as mine.</li>
            <li> And I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> the plus side: the price is good.  </li>
            <li> This Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic styler with 3 attachments works really good.</li>
            <li> Each one I&#x27;ve had has lasted for a good number of years and has seen it&#x27;s share of abuse.</li>
            <li> It is a good hair dryer and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer works exceptionally well</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the heat and how quick do i get the result i want.</li>
            <li> excellent product, works great, great price, Target didn&#x27;t have it on the shelf locally but they sell it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was very glad to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt&amp;#60;&amp;#60; AND IM VERY PLEASED WITH ITS POWER.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the great service when purchasing it .....</li>
            <li> the most important one the roller brush doesn&#x27;t even stay on for three minutes!!!</li>
            <li> The body of the dryer is quite good and does an excellent job, but the attachments are pure garbage, making the product a loser.  </li>
            <li> the price was good and fair nothing more to say</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed at the BEST price I could find.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer!</li>
            <li> and I have been using this hairdryer for more than 30 years!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> It functions great, drys well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The dryer is great and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - heat variance is great.  </li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and brush is good for my curly hair, helps straighten without the frizz and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and find it to be just as amazing now.</li>
            <li> but it was amazing.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t actually own it YET.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is excellent and I use it every day for a fast hair drying experience.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m all grown up and doing hair on my own</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a lot of control over the end result of my efforts (to be honest with you</li>
            <li> What more can I say then if it works then good for you...</li>
            <li> and was overjoyed to discover I could order the style he liked .</li>
            <li> the vent flip is nice for cleaning.</li>
            <li> WHEN THE WARM AIR GOT TO THEM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another type of dryer but this kind.  </li>
            <li> Nice, compact, convienient.</li>
            <li> It does a really nice job on her hair and even somewhat straightens it if she uses the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered in the manufacturers box with now wrapping of any kind.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered by a girl in her own car.  </li>
            <li> love this dryer, perfect for when you want your hair straight.</li>
            <li> Really good value for money, although it would be better if it had more than two heat settings.</li>
            <li> Output is great and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic powerful dryer that distributes heat evenly drying hair to perfect with no flyaways.</li>
            <li> Love, love!</li>
            <li> Love the product and love the price!</li>
            <li> However, with that said, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20-$30 annually or semiannually to replace it because of the great straigthening results.</li>
            <li> It is a good item, however it is a HUGE hassle to get replacement combs.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of glad</li>
            <li> This makes blowdrying my hair so easily!</li>
            <li> Love, love love it!</li>
            <li> old fashion type hair dryer which is still the best type for many people.</li>
            <li> I have never used another hair dryer where I didnt have to straighten my hair after to make it look more smooth and straight, but this hair dryer leaves it perfect</li>
            <li> The brush and comb attachment leaves you with very smooth hair.  </li>
            <li> I also made for a very smooth and shiny finish to my hair.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is easy to use and the comb options are nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of hair dryer for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li> and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better straightening blow dryer for under $50.     </li>
            <li> 1875 Ionic Styler/ Dryer - Quieter than most hair dryers</li>
            <li> works excellent now; however, only one attachment can be used.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and then it worked ok.</li>
            <li> (I made sure not to cover any vents.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I like this hairdryer because so far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found to smooth my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was glad when I got this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried to snap the brush in place, it continues to come off while I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer.</li>
            <li> this product would have been much better if it came with just one permanent brush instead of three snap-ons.</li>
            <li> Sometimes simpler is better.</li>
            <li> This is an okay dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> am extremely satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love drying and styling my hair this way and hope they never discontinue this model.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty purchase of the year.</li>
            <li> lovely do you sell dvd</li>
            <li> This product seems to work better on wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this model of hair dryer for many years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair dryer of all time.  </li>
            <li> Love that it has the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> You can use these so much better than with a separate brush and hair dryer, particulary, if you are doing it youself.  </li>
            <li> I threw the box away before using it because I didn&#x27;t think there would be an issue since I have used this dryer so many times.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair, and I loved the results so much I bought my own.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift for my sister and she love it.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on no matter how many times I reattach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a morning changer :-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this style dryer for many years and never wanted to change until now.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> and I was worried that I would not be able to find one with a comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> Glad you still carry it and that they still make it.</li>
            <li> I love how it styles however</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one if these blow dryers for many years until it gave up.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s time to replace it with a better one.</li>
            <li> have been using this style of hair dryer for many years.  </li>
            <li> It does not even attach to the body any longer (so that it can fall off one more time).  </li>
            <li> More correctly, I drilled four holes in the brush attachment, so that the bolts are, in effect, squeezing the attachment so that it is clamping itself to the body of the dryer (and cannot come out of the slots it is supposed to ride in).  </li>
            <li> I love this styler in theory.  </li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer because it has the brushes with it.  </li>
            <li> So I can get more body in my hair while drying it.  </li>
            <li> I love connair hair dryers and Stylers and have Been using them since i Was a kid.</li>
            <li> , I love it as I do not like the blower types.</li>
            <li> Love to use the brush attachment for this dryer.  </li>
            <li> and, boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> maybe because I thought paying more meant better quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Conair 1875 hair dryer for years and have always been pleased however, they&#x27;ve updated this model and now the brush attachment falls off.</li>
            <li> This one is exactly like the first one I had and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so glad that i purchase it</li>
            <li> But once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The second one works perfect.</li>
            <li> read many reviews, here and elsewhere before I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my conair styler!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Use an antifrizz product, It is better that way.</li>
            <li> I will buy more ...</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I wish the brush attachment was even stiffer and more substantial.  </li>
            <li> Yes, make the brush even stiffer with more bristles</li>
            <li> hence the 4 star:-)</li>
            <li> I love these hair dryers, but the brush keeps falling off this one.</li>
            <li> I have used the Conair model for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love my conair 1875 watt</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer because of the shape.  </li>
            <li> The end is just like you hairbrush, so drying your hair is more efficient.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is more designed for men than women.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Works great, the clips sometimes fall off but other than that its great.</li>
            <li> When the conair gets hot the combs, or brush keeps falling off!!!</li>
            <li> Comb attachment works great and gets hair very straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have been searching for a dyer and brush two in love for a long time</li>
            <li> The good: This styler dryer has saved me so much time and frustration!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is pretty good at not frying it out and manages to do it in a manageable time (about 30 minutes, but I have a LOT of hair).</li>
            <li> The brush won&#x27;t stay on, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good, but I bought it for the brush feature.</li>
            <li> one is nice, has 2 heat settings and a cool shot button.  </li>
            <li> When my old hair dryer broke, I was delighted to be able to purchase this model again!</li>
            <li> okay - but doest seem as strong as i need for my hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer the fine comb, which straightens better.</li>
            <li> I am trying vidal Sassoon now which I am sure will be fine.</li>
            <li> This dryer allows me to blowout my own hair beautifully with awesome shiny flips in 15 min just by taking wet sections &amp; brushing them till dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second dryer - very good dryers.  </li>
            <li> have only used it twice but very good so far.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend this item.</li>
            <li> Competitor, Andis, makes an great ceramic dryer and replacement combs are VERY easy to find in stores and online, however my Andis dryers have not lasted as long, I end up spending more replacing the dryers themself than the combs.  </li>
            <li> Conair needs to pay attention to their customer reviews/complaints, and make the brush a better fit for the dryer.</li>
            <li> The insert, or grooves need to be deeper so the attachments will stay on more secure.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it as a really good and fast dryer /</li>
            <li> it works great on my thick hair, dries quickly, and using the comb attachment gives me the control I need for drying my own hair, without having it fly all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I had a wonderful previous model for many years that died</li>
            <li> I loved this dryer to begin with, it works very quickly and smoothed out my curly hair really well.</li>
            <li> But other than that is is one of the best hair dryers I have used.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to straighten out my hair.  </li>
            <li> It straightens your hair easily without pulling, handles well in your hand.</li>
            <li> Its easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and easy to use both at home and for travel.   </li>
            <li> Its easy to handle too</li>
            <li> We take it everywhere with us, the power converging is making it easy to travel with it.</li>
            <li> The styler has plenty of power and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fluffs hair without using a separate brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grip</li>
            <li> However, it is easy to grip</li>
            <li> but  can&#x27;t find them as easily at the retail stores.  </li>
            <li> It comes off too easy.</li>
            <li> ie it runs and heats just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li> 2 of the attachments work fine.</li>
            <li> It was working fine, but the teeth in the combs started breaking</li>
            <li> I used to have a 3 speed, lower wattage dryer that worked fine until it died.</li>
            <li> because i have fine hair</li>
            <li> I love it so much - I bought tHree!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a great buy, and it works well, if you are looking to simply \\&quot;dry\\&quot; your hair.</li>
            <li> and I need the brush to get that smooth finish that I like.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use the brush.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd dryer like this I have and it is great.</li>
            <li> I also noticed this styler is available at CVS, Walgreens and Harmons.  </li>
            <li> CHEAP, FLIMSY, DID NOT HOLD UP.</li>
            <li> They last 1-2 years and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> Great - hubby uses it daily!!!</li>
            <li> The brush attachment started falling off after one use and there is no way to secure it.  </li>
            <li> Great product that smoothes your hair instantly.</li>
            <li> I have never had to make a exchange with amazon but this time it worked smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you smooth out your hair, you must have this dryer-period.</li>
            <li> I got this one, because I was so happy with the same brand, etc.</li>
            <li> I hope to always find this product available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The ionic dryer allows for great movement with the replacable brush heads to create different styles</li>
            <li> Wife likes the brush with the bristles - most stylers do not have this - have used this brand over several years&lt;br /&gt;and has proven to be a good product</li>
            <li> However, this time the brush isn&#x27;t fitting right.</li>
            <li> So, all-in-all, I love this dryer for all the right reasons.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, you saved the day again!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and I never have to set my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush clips on fine when the dryer is cool.</li>
            <li> This a pretty good hair blower for the money I pied, and the styling brushes really work.</li>
            <li> My complaints are the brush falling off, like most everyone else mentions, and the fact that it gets so hot.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is fine; it doesn&#x27;t overheat and yet it still drys quickly.</li>
            <li> But I still think it is worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> From the reviews I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> amaaaaaazing i love it, so easy and fast specially when i divide my hair to quarters</li>
            <li> With the popularity of straight hair, it is so easy with the brush attachment!</li>
            <li> I have it attached by hair bands and it less than ideal.</li>
            <li> Sender shipped extremely quickly and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> While using it this week (and I do not use it every day), it started making a very funny sound and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> They ALWAYS melt on top side where brush attaches and get super hot.  </li>
            <li> I love the dryer the attachment kit to large want buy again</li>
            <li> I immediately went right on to Amazon to search for a replacement and received it yesterday!  </li>
            <li> Excellent version of this hard to find in stores hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great for getting knots out of wet hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great on time i finished in 15 min my hair being soaking wet.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said the brush falls off, I did not find this to be true.</li>
            <li> To remedy this, I use the cool shot button after drying each section of hair.  </li>
            <li> I will say you need to make sure you use a heat protectant because the heat very concentrated and close to the hair.</li>
            <li> It is true that the brush does not want to stay attached, but I reattached it with duct tape and it never fell off again.</li>
            <li> I had this same hair dryer for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good basic dryer.  </li>
            <li> I took my old brush and put it on my new blow dryer and it works great.</li>
            <li> I broke the old one because the new one works great and was inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my hair so straight, so quickly, than with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It creates a smooth style with just the right amount of volume.  </li>
            <li> It makes a high pitched noise on both hot and warm.</li>
            <li> Seriously would super glue it if I thought it would work!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly as it straightens.</li>
            <li> For a male with short hair it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this one was defective, or they all wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it dries my hair quickly and has the brush attachment for the ability to style while drying</li>
            <li> It has variable speed and temperature and gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> The attachments do not seem to securely attach to the body of the unit and the fan does not seem to blow as strong as the older model.  </li>
            <li> Seller expressed regret and helped make arrangements to return quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conair has been manufacturing this same brush design and styler for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> quick and efficient....</li>
            <li> Ok, it didn&#x27;t really die, but it started overheating right away</li>
            <li> This one is the perfect size for styling while you dry and it leaves my hair soft and in much better condition than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this model, and was very satisfied both time.</li>
            <li> were far superior to others as far as the brush attachment staying secure on the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The machine is great as allwAys but the accessory falls down.</li>
            <li> The whole process goes very quickly this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great if you have long straight hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> That said, this is a great tool to quickly dry curly hair and make it straight.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and dries hair quickly and frizz free.</li>
            <li> works for natural black hair perfectly!  </li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer with lots of power.  </li>
            <li> accurate description , thanks</li>
            <li> wow this styler is all that and more.</li>
            <li> So far, my favorite is this one,</li>
            <li> and he wasn&#x27;t having much success styling his hair using a \\&quot; nozzle\\&quot; style hair dryer without a brush attachment .  </li>
            <li> So powerful and with the brush attachment</li>
            <li> The drier itself is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had hair dryers like this in the past that work beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I should give this zero stars, but only because I bought this kind of blow dryer specifically for the brush attachment and the brush does not stay on at all.</li>
            <li> My old con air that gave up the roast after 30 years was light, fit my had</li>
            <li> So glad I can buy several online and that they are still available.</li>
            <li> &quot; is that every time I use it the dryer is so powerful my lights go out</li>
            <li> Nice to know Conair actually cares about quality...</li>
            <li> Wish there was a way to get the strong air power without the temperature getting so high.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works great and doesn&#x27;t short out / over heat like many of the other brands do.</li>
            <li> also dries hair super fast!</li>
            <li> Very nice and heavy duty product.</li>
            <li> Is very gentle on her hair, much better than her old one.</li>
            <li> It slipped right off, popped right off, drove me nuts.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> The brush literally just falls right off.</li>
            <li> I am a right arm amputee</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I kept the old dryer attachments and that they fit this new model.</li>
            <li> The first few uses this dryer worked great.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to put some product in your hair and separate it into sections properly to ensure a good blow dry.  </li>
            <li> When the brush wears out it is just about as cheap to order a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> It came highly recommended by my cousin and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> In comparison, I found that the Vidal Sassoon model shorts easily and pops, and its brush bristles are complete garbage.     </li>
            <li> This is the only kind of dryer I can ever use to blow my hair straight</li>
            <li> , I found out you can also easily order replacement combs by calling them directly.  </li>
            <li> this makes drying fast and leaves my hair straight and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> , this makes it easier for me to dry my own hair.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use, old school hair dryer.</li>
            <li> While you are using the styling brush, it gets warm and consequently loose.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I may buy another and give it another chance, but not cool to have to replace it so quickly!</li>
            <li> So if you can help me with this problem I would very much appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a bursh and it is very fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wattage makes your drying time very fast.   </li>
            <li> By the way, I am a 68 year old guy, who is very happy to have enough hair to dry.</li>
            <li> This dryer is one of the better dryers I have used with a big BUT.</li>
            <li> The conair hair dryer with brush attachment has been my favorite hairdryer for the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> and it works great on really thick hair too.  </li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th Conair and I love it as it is the only dryer that I know that is attached to the brush</li>
            <li> i had one exactly like this one</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot if you want a fast dryer.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> it dryes fast, and leaves my hair with a straight, soft, and healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li> I had to hot</li>
            <li> Brush falls off when hot.</li>
            <li> $19.99 for something that I use every day and will last almost a decade is a worthwhile purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my most recent orders must if been defective.</li>
            <li> I get consistent results each time I use it, too.</li>
            <li> I put it back on effortlessly and it stays and then most times it keeps falling off every 2 seconds (no exaggeration here).  </li>
            <li> Its an exact replica of what I had, so I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair products for many years and have never had one that was such a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty it would lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t drop it a bunchof times.</li>
            <li> It works great on his thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This is my first dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model that served me well for many years.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have encountered one where the hair brush does not stay on.  </li>
            <li> The first person I spoke with told me I could buy another attachment for $4.50.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to switch to the comb attachment which stays on better, but does not give me the look I want.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer of many years broke recently</li>
            <li> so I looked and now I have my favorite back.</li>
            <li> During the first use I had to use duck tape on both sides to get it to stay attached and have been using it with the tape since.  </li>
            <li> The VS would get so hot that it would almost burn my scalp</li>
            <li> Lastly, the Conair is also a bit more compact which makes it much easier to tuck in my travel bag and go!  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t stay on always when it heats up it does get hot.</li>
            <li> It helps straighten my hair so much!</li>
            <li> I really love this dryer and think I may purchase another one for back up purposes.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer gets so hot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it gets to hot for the plastic on the brush or what, but that is why I purchased it, because I wanted one with a brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I have bought the same one many times and never had any problems before.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s design has not changed since I bought it for the first time over 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I am able to use the old brush on the new dryer, just hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lightweight, cost was reasonable, no problems with purchase or delivery, choice of colors rather limited, overall very satisfied</li>
            <li> I have tightly coilded hair and I love how easy and fast I can get through my hair with this thing.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, really pulls my thick, curly hair straight!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s travel-size friendly, but still a hefty (not heavy, but ...durable feeling) dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes drying my thick, wavy hair much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Awesome if the brush attachment stayed but useless to have a brush attachment that falls off like this so much.  </li>
            <li> i love it because it works very well on the low heat setting.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and I love the attachment I get to brush my hair that the same time.</li>
            <li> The most helpful negative review that Amazon shows at the top is a 3 star</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery thanks to Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty fast, too.</li>
            <li> Like other purchasers, I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment and think it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> My hair plus years of accumulated dust pretty much plugged up my first one causing it to overheat and shut off, so it really wasn&#x27;t the fault of the hair dryer itself in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent dryer brush to get your hair straight and dry in very little time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying my third one of these because it&#x27;s always been easy to use when straightening my semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> it wont last forever, but is an easy to use tool.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly without leaving my naturally curly hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> The large brush would not remain clipped on the blower.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would never consider another Conair product in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same Conair model hairdryer for years, it dries my medium length straight not to think hair very quickly</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;ve got a hot-glue-gun handy: I&#x27;d buy a different brush if I were you--make sure it&#x27;s a straight brush like this one, and not a rounded brush because those do not dry wet hair.</li>
            <li> and I think that the company has pretty high quality products.</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair is still very thick, and this hairdryer dries my curly hair better than most dryers.  </li>
            <li> Hair dries fast</li>
            <li> and does it job fast.  </li>
            <li> It works really well at what it does.</li>
            <li> It really does the job.  </li>
            <li> It heats up too much and turns off by itself.</li>
            <li> I just end up buying the package for the combs, which does not make too much sense.</li>
            <li> Using this dryer got my hair close to straight</li>
            <li> Thanks to another reviewer her</li>
            <li> It gets really tiring when I have to hold the dryer in one hand the bursh in another.    </li>
            <li> The straight bristle brush gets at your roots and gives volume, and also straightens/de-frizzes straight-wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much faster than pistol and hand brush styling.</li>
            <li> He decided to cheap out and cut his own hair a few days later, but forgot to put the guard on the clippers.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Beyond that it dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> very anyoing.</li>
            <li> Hairdressers use the separage hair dryer and separate brush method, but when doing it yourself, having a contained unit is so much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> I really like using this type Blow Dryer.  </li>
            <li> Mainly,the attachments are made of a much thinner plastic,so they tend to flex while using and pop off.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and this dryer</li>
            <li> Not all the different style brushes actually fit on the dryer...</li>
            <li> I love it, left my natural 3c Curly afro hair straight and sleek.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and have been using this type of dryer for over 20 years to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> the one defect is the brush does not stay on very well</li>
            <li> I really like the brush feature because it adds fullness to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Conair Hair Dryer is for my mentallly-challenged son and meets his needs very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer -</li>
            <li> the comb attachment goes through my hair a LOT smoother and without so much tangling between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Gets my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> this product works very well</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I could get style and volume from this device, but it didn&#x27;t do too much of anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast service but not the order that will linger at my front door and in my living room for a day or two.</li>
            <li> This dryer works really well, but the attachments won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> BLOW DRIES AND STRAIGHTENS THE HAIR VERY FAST.VERY</li>
            <li> and I get so upset because of how straight my hair is getting</li>
            <li> your hair straight in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Besides that, all works as expected or better....</li>
            <li> Ionic just what I needed thanks</li>
            <li> MUCH happier with that one.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I noticed that it didn&#x27;t get NEARLY as hot as my old Vidal Sassoon dryer.  </li>
            <li> I like the flat blower because I find the&lt;br /&gt;it easier to handle &amp; more direct focus on each area of the head.</li>
            <li> My hair is not thick or too curly, so this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but I am going to return this product as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> They never short and the brush bristles rarely fall out!</li>
            <li> It also style my hair the way I wanted and make my hair more softer than other ones.</li>
            <li> It may be fine for someone with long hair, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not possible to clean off the elements when there are incased like that.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I think I&#x27;ll wait and buy it at a store, where I can try on the attachments to make sure they fit tight.  </li>
            <li> Have used Conair styler/dryers forever, and fully expected to love this new one.  </li>
            <li> It dries my natural hair very quickly using the low heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer a dryer that straightens your hair without overdrying while still leaving your hair full of body.</li>
            <li> his old dryer burned out and we replaced it for over $30 with this exact model.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that the cool button does NOT hold in place like it says on the box...</li>
            <li> I noticed this the first time I used it,and I had the old brush from the burned out Conair for comparison.</li>
            <li> It keeps shutting off constantly in order to cool off.</li>
            <li> No good it was good for 30 days</li>
            <li> The first heat setting is kind of subtle, too...</li>
            <li> It had been handled gently, banged on nothing, and except for the flames shooting out looked brand new.  </li>
            <li> It really bugs me that I will have to buy a new hairdryer just to get the combs.  </li>
            <li> - the customer just has to purchase new parts - really, are you kidding me???  </li>
            <li> I need a brush attachment that has firm bristles to get through my thick hair and this one was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular hair dryer for years</li>
            <li> I think the main reason for it is the shape of this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I only use the wide comb attachment, but its nice to have options.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these hair dryers as the do not last more than a year or so.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I especially like the attachments which work well with my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Besides that though I would most definitely recommend trying the dryer I might be the only one with that issue.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve had the older version of Conair and didn&#x27;t have that issue.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this blow-dryer was for the brush attachment in the picture.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it dries hair pretty quickly and keeps it straight.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> LACKS POWER WHEN USING HIGH SPEED SETTING.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair styler.</li>
            <li> The styler however shuts off when i turn it up to the high setting, apart from that</li>
            <li> Also, when drying on high heat it shuts off after 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  </li>
            <li> But note that hair might get little greasy because of hot air but that is fine and can be managed.  </li>
            <li> I use the fine comb, but it also comes with a wide comb attachment and a brush attachment, which I never used.  </li>
            <li> Consider using a tourmaline flat iron after if you are going for the ultimate sleek effect or use a curling iron if you want to curl ends a little more to give hair more a salon-styled effect.</li>
            <li> I still need to use a flat iron to really get my hair smooth, but the ironing goes quicker if I dry my hair this way first.</li>
            <li> and this styker just blow all my natural out giving me a straight blown out look.</li>
            <li> I have a Vidal Sasoon, but the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough so the brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the top layer of hair</li>
            <li> It has gone from a normal hairdryer roar to sounding like a lawnmower, which is quite disconcerting when being used beside one&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> It is worth according with the price and it is similar as the picture.</li>
            <li> gets my hair really stright and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that the comb attachments break pretty quickly (I have thick hair), especially the fine tooth one.  </li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t more companies make these hatchet dryers with stiff brush</li>
            <li> Its perfect to brush out my curls for when I want to straighten my hair or add fake loose curls.</li>
            <li> I have relatively straight and fine hair, so it dried my hair with no problems, but it didn&#x27;t look like I had styled my hair at all.</li>
            <li> It turns my long, wavy hair into smooth, straight hair after only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I returned the two dryers I ordered and they resent me 2 new ones.</li>
            <li> and get a new one yearly.</li>
            <li> The new one has softer heat.  </li>
            <li> I just bought a replica because I needed a new comb attachment.</li>
            <li> I told him the product was brand new</li>
            <li> New</li>
            <li> It looks brand new</li>
            <li> If I ever need a new dryer I know where to go.</li>
            <li> On this new one however the brush keeps falling off as I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I keep 3 brand new back-ups on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> I have to always buy a new hair dryer when the brush gets flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about this dryer is that the brush comes off very easily while drying!</li>
            <li> Has plenty of power for a quick dry, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s VERY loud and high-pitched</li>
            <li> and I do have to dry the hair behind my ears, which means the noise is aimed right in my ear canal, and that ain&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> This was exactly the same model or close to it</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the brush fell off the first time I used it and will not stick back in the grooves.</li>
            <li> My first lasted for years with daily use.</li>
            <li> When purchasing your item I was not made aware that it was not under the Australian standards</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m excited to try the other attachments).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna by the same exact one again.</li>
            <li> the only two that sale replacements are the Andis and the Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> I already have the same exact blow dryer that I got years ago.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make my hair static like other regular hair blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I put the bolts outside of the airstream at each end of the attachment so that they don&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It is better than some other similar ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Different combs and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> It does help get my hair straighter faster, but I think the high setting and even the low setting blow my hair around to much  to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li> so it can get dried out easily.</li>
            <li> They are fast, light-weight and not too noisy (considering how powerful they are) but the big drawback is that the combs don&#x27;t last long; once the first tooth falls out, others follow rapidly.  </li>
            <li> , It works so well to get my hair smooth and give it a little bit of body.  </li>
            <li> Started making a roaring sound and little air coming out.....</li>
            <li> The things I really like about it are that it gets my hair dry fairly quickly, it gets my hair straight-ish(saves time when straightening with a Chi afterward), and I also appreciate the fact that it has lived this long and is still working.</li>
            <li> I am able to essentially flat iron and dry my hair at the same time!</li>
            <li> i have longthick natural hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and in my opinion the brush is so soft</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that a hairdryer is a priority enough to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue is that it seems to trip my GFI frequently, and hair builds up inside the dryer (no matter if you try to pull it out each use) and starts to burn and smell.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have to frequently replace this dryer, I continue to use it for it&#x27;s ease.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly</li>
            <li> Its not too loud.</li>
            <li> rid of frizzies pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t hang out in the humid bathroom for too long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> others have stated, it is loud, but so are all dryers of this type.</li>
            <li> but it is quite loud, as another user noted in a review.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because my old Conair lasted 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li> It works with a loud noise.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after my old conair hand held dryer went out.</li>
            <li> His old one \\&quot; died\\&quot; on him</li>
            <li> The brush attachments allow for the (almost) look of a professional blow out.</li>
            <li> But unlike my mother&#x27;s Conair dryer it does not straighten my hair as well nor does it leave it feeling soft like my mother&#x27;s Conair dryer</li>
            <li> By-by curls, hello soft waves.</li>
            <li> It is serving me well so far</li>
            <li> However, the biggest problem by far is the noise.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is LOUD.  </li>
            <li> , so I say, let buyer beware, and be sure to read all the really negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is very noisy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style of dryer since I was 14 years old.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that (by comparison to my old VS dryer)</li>
            <li> Without this dryer, I&#x27;m completely screwed...</li>
            <li> The box was not sealed and smelled so heavy of cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li> They give lift to my short straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The price has increased considerably over the years.  </li>
            <li> complete outrage</li>
            <li> and I am going natural</li>
            <li> , brush is soft like hair...</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and because of this model&#x27;s shape; I can squeeze it in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to use than a regular blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, especially since it is one of the few with a comb attachment which I need to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I still love this style of hair dryer as my hair is thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> What breaks down eventually is that it tends to overheat and blow out the heating coil, so I try to use the button that blows on cool as often as I can.</li>
            <li> and then I have to wait until it cools down before I can even use the cool</li>
            <li> I had the first one for over a year and used it every single day.  </li>
            <li> This cools the hair down quickly and also cools the dryer so it won&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li> To much trouble to return, and my old brush attachment is pretty much worn out.</li>
            <li> and it REALLY cuts down on the straitener time it would normally take with a normal dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously like magic.  </li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t really care for this one initially because it seemed less powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is the fourth Conair hair dryer (exactly like this) that I&#x27;ve owned and the quality of this dryer was not the same as the others.  </li>
            <li> I had memories of my first blow dryer, which was a Conair Max, or something similr, which was a smaller form factor and which I could use just like a hairbrush, but this was definitely not it.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment doesn&#x27;t fit as tight, and keeps coming off due to the pull of my long long hair, but if I hold my hand on the brush as I run my hair through it, it will stay most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other stylers and still have not found the right one for me.</li>
            <li> the dryer is very heavy and the brush (not round) is huge.</li>
            <li> have short hair, but the high setting automatically turns off after about 2 minutes</li>
            <li> for someone that can not use a round brush and blow dry my hair this is my favorite tool.</li>
            <li> exactly  what I expected</li>
            <li> but I searched to find it because I have had every other kind of hair dryer in the past and</li>
            <li> It is a little on the noisy side which I don&#x27;t mind, I find the high heat settings to be quite hot.</li>
            <li> I emailed Conair, and they sent me a new brush, which appears to be made of a different type of plastic, which stays on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of buying a new one only because I need attachments.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that with the new one that I got off amazon, the three attachments don&#x27;t always stay attached to the hairdryer and sometimes when I&#x27;m drying my hair they will fall off..</li>
            <li> But it does really dry fast.</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the brush comes off easily?  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it daily it may last much longer.</li>
            <li> and I had to take several breaks just to cool down.</li>
            <li> The major problem with this dryer, though, is the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> This dryer just isn&#x27;t hot enough, so my hair lacked post blow dry lustre.</li>
            <li> These types of hair dryers are impossible to find in any stores, most dryers found in stores are the kind that are round  and shaped like a tube which  doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair dried quickly and was left soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s not a matter of my hair being too thick.  </li>
            <li> The low speed doesn&#x27;t do anything, and the high speed blows my short hair to kingdom</li>
            <li> Wish I could find one like my old one that finally died after 10 years.</li>
            <li> so I decided to get the same one, hoping that they fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li> But now a month later it makes a loud noise and shuts off.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Conair styler which was almost identical,but which burned out after nearly 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairdryer that can style my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Loud enough to wear earplugs!  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised that a company like Conair would put this on the market with this obvious flaw.</li>
            <li> : Use a heat guard creme or spray as well as serum first to cut down on heat damage and creater softer, shinier hair.</li>
            <li> This one has a stiff brush which is essential to really grasp the hair so that it dries straight.</li>
            <li> The high setting is not as powerful (heat temp) as other hair dryers I have owned and previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Would like to see a less hot</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it feels so much like a brush due to the design</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the original one I bought at least 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> -may be speculating with the possibility of you keeping that and still buying that OTHER item you were REALLY looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The quality of this new one is a BIG step down from it&#x27;s older brother.</li>
            <li> instead of buying replacement head from Conair for half the price of the new dryer, I just bought a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, I just bought this thing, and the brush attachment is nearly eighth of an inch wider than the body (where it attaches), which simply means, I can no longer use the brush.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry well and even after styling it was still frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I always hated blow drying and brushing my hair at the same time, so this is awesome to combine the two.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I turned it on, it would buzz very loudly and sort of vibrate and shake while I attempted to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I need the brush attachment right on the hair dryer to straighten my hair and the last few dryers I purchased from Conair</li>
            <li> I normally section my hair off into four sections and work from the back forward to dry it.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I use this kind of dryer to straighten my hair; unfortunately, the brush attachment falls off s soon as the dryer warms, rendering it totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the tines on the comb do break and I order 4 or so extra from Conair to always have some available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hairdryer for as long as I can remember and continue to buy it when my old one breaks or starts to overheat.  </li>
            <li> I  have long naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Also, if it gets too hot, it automatically shuts off, and won&#x27;t turn on until it cools for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but i had it for awhile before using it the first time, dont waste your money</li>
            <li> It is usually the only thing I need to fix my hair, no curling irons or straightening irons, unless I want to do something extra special or different.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this item a few months ago from Sears (I needed it right away), and it is my third Conair in the last 10-15 years.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for having products that are hard if not impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I can completely blow out my long curly hair in about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> My hair has a slight wave, but isn&#x27;t straight without a tool.</li>
            <li> My old 1875 dryer would take 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this style hair dryer for at least 10 years, and there is something about this type (and this model specifically) of dryer that causes it to die quickly.  </li>
            <li> I get tired of holding down the cool button, but don&#x27;t want to expose my hair to such direct heat, since the whole purpose of this style of dryer is to run the brush through your hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making me a bit crazy this time, but all previous ones I had were great.</li>
            <li> (they last me about 2 years per) unfortunately the new one I received the brush piece does not stay on dryer securely at all and every time I use</li>
            <li> I really like it as it has a comb attachment &amp; makes it much easier to dry my thick hair, especially in the back.</li>
            <li> But after a few tries I realized that it really does dry my hair quick and with less heat.  </li>
            <li> This new model however is a little bit hotter and it feels like I could almost burn myself if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> On all of them the bristles are to soft, even for very thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 other attachments that fit fine, but the brush one, the only one I wanted, does not fit properly and is therefore useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other similar dryers but found the brush attachment to be too soft.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> The only two negative for me is my roots are flatter with this dryer than a flat iron, because I wouldn&#x27;t iron as high and it is loud around the ears.</li>
            <li> When I turned on the high heat seating it would only work for a few seconds and then cut off.</li>
            <li> However, this particular attachment does not fit the blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not abnormally loud or heavy, and SO much easier than using a round brush &amp; regular dryer.</li>
            <li> The comb attachments will stay on, so you can use the comb attachments to detangle your hair while you dry it, but the brush attachment simply will not stay on, so give up on any hope of actually styling while drying.</li>
            <li> Have had this problem with previous models of this same product, but the plastic they are now using is far too pliable.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend to use on his hair and he really likes it and uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> This dryer saves on the time you need to flat iron your hair</li>
            <li> I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron afterwards</li>
            <li> If I could find another hairdryer with the same sturdy long bristles, I would buy it instead.  </li>
            <li> (If your hair is not as curly as mine, you&#x27;ll probably get smoother results and not need the flat</li>
            <li> I only use the brushy attachment and threw the comb ones away a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Combs never last as long as dryer</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and the brush attachment, when hot, becomes pliable and comes off the track.  </li>
            <li> It even eliminates the need for a flat iron!</li>
            <li> It takes me maybe 5 minutes to dry my shortish hair, and it used to take up to 10 with a standard drugstore hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Then I dry one section at a time starting from the bottom.</li>
            <li> The brush is too big for the dryer which caused it to fall off every time I tried to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got wavy or textured hair, this could help dry and straighten it before you then style it, but for me it just did the same thing my blow dryer does.</li>
            <li> Guess I can try it on low and see if it takes really long to dry.  </li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s REALLY fast (so fast that I sometimes end up with a weird cowlick or whatever because I didn&#x27;t realize some of my hair was already dry</li>
            <li> The dryer is very loud and it is not easy to handle.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate their prices and the performance (at least on this hair dryer).</li>
            <li> Put in other words, it means that when one puts the brush attachment in one channel on one side of the body, the other side is nearly an eighth of an inch away from the body.</li>
            <li> and it did not take long either.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is not loud.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair brush blow dryers for years as I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> A complete waste.  </li>
            <li> I have waist long hair too...</li>
            <li> How is it that Conair has not fixed this yet?</li>
            <li> Although everything else works fine, it was very frustrating to discover this.</li>
            <li> after a while, due to the heat, the comb attachment will inevitably begin to lose some of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Have had to superglue the brush on to use this and will see how long that lasts!</li>
            <li> This styler has been used many times since it was ordered, and hasn&#x27;t failed me at all!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, it&#x27;s also pretty long</li>
            <li> My Conair has lasted a very long time, even bumping around when I travel.  </li>
            <li> I have to keep attaching the brush and put it on LOW setting and go very carefully...</li>
            <li> I have issues with getting my hair dry.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll discourage purchase if you need those attachments in order to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and like to straighten it when I dry it.  </li>
            <li> The brush keeps coming off while I am trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My head looks like a bush if I dont use heat to dry it</li>
            <li> The brush attachment does not stay on when you try to brush your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> It seems to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the brush attachment to dry my hair and have never had a problem until now.  </li>
            <li> I break my hair up into sections to straighten, curl, blow dry, etc.</li>
            <li> There is no point of having a brush attachment if it won&#x27;t stay on while you brush your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I just hold hairdryer at the attachment point to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush on my dry doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> It takes me forever to dry my hair now.</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble getting through my thick curly, medium to coarse, hair texture.</li>
            <li> so It got a major work out everyday.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works fine, but it is too big for how short my hair is - my bad.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good styling option for someone who wants a lot of flexibility in their styling, as it doesn&#x27;t fully curl ends.     </li>
            <li> The plastic attachment brushes are loose and fall off with use.  </li>
            <li> I have used a similar blow dryer and it would alway overheat and shut down, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I had used this for at least 5 years before I purchased a new one on amazon...</li>
            <li> The only (slight) problem with this version is that the brush attachment will slip off once in a while.</li>
            <li> I have only used it maybe 7 times after the about the 5th used it started making a funny noise it still dries but that noise is scary</li>
            <li> As long as I can remember, the brushes and other attachments lose their shape and fall off the body.  </li>
            <li> The clip on&#x27;s are not strong enough, the bristles are too hard and not long enough to stabilize long hair.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is a big help to straighten the hair, although it is a little bulky/inconvenient to use the attachment.</li>
            <li> My hair usually takes about 15 minutes to dry, but now it only takes 7 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair and when I get my hair cut and styled by someone else</li>
            <li> I have tried the round brushes and standard hairdryer</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say that this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment gets frayed after some use, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> wet a lot.  </li>
            <li> The attachments do not fit properly when in use.</li>
            <li> ; that is the only thing that is missing.  </li>
            <li> the minus side: the brush will not stay on.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> These companies have absolutely no pride in what they put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It separates wet hair and speeds the drying process.  </li>
            <li> To big and too heavy.</li>
            <li> It keeps slipping or popping off when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not the product I expected</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Sad because I like the size,color and cool down button.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a little longer than the length of all my other wide tooth combs.</li>
            <li> This dryer is faster to dry and saves the time of having to use a second tool (which I usually wouldn&#x27;t do because..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first time I used it the brush attachment kept coming off while I was trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not very coordinated to use the other styles.  </li>
            <li> I have extreemly tight curls and my previous, similar blow dryer died on me.</li>
            <li> and something is wrong with it as it got real loud, started to vibrate, and scared me enough to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> females with long hair prefer the blower type but his allows you to \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; up my thinning hair and make it look a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had each of the previous ones for less than a year because after a few months it starts to smell like burning hair or plastic when using it, then after a few more months it sporadically fails to work when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> if you want to buy it at a store instead of online i saw it at Christmas Tree Shop the other day for $23.</li>
            <li> so i need a brush attachment since I don&#x27;t do too well with a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much point in an attachment dryer without attachments!</li>
            <li> Other than that-  </li>
            <li> Oh well, hair usually grows back.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past and it lasted several years, so</li>
            <li> I still use two hands, one on the dryer and the other to keep the hair in the comb.</li>
            <li> just shake things up a bit, but I definately recommend this to all other bushy headed ladies like myself.  </li>
            <li> The downfall of it is that I find they tend to burn out sooner than other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> Those of us who use this style dryer do so exclusively because of the attachments which other dryers do not offer.  </li>
            <li> This was the same blow dryer model number that I have used for the past three years with satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> other brands didn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely noisy, so</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;d had for the last few years!  </li>
            <li> It conked out, the other day -</li>
            <li> Other problem is it&#x27;s life expectancy is about 2 years if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> Still beats any other blow dryer on time</li>
            <li> Should have taken notice of other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> and you have to spend a lot of time reading very carefully (</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t find it too easily in stores now</li>
            <li> Only complaint is brush attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on well while in use.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and am lazy.</li>
            <li> I have hair a few inches past my shoulders and always get compliments when I use this dryer versus a regular.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the brush attachment won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a weird in between straight and blow out look.</li>
            <li> tried it several times, but it was just too clumsy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the brush.</li>
            <li> The annoying brush attachment is still better than blow drying and using a separate brush.</li>
            <li> It cut my drying time down by probably twenty or thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> brush will wear down with time, but you can order replacements for about $3.50 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Down side, the teeth of the comb attachment break after awhile.</li>
            <li> The brushes always wear down, but I am used to that.  </li>
            <li> After checking several stores without results I turned to my &#x27;go to&#x27; source, Amazon, and, as usual they came through again!</li>
            <li> some other brand! .</li>
            <li> less coordination than brush/dryer combo&lt;</li>
            <li> The newer version does not seem to be as well built as the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Conair, but the next time I shop for a dryer, it will be a different brand.</li>
            <li> It went from black to silver ionic &amp; now there&#x27;s a black ceramic one out.</li>
            <li> if u pack it in a overnight bag, it will def break in half.</li>
            <li> The plastic material that holds the brush on seems to be made of a softer material than was used on the previous generation of this model.    </li>
            <li> I would be a mess without it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My real challenge has been the durability of dryers before they fail to heat or begin dangerously overheating, and I do prefer tourmaline, ionic, or ceramic dryers, because I use my dryer daily on wet or dry relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> This dryer helps concentrate the heat and air on to my hair because the comb holds it tight.</li>
            <li> granted I have tightly curled hair).  </li>
            <li> In one drying session I usually have to snap it back on at least 6 times.  </li>
            <li> It also takes a little while to get used to the weight and bulk when you start using it.</li>
            <li> (open late also!).</li>
            <li> No more using a brush in one hand and a dryer in the other.  </li>
            <li> the brush is a little floppy and falls off if it gets stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to mess around with it after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> Have had several of this type in the past and the only part that was useless on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in under one week of use, it sounds like something internal (can&#x27;t be seen) has come loose and is banging when the dryer is turned on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can bear the hassle again, but I don&#x27;t see any other dryer with a stiff brush attachment on the market.</li>
            <li> not effective for long curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> If you have problems with the round brushes I would recommend you to try this out.</li>
            <li> Replacement combs are not available through the Conair site.  </li>
            <li> I buy one every few years</li>
            <li> I replace them every few years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s a bit heavy, and</li>
            <li> Hold it a few inches away.</li>
            <li> When this happens, I order replacements for a few dollars each-  there is an order form in the box.</li>
            <li> If you want a hair dryer with the comb attached to the air blower, this is one of the few remaining models for you.</li>
            <li> I have used it almost everyday since then.</li>
            <li> After a few week of use it got even louder.  </li>
            <li> the dryer for, DOES NOT FIT.  </li>
            <li> The fact is, that the problem has actually grown much worse.  </li>
            <li> The difference is that now the brush falls off as soon as you have been using the dryer for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> There are few choices except for this one.  </li>
            <li> It gives it volume and it looks like i got it blown dried in the salon.</li>
            <li> It had the same irritating flaw: the brush kept jumping out while in use.</li>
            <li> so I only blow dry my hair 1-2 times a week and was very disappointed that this product lasted such a short time.</li>
            <li> I usually use a round brush styler/dryer, but mine is not dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sorry Conair, this dryer is a colossal fail.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to maneuver a brush and blow dryer at the same time, so why not build the brush into the blow dryer?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a couple of weeks the dryer would continually short out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care that</li>
            <li> I divide my hair into small sections and clip them up.</li>
            <li> Not sure why anyone would want to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but, since I&#x27;m going to return this product to Amazon, I thought I take the time to comment on why.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> IN THE PAST I HAVE GIVEN ONE TO A FRIEND, SHE LOVES IT TOO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy.)</li>
            <li> anytime I order one of these, the brush does not fit!  </li>
            <li> and I can blowdry chunks of my hair at one time rather than taking small pieces.</li>
            <li> I usually have to replace it after about a year</li>
            <li> I have owned 6 or 7 of these over the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> , WAS SAD WHEN MY REGULAR HAIR DRYER WENT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure Conair still makes them.  </li>
            <li> Within a few seconds the brush attachment falls off!</li>
            <li> The bad: As previously mentioned, it&#x27;s loud and a burning smell starts to occur after wear and tear - 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> Too heavy which make it uncomfortable to hold and handle with single hand.</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and it is very heavy.</li>
            <li> Very few hairdryers are still designed with the brush attached to the blower.</li>
            <li> The brush falls off and I have thin, above the shoulder hair, so it is not a question of my hair being too tough to style.  </li>
            <li> He was not happy with the newer style hair dryers and had gone to store after store looking for one with the brush attachment with no success.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other...way too difficult with long hair.  </li>
            <li> have thick hair, so I am not sure how this blow dryer will work.</li>
            <li> I also like the brush to be very stiff.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a blow dryer with a brush attachment.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how hard it is to find this hair dryer in stores.</li>
            <li> For my hairstyle, I need a hairdryer with a brush attachment - and they are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Dryers with combs are hard to find and he loves this one from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> so they are bit hard to find.</li>
            <li> I am extremely hard to please when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li> This style is getting somewhat hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a dryer with a comb.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these.</li>
            <li> The button is hard to adjust.  </li>
            <li> and she hasnt complained yet..  </li>
            <li> and I probalby had it at least 7-8 years.</li>
            <li> My one complaint and the reason for not giving it a 5 star is that they do wear out after a couple of years and have to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make me sweat like crazy while blow drying like traditional blow dryers do.  </li>
            <li> WORKS.BLOW DRYING EFFECT LASTS FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.</li>
            <li> at least too inaccurate- as it brings up all kinds of products</li>
            <li> I wish o could return this but its too late.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and somewhat curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using thick fabric covered rubber bands, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I was forced to removed the box from the house.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t blame it, I have ALOT of hair that is thick and wavy...</li>
            <li> Dryed my thick curly hair in no time with out all the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I was hesitant to buy the less expensive Conair brand -</li>
            <li> I used to flat iron my hair and hated it because it took so long</li>
            <li> Seriously, the brush attachment will not stay on for ANY TIME at all, once the heat is blowing through the dryer.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, who has very thick, curly hair, has burned out at least one of these dryers</li>
            <li> The power switch seems to be the weak link and this is what failed on the previous ones.</li>
            <li> I was in middle drying my hair and this made me so frustrated I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> thick hair vs. thin hair).</li>
            <li> My hair never looked so thick (with hair products of course)!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t blow very hard</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I dry and style my hair with this Conair styling sick in about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> This one lasted several months before it began shooting sparks out of the base and caught fire.  </li>
            <li> I drilled holes and tied to the blower with thin wire.  </li>
            <li> It was not great</li>
            <li> CONAIR does not stand behind this issue.  </li>
            <li> The attachments doesn&#x27;t stay on the dryer; you have to hold the attachment while blow drying hair...very frustrating.</li>
            <li> In all the years of using this style of dryer, this is the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> Poor engineering.  </li>
            <li> The brush bristles are thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> My friend let me in on her secret, she has used this dryer for years.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s even worse</li>
            <li> Wife likes it but not happy with the fact that brush sometimes snaps off while using it.</li>
            <li> It continuously pops off which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Conair usually exceeds in products such as this one, but this time failed miserably.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and it can be difficult to work with; but I just use the finer comb attachment, and voila!  </li>
            <li> Although all instructions say not to wrap the cord around the handle, everyone does which eventually causes the dryer to fail.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush part falls off some of the time.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> no one does here in Austraia, so this product is useless to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb attachments are totally useless (for me).</li>
            <li> The brush and comb attachments are practically useless.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it will be quite awhile before he will be trying out the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was unable to find it in any store.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong beleive me.</li>
            <li> But they aren&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> so Ill probably donate it.</li>
            <li> The combs never stayed on, the brush its useless.</li>
            <li> Conair obviously didn&#x27;t take the time to test this horrible product.</li>
            <li> This make the dryer close to useless.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say I&#x27;m done with conair</li>
            <li> This is very frustrating when I am in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I have long, frizzy, wavy, colicky awful hair that has to be smoothed out 1x/wk.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of burning my hair.  </li>
            <li> Probably dangerous</li>
            <li> EVEN WHEN COLD.  </li>
            <li> but after a lousy experience with an Andis blow dryer I will never stray from my Conair again!</li>
            <li> Useless!  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!  </li>
            <li> I hate to think of people damaging their vulnerable ears with this thing though; hopefully I just got an abnormally noisy dryer.</li>
            <li> Both times it lasted about 2 years each which isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell replacements.</li>
            <li> It is made of bad plastic.</li>
            <li> and then it shuts itself off and a bad time.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer stinks!  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> and I have to switch dryers because I don&#x27;t want that to keep happening. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the brush attachment continues to fall off of it while you are trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> Very dangerous product that doesn&#x27;t deserve its Underwriters Laboratories seal.</li>
            <li> Clicks but never locks on drying base.</li>
            <li> If you try to use the brush with it the brush finds a way to work its way off the base.  </li>
            <li> It gets really annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent dryer brush to get your hair straight and dry in very little time.  You have a brush and two comb attachments.  This is a cosmetologist&#x27;s tools of the trade kit in one.  I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> Hard to find a blow dryer with a brush attachment. Some reviews said the brush falls off, I did not find this to be true. It works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of hair dryer for many years and love it.  Hair dries fast and I don&#x27;t need to bother with a straightener.  The only problem is the brush keeps falling off on this one.  I may just get out the duct tape.....</li>
            <li> I like this blow dryer I straightened my hair as soon as I got it and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> Dryer works ...ie it runs and heats just fine.  However, if you are going to use the brush attachment....well, forget it.  The brush will not stay attached to the hair dryer.. Actually, it will go flying across the bathroom.  I had to use zip ties to make it stay on..</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a great buy, and it works well, if you are looking to simply \\&quot;dry\\&quot; your hair. However, if you are depending on the brush to \\&quot;style\\&quot; your hair, forget it!!  Conair needs to pay attention to their customer reviews/complaints, and make the brush a better fit for the dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife blew hers out in europe.  This was exactly the same model or close to it and she hasnt complained yet..  so thumbs up for me.</li>
            <li> wow this styler is all that and more. i have longthick natural hair. and this styker just blow all my natural out giving me a straight blown out look. JUS HOW I WANT IT!... GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying my third one of these because it&#x27;s always been easy to use when straightening my semi-curly hair.  The frustrating thing, though, is precisely that it will be my THIRD ONE.  I think I&#x27;ve had each of the previous ones for less than a year because after a few months it starts to smell like burning hair or plastic when using it, then after a few more months it sporadically fails to work when plugged in.  Sometimes the combination of pushing reset buttons on the power outlet and on the plug will do the trick, but at some point it simply refuses to turn on again.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can bear the hassle again, but I don&#x27;t see any other dryer with a stiff brush attachment on the market.</li>
            <li> Noce dryer, works well, does what is advertised.  If you like this style of dryer, a good value and it is dual-voltage.</li>
            <li> The good: This styler dryer has saved me so much time and frustration! It turns my long, wavy hair into smooth, straight hair after only 10 minutes. I have been using Conair styler dryers for about four years now. They never short and the brush bristles rarely fall out! In comparison, I found that the Vidal Sassoon model shorts easily and pops, and its brush bristles are complete garbage.     The bad: As previously mentioned, it&#x27;s loud and a burning smell starts to occur after wear and tear - 6 months to a year. It also takes a little while to get used to the weight and bulk when you start using it. Definitely not a good styling option for someone who wants a lot of flexibility in their styling, as it doesn&#x27;t fully curl ends.     Conclusion: However, with that said, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20-$30 annually or semiannually to replace it because of the great straigthening results. I have yet to find a better straightening blow dryer for under $50.     Recommendations: Use a heat guard creme or spray as well as serum first to cut down on heat damage and creater softer, shinier hair. (CHI products are excellent if you are stumped.) Consider using a tourmaline flat iron after if you are going for the ultimate sleek effect or use a curling iron if you want to curl ends a little more to give hair more a salon-styled effect.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my hair so straight, so quickly, than with this hair dryer.  It elimiates the need for needing to coordinate a brush and hair dryer becuase it is all in one.  My hair looks the best it has ever looked whenever I use this dryer!</li>
            <li> 1875 Ionic Styler/ Dryer - Quieter than most hair dryers and does it job fast.  An unheralded feature is the cord guard at the handle.  Although all instructions say not to wrap the cord around the handle, everyone does which eventually causes the dryer to fail.  Conair has reinforced the area where the cord enters the handle, which should protect it from pre-mature death.</li>
            <li> amaaaaaazing i love it, so easy and fast specially when i divide my hair to quarters</li>
            <li> I am amazed how hard it is to find this hair dryer in stores. With the popularity of straight hair, it is so easy with the brush attachment! I love it so much - I bought tHree!!</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair and when I get my hair cut and styled by someone else it looks great, but I have the hardest time styling it myself. I have tried the round brushes and standard hairdryer but I just can&#x27;t get the hang of it. This hairdryer helps out. My hair never looked so thick (with hair products of course)! The dryer is easy to use and the comb options are nice. If you have problems with the round brushes I would recommend you to try this out.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another Conair that burned out.  This one lasted several months before it began shooting sparks out of the base and caught fire.  It had been handled gently, banged on nothing, and except for the flames shooting out looked brand new.  Very dangerous product that doesn&#x27;t deserve its Underwriters Laboratories seal.</li>
            <li> Excellent blowdryer for curly hair.  Snap on brush attachment and straightens hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer no problem but brush attachment keep coming off. Clicks but never locks on drying base. Sad because I like the size,color and cool down button.</li>
            <li> Between us, my daughter and I have owned 3 or 4 of these.  They are fast, light-weight and not too noisy (considering how powerful they are) but the big drawback is that the combs don&#x27;t last long; once the first tooth falls out, others follow rapidly.  Replacement combs are not available through the Conair site.  My daughter, who has very thick, curly hair, has burned out at least one of these dryers but I have never had that problem, and my hair is medium-thick and wavy.  It really bugs me that I will have to buy a new hairdryer just to get the combs.  Oh, and in my opinion the brush is so soft, it&#x27;s totally useless.  If it weren&#x27;t for the comb and brush problem, I&#x27;d give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> For my hairstyle, I need a hairdryer with a brush attachment - and they are hard to find.  Unfortunately, the brush part falls off some of the time.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer stinks!  If you try to use the brush with it the brush finds a way to work its way off the base.  Very frustrating!  I have long, thick hair and I need the brush to get that smooth finish that I like.  Since the brush is always flopping off, all I get is aggravation.  Look for another hairdryer, this one will  make you furious!</li>
            <li> This is the only hairdryer I use.  When I saw the sale price, I bought two and put them away for the future!</li>
            <li> It works really well at what it does. I have a lot of fine hair so it can get dried out easily. This hair dryer is pretty good at not frying it out and manages to do it in a manageable time (about 30 minutes, but I have a LOT of hair). Faster drying time would be nicer but I can&#x27;t say that a hairdryer is a priority enough to spend too much money. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Brush does NOT stay on dryer.  It is terrible!  Called customer service to try to find a solution and they were NO help.</li>
            <li> I have used these brush attachment hair dryers since the 3rd grade... which was a while ago. This dryer is one of the better dryers I have used with a big BUT. The dryer works great and doesn&#x27;t short out / over heat like many of the other brands do. HOWEVER, the brush fell off the first time I used it and will not stick back in the grooves. I have it attached by hair bands and it less than ideal.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new hair dryer.  It functions great, drys well and is easy to handle. Dryers with combs are hard to find and he loves this one from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Great product. Had it for awhile and it still works great. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The conair hair dryer with brush attachment has been my favorite hairdryer for the last 20 years.  It makes it easy to straighten out my hair.  It really does the job.  The only (slight) problem with this version is that the brush attachment will slip off once in a while.</li>
            <li> i used this hairdryer when i was on vacation with some friends and one of them had it. i don&#x27;t actually own it YET. but i plan on purchasing one. FYI if you want to buy it at a store instead of online i saw it at Christmas Tree Shop the other day for $23. I&#x27;ll be getting mine on amazon because I have a gift certificate. Can&#x27;t wait to have my very own &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> excellent product, works great, great price, Target didn&#x27;t have it on the shelf locally but they sell it here on Amazon.  Funny huh?</li>
            <li> This is my second dryer - very good dryers.  My first lasted for years with daily use.</li>
            <li> We have 2 of these hair dryers.  They are the ones our local salon uses and tells for $50+ each.  So buying them on Amazon was a great deal.  This dryer saves on the time you need to flat iron your hair and it works great on really thick hair too.  I don&#x27;t know how I did it before this product!  We love it!</li>
            <li> This dryer seemed like a great idea. It can be difficult to maneuver a brush and blow dryer at the same time, so why not build the brush into the blow dryer? Terrific! Except that once the blow dryer is turned on the heat warps the brush attachment and it then falls off.  The comb attachments will stay on, so you can use the comb attachments to detangle your hair while you dry it, but the brush attachment simply will not stay on, so give up on any hope of actually styling while drying. Seriously, the brush attachment will not stay on for ANY TIME at all, once the heat is blowing through the dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t even stay on all that well when the dryer is off. Overall, I would say that this was a waste of money. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 of these blow dryers over 10 years.  What breaks down eventually is that it tends to overheat and blow out the heating coil, so I try to use the button that blows on cool as often as I can.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th Conair and I love it as it is the only dryer that I know that is attached to the brush</li>
            <li> It heats up too much and turns off by itself. Not impressed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this style hair dryer for at least 10 years, and there is something about this type (and this model specifically) of dryer that causes it to die quickly.  My biggest issue is that it seems to trip my GFI frequently, and hair builds up inside the dryer (no matter if you try to pull it out each use) and starts to burn and smell.  The brush attachment gets frayed after some use, which is to be expected.  That said, this is a great tool to quickly dry curly hair and make it straight.  I&#x27;ve never been coordinated enough to use a brush and dryer to straighten my hair.  This is a brush and dryer in one.  Be sure to put some product in your hair and separate it into sections properly to ensure a good blow dry.  Even though I have to frequently replace this dryer, I continue to use it for it&#x27;s ease.</li>
            <li> I was relieved to find a hair dryer with a brush attachment. After checking several stores without results I turned to my &#x27;go to&#x27; source, Amazon, and, as usual they came through again!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is excellent and I use it every day for a fast hair drying experience.</li>
            <li> The first few uses this dryer worked great.  My hair dried quickly and was left soft and shiny.  Unfortunately after a couple of weeks the dryer would continually short out.  Whenever I turned it on, it would buzz very loudly and sort of vibrate and shake while I attempted to dry my hair.  When I turned on the high heat seating it would only work for a few seconds and then cut off. I have naturally curly so I only blow dry my hair 1-2 times a week and was very disappointed that this product lasted such a short time.</li>
            <li> The large brush would not remain clipped on the blower.  I drilled holes and tied to the blower with thin wire.  Recommend a redesign for the attachment retaining mechanism.  works excellent now; however, only one attachment can be used.</li>
            <li> Brush keeps falling off. Very disappointed in the quality.  Wish I could find one like my old one that finally died after 10 years. Any suggestions are welcomed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in store. It is a good item, however it is a HUGE hassle to get replacement combs. I just end up buying the package for the combs, which does not make too much sense. I now own 3 of those!</li>
            <li> Me being African American, I needed a blow dryer with a comb. This came with two combs and a brush-like part. Using this dryer got my hair close to straight and it did not take long either. Always stick with Conair!</li>
            <li> Hair dryers like this with the brush type attachment aren&#x27;t very popular so they are bit hard to find. I&#x27;m a guy so i need a brush attachment since I don&#x27;t do too well with a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other. i had one exactly like this one and I probalby had it at least 7-8 years. It finally wore out.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t blow very hard</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> I have extreemly tight curls and my previous, similar blow dryer died on me. So I decided to try this one out! Its perfect to brush out my curls for when I want to straighten my hair or add fake loose curls. Its works perfect. Its not too loud. The only thing I found is that sometimes the brush slides or comes off the track, but I just tighten the tracks on the brush together and it hasnt fallen off since.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. Granted, I use it for the shape, not the attachments.  I buy one every few years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair dryer twice and gotten really good results. I have another conair hairdryer that&#x27;s a different design and I think that the company has pretty high quality products. My mother used to have a hair dryer like this when I was a kid, it was bright orange and I have good memories of it. That was back when Mom did my hair. Now that I&#x27;m all grown up and doing hair on my own I have issues with getting my hair dry. I have very thick hair, it&#x27;s also pretty long and it takes ages to straighten. I have to do it in sections. I normally section my hair off into four sections and work from the back forward to dry it. This dryer helps concentrate the heat and air on to my hair because the comb holds it tight. It&#x27;s pretty fast, too. It cut my drying time down by probably twenty or thirty minutes. I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron afterwards but I noticed that my roots were straighter and I didn&#x27;t have any damp spots.</li>
            <li> Hope they continue to make this style of dryer!  Works well and lasts a long time.  I have long, thick hair and I use the same one for well over a year.</li>
            <li> When purchasing your item I was not made aware that it was not under the Australian standards I do not have an American power point in my home no one does here in Austraia, so this product is useless to me and I have no return address to send it back to. So if you can help me with this problem I would very much appreciate it.  Conair sd6x 1875-watt ionic styler</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, really pulls my thick, curly hair straight!</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of dryer I can ever use to blow my hair straight and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d ever do if they stopped making them.  I replace them every few years.  My complaints are the brush falling off, like most everyone else mentions, and the fact that it gets so hot.  Wish there was a way to get the strong air power without the temperature getting so high.  Guess I can try it on low and see if it takes really long to dry.  I get tired of holding down the cool button, but don&#x27;t want to expose my hair to such direct heat, since the whole purpose of this style of dryer is to run the brush through your hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I still use this hair dryer and I bought it years ago!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer five years ago and the brush wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s not a matter of my hair being too thick.  I had to wrap the edges of the brush with electrical tape to keep the brush on and then it worked ok. (I made sure not to cover any vents.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer recently broke so I decided to get the same one, hoping that they fixed the problem.  But they didn&#x27;t.  Does Conair just not care?  Why would they continue to manufacture this model without fixing a known problem?  But I like this hairdryer because so far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found to smooth my curly hair.  I have a Vidal Sasoon, but the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough so the brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the top layer of hair and it gets frizzy.  If I could find another hairdryer with the same sturdy long bristles, I would buy it instead.  So I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.  If the brush stayed on, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s REALLY fast (so fast that I sometimes end up with a weird cowlick or whatever because I didn&#x27;t realize some of my hair was already dry and I&#x27;d missed the styling window)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It makes my hair even shinier than usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Gets rid of frizzies pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t hang out in the humid bathroom for too long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Requires less coordination than brush/dryer combo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s VERY loud and high-pitched and I do have to dry the hair behind my ears, which means the noise is aimed right in my ear canal, and that ain&#x27;t good (I put cotton balls in my ears before I turn the dryer on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It blows my hair around so I don&#x27;t have a lot of control over the end result of my efforts (to be honest with you I don&#x27;t usually care that much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s a bit heavy, and because you use it like a brush, it gets really close to your head (which in my case means I crack myself in the head with it every few days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The cord is too short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a shot if you want a fast dryer.  It takes me maybe 5 minutes to dry my shortish hair, and it used to take up to 10 with a standard drugstore hairdryer. I hate to think of people damaging their vulnerable ears with this thing though; hopefully I just got an abnormally noisy dryer.</li>
            <li> I was glad when I got this hair dryer. It was not great but i thought it did the job just about O.K. The dryer is very loud and it is not easy to handle. But the bigger problem with it was that it stopped working in three days. What more can I say then if it works then good for you...</li>
            <li> had three of these before, what i like</li>
            <li> This hair dryer (with the brush attachment) gives you the same results you would get from the traditional blow dryer and big round brush technique (the way they do it at the salon), except this is much simpler. I divide my hair into small sections and clip them up. Then I dry one section at a time starting from the bottom. The whole process goes very quickly this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other similar dryers but found the brush attachment to be too soft. This one has a stiff brush which is essential to really grasp the hair so that it dries straight. I still need to use a flat iron to really get my hair smooth, but the ironing goes quicker if I dry my hair this way first. (If your hair is not as curly as mine, you&#x27;ll probably get smoother results and not need the flat iron)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush will wear down with time, but you can order replacements for about $3.50 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb attachments are totally useless (for me). Not sure why anyone would want to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this dryer is that I can also use it as a diffuser when I want to keep my hair curly. Just keep the brush attachment on the dryer but don&#x27;t let it come in contact with your hair. Hold it a few inches away. The brush attachment will prevent your hair from flying all over the place and thus acting as a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, it is loud, but so are all dryers of this type. I recommend using a good pair of earplugs. ;)</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer.  My real challenge has been the durability of dryers before they fail to heat or begin dangerously overheating, and I do prefer tourmaline, ionic, or ceramic dryers, because I use my dryer daily on wet or dry relaxed hair.  So far, my favorite is this one, it dryes fast, and leaves my hair with a straight, soft, and healthy appearance.  I&#x27;ve owned similar dryers made by both Conair &amp; Andis, but I prefer Conair&#x27;s durability.  Competitor, Andis, makes an great ceramic dryer and replacement combs are VERY easy to find in stores and online, however my Andis dryers have not lasted as long, I end up spending more replacing the dryers themself than the combs.  My Conair has lasted a very long time, even bumping around when I travel.  Thanks to another reviewer her, I found out you can also easily order replacement combs by calling them directly.  Excellent customer service as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call Conair.com&#x27;s customer service with the part no. SD6NP at 1-800-326-6247 (open late also!).</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and it is very heavy. It takes forever to dry my hair. It gets really tiring when I have to hold the dryer in one hand the bursh in another.    This hair dryer is all in one. You don&#x27;t need to use a bursh and it is very fast.  The cord is too short. But other than that is is one of the best hair dryers I have used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but, since I&#x27;m going to return this product to Amazon, I thought I take the time to comment on why. The dryer is fine; it doesn&#x27;t overheat and yet it still drys quickly. The major problem with this dryer, though, is the brush attachment. No matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried to snap the brush in place, it continues to come off while I&#x27;m drying my hair. There&#x27;s not much point in an attachment dryer without attachments!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer. Dries hair quickly as it straightens. Use it on my girls hair all the time.</li>
            <li> Works well for my curly hair- but it is quite loud, as another user noted in a review.  Also, if it gets too hot, it automatically shuts off, and won&#x27;t turn on until it cools for a few minutes.  To remedy this, I use the cool shot button after drying each section of hair.  This cools the hair down quickly and also cools the dryer so it won&#x27;t overheat.  Other than that-  it works great on my thick hair, dries quickly, and using the comb attachment gives me the control I need for drying my own hair, without having it fly all over the place.  I use the fine comb, but it also comes with a wide comb attachment and a brush attachment, which I never used.  I prefer the fine comb, which straightens better. This one is replacing an identical one that I had for several years.  Just a tip-   after a while, due to the heat, the comb attachment will inevitably begin to lose some of the teeth.  When this happens, I order replacements for a few dollars each-  there is an order form in the box.</li>
            <li> I had to hot-glue-- I kid you not-- the bristle-brush attachment onto the dryer. It slipped right off, popped right off, drove me nuts. this product would have been much better if it came with just one permanent brush instead of three snap-ons. Sometimes simpler is better. Unless you&#x27;ve got a hot-glue-gun handy: I&#x27;d buy a different brush if I were you--make sure it&#x27;s a straight brush like this one, and not a rounded brush because those do not dry wet hair. The straight bristle brush gets at your roots and gives volume, and also straightens/de-frizzes straight-wavy hair. If you can keep the headpiece on, you&#x27;ll get a salon-quality blow-out in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> not effective for long curly hair!!! The clip on&#x27;s are not strong enough, the bristles are too hard and not long enough to stabilize long hair.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer! Attachment pieces tend to loosen the longer the dryer is on &amp; the dryer motor seems to get louder as well. But the hair dryer still drys &amp; styles the way I like it to.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works exceptionally well esp. women of color. It straightens your hair easily without pulling, handles well in your hand. I would highly recommend this product. I personally prefer a dryer that straightens your hair without overdrying while still leaving your hair full of body. I am extremely hard to please when it comes to my hair. This is by far the best hair dryer and you can&#x27;t beat the price.[[ASIN:B000JUV816 Conair SD6IS Ion Shine 1875-Watt Hair Dryer with Three Attachments]]</li>
            <li> only type of dryer my husband uses. very good for one handed lifting and drying hair.  his old dryer burned out and we replaced it for over $30 with this exact model.  i wanted to keep an extra one for the guest bath and the price was so good to keep on hand</li>
            <li> I would have given this product five stars if one  &amp;#34;major&amp;#34; problem didn&#x27;t exist!!! When the conair gets hot the combs, or brush keeps falling off!!! The insert, or grooves need to be deeper so the attachments will stay on more secure.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has saved my life, not event exaggerating. It works wonders on curly hair.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t really click on that well and loosen up after a few uses so you have to either hold it on with your hand or put a rubber band on it.</li>
            <li> I have used this same hair dryer for years and years.  This is my third or fourth one.  My wife uses one also.  This style is getting somewhat hard to find.  For a male with short hair it is perfect.  Seems like females with long hair prefer the blower type but his allows you to \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; up my thinning hair and make it look a little fuller.  Conair lasts and lasts.  Great product.  I primarily use the brush.  When the brush wears out it is just about as cheap to order a new dryer.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I loved this dryer to begin with, it works very quickly and smoothed out my curly hair really well. After having it about 6 months now it has begun to overheat almost immediately into the drying cycle. I have literally found charred pieces of my hair in the sink and the bathroom smells like burning hair. I liked it so much I may buy another and give it another chance, but not cool to have to replace it so quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years because of their ease of use and speed of drying. You use it like you would the brush if you use a pistol dryer.  It creates a smooth style with just the right amount of volume.  It&#x27;s so much faster than pistol and hand brush styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have been searching for a dyer and brush two in love for a long time and finally I got what I wanted. I even got one for my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The brush and comb attachments are practically useless.  They slip and slide off with the slightest of pressure. I had to &amp;#34;SuperGlue the brush attachment on to keep it from  coming off during use.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd dryer like this I have and it is great. I really like it as it has a comb attachment &amp; makes it much easier to dry my thick hair, especially in the back. Has plenty of power for a quick dry, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer before and it was great. However, this time the brush isn&#x27;t fitting right. I took my old brush and put it on my new blow dryer and it works great. But now a month later it makes a loud noise and shuts off.</li>
            <li> Great for taming and smoothing hair</li>
            <li> Brush falls off when hot.</li>
            <li> Have used Conair styler/dryers forever, and fully expected to love this new one.  Unfortunately, in under one week of use, it sounds like something internal (can&#x27;t be seen) has come loose and is banging when the dryer is turned on.  It has gone from a normal hairdryer roar to sounding like a lawnmower, which is quite disconcerting when being used beside one&#x27;s head.  Like many others, I use this kind of dryer to straighten my hair; unfortunately, the brush attachment falls off s soon as the dryer warms, rendering it totally useless.  Sorry Conair, this dryer is a colossal fail.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Son for Christmas as he had a lot of hair and went out with it wet a lot.  He decided to cheap out and cut his own hair a few days later, but forgot to put the guard on the clippers.  Needless to say, it will be quite awhile before he will be trying out the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother had a hair dryer like this when we were teenagers and his hair always looked great when he used it.  I even used it back then and I loved it.  That is why I went searching for this one for my Son.  Oh well, hair usually grows back.  Right?</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer. Its easy to hold and maneuver. My only problem is that the cool button does NOT hold in place like it says on the box...besides that its great!!</li>
            <li> love this dryer, perfect for when you want your hair straight.</li>
            <li> The brush falls off and I have thin, above the shoulder hair, so it is not a question of my hair being too tough to style.  The quality of the product is not like it used to be.</li>
            <li> This is an okay dryer.  It does the job but the brush attachment wont stay on the dryer and slides off.</li>
            <li> If you want a hair dryer with the comb attached to the air blower, this is one of the few remaining models for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer with lots of power.  It&#x27;s wattage makes your drying time very fast.   It&#x27;s compact and easy to use both at home and for travel.   The brush and comb attachment leaves you with very smooth hair.  You can style your hair while drying it with the attachments.    No more using a brush in one hand and a dryer in the other.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this. It is the best blow dryer I ever used. The price wast excellent for the quality of drying.</li>
            <li> So I was drying my hair this morning when it occurred to me that I have had my Conair Ion Shine dryer since 2007. I have used it almost everyday since then. The things I really like about it are that it gets my hair dry fairly quickly, it gets my hair straight-ish(saves time when straightening with a Chi afterward), and I also appreciate the fact that it has lived this long and is still working. I only use the brushy attachment and threw the comb ones away a long time ago. When it finally does die, I am considering purchasing another one! $19.99 for something that I use every day and will last almost a decade is a worthwhile purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 15 years. Unfortunately my most recent orders must if been defective. The brush kept on coming off the dryer. I returned the two dryers I ordered and they resent me 2 new ones. After two weeks of using it, the same thing is happening Again. I need to return it!</li>
            <li> Ok, it didn&#x27;t really die, but it started overheating right away and something is wrong with it as it got real loud, started to vibrate, and scared me enough to stop using it.  I was afraid of burning my hair.  I have purchased this item in the past and it lasted several years, so I don&#x27;t know if this one was defective, or they all wear out quickly.  I still love this style of hair dryer as my hair is thick and curly.  I am going to try the infiniti pro.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick and wavy hair and  this works well for that if the attachment stayed on. It doesn&#x27;t,I had to tape it. Beyond that it dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about this dryer and took a risk after reading the variety of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with this dryer. Like other purchasers, I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment and think it&#x27;s great (I&#x27;m excited to try the other attachments). This dryer is not loud. It&#x27;s travel-size friendly, but still a hefty (not heavy, but ...durable feeling) dryer. I get consistent results each time I use it, too.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, the brush kept falling off when the dryer heated up.  I emailed Conair, and they sent me a new brush, which appears to be made of a different type of plastic, which stays on.  I rate them 5 stars for GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li> WORKS GERAT I HAVE HAD NO PREBLEMS WITH THIS DRYER. MY HAIR FEELS GOOD AFTER,. I USE IT. IN THE PAST I HAVE GIVEN ONE TO A FRIEND, SHE LOVES IT TOO.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment falls off.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> good value; works great</li>
            <li> Works great and makes drying my thick, wavy hair much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> I need a brush attachment that has firm bristles to get through my thick hair and this one was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> brush constantly fell off. I returned it and ordered the Conair Pro</li>
            <li> The brush kept falling off. Would have returned it if I had not lost the bill.</li>
            <li> Very few hairdryers are still designed with the brush attached to the blower. I love drying and styling my hair this way and hope they never discontinue this model.</li>
            <li> brush does not stay attached during use. I&#x27;ve had to wire it in place.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> for someone that can not use a round brush and blow dry my hair this is my favorite tool. i have gone through 3 of these now. and get a new one yearly. this makes drying fast and leaves my hair straight and silky smooth. it wont last forever, but is an easy to use tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my old Conair lasted 10 yrs.  The new one has softer heat.  I like the flat blower because I find the&lt;br /&gt;it easier to handle &amp; more direct focus on each area of the head.</li>
            <li> Wife likes the brush with the bristles - most stylers do not have this - have used this brand over several years&lt;br /&gt;and has proven to be a good product</li>
            <li> My wife is using it as a really good and fast dryer / styler.&lt;br /&gt;Issues:&lt;br /&gt;1- While you are using the styling brush, it gets warm and consequently loose. It falls off the body so they should change the material or think of some solution.&lt;br /&gt;2- It works with a loud noise.</li>
            <li> Worst hair dryer ever! I hate this hair dryer! Yes it dries my hair, but if the brush attachment falls off forget trying to keep it on again.  I don&#x27;t understand why sometimes it falls off I put it back on effortlessly and it stays and then most times it keeps falling off every 2 seconds (no exaggeration here).  Awesome if the brush attachment stayed but useless to have a brush attachment that falls off like this so much.  I was in middle drying my hair and this made me so frustrated I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> Too heavy which make it uncomfortable to hold and handle with single hand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after my old conair hand held dryer went out. Its an exact replica of what I had, so I knew what I was getting. It works.</li>
            <li> My second one in 15 years. Works perfect. Arrived on time, has dual voltage and a good brush, good heat, doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair products for many years and have never had one that was such a piece of junk.  It makes a high pitched noise on both hot and warm. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for 10 plus years and it just blew out today. I&#x27;m pretty it would lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t drop it a bunchof times. I&#x27;m gonna by the same exact one again. Its easy to handle too and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love! this product. Makes my life easier. It came highly recommended by my cousin and I am not disappointed. I&#x27;ll be recommending it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> okay - but doest seem as strong as i need for my hair. the brush is a little floppy and falls off if it gets stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a year ago I have only used it maybe 7 times after the about the 5th used it started making a funny noise it still dries but that noise is scary</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my son.  He loves it.  It works great on his thick hair.  He&#x27;s used this Conair model for years.  I was unable to find it in any store.  I was very glad to find it at Amazon.  The last Conair dryer lasted a lot longer than the warranty indicated.</li>
            <li> I like it because it dries my hair quickly and has the brush attachment for the ability to style while drying</li>
            <li> Very nice and heavy duty product. We take it everywhere with us, the power converging is making it easy to travel with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for one handed blow drying when I broke my wrist. Works very well and dries hair quickly and frizz free. Only complaint is brush attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on well while in use. Comb attachment works great and gets hair very straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> The attachments do not fit properly when in use.</li>
            <li> LACKS POWER WHEN USING HIGH SPEED SETTING. PURCHASED &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt&amp;#60;&amp;#60; AND IM VERY PLEASED WITH ITS POWER.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty purchase of the year. I have long hair and am lazy. This dryer is an answered prayer. I am able to essentially flat iron and dry my hair at the same time! My hair has a slight wave, but isn&#x27;t straight without a tool. My old 1875 dryer would take 30 minutes to dry. This dryer is faster to dry and saves the time of having to use a second tool (which I usually wouldn&#x27;t do because..I&#x27;m lazy.) I will say you need to make sure you use a heat protectant because the heat very concentrated and close to the hair. I still use two hands, one on the dryer and the other to keep the hair in the comb. The only two negative for me is my roots are flatter with this dryer than a flat iron, because I wouldn&#x27;t iron as high and it is loud around the ears. Neither of which are a deterrent from purchasing or using religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to wavy/staying comb. I will update when I do. I do get a great blow out with the straightening comb or the detangling comb.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair styler. Well made,good price and excellent results. You can&#x27;t go wrong beleive me.</li>
            <li> anytime I order one of these, the brush does not fit!  what good is that if I am buying it for the brush? I am trying vidal Sassoon now which I am sure will be fine.</li>
            <li> My husband has preferred using this style hair dryer for years. His old one \\&quot; died\\&quot; on him and he wasn&#x27;t having much success styling his hair using a \\&quot; nozzle\\&quot; style hair dryer without a brush attachment .  He was not happy with the newer style hair dryers and had gone to store after store looking for one with the brush attachment with no success. I decided to check on Amazon .com and was overjoyed to discover I could order the style he liked . I ordered 2 of them for him. Thank you Amazon for having products that are hard if not impossible to find in stores. My husband is very happy and I am very satisfied with my order. Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the places that I had searched for it.</li>
            <li> lovely do you sell dvd</li>
            <li> works well for people who have difficulty using a brush and blowdryer separately. but the brush attachment falls off all the time. very anyoing. leaves hair shiny</li>
            <li> I have used this before and find it to be just as amazing now. I will be encouraging others to buy this Conair blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair and I felt that my hair does not stay as &amp;#34;blow-dried&amp;#34;.. It tends to curl back up. This product seems to work better on wavy hair. My friend loved it and her hair is not as curly as mine.</li>
            <li> The styler has plenty of power and easy to hold. The only drawback, the attachment keeps coming off. We had to tape it on.</li>
            <li> I have used this model of hair dryer for many years. It does a wonderful job of smoothing out my frizzy curly hair. I would be a mess without it. It is usually the only thing I need to fix my hair, no curling irons or straightening irons, unless I want to do something extra special or different.  My one complaint and the reason for not giving it a 5 star is that they do wear out after a couple of years and have to be replaced. But they aren&#x27;t too expensive. And I would be lost without mine!</li>
            <li> The brush attachments allow for the (almost) look of a professional blow out. I have hair a few inches past my shoulders and always get compliments when I use this dryer versus a regular.</li>
            <li> I am have researching hair dryer stylers. I purchased this item from Sears and thought it would work.  I used the brush attachment which kept falling off.  I thought it was defective but I saw no chips in the frame of the attachment. It did not dry well and even after styling it was still frizzy.  I used Herbal Essense anti-frizz leave in cream no mousse though.  I guess it depends what type of hair you have (ie. thick hair vs. thin hair). I would recommend you buy this styler from a walk-in store so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you you can return it without having to pay return shipping.  I also noticed this styler is available at CVS, Walgreens and Harmons.  I have tried other stylers and still have not found the right one for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. works for natural black hair perfectly!  also dries hair super fast!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair dryer of all time.  Love that it has the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair stylers for years.  My biggest fear is that one day they won&#x27;t exist anymore.  So whenever I find these or see a great buy, I stock up on them.  You can use these so much better than with a separate brush and hair dryer, particulary, if you are doing it youself.  Hairdressers use the separage hair dryer and separate brush method, but when doing it yourself, having a contained unit is so much easier and faster.  I dry and style my hair with this Conair styling sick in about 3 minutes and I have medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I think the concept id awesome, I have been using this type of blow-drier for years; however the downside of this bran is that it does not offer/sale replacements for the attachments. So I&#x27;ll discourage purchase if you need those attachments in order to dry your hair. I&#x27;m in the process of buying a new one only because I need attachments. Im researching the different brands with this type of concept and the only two that sale replacements are the Andis and the Gold N Hot. BTW the blower still works great so Ill probably donate it.</li>
            <li> When my old hair dryer broke, I was delighted to be able to purchase this model again! It has variable speed and temperature and gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> great and the vent flip is nice for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer with the brush attached.  Easy to use and fluffs hair without using a separate brush.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this hairdryer. I have been using this hairdryer for 15 years and have never had a problem with it. This one however would not attach the brush part to it. Every time I would put it thru my hair the brush would fall off on the floor. I threw the box away before using it because I didn&#x27;t think there would be an issue since I have used this dryer so many times.</li>
            <li> I had used this for at least 5 years before I purchased a new one on amazon... And I LOVED it.  I flip my head over and use the brush attachment, It works so well to get my hair smooth and give it a little bit of body.  I have never used another hair dryer where I didnt have to straighten my hair after to make it look more smooth and straight, but this hair dryer leaves it perfect so I don&#x27;t have to mess around with it after it&#x27;s dried.  The only downside is that with the new one that I got off amazon, the three attachments don&#x27;t always stay attached to the hairdryer and sometimes when I&#x27;m drying my hair they will fall off.. But I still think it is worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my first dryer.  It dries my natural hair very quickly using the low heat settings.  But unlike my mother&#x27;s Conair dryer it does not straighten my hair as well nor does it leave it feeling soft like my mother&#x27;s Conair dryer; that is the only thing that is missing.  I like the fact that it feels so much like a brush due to the design, this makes it easier for me to dry my own hair.    It is a little on the noisy side which I don&#x27;t mind, I find the high heat settings to be quite hot.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and like to straighten it when I dry it.  I can use a bush and blow dryer to do everything but my bangs. For them I need a styler dryer.  This one is the perfect size for styling while you dry and it leaves my hair soft and in much better condition than my old dryer.  Love the product and love the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular hair dryer for years and I just had to replace mine in March 2014.  While using it this week (and I do not use it every day), it started making a very funny sound and stopped working.  The return policy expired on April 14th but would like to get this replaced if possible or purchase it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I really like using this type Blow Dryer.  This is exactly what I needed at the BEST price I could find.  Thanks Amazon, you saved the day again!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair, and I loved the results so much I bought my own.  It dries your hair in record time, while styling it at the same time.  My hair is thick, and it can be difficult to work with; but I just use the finer comb attachment, and voila!  It&#x27;s seriously like magic.  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this styler before!  Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a dryer and styler in one.</li>
            <li> got it as a gift... loves it</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Conair styler which was almost identical,but which burned out after nearly 4 years of daily use.The quality of this new one is a BIG step down from it&#x27;s older brother. Mainly,the attachments are made of a much thinner plastic,so they tend to flex while using and pop off. I noticed this the first time I used it,and I had the old brush from the burned out Conair for comparison. I am so glad that I kept the old dryer attachments and that they fit this new model. Using THOSE attachments,the dryer meets expectations. If these attachments break,I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand.</li>
            <li> I loved this Hair Dryer! My hair usually takes about 15 minutes to dry, but now it only takes 7 minutes to dry my hair. Once my hair is finished, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is smoother with a drastic decrease in the amount of frizz.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and this dryer gets my hair really stright and dried very quickly. I would totally recommend this product</li>
            <li> The Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic Styler with 3 Attachments was a replacement styler for the one I broke that belonged to my wife.  I&#x27;m kind of glad I broke the old one because the new one works great and was inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairdryer that can style my naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s quick and easy and I never have to set my hair. By-by curls, hello soft waves.</li>
            <li> Heats up well ....2 of the attachments work fine. The brush pops off constantly during use. This is the only draw back</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair. From the reviews I was excited to try this out. Unfortunately, the first time I used it the brush attachment kept coming off while I was trying to dry my hair. Not the result I was looking for.</li>
            <li> exactly  what I expected</li>
            <li> CHEAP, FLIMSY, DID NOT HOLD UP. BRUSH ATTACHMENTS MELTED LIKE NOODLES WHEN THE WARM AIR GOT TO THEM. SENT IT BACK TO AMAZON~ PURCHASED INFINITI PRO CONAIR. It is sturdy &amp; lasts.</li>
            <li> Excellent version of this hard to find in stores hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I already have the same exact blow dryer that I got years ago. That one still works great. I just bought a replica because I needed a new comb attachment. This blow dryer works well and does what is designed to do. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s hair dryers continue to be great for frizzy, curly hair.  They last 1-2 years and do a great job.  I need the brush attachment right on the hair dryer to straighten my hair and the last few dryers I purchased from Conair were far superior to others as far as the brush attachment staying secure on the dryer.  With some others, after awhile, I had to duck tape the attachment to the dryer!!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.  It is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this model, and was very satisfied both time.</li>
            <li> Not all the different style brushes actually fit on the dryer... the most important one the roller brush doesn&#x27;t even stay on for three minutes!!! So disappointing!</li>
            <li> I love it, left my natural 3c Curly afro hair straight and sleek.The styler however shuts off when i turn it up to the high setting, apart from that i love it because it works very well on the low heat setting.</li>
            <li> Great - hubby uses it daily!!!</li>
            <li> It works great! I just wish there was medium heat option</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my sister and she love it.</li>
            <li> I love the dryer the attachment kit to large want buy again</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model that served me well for many years.  The newer version does not seem to be as well built as the previous model.  The attachments do not seem to securely attach to the body of the unit and the fan does not seem to blow as strong as the older model.  It is serving me well so far and I would recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> The brush keeps coming off while I am trying to dry my hair. It does not stay on no matter how many times I reattach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this dryer twice from walmart.  Both times it lasted about 2 years each which isn&#x27;t too bad considering I paid $20 for it and literally use it every day.  My head looks like a bush if I dont use heat to dry it and it REALLY cuts down on the straitener time it would normally take with a normal dryer.  I&#x27;ll never use another type of dryer but this kind.  I am going to try a different brand this time just shake things up a bit, but I definately recommend this to all other bushy headed ladies like myself.  It&#x27;s a morning changer :-)  Edit: It is true that the brush does not want to stay attached, but I reattached it with duct tape and it never fell off again. Totally forgot about that so I will deduct one star.  It looks a bit junky with the duct tape but for how well it works on my hair, I&#x27;ll still buy another one.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this dryer if you want to use it to straighten your hair! The brush attachment does not stay on when you try to brush your hair dry.  I have very curly hair and have been using this type of dryer for over 20 years to straighten my hair.  This is the first time I have encountered one where the hair brush does not stay on.  I called Conair and was on hold about 10 min.  The first person I spoke with told me I could buy another attachment for $4.50.  I told him the product was brand new and I was not going to pay for a another attachment when it was probably a design flaw.  Then he suggested I return it to where I purchased it, as they have no warranty - the customer just has to purchase new parts - really, are you kidding me???  Next I spoke with the floor supervisor who told me the same thing or suggested I send in the entire unit, at my expense, of course.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it -Brand New and  they want me to pay - I had to verify again with him that they do not back up their product.  I&#x27;m going back to the Vidal Sassoon Brand.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is awesome! So powerful and with the brush attachment I can completely blow out my long curly hair in about 10 minutes! Love, love love it! Too bad you can&#x27;t find it too easily in stores now but after a lousy experience with an Andis blow dryer I will never stray from my Conair again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this style dryer for many years and never wanted to change until now.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side: the price is good.  It dries my hair.  I straightens my hair. (hence 2 stars)&lt;br /&gt;On the minus side: the brush will not stay on.  I finally had to switch to the comb attachment which stays on better, but does not give me the look I want.  However, the biggest problem by far is the noise.  This dryer is LOUD.  Loud enough to wear earplugs!  After a few week of use it got even louder.  Sounds like a plane taking off.  Very annoying and it will keep me from buying this product again.</li>
            <li> JUNK.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair, but the high setting automatically turns off after about 2 minutes and then I have to wait until it cools down before I can even use the cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;Buy some other brand! .</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and I love the attachment I get to brush my hair that the same time.</li>
            <li> The brush will not stay on when I am using this.  This is very frustrating when I am in a hurry.  I plan to glue it.</li>
            <li> From the moment I got this hair dryer it has been awful.  The brush attachment started falling off after one use and there is no way to secure it.  Also, when drying on high heat it shuts off after 2-3 minutes.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic styler with 3 attachments works really good. This product didn&#x27;t make my hair static like other regular hair blow dryer. It also style my hair the way I wanted and make my hair more softer than other ones.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer. the one defect is the brush does not stay on very well, I have to hold it on and that&#x27;s ac-ward. But it does really dry fast.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and well packaged (although the box was quite oversized).  Unit was just a described.  Have had several of this type in the past and the only part that was useless on all of them was the brush attachment.  On all of them the bristles are to soft, even for very thin, fine hair.  But I never us any of the attachments anyway.  The drier itself is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. The combs never stayed on, the brush its useless.</li>
            <li> Works great, the clips sometimes fall off but other than that its great.</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine, but it is too big for how short my hair is - my bad.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about this dryer is that the brush comes off very easily while drying! I had to superglue it to stay on.</li>
            <li> The reason I use this style of hair dryer is for the brush attachment. The brush clips on fine when the dryer is cool. As it heats up during use, the brush just falls off. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hairdryer for as long as I can remember and continue to buy it when my old one breaks or starts to overheat.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> This makes blowdrying my hair so easily! I have tightly coilded hair and I love how easy and fast I can get through my hair with this thing. I think the main reason for it is the shape of this blowdryer. It&#x27;s only a little longer than the length of all my other wide tooth combs. It&#x27;s easy to grip and I can blowdry chunks of my hair at one time rather than taking small pieces.</li>
            <li> Lasts long. Works well for drying and styling.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, great!</li>
            <li> I have used a similar blow dryer and it would alway overheat and shut down, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that.  Works awesome!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend to use on his hair and he really likes it and uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> My hair dryer of many years broke recently and I was worried that I would not be able to find one with a comb attachment.  The Conair was a perfect replacement.  It seems to dry my hair.  By the way, I am a 68 year old guy, who is very happy to have enough hair to dry.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this model of conair hair dryer for years.  I really like the brush feature because it adds fullness to my hair.  The downfall of it is that I find they tend to burn out sooner than other hair dryers.  I usually have to replace it after about a year but that&#x27;s after using it daily.  If you don&#x27;t use it daily it may last much longer.</li>
            <li> I had a hair dryer similar to this in the eighties and wore it out.  A friend said she found one on Amazon so I looked and now I have my favorite back.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a dryer with a comb. This one works great. Glad you still carry it and that they still make it.</li>
            <li> The brush won&#x27;t stay on, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good, but I bought it for the brush feature.</li>
            <li> This recent order arrived damaged-- no electric power.  I have owned 6 or 7 of these over the past 30 years.  I love how it styles however, there is a defect with the heating element.  They ALWAYS melt on top side where brush attaches and get super hot.  Probably dangerous but I use caution and a prayer.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment, that I keep&lt;br /&gt;Buying the dryer for, DOES NOT FIT.  It keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> Bought for elderly mom, she says its heavier than others.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve had one if these blow dryers for many years until it gave up. This newer one is a charm. Can&#x27;t complain. I love it!</li>
            <li> It worked very well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it twice but very good so far.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend this item.</li>
            <li> Great product that smoothes your hair instantly. But note that hair might get little greasy because of hot air but that is fine and can be managed.  I was impressed by the heat and how quick do i get the result i want.</li>
            <li> The Conair Hair Dryer is for my mentallly-challenged son and meets his needs very well.  He needs the brush attachment; the comb attachment is something he could not manage in drying his hair.  Thank you for a product designed the way he truly needs!</li>
            <li> Really good value for money, although it would be better if it had more than two heat settings. Great for getting knots out of wet hair.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer was defective. I had to return it. Seller expressed regret and helped make arrangements to return quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought it in January of this year and since the beginning It keeps shutting off constantly in order to cool off. It&#x27;s been happening for months so it&#x27;s time to replace it with a better one.</li>
            <li> Very good dryer, but the attachments will NOT stay on.  Have had this problem with previous models of this same product, but the plastic they are now using is far too pliable.  Those of us who use this style dryer do so exclusively because of the attachments which other dryers do not offer.  Have had to superglue the brush on to use this and will see how long that lasts!</li>
            <li> The brush on this hairdryer warps, stretches out and becomes unusable after about 5-10 uses. The brush literally just falls right off.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth Conair hair dryer (exactly like this) that I&#x27;ve owned and the quality of this dryer was not the same as the others.  I use the brush attachment to dry my hair and have never had a problem until now.  The brush will not stay attached to the dryer.  During the first use I had to use duck tape on both sides to get it to stay attached and have been using it with the tape since.  Sorry Conair, but the next time I shop for a dryer, it will be a different brand.</li>
            <li> Very good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> old fashion type hair dryer which is still the best type for many people.Allows hair drying with some styling which blow drying only does not accomplish</li>
            <li> Hard to find these. They are great if you have long straight hair. Down side, the teeth of the comb attachment break after awhile. Too bad they don&#x27;t sell replacements.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Straightens her hair every morning, so only lasts about 6-8 months or so.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer - the only concern I have is that the attachment keeps falling off the unit. It gets really annoying. Other than that, it dries hair pretty quickly and keeps it straight.</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand of hairdryer for years but this one is AWFUL. I have to tape it together to keep the brush attachment from falling off.</li>
            <li> These companies have absolutely no pride in what they put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this style of hair dryer for many years.  I just bought this item a few months ago from Sears (I needed it right away), and it is my third Conair in the last 10-15 years.  My last dryer was a Vidal Sassoon with the same style.  The Vidal Sassoon lost 90% of its bristles in six months, and it started on fire with no warning after a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair has been manufacturing this same brush design and styler for many, many years.  If I were to guess, Conair has been producing this style for 30-50 years.  The body of the dryer is quite good and does an excellent job, but the attachments are pure garbage, making the product a loser.  As long as I can remember, the brushes and other attachments lose their shape and fall off the body.  One would think that after all of these years, Conair would fix this problem.  How can they not know, especially with reviews all over the internet.  The fact is, that the problem has actually grown much worse.  As I mentioned above, I just bought this thing, and the brush attachment is nearly eighth of an inch wider than the body (where it attaches), which simply means, I can no longer use the brush.  It does not even attach to the body any longer (so that it can fall off one more time).  Put in other words, it means that when one puts the brush attachment in one channel on one side of the body, the other side is nearly an eighth of an inch away from the body. A wish and a prayer, anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the executives at Conair, they must be either totally bald or exhibit a total void, you know where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I called Conair this morning (3-7-13)and told them about the problem.  I was told that after three months the brush was probably worn out.  Warn out?  It looks brand new BUT THE BRUSH NO LONGER ATTACHES TO THE BODY EVEN WHEN COLD.  Then I was told that Conair doesn&#x27;t warranty the attachments, and I could buy one from them.  NO WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have advice on reading Amazon reviews.  The most helpful negative review that Amazon shows at the top is a 3 star, so I say, let buyer beware, and be sure to read all the really negative reviews.  How do you use a hair dryer where the attachments do not attach after 2.5 months?  If the above comments are not \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; in knowing about a flaw in a product, I don&#x27;t know what is.  CONAIR does not stand behind this issue.  And if Amazon doesn&#x27;t post this review, it will be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I bolted the brush to the body using two 8/32 x 2\\&quot; bolts (electricians use this size and 6/32).  More correctly, I drilled four holes in the brush attachment, so that the bolts are, in effect, squeezing the attachment so that it is clamping itself to the body of the dryer (and cannot come out of the slots it is supposed to ride in).  I put the bolts outside of the airstream at each end of the attachment so that they don&#x27;t get hot.  I ran the dryer, and could touch the bolts just afterward.  I would have used a longer bolts with lockwashers and cut the bolts off at the nuts, but the longest bolt I had was 2\\&quot;.  After a couple of weeks, it is still holding.</li>
            <li> The only problem is very noisy</li>
            <li> I love this styler in theory.  I always hated blow drying and brushing my hair at the same time, so this is awesome to combine the two.  It also doesn&#x27;t make me sweat like crazy while blow drying like traditional blow dryers do.  My only complaint is the brush attachment won&#x27;t stay on.  In one drying session I usually have to snap it back on at least 6 times.  But, it is not enough to make me stop using it, and even knowing this I would buy it again.  The annoying brush attachment is still better than blow drying and using a separate brush.</li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer because it has the brushes with it.  So I can get more body in my hair while drying it.  The best blowdryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Nice, compact, convienient. I only use the wide comb attachment, but its nice to have options. If I ever need a new dryer I know where to go.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and somewhat curly. I break my hair up into sections to straighten, curl, blow dry, etc. My hair. I love this device but sadly everyone that says the attachments slide off is correct.</li>
            <li> This styler has been used many times since it was ordered, and hasn&#x27;t failed me at all! It is still in good condition after over a year of use, and is now being used by my family members as well! I would definitely recommend this styler to anybody in need of one.</li>
            <li> I love connair hair dryers and Stylers and have Been using them since i Was a kid. The machine is great as allwAys but the accessory falls down. It is made of bad plastic.</li>
            <li> Have had this dryer for 2 months....Started making a roaring sound and little air coming out.....Amazon says its too&lt;br /&gt;late to get an exchange or refund.  Last review I gave Amazon wouldn&#x27;t post it.</li>
            <li> This is the third on of these dryer/stylers I ordered over the years and I hope they never stop selling it, I love it as I do not like the blower types. I need to have the comb attached to the styler and this one works well. Each one I&#x27;ve had has lasted for a good number of years and has seen it&#x27;s share of abuse. The power switch seems to be the weak link and this is what failed on the previous ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it! It does a really nice job on her hair and even somewhat straightens it if she uses the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Combs never last as long as dryer</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping! The attachments doesn&#x27;t stay on the dryer; you have to hold the attachment while blow drying hair...very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. My second Ionic hair dryer. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style of dryer since I was 14 years old. I am now almost 50. In all the years of using this style of dryer, this is the absolute worst. The brush does not stay on. I&#x27;ve tried using thick fabric covered rubber bands, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. The brush simply will not stay on. Do yourself a favor and buy a different hair dryer by a different manufacturer. Conair obviously didn&#x27;t take the time to test this horrible product. No longer buying Conair.</li>
            <li> I have had hair dryers like this in the past that work beautifully.  However, this one wasn&#x27;t engineered that way.  The brush is too big for the dryer which caused it to fall off every time I tried to dry my hair.  Conair usually exceeds in products such as this one, but this time failed miserably.  Try the Conair Infinity Ion dryer.  That one works!!</li>
            <li> This was the same blow dryer model number that I have used for the past three years with satisfaction.  The difference is that now the brush falls off as soon as you have been using the dryer for a few minutes.  The plastic heats up and expands and  the brush falls off.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair brush blow dryers for years as I have long curly hair and this is the easiest way to eliminate frizz. I cannot use a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other...way too difficult with long hair.  I noticed  that the ionic technology makes hair softer</li>
            <li> Love to use the brush attachment for this dryer.  It separates wet hair and speeds the drying process.  I leave one at home and carry a second in my luggage for travel.</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer! I have purchase one like this before! I will purchase again and again and again and again!</li>
            <li> I should give this zero stars, but only because I bought this kind of blow dryer specifically for the brush attachment and the brush does not stay on at all. There is no point of having a brush attachment if it won&#x27;t stay on while you brush your hair dry. My hair is not thick or too curly, so this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but I am going to return this product as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer to replace my Vidal Sassoon 1875 Watt dryer and, boy, am I glad I did.  I&#x27;m not sure why I was hesitant to buy the less expensive Conair brand - maybe because I thought paying more meant better quality.  But this dryer proved me wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 3 months now and it&#x27;s become my &#x27;go to&#x27; hair dryer.  When I first used it I noticed that it didn&#x27;t get NEARLY as hot as my old Vidal Sassoon dryer.  The VS would get so hot that it would almost burn my scalp and I had to take several breaks just to cool down. So I didn&#x27;t really care for this one initially because it seemed less powerful.  But after a few tries I realized that it really does dry my hair quick and with less heat.  I also noticed that (by comparison to my old VS dryer) the comb attachment goes through my hair a LOT smoother and without so much tangling between the teeth.  That, too, made the drying process a lot quicker since I didn&#x27;t have to detangle my hair and unhinge the hair out of the comb attachment.  I also made for a very smooth and shiny finish to my hair.  Lastly, the Conair is also a bit more compact which makes it much easier to tuck in my travel bag and go!  So, all-in-all, I love this dryer for all the right reasons.  Conair has been around since the dawn of time and I really appreciate their prices and the performance (at least on this hair dryer).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Conair 1875 hair dryer for years and have always been pleased however, they&#x27;ve updated this model and now the brush attachment falls off. I will not be purchasing anything from Conair again. Ever.</li>
            <li> To big and too heavy. Output is great and dries hair quickly. I could do without the drying quickness for a lighter unit. My old con air that gave up the roast after 30 years was light, fit my had and I could take it on trips. I hope CONAIR reads this because if they have a lighter dryer I will go for it.</li>
            <li> Attachments come off while drying!</li>
            <li> I have been using this same Conair model hairdryer for years, it dries my medium length straight not to think hair very quickly and I always use the brush piece. I recently had to replace it (they last me about 2 years per) unfortunately the new one I received the brush piece does not stay on dryer securely at all and every time I use it falls off multiple times while I am drying my hair. It&#x27;s making me a bit crazy this time, but all previous ones I had were great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lightweight, cost was reasonable, no problems with purchase or delivery, choice of colors rather limited, overall very satisfied</li>
            <li> The dryer is great and it came very quickly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the original one I bought at least 10 years ago.  It was working fine, but the teeth in the combs started breaking and I couldn&#x27;t find any replacements.  This one is exactly like the first one I had and works wonderfully.  Hopefully it will last another 10 years!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, old school hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Works great.  Gets my hair straight.  Dries my hair quickly.  Love it.</li>
            <li> this product works very well so glad that i purchase it the price was good and fair nothing more to say</li>
            <li> I like this product, have been using it for years. On this new one however the brush keeps falling off as I&#x27;m drying my hair. Fortunately I am able to use the old brush on the new dryer, just hope it lasts. I do not use the combs at all. I am a right arm amputee so need a dryer with a brush attached.</li>
            <li> Brush did not stay on the dryer.  Comb worked well and stayed on if that&#x27;s what you use.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is a big help to straighten the hair, although it is a little bulky/inconvenient to use the attachment. But once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I like a hair dryer with a brush attachment.  I also like the brush to be very stiff.  This dryer satisfies both requirements. There are few choices except for this one.  It comes with 2 comb attachments which I never use, I only use the brush.  It is either on or off.  Would like to see a less hot setting.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with it is that the brush wont stay on while drying my hair.  the plastic brush attachment snaps into place.  It keeps slipping or popping off when drying my hair.  This make the dryer close to useless.  I will probably have to epoxy the brush to the body to keep it in place.  I would imagine its the same problem with the comb attachments as they are identical bodies.</li>
            <li> These types of hair dryers are impossible to find in any stores, most dryers found in stores are the kind that are round  and shaped like a tube which  doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ve always preferred this Conair type and shape with the comb attachment.  So glad I can buy several online and that they are still available.</li>
            <li> I  have long naturally curly hair and I have been using this hairdryer for more than 30 years! go through one every two years or so..Now I can only find them online so i buy 4 at a time...Please don&#x27;t stop making them...</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is what I expected. We had an issue with our hair dryer but amazon handle everything wonderfully. I have never had to make a exchange with amazon but this time it worked smoothly. The second one works perfect.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I could get style and volume from this device, but it didn&#x27;t do too much of anything for my hair. I have relatively straight and fine hair, so it dried my hair with no problems, but it didn&#x27;t look like I had styled my hair at all. I ended up with a weird in between straight and blow out look. If you&#x27;ve got wavy or textured hair, this could help dry and straighten it before you then style it, but for me it just did the same thing my blow dryer does.</li>
            <li> If you smooth out your hair, you must have this dryer-period. It even eliminates the need for a flat iron! I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for 15yrs! It went from black to silver ionic &amp; now there&#x27;s a black ceramic one out. It also doubled in price this yr &amp; is now at $49.99 in stores. I have long, frizzy, wavy, colicky awful hair that has to be smoothed out 1x/wk. This dryer allows me to blowout my own hair beautifully with awesome shiny flips in 15 min just by taking wet sections &amp; brushing them till dry. Without this dryer, I&#x27;m completely screwed...I keep 3 brand new back-ups on hand at all times. It&#x27;s not abnormally loud or heavy, and SO much easier than using a round brush &amp; regular dryer. Do yourself a favor, try this dryer. You&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li> as soon as my husband tried this, the brush came off. it won&#x27;t stay attached.  other brands didn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer was ordered and delivered on time.  The item was delivered in the manufacturers box with now wrapping of any kind.  The box was not sealed and smelled so heavy of cheap perfume.  I was forced to removed the box from the house.  It was delivered by a girl in her own car.  Thanks for the fast service but not the order that will linger at my front door and in my living room for a day or two.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Have used this for years. The brush doesn&#x27;t stay on always when it heats up it does get hot. Sometimes need to hold the brush while I&#x27;m drying or else it falls off. Not all the times though</li>
            <li> accurate description , thanks</li>
            <li> This dryer works really well, but the attachments won&#x27;t stay on. I&#x27;ve used a Conair dryer for a number of years without this problem. I won&#x27;t be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these hair dryers as the do not last more than a year or so.  They give lift to my short straight hair.  Only complaint is the tines on the comb do break and I order 4 or so extra from Conair to always have some available.  The price has increased considerably over the years.  The Sassoon dryer is very similar.</li>
            <li> dont buy, all the combs broke. if u pack it in a overnight bag, it will def break in half. a mess/ now im lookingto buy an andis comb dryer</li>
            <li> Useless!  Poor engineering.  Thoughtless.  A complete waste.  Attachments fall off as they expand from heat during use.  Didn&#x27;t anyone test this product before it went on the market?&lt;br /&gt;A complete outrage + I certainly would never consider another Conair product in my lifetime. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Item is very loved by my GF... Is very gentle on her hair, much better than her old one.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper according with the functions. It is worth according with the price and it is similar as the picture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a recent trip to Europe. I usually use a round brush styler/dryer, but mine is not dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews, here and elsewhere before I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;But the dryer is very heavy and the brush (not round) is huge. It may be fine for someone with long hair, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it several times, but it was just too clumsy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not bringing it at all.&lt;br /&gt;This will end up being given away.</li>
            <li> The high setting is not as powerful (heat temp) as other hair dryers I have owned and previously purchased.</li>
            <li> This a pretty good hair blower for the money I pied, and the styling brushes really work. I didn&#x27;t even have to use the hair straghtener</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the hair styler it used to be.  The plastic attachment brushes are loose and fall off with use.  The button is hard to adjust.  The brush bristles are thin and flimsy.  It works, that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! My friend let me in on her secret, she has used this dryer for years.  It helps straighten my hair so much!</li>
            <li> This dryer just isn&#x27;t hot enough, so my hair lacked post blow dry lustre. However, it is easy to grip and I had no trouble getting through my thick curly, medium to coarse, hair texture.</li>
            <li> BLOW DRIES AND STRAIGHTENS THE HAIR VERY FAST.VERY AFFORDABLE AND BEST OF ALL....IT WORKS.BLOW DRYING EFFECT LASTS FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - heat variance is great.  I enjoy using my conair styler!  I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> I searched for &amp;#34;travel hair dryer 1875&amp;#34; and this was among Amazon&#x27;s suggestions. Well, it&#x27;s not travel size and it&#x27;s extremely noisy, so definitely not what I was looking for. I think using Amazon&#x27;s search engine in misleading -or at least too inaccurate- as it brings up all kinds of products and you have to spend a lot of time reading very carefully (and the necessary information is not always there), so it&#x27;s no help. You feel like you&#x27;re being tricked into buying something different than what you are looking for -may be speculating with the possibility of you keeping that and still buying that OTHER item you were REALLY looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I know that you can return items, but since I was traveling -that&#x27;s why I needed a travel hair dryer- I did not have that chance and had to keep the big noisy hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have no idea why the word &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; is part of the description. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair any shinier...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND IT HAS A LOT OF POWER , WAS SAD WHEN MY REGULAR HAIR DRYER WENT OUT BUT THIS HAS BEEN A BLESSING</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had shoulder surgery, thinking I could style my hair using only one arm. Not so. The brush would not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; my hair unless I used a second hand to wrap it onto the brush. I ultimately had to use the double comb attachment, which was not fully satisfactory either. I had memories of my first blow dryer, which was a Conair Max, or something similr, which was a smaller form factor and which I could use just like a hairbrush, but this was definitely not it.</li>
            <li> I wish o could return this but its too late. I just oepened the box to use it and the brush just keeps popping off. Horrible.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I especially like the attachments which work well with my short hair.  I have looked for something like this but  can&#x27;t find them as easily at the retail stores.  I give it a five star!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neither impressed or dissatisfied with this blow dryer. It does help get my hair straighter faster, but I think the high setting and even the low setting blow my hair around to much  to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this dryer is absolutely AWESOME. I am an African American woman with pretty thick hair and I am going natural so it&#x27;s even worse but this dryer with the comb piece is absolutely AMAZING! The reason I say \\&quot;but\\&quot; is that every time I use it the dryer is so powerful my lights go out and I get so upset because of how straight my hair is getting and I have to switch dryers because I don&#x27;t want that to keep happening. :( Besides that though I would most definitely recommend trying the dryer I might be the only one with that issue.</li>
            <li> I got this one, because I was so happy with the same brand, etc. that I&#x27;d had for the last few years!  It is a good hair dryer and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  The brush attachment doesn&#x27;t fit as tight, and keeps coming off due to the pull of my long long hair, but if I hold my hand on the brush as I run my hair through it, it will stay most of the time.  My hair plus years of accumulated dust pretty much plugged up my first one causing it to overheat and shut off, so it really wasn&#x27;t the fault of the hair dryer itself in my opinion. It&#x27;s just not possible to clean off the elements when there are incased like that.  Next time, I think I&#x27;ll wait and buy it at a store, where I can try on the attachments to make sure they fit tight.  To much trouble to return, and my old brush attachment is pretty much worn out.</li>
            <li> Basic hairdryer.. The brushes always wear down, but I am used to that.  I wish you could order just the brushes and not the combs, since I do not even use the combs. I have to always buy a new hair dryer when the brush gets flat.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: the brush does not stay on the handle. I have to duct tape it to the handle in order to use it!</li>
            <li> I bought one for the gym and one for home - LOVE it except wish the brush would stay ON!!!!! Seriously would super glue it if I thought it would work!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! your hair straight in a couple of minutes. Use an antifrizz product, It is better that way.</li>
            <li> used every day...better than all the new-fangled types. I will buy more ...if I can.</li>
            <li> I wish it had 3 speeds.  The low speed doesn&#x27;t do anything, and the high speed blows my short hair to kingdom come!  I try to style one section, and the rest of my hair is flying everywhere.  I used to have a 3 speed, lower wattage dryer that worked fine until it died.</li>
            <li> This is my second Conair Ionic styler.  I had the first one for over a year and used it every single day.  I love it.  It conked out, the other day - I didn&#x27;t blame it, I have ALOT of hair that is thick and wavy...so It got a major work out everyday.  I immediately went right on to Amazon to search for a replacement and received it yesterday!  I am at peace.  My hairdryer is back!!!  This is the only dryer that has a brush attachment that grips my hair; smooths it out and makes it shiny.  I really love this dryer and think I may purchase another one for back up purposes.  Sender shipped extremely quickly and the price is fantastic.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t more companies make these hatchet dryers with stiff brush attachments??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is nice, has 2 heat settings and a cool shot button.  The first heat setting is kind of subtle, too...isn&#x27;t \\&quot;too much\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One critique, however.  I wish the brush attachment was even stiffer and more substantial.  Yes, make the brush even stiffer with more bristles and I would have given this product 5 stars.  Some have complained that the brush comes off easily?  Not in my experience...it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best I have found out there..and the ones at retail are a joke, brush is soft like hair...no substance at all.  Nice to know Conair actually cares about quality...it has been a very nice unit...don&#x27;t EVER discontinue it!!</li>
            <li> The bigger comb attachment doesn&#x27;t work well.  It slips out every time I comb my hair (granted I have tightly curled hair).  However, I&#x27;ve had the older version of Conair and didn&#x27;t have that issue.  Besides that, all works as expected or better....hence the 4 star:-)</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and brush is good for my curly hair, helps straighten without the frizz and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it but not happy with the fact that brush sometimes snaps off while using it.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, especially since it is one of the few with a comb attachment which I need to straighten my hair. However the comb teeth break over time from the heat. Other problem is it&#x27;s life expectancy is about 2 years if you use it every day. I&#x27;m on my fifth or sixth of the same dryer.</li>
            <li> very happy with this hair dryer.  I am not very coordinated to use the other styles.  I like this one that can be used as a brush while drying hair</li>
            <li> I love these hair dryers, but the brush keeps falling off this one. The plastic material that holds the brush on seems to be made of a softer material than was used on the previous generation of this model.    To resolve the issue I just wired it on</li>
            <li> Dryed my thick curly hair in no time with out all the frizz. My only complaint is the brush. It comes off too easy. I just hold hairdryer at the attachment point to dry my hair. Still beats any other blow dryer on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m changing my review because IT DIED!!!! It got louder and then it just died!!! Sorry to say I&#x27;m done with conair</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I have used the Conair model for many years.  I&#x27;m not sure Conair still makes them.  I purchased it on Amazon for a back-up.  I travel frequently and because of this model&#x27;s shape; I can squeeze it in my suitcase.  Plus, my hair is still very thick, and this hairdryer dries my curly hair better than most dryers.  I hope to always find this product available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly without leaving my naturally curly hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer i didn&#x27;t think it would work for my because i have fine hair but it was amazing.It gives it volume and it looks like i got it blown dried in the salon. I used to flat iron my hair and hated it because it took so long and it damaged my hair. This hair dryer is great on time i finished in 15 min my hair being soaking wet. Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and the brush attachment, when hot, becomes pliable and comes off the track.  Not the product I expected</li>
            <li> I had this same hair dryer for years and loved it.  This new model however is a little bit hotter and it feels like I could almost burn myself if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> No good it was good for 30 days</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. The comb attachments stay in place and the heat has two settings and a cooling button.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> i tried using mine twice both times it did the same thing, shut off after only 30 seconds to a minute of being on it is obviously faulty i would have returned it immediately but i had it for awhile before using it the first time, dont waste your money</li>
            <li> This is a good basic dryer.  I had one before and it lasted several years.  The main problem is that the comb attachments break pretty quickly (I have thick hair), especially the fine tooth one.  I use that comb to straighten my hair.  However, replacement combs can be purchased from Conair.  It is better than some other similar ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The brush on my dry doesn&#x27;t stay on. Had to glue it on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise a great dryer</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve gone through several of these same type of blow dryers over the years but this is my favorite. May buy another one just so I&#x27;ll have it in the future when this one dies.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer gets so hot and then it shuts itself off and a bad time.  Oh boy!&lt;br /&gt;R. Medley</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery thanks to Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair, so I am not sure how this blow dryer will work. I will edit this when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Great for doing my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I love my conair 1875 watt 3-in-1 Ionic just what I needed thanks</li>
            <li> Fantastic powerful dryer that distributes heat evenly drying hair to perfect with no flyaways. The ionic dryer allows for great movement with the replacable brush heads to create different styles</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this blow-dryer was for the brush attachment in the picture. However, this particular attachment does not fit the blow-dryer. There are 2 other attachments that fit fine, but the brush one, the only one I wanted, does not fit properly and is therefore useless. Although everything else works fine, it was very frustrating to discover this.</li>
            <li> I owned one of these before but I searched to find it because I have had every other kind of hair dryer in the past and this one is the one I love the best.  It also lasts the longest.  I have waist long hair too...It not only dries your hair but also puts additional shine to it.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  I also enjoyed the great service when purchasing it .....quick and efficient....I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the brush attachment continues to fall off of it while you are trying to use it.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it gets to hot for the plastic on the brush or what, but that is why I purchased it, because I wanted one with a brush attachment.  Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li> instead of buying replacement head from Conair for half the price of the new dryer, I just bought a new dryer.  love it.  using the same one for 15 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS DRYER FOR YEARS AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT TIL NOW.  THE BRUSH KEEPS FALLING OFF. WAKE UP CONAIR.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer because of the shape.  The end is just like you hairbrush, so drying your hair is more efficient.  This is my 2nd one.  My first one lasted about 3 years.  I was so bummed when it went out, I was happy to see that they had it for sale on Amazon.  I will buy it again next time!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair dryer. I would say it is more designed for men than women. But it works great.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and it broke after 3 weeks.  I have bought the same one many times and never had any problems before.</li>
            <li> Should have taken notice of other reviewers.  Brush attachment falls off again and again.  PLEASE CONAIR TAKE NOTICE OF CONSUMERS COMMENTS.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s design has not changed since I bought it for the first time over 15 years ago. It had the same irritating flaw: the brush kept jumping out while in use. How is it that Conair has not fixed this yet? Returned this and bought the Conair Infinit Pro. That one has a lock to prevent this problem. MUCH happier with that one.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair well but the brush attachment does not stay on while drying my hair. It continuously pops off which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful previous model for many years that died so I figured I&#x27;d go with Conair again. I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s wavy and use the brush attachment to straighten my hair. Within a few seconds the brush attachment falls off! I tried taping it on with packing tape and the heat melted that. I have to keep attaching the brush and put it on LOW setting and go very carefully...even then, the brush falls off. It takes me forever to dry my hair now. I see they make another model (ceramic, more expensive) but someone reviewed it and said the brush doesn&#x27;t fall off. I would say try that one. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this one unless you plan to use it with no attachments (in which case a regular blower would do). I am really surprised that a company like Conair would put this on the market with this obvious flaw.</li>
            <li> I love it. Different combs and gets really hot. Works perfect.</li>
            <li> whatever happened to quality control?  the brush does not stay on.  what a piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY!  BEWARE.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than a regular blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> Packaging was great, came on-time &amp; this dryer is awesome! I LOVE it. the attachments make everything easier and in my opinion faster.</li>
