            <li>This shampoo cleaned my hair and smelled kinda good...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo, it lathers nicely, and it smells good, but it&#x27;s no miracle product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very smooth after using this!</li>
            <li>I wish this worked because I usually love this brand and the concept sounds great, but</li>
            <li>yes, the shampoo and conditioner are good on their own.  </li>
            <li>That conditioner was a worthwhile investment!  </li>
            <li>I love reading!</li>
            <li>Would I spend my own money on this.</li>
            <li>I liked the way this shampoo lathers up and feels on my hair while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>I suppose the makers think that it smells nice</li>
            <li>In addition to smoothing and gentling one&#x27;s hair, it also has a very pleasant aroma and it leaves your hair a whole lot cleaner.  </li>

            <li>Liked the packaging, product is easy to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked the packaging, product is easy to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy again, but glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>love Keratin.  </li>
            <li>You will be glad that you did.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t understand -- it seemed you should be able to wash your hair and it should work for 7 days</li>
            <li>If you have really frizzy hair this might work great for you.</li>
            <li>I bought the conditioner, too, and it&#x27;s even better with conditioner.</li>
            <li>The surprise was my hair did straighten better.  </li>
            <li>My flyaways and frizz were much better controlled and stayed that way for the week.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Well, I love all Tresemme products, it seems.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>would buy this for sure.</li>
            <li>love these hair products for when I&#x27;m using my curling or straightening iron and even recommended them to family members.</li>
            <li>I have used the conditioner and leave in treatment in this hair care line and love both.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t look a lot smoother, in fact it was a bit more frizzy</li>
            <li>But as a total hair-care solution, I have been very impressed with Tresemme&#x27;s 7-day keratin system of products and will use them when I want a smoother look.</li>
            <li>I love the feel after I used it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo helps my hair return to its more luxurious self.</li>
            <li>Too many shampoos are overloaded with fragrance; this has just a touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ingredient of most concern may be DMDM Hydantoin, an antimicrobial formaldehyde-releaser preservative.</li>
            <li>That ended up being a disaster, the Conditioner left my hair incredibly frizzy, even more frizzy than no conditioner at all...</li>
            <li>As much as I love the shampoo, I knew that in order to enjoy maximum benefits, it was time to get the conditioner to work with it.  </li>
            <li>I switched to another shampoo just to check out the results and noticed my hair was not as easily straightened.    </li>
            <li>This is a smooth-feeling shampoo that does not have a strong odor, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a good shampoo, it got my hair clean and it certainly did not exacerbate any frizziness.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, but the shampoo is creamy and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li>Help is here in the form of Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, conditioned, and didn&#x27;t get frizzy as easily.</li>
            <li>great product.. especially for my european/caribbean sun beaten...</li>
            <li>This shampoo promises to smooth out frizz and to keep hair smoother, even after three shampoos.  </li>
            <li>7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, 9 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00GYB1E5O Tresemme 7 Day</li>
            <li>Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment, 3 Ounce]].</li>
            <li>After styling, my hair was smooth and shiny which is quite a feat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why oh why do these products have to be loaded with cheap scent?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Instead she found that it made her hair more manageable, made it look and feel fuller, and gave her hair more vibrant color and body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty cheap shampoo/conditioner, so I decided to buy a bottle of the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner and see if these two worked better as a system.  </li>
            <li>The underneath of my hair is bleached blond and tends to get frizzy, so I was excited to give this smoothing shampoo a try.  </li>
            <li>But the triumvirate, though much more work, really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It seems to get my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo got my hair clean</li>
            <li>I was excited to test this specially formulated shampoo as well.  </li>
            <li>This product did make my hair shiny and smooth but it also made me lose more than normal during brushing.  </li>
            <li>Without flatironing the whole thing or curling the top layers, I look like I got 1/2 way through styling it and gave up somehow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, which I co-wash most of the time.</li>
            <li>This has a nice, soft scent and even my boyfriend uses it and likes it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and I did notice my hair did not revert as much in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can dry my hair on medium and have great success--</li>
            <li>I may get different results if paired with the conditioner, but I have a huge bottle of Tresemme Naturals conditioner, which I like and that seems to pair nicely with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This actually worked pretty well, my hair was nice and smooth and</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li>I received the shampoo and conditioner before the thermal treatment and used them a few times to great success.</li>
            <li>When I started using this shampoo I was using this with the Organix Argan Oil Conditioner and didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Now this flat iron is so good her hair stays straight for days until she washes it.</li>
            <li>Right now I am using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Then I applied again and back to nice straight</li>
            <li>So with that in mind, and my great success with Tresemme products in the past, I was really looking forward to trying this 7 day stuff</li>
            <li>very nice smell, enough for several months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li>So I tried it again with the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo, followed by the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Condition and then blow-drying and straightening with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>so I want to use up the L&#x27;Oreal heat spray first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t condition every day - more like every 3rd day.</li>
            <li>Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, and Shampoo leave my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I would never go seven days without washing my hair</li>
            <li>I have been using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner for years but recently fell out of love with them.  </li>
            <li>and that works pretty well for</li>
            <li>I know companies like us using every product in a specific line because they formulated it to work together, but the product should be able to stand alone--</li>
            <li>What it does do well is keep your hair looking good for a few days, even if you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo every day.</li>
            <li>However, my hair was much easier to smooth while styling, and that is no small thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I liked the smoothing effect, the other aspects I could have done without.</li>
            <li>I needed to use a volumizing mousse but other than that I liked this shampoo and would recommend it for those who often straighten their hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Does not fade coloured hair as much as shampoos with higher sulfate</li>
            <li>Average shampoo, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair that I must wash daily, however while the bottom layers are straight, my top layer is wavy and gets very fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says that it is a 7 day formula, but the longer I used it the more it seemed to dry out the ends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keratin is a magic word for people with ultra dry hair like mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regular Tresemme shampoo and conditioner does a LOT more for my hair than this line, my hair was as dry and unmanageable as it is if I use the stuff from the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li>(I find that a matter of taste for people), the feel was good going on - and a relatively small amount lathered up very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a shampoo that will straighten your curly hair, then  look no further as Tresemme&#x27;s 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo will do that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the product description very well</li>
            <li>My hair still looks much smoother.</li>
            <li>My daughter however, has funky, wavy, frizzy prone, poofy hair that neither keeps it curl or goes straight.</li>
            <li>So I used the whole system on her hair, the shampoo, the conditioner and the thermal activated serum.</li>
            <li>After using the system my daughter&#x27;s hair was straight.</li>
            <li>Gentle on scalp.</li>
            <li>While this may be because I have to get used to the lower-lather of low-sulfate shampoos, it is still something to consider depending on your lifestyle as it impacts how much of this product you would use and how much it will cost over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this and the way my hair feels after using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the shipping of this leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Very unnerving.</li>
            <li>A shampoo that really helps with aging hair.</li>
            <li>I found that it left my hair fairly smooth, although a bit of conditioner on the ends was needed to leave my hair looking right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, it seems like any shampoo begins to lose its effectiveness (or become harsh)</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I do have other shampoos I prefer more.</li>
            <li>My hair was left feeling clean, yet I had that sinking feeling</li>
            <li>I honestly saw no difference in my hair after using this product vs. my usual</li>
            <li>While sulfate damage is still there, it is not as damaging as high sulfate</li>
            <li>I went back again to a simple shampoo and no excessive hair loss, better control and shine.</li>
            <li>and I must say this lathers well and has a nice smell, not overpowering in the least.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a keratin shampoo from the salon where I get my hair done.  </li>
            <li>Having had good results using the other two items, I was very curious how my hair would react when using all three as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does not dry hair and scalp as much as higher sulfate</li>
            <li>I like Tresemme products so was intrigued to try this new formula.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice but it doesn&#x27;t knock you down and drag you through the much.</li>
            <li>As you suspect it is more expensive than Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if the Tresemme trio would give better results</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair smooth and shiny but not weighed down</li>
            <li>(Kirkland Signature Professional Salon Formula Moisture Shampoo).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet purchased the conditioner and treatment that will complete the package, so this review is somewhat incomplete.  </li>
            <li>Tresemme promises and delivers frizz free hair in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t have to) and secondly I wondered how straight my hair would be after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After using it one week on, one week off and comparing it to Pantene, this shampoo does seem to leave my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I used it on my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I even slept with my hair still damp and woke up to incredibly soft, non frizzy, waves.</li>
            <li>When it comes to marketing hair products, &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; is used as a Symbol of Instant Results almost as much as argan oil is.</li>
            <li>That may or may not matter to you, depending on your philosophy and how sensitive your body is.</li>
            <li>Then I used a very high end flat iron, as directed, to straighten her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced by the miracle claims of helping to keep flat ironed hair straight through three shampoos.  </li>
            <li>But on the first wash it was as if we simply used regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>The Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth products might be good for when I&#x27;m going to style my hair, but it leaves my hair limp if I don&#x27;t style it - like the hair is waiting for something, hard to describe, just heavy and limp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, this was a tiny quantity of shampoo at a high price.</li>
            <li>so it still does lather although not as much as high sulfate brands such as Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>This Tresemme Keratin smooth shampoo is my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li>Lathered up great, was afraid with lower sulfur in it that it would be hard to lather &amp; clean hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have reviewed other products with higher concerns and this one seems relatively benign, it is far from being a natural product.</li>
            <li>However, I found that after a week&#x27;s use it left my curly hair greasy and limp, meaning I had to wash it every day to make it look clean.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat sensitive and I have not had any obvious reaction to the chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li>Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth shampoo leaves our hair thick and &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34; Our hair is shinier than before use, but it also feels drier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like this shampoo enough to consider switching to it for regular daily shampoo and keep my high sulfate Pantene for a day at the gym.</li>
            <li>For regular daily use, a single shampoo is enough, but on hot humid sweaty days or after a session a the gym, I needed to shampoo my hair twice.  </li>
            <li>It has made my hair slightly more noticeably smoother, although I live in such a dry climate that&#x27;s its hard to completely get away from the little frizzy summer hair.  </li>
            <li>It breaks easily and I try not to style it, as to try to save it from any unnecessary damage.</li>
            <li>Overall, as a regular shampoo, this shampoo has less lather than my other shampoo (Pantene) but otherwise seems to clean my hair well enough without overly tripping oils from it.  </li>
            <li>That is a little too much fussing for me.  </li>
            <li>and my hair was fine, then tried this set again and the same thing, dull frizzy hair and clumps of it coming out when I combed it wet.</li>
            <li>I have learned that I have to keep realistic expectations about what any product will do for my hair - and this performed above average for me.  </li>

            <li> but it didn&#x27;t look a lot smoother, in fact it was a bit more frizzy</li>
            <li> But as a total hair-care solution, I have been very impressed with Tresemme&#x27;s 7-day keratin system of products and will use them when I want a smoother look.</li>
            <li> I love the feel after I used it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps my hair return to its more luxurious self.</li>
            <li> Too many shampoos are overloaded with fragrance; this has just a touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ingredient of most concern may be DMDM Hydantoin, an antimicrobial formaldehyde-releaser preservative.</li>
            <li> That ended up being a disaster, the Conditioner left my hair incredibly frizzy, even more frizzy than no conditioner at all...</li>
            <li> As much as I love the shampoo, I knew that in order to enjoy maximum benefits, it was time to get the conditioner to work with it.  </li>
            <li> I switched to another shampoo just to check out the results and noticed my hair was not as easily straightened.    </li>
            <li> This is a smooth-feeling shampoo that does not have a strong odor, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a good shampoo, it got my hair clean and it certainly did not exacerbate any frizziness.  </li>
            <li> fragrance is fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, but the shampoo is creamy and lathers up well.  </li>
            <li> Help is here in the form of Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean, conditioned, and didn&#x27;t get frizzy as easily.</li>
            <li> great product.. especially for my european/caribbean sun beaten...</li>
            <li> This shampoo promises to smooth out frizz and to keep hair smoother, even after three shampoos.  </li>
            <li> 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, 9 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00GYB1E5O Tresemme 7 Day</li>
            <li> Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment, 3 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> After styling, my hair was smooth and shiny which is quite a feat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why oh why do these products have to be loaded with cheap scent?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Instead she found that it made her hair more manageable, made it look and feel fuller, and gave her hair more vibrant color and body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pretty cheap shampoo/conditioner, so I decided to buy a bottle of the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner and see if these two worked better as a system.  </li>
            <li> The underneath of my hair is bleached blond and tends to get frizzy, so I was excited to give this smoothing shampoo a try.  </li>
            <li> But the triumvirate, though much more work, really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It seems to get my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo got my hair clean</li>
            <li> I was excited to test this specially formulated shampoo as well.  </li>
            <li> This product did make my hair shiny and smooth but it also made me lose more than normal during brushing.  </li>
            <li> Without flatironing the whole thing or curling the top layers, I look like I got 1/2 way through styling it and gave up somehow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I co-wash most of the time.</li>
            <li> This has a nice, soft scent and even my boyfriend uses it and likes it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and I did notice my hair did not revert as much in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair on medium and have great success--</li>
            <li> I may get different results if paired with the conditioner, but I have a huge bottle of Tresemme Naturals conditioner, which I like and that seems to pair nicely with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This actually worked pretty well, my hair was nice and smooth and</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner before the thermal treatment and used them a few times to great success.</li>
            <li> When I started using this shampoo I was using this with the Organix Argan Oil Conditioner and didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Now this flat iron is so good her hair stays straight for days until she washes it.</li>
            <li> Right now I am using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Then I applied again and back to nice straight</li>
            <li> So with that in mind, and my great success with Tresemme products in the past, I was really looking forward to trying this 7 day stuff</li>
            <li> very nice smell, enough for several months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> So I tried it again with the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo, followed by the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Condition and then blow-drying and straightening with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> so I want to use up the L&#x27;Oreal heat spray first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t condition every day - more like every 3rd day.</li>
            <li> Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, and Shampoo leave my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I would never go seven days without washing my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner for years but recently fell out of love with them.  </li>
            <li> and that works pretty well for</li>
            <li> I know companies like us using every product in a specific line because they formulated it to work together, but the product should be able to stand alone--</li>
            <li> What it does do well is keep your hair looking good for a few days, even if you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo every day.</li>
            <li> However, my hair was much easier to smooth while styling, and that is no small thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I liked the smoothing effect, the other aspects I could have done without.</li>
            <li> I needed to use a volumizing mousse but other than that I liked this shampoo and would recommend it for those who often straighten their hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Does not fade coloured hair as much as shampoos with higher sulfate</li>
            <li> Average shampoo, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair that I must wash daily, however while the bottom layers are straight, my top layer is wavy and gets very fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says that it is a 7 day formula, but the longer I used it the more it seemed to dry out the ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keratin is a magic word for people with ultra dry hair like mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular Tresemme shampoo and conditioner does a LOT more for my hair than this line, my hair was as dry and unmanageable as it is if I use the stuff from the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> (I find that a matter of taste for people), the feel was good going on - and a relatively small amount lathered up very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo that will straighten your curly hair, then  look no further as Tresemme&#x27;s 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo will do that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the product description very well</li>
            <li> My hair still looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> My daughter however, has funky, wavy, frizzy prone, poofy hair that neither keeps it curl or goes straight.</li>
            <li> So I used the whole system on her hair, the shampoo, the conditioner and the thermal activated serum.</li>
            <li> After using the system my daughter&#x27;s hair was straight.</li>
            <li> Gentle on scalp.</li>
            <li> While this may be because I have to get used to the lower-lather of low-sulfate shampoos, it is still something to consider depending on your lifestyle as it impacts how much of this product you would use and how much it will cost over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this and the way my hair feels after using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the shipping of this leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Very unnerving.</li>
            <li> A shampoo that really helps with aging hair.</li>
            <li> I found that it left my hair fairly smooth, although a bit of conditioner on the ends was needed to leave my hair looking right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, it seems like any shampoo begins to lose its effectiveness (or become harsh)</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I do have other shampoos I prefer more.</li>
            <li> My hair was left feeling clean, yet I had that sinking feeling</li>
            <li> I honestly saw no difference in my hair after using this product vs. my usual</li>
            <li> While sulfate damage is still there, it is not as damaging as high sulfate</li>
            <li> I went back again to a simple shampoo and no excessive hair loss, better control and shine.</li>
            <li> and I must say this lathers well and has a nice smell, not overpowering in the least.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a keratin shampoo from the salon where I get my hair done.  </li>
            <li> Having had good results using the other two items, I was very curious how my hair would react when using all three as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does not dry hair and scalp as much as higher sulfate</li>
            <li> I like Tresemme products so was intrigued to try this new formula.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice but it doesn&#x27;t knock you down and drag you through the much.</li>
            <li> As you suspect it is more expensive than Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the Tresemme trio would give better results</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair smooth and shiny but not weighed down</li>
            <li> (Kirkland Signature Professional Salon Formula Moisture Shampoo).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet purchased the conditioner and treatment that will complete the package, so this review is somewhat incomplete.  </li>
            <li> Tresemme promises and delivers frizz free hair in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t have to) and secondly I wondered how straight my hair would be after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After using it one week on, one week off and comparing it to Pantene, this shampoo does seem to leave my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I used it on my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I even slept with my hair still damp and woke up to incredibly soft, non frizzy, waves.</li>
            <li> When it comes to marketing hair products, &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; is used as a Symbol of Instant Results almost as much as argan oil is.</li>
            <li> That may or may not matter to you, depending on your philosophy and how sensitive your body is.</li>
            <li> Then I used a very high end flat iron, as directed, to straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced by the miracle claims of helping to keep flat ironed hair straight through three shampoos.  </li>
            <li> But on the first wash it was as if we simply used regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth products might be good for when I&#x27;m going to style my hair, but it leaves my hair limp if I don&#x27;t style it - like the hair is waiting for something, hard to describe, just heavy and limp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, this was a tiny quantity of shampoo at a high price.</li>
            <li> so it still does lather although not as much as high sulfate brands such as Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> This Tresemme Keratin smooth shampoo is my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> Lathered up great, was afraid with lower sulfur in it that it would be hard to lather &amp; clean hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have reviewed other products with higher concerns and this one seems relatively benign, it is far from being a natural product.</li>
            <li> However, I found that after a week&#x27;s use it left my curly hair greasy and limp, meaning I had to wash it every day to make it look clean.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat sensitive and I have not had any obvious reaction to the chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li> Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth shampoo leaves our hair thick and &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34; Our hair is shinier than before use, but it also feels drier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like this shampoo enough to consider switching to it for regular daily shampoo and keep my high sulfate Pantene for a day at the gym.</li>
            <li> For regular daily use, a single shampoo is enough, but on hot humid sweaty days or after a session a the gym, I needed to shampoo my hair twice.  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair slightly more noticeably smoother, although I live in such a dry climate that&#x27;s its hard to completely get away from the little frizzy summer hair.  </li>
            <li> It breaks easily and I try not to style it, as to try to save it from any unnecessary damage.</li>
            <li> Overall, as a regular shampoo, this shampoo has less lather than my other shampoo (Pantene) but otherwise seems to clean my hair well enough without overly tripping oils from it.  </li>
            <li> That is a little too much fussing for me.  </li>
            <li> and my hair was fine, then tried this set again and the same thing, dull frizzy hair and clumps of it coming out when I combed it wet.</li>
            <li> I have learned that I have to keep realistic expectations about what any product will do for my hair - and this performed above average for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually have a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My curls are not uniform, and it makes me crazy (the top of my head sprouts straight hair, but the lower you get down my neckline, the curlier it gets--my lowermost hair being downright spiral).  </li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, fragile, processed, red hair...</li>
            <li> I rarely blow dry or straighten my hair, I usually let it air dry</li>
            <li> I have some wicked frizzy curly hair and this help in the flat ironing process.</li>
            <li> It also helps in between flat irons to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t realize that this was part of a system that you use to straighten your hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is supposed to be activated by heat, they recommend using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about using this conditioner because it says it works with your flat iron</li>
            <li> This did an average job on my hair after the first few washings.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have time to follow that blow dry, flat iron straightening regimen every day for a couple weeks...</li>
            <li> I used to think that was an extra pain to opening the tube, but when I got this I suddenly saw the advantage to a little extra wrapping on the tube.  </li>
            <li> When I used another shampoo the next few times and came back to this one I was happier with the outcome (not such dry, brittle ends).</li>
            <li> (I tried the shampoo and conditioner at the same time, so there will be a little bit of cross pollinating for each review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have left my hair heavy and broken, and took weeks to months to get back to it&#x27;s normal split-personality</li>
            <li> and it did not really soften my hair.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I wound up using the Tresemme every OTHER day just to lose the greasy effect.</li>
            <li> This product gets one star docked because the instructions on the bottle tell you to use the conditioner too, then put on some other stuff before blow drying and ironing your hair.  </li>
            <li> other products I have purchased online that come in a tube like this have been shrink wrapped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this would last though washings or not.</li>
            <li> but if you have allergies or other sensitivities all you get is some discomfort when you use the product.  </li>
            <li> a side note, my first sample of this product was packaged very poorly and had squirted all over the cardboard box</li>
            <li> I always need to use conditioner after this or any other shampoo because we have such brutally hard water.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, as a result of low sulfate content, does not lather as much in hard water conditions&lt;</li>
            <li> This was just your average drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was an average shampoo that I wouldn&#x27;t bother to buy when it runs out.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how this product would affect the health of your hair long term.  </li>
            <li> but it seemed to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It does not weight down my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is an odd combination of characteristics.  </li>
            <li> The curls have piped down and now with this shampoo, my Nexus conditioner, and a little serum</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo alone for a few days and it did well at keeping the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> Tresemme products do leave your hair feeling heavy, but I think that&#x27;s the added volume.</li>
            <li> Says to use for 7 days, will post after I have tried for a few days.</li>
            <li> I think I lost at least 1/3 of the shampoo with that little debacle.</li>
            <li> there is no overwhelming smells.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to stop frizzies, but unfortunately I did not pay attention to then need to use a flat iron for it to work.</li>
            <li> In the past few years my hair has changed from thick and glossy to thin and brittle.</li>
            <li> I found out too late that some people&#x27;s hair cannot withstand Keratin.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, frizzy hair about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> When using it the conditioner was thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> the past, I have tried the various keratin products, and had disastrous results.  </li>
            <li> She took my shampoo, but since it is much less expensive than the saloon sold product I saved money.</li>
            <li> She was shocked and wowed at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; that it was shipped in was one of those thin, cardboard wrap boxes that Amazon often uses for books.  </li>
            <li> I bought the set attracted by the promise of smoother hair, but not only was my hair not smoother, but the colour was dull, it was frizzy and worst of all</li>
            <li> I have oily hair - which is weird</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Keratin.</li>
            <li> I admit I was a bit skeptical about the claims of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Must use with matching conditioner and heat to get smoothing effect.product was packaged very poorly and had squirted all over the cardboard box</li>
            <li> We all know how bad it feels to have one&#x27;s hair looking like ass and feeling even worse.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is a disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li> We all know what it is to have a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> I hate to throw things away, but this has got to go.</li>
            <li> Once I received it and read the label I was very disappointed to learn</li>
            <li> this contains sulfates the evil enemy of Keratin</li>
            <li> When forgetting to bring her shampoo that her hair-dresser recommended and sold, my spouse used this Tresemme shampoo and feared for the worst.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I honestly saw no difference in my hair after using this product vs. my usual (Kirkland Signature Professional Salon Formula Moisture Shampoo). To me, this was a tiny quantity of shampoo at a high price. Won&#x27;t buy again, but glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could try the 7 day keratin treatment, which did NOT work. This was just your average drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li> Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth shampoo leaves our hair thick and &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34; Our hair is shinier than before use, but it also feels drier. I was looking for something to stop frizzies, but unfortunately I did not pay attention to then need to use a flat iron for it to work. My husband won&#x27;t use one on his shoulder length curly hair, and mine is too short, so I can&#x27;t review that part of the claim.</li>
            <li> We all know what it is to have a bad hair day.  We all know how bad it feels to have one&#x27;s hair looking like ass and feeling even worse.  Help is here in the form of Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Keratin.  As much as I love the shampoo, I knew that in order to enjoy maximum benefits, it was time to get the conditioner to work with it.  That conditioner was a worthwhile investment!  In addition to smoothing and gentling one&#x27;s hair, it also has a very pleasant aroma and it leaves your hair a whole lot cleaner.  Again, I suggest that you get the conditioner that goes along with the shampoo.  You will be glad that you did.</li>
            <li> When I review a product I ask myself, would I buy it again? Would I spend my own money on this. With this shampoo I used it along with the conditioner. It was okay. Maybe it is because I have fine straight hair but it seemed to weigh my hair down. And I don&#x27;t understand -- it seemed you should be able to wash your hair and it should work for 7 days but the directions is that you need to wash your hair every day -- why bother with the 7 day smoothing stuff? If you have really frizzy hair this might work great for you.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo that will straighten your curly hair, then  look no further as Tresemme&#x27;s 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo will do that. However, I found that after a week&#x27;s use it left my curly hair greasy and limp, meaning I had to wash it every day to make it look clean. In the end, I wound up using the Tresemme every OTHER day just to lose the greasy effect. While I liked the smoothing effect, the other aspects I could have done without. Average shampoo, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, fragile, processed, red hair...It breaks easily and I try not to style it, as to try to save it from any unnecessary damage. My curls are not uniform, and it makes me crazy (the top of my head sprouts straight hair, but the lower you get down my neckline, the curlier it gets--my lowermost hair being downright spiral).  Without flatironing the whole thing or curling the top layers, I look like I got 1/2 way through styling it and gave up somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product, my hair has gained uniformity.  The curls have piped down and now with this shampoo, my Nexus conditioner, and a little serum I can dry my hair on medium and have great success--I don&#x27;t need to flatiron nor do I need to curl to look &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have tried the various keratin products, and had disastrous results.  They have left my hair heavy and broken, and took weeks to months to get back to it&#x27;s normal split-personality self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives my hair a beautiful texture and shine.  I am a big fan and will buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I have some wicked frizzy curly hair and this help in the flat ironing process. It also helps in between flat irons to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet purchased the conditioner and treatment that will complete the package, so this review is somewhat incomplete.  The shampoo leaves my hair smooth and shiny but not weighed down and it smells terrific.  I&#x27;m still using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost It Blow Out Heat Spray as my treatment product after shampooing and the combined results with the Tresemme shampoo are terrific.  Not sure if the Tresemme trio would give better results but I like the Tresemme shampoo enough to try the conditioner and treatment.  I&#x27;m thrifty so I want to use up the L&#x27;Oreal heat spray first.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the product description very well so I didn&#x27;t realize that this was part of a system that you use to straighten your hair with a flat iron. I don&#x27;t actually have a flat iron. I was looking for something that will help keep the frizz under control in the humid Florida summers. We&#x27;re already into summer here, even though it&#x27;s only May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. I used the shampoo alone for a few days and it did well at keeping the frizz at bay. I bought the conditioner, too, and it&#x27;s even better with conditioner. I have oily hair - which is weird given how frizzy it gets in the humidity -so I don&#x27;t condition every day - more like every 3rd day. My hair still looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> Tresemme promises and delivers frizz free hair in just a few days.  This product gets one star docked because the instructions on the bottle tell you to use the conditioner too, then put on some other stuff before blow drying and ironing your hair.  That is a little too much fussing for me.  Before I do all of that, I will go back to shaving my head.  What it does do well is keep your hair looking good for a few days, even if you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo every day.</li>
            <li> I have used allot of Tresemme products they are salon quality products at a affordable price. Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, and Shampoo leave my hair soft and manageable. It does not weight down my hair there is no overwhelming smells. I color and process my hair allot so I need things to condition and strengthening my stressed hair. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Keratin.</li>
            <li> I admit I was a bit skeptical about the claims of this shampoo.  Firstly, I would never go seven days without washing my hair (you don&#x27;t have to) and secondly I wondered how straight my hair would be after using this shampoo.  I shampoo my hair about 5 times a week and I must say this lathers well and has a nice smell, not overpowering in the least.  The surprise was my hair did straighten better.  I switched to another shampoo just to check out the results and noticed my hair was not as easily straightened.    The drawback to this shampoo is that it does not give great volume and it did not really soften my hair.  I needed to use a volumizing mousse but other than that I liked this shampoo and would recommend it for those who often straighten their hair.</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner before the thermal treatment and used them a few times to great success. My hair felt clean, conditioned, and didn&#x27;t get frizzy as easily. But when used with the thermal treatment (you put it into your hair and then flatiron to &#x27;seal&#x27; it in), I noticed quite an improvement.  My flyaways and frizz were much better controlled and stayed that way for the week.  Then I applied again and back to nice straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, the shampoo and conditioner are good on their own.  But the triumvirate, though much more work, really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This Tresemme Keratin smooth shampoo is my usual shampoo. I found it convenient to purchase online Absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I co-wash most of the time. My daughter however, has funky, wavy, frizzy prone, poofy hair that neither keeps it curl or goes straight. It drives me nuts. So I used the whole system on her hair, the shampoo, the conditioner and the thermal activated serum. Then I used a very high end flat iron, as directed, to straighten her hair. Now this flat iron is so good her hair stays straight for days until she washes it. Then we have Cousin It hair again. After using the system my daughter&#x27;s hair was straight. And it smelled really good. But on the first wash it was as if we simply used regular shampoo. Oh well. Next try will be a Brazilian blow out. Same steps, but lasting results.</li>
            <li> great product.. especially for my european/caribbean sun beaten...salt water...damaged hair lol</li>
            <li> Overall, as a regular shampoo, this shampoo has less lather than my other shampoo (Pantene) but otherwise seems to clean my hair well enough without overly tripping oils from it.  The scent is a medium fruity-floral.  After using it one week on, one week off and comparing it to Pantene, this shampoo does seem to leave my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this shampoo also advertises itself as a low-sulfate shampoo.  This means:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Does not dry hair and scalp as much as higher sulfate shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;+ Gentle on scalp. Scalp does not itch after washing&lt;br /&gt;+ Does not fade coloured hair as much as shampoos with higher sulfate content.&lt;br /&gt;+ Does not corrode nor damage hair folicles&lt;br /&gt;+ This shampoo is low-sulfate not no-sulfate so it still does lather although not as much as high sulfate brands such as Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;+ While sulfate damage is still there, it is not as damaging as high sulfate brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This shampoo does contain sulfates (even at lower amounts).&lt;br /&gt;- This shampoo, as a result of low sulfate content, does not lather as much in hard water conditions&lt;br /&gt;- A second shampoo may be needed to fully wash hair because of low lather. For regular daily use, a single shampoo is enough, but on hot humid sweaty days or after a session a the gym, I needed to shampoo my hair twice.  While this may be because I have to get used to the lower-lather of low-sulfate shampoos, it is still something to consider depending on your lifestyle as it impacts how much of this product you would use and how much it will cost over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this shampoo enough to consider switching to it for regular daily shampoo and keep my high sulfate Pantene for a day at the gym.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Well, I love all Tresemme products, it seems. People really notice when I use Tresemme products, as it really adds volume to my thin (albeit permed) hair. Tresemme products do leave your hair feeling heavy, but I think that&#x27;s the added volume. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great , it smells SO GOOD !! and leaves my hair smooth , straight and with a great smell !</li>
            <li> This is awesome. The smell is nice but it doesn&#x27;t knock you down and drag you through the much. It clarify&#x27;s the hair but does not strip it. Overall? I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have learned that I have to keep realistic expectations about what any product will do for my hair - and this performed above average for me.  My hair is an odd combination of characteristics.  I have oily hair that I must wash daily, however while the bottom layers are straight, my top layer is wavy and gets very fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did quite a good job taming that frizz, though it didn&#x27;t fully get rid of it.  However, my hair was much easier to smooth while styling, and that is no small thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is fine (I find that a matter of taste for people), the feel was good going on - and a relatively small amount lathered up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner for years but recently fell out of love with them.  I liked the way this shampoo lathers up and feels on my hair while I&#x27;m using it.  I really like the smell of this and the way my hair feels after using it</li>
            <li> I like Tresemme products so was intrigued to try this new formula.  It has made my hair slightly more noticeably smoother, although I live in such a dry climate that&#x27;s its hard to completely get away from the little frizzy summer hair.  This has a nice, soft scent and even my boyfriend uses it and likes it.  I may get different results if paired with the conditioner, but I have a huge bottle of Tresemme Naturals conditioner, which I like and that seems to pair nicely with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shipping of this leaves much to be desired.  other products I have purchased online that come in a tube like this have been shrink wrapped.  I used to think that was an extra pain to opening the tube, but when I got this I suddenly saw the advantage to a little extra wrapping on the tube.  The &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; that it was shipped in was one of those thin, cardboard wrap boxes that Amazon often uses for books.  It didn&#x27;t work out too well with the US Postal Service for this item. the box got squished, the shampoo leaked out, and the postal service had it wrapped in a plastic bag when it arrived.  I think I lost at least 1/3 of the shampoo with that little debacle.</li>
            <li> This did an average job on my hair after the first few washings. It says that it is a 7 day formula, but the longer I used it the more it seemed to dry out the ends. Honestly, it seems like any shampoo begins to lose its effectiveness (or become harsh) after a week or so. When I used another shampoo the next few times and came back to this one I was happier with the outcome (not such dry, brittle ends). I always need to use conditioner after this or any other shampoo because we have such brutally hard water. This was an average shampoo that I wouldn&#x27;t bother to buy when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo promises to smooth out frizz and to keep hair smoother, even after three shampoos.  I found it to be a good shampoo, it got my hair clean and it certainly did not exacerbate any frizziness.  I&#x27;m not convinced by the miracle claims of helping to keep flat ironed hair straight through three shampoos.  It&#x27;s a good shampoo, it lathers nicely, and it smells good, but it&#x27;s no miracle product.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner with the [[ASIN:B00GYB1ECW Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, 9 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00GYB1E5O Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment, 3 Ounce]]. As a trio, they work well together. I have thick, curly, frizzy hair about shoulder length. I tried this with both my straightening iron and curling iron. It worked well with both styles. After styling, my hair was smooth and shiny which is quite a feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this would last though washings or not. I like the products so I&#x27;ve been using them whenever I decide to style my hair. If I have a day where I&#x27;m not going to style, I use one of my moisturizing shampoos. The Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth products might be good for when I&#x27;m going to style my hair, but it leaves my hair limp if I don&#x27;t style it - like the hair is waiting for something, hard to describe, just heavy and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these hair products for when I&#x27;m using my curling or straightening iron and even recommended them to family members.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a disappointment for me.  I have used the conditioner and leave in treatment in this hair care line and love both.  I was excited to test this specially formulated shampoo as well.  Once I received it and read the label I was very disappointed to learn this contains sulfates the evil enemy of Keratin users.&lt;br /&gt;This suds up nicely and smells great.  My hair was left feeling clean, yet I had that sinking feeling I was damaging my hair.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the conditioner and leave in treatment, but I&#x27;m sticking with no sulfate, no suds shampoos.</li>
            <li> Will never change.  Love it</li>
            <li> I bought the set attracted by the promise of smoother hair, but not only was my hair not smoother, but the colour was dull, it was frizzy and worst of all I lost clumps of hair after washing! I went back to another shampoo I had in the house and my hair was fine, then tried this set again and the same thing, dull frizzy hair and clumps of it coming out when I combed it wet. Very unnerving. I went back again to a simple shampoo and no excessive hair loss, better control and shine. I hate to throw things away, but this has got to go.</li>
            <li> I found out too late that some people&#x27;s hair cannot withstand Keratin.  This product did make my hair shiny and smooth but it also made me lose more than normal during brushing.  Use cautiously... product works but some people have a reaction to Keratin.  Google it to understand why.</li>
            <li> I normally use a keratin shampoo from the salon where I get my hair done.  As you suspect it is more expensive than Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth.  I would not say that this shampoo delivers a keratin treatment.  I would say that if you have had an express keratin treatment this shampoo would probably be a good choice.  It did not disappoint me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was a hit by accident.  When forgetting to bring her shampoo that her hair-dresser recommended and sold, my spouse used this Tresemme shampoo and feared for the worst.  Instead she found that it made her hair more manageable, made it look and feel fuller, and gave her hair more vibrant color and body.  She was shocked and wowed at the same time.  Believe me she would have NEVER let any shampoo touch her hair besides her hair-dresser&#x27;s product so this was quite a statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be a win-lose.  She took my shampoo, but since it is much less expensive than the saloon sold product I saved money.</li>
            <li> My hair is very smooth after using this! very nice smell, enough for several months&#x27; use. will order again if out.</li>
            <li> Why oh why do these products have to be loaded with cheap scent?  I suppose the makers think that it smells nice but if you have allergies or other sensitivities all you get is some discomfort when you use the product.  My daughter reports that the shampoo otherwise works well but left her hair someone lank.</li>
            <li> I got this product to review through the Amazon Vine program.  The underneath of my hair is bleached blond and tends to get frizzy, so I was excited to give this smoothing shampoo a try.  Right now I am using [[ASIN:B0094WOKY2 Organix: Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo]] and that works pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell, but the shampoo is creamy and lathers up well.  It seems to get my hair clean.  When I started using this shampoo I was using this with the Organix Argan Oil Conditioner and didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference.  This shampoo got my hair clean but it didn&#x27;t look a lot smoother, in fact it was a bit more frizzy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty cheap shampoo/conditioner, so I decided to buy a bottle of the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner and see if these two worked better as a system.  That ended up being a disaster, the Conditioner left my hair incredibly frizzy, even more frizzy than no conditioner at all...even my non-color treated hair was incredibly frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read the directions.  The conditioner is supposed to be activated by heat, they recommend using a flat iron.  So I tried it again with the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo, followed by the 7 Day Keratin Smooth Condition and then blow-drying and straightening with my flat iron.  This actually worked pretty well, my hair was nice and smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately that means this is not the Shampoo/conditioner for me.  I rarely blow dry or straighten my hair, I usually let it air dry and that does not work with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this could be a good product for someone who does a lot of heat treatment on their hair.  But I don&#x27;t have time to follow that blow dry, flat iron straightening regimen every day for a couple weeks...so I am not sure how this product would affect the health of your hair long term.  For now I will be sticking with my Organix Argan Oil shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, my first sample of this product was packaged very poorly and had squirted all over the cardboard box it came in (my mailbox still smells like shampoo).  Vine did send out another sample for me to evaluate and that one arrived fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Creamy&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;- Liked the packaging, product is easy to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Smell&lt;br /&gt;- Must use with matching conditioner and heat to get smoothing effect.product was packaged very poorly and had squirted all over the cardboard box it came in (my mailbox still smells like shampoo).  Vine did send out another sample for me to evaluate and that one arrived fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Creamy&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;- Liked the packaging, product is easy to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Smell&lt;br /&gt;- Must use with matching conditioner and heat to get smoothing effect.</li>
            <li> I got this because I already had the companion products -- the conditioner and the leave in treatment for thermal styling.  Having had good results using the other two items, I was very curious how my hair would react when using all three as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely say there is a noticeable difference.  The Keratin acts to keep the hair manageable and reduces frizz for a longer period of time.  The smell is lovely and I did notice my hair did not revert as much in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do have other shampoos I prefer more. But as a total hair-care solution, I have been very impressed with Tresemme&#x27;s 7-day keratin system of products and will use them when I want a smoother look.</li>
            <li> I love the feel after I used it. Lathered up great, was afraid with lower sulfur in it that it would be hard to lather &amp; clean hair. Says to use for 7 days, will post after I have tried for a few days.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this conditioner because it says it works with your flat iron but I used it on my naturally wavy hair. When using it the conditioner was thick and creamy. My hair never felt so soft. I even slept with my hair still damp and woke up to incredibly soft, non frizzy, waves. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Use as directed and Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo will have your hair shinning and looking great in no time at all!</li>
            <li> A shampoo that really helps with aging hair. In the past few years my hair has changed from thick and glossy to thin and brittle. This shampoo helps my hair return to its more luxurious self.</li>
            <li> (I tried the shampoo and conditioner at the same time, so there will be a little bit of cross pollinating for each review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keratin is a magic word for people with ultra dry hair like mine. When it comes to marketing hair products, &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; is used as a Symbol of Instant Results almost as much as argan oil is. So with that in mind, and my great success with Tresemme products in the past, I was really looking forward to trying this 7 day stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it seemed to glide over my hair and leave nothing in its wake. I could feel it mock my thirsty strands while it slide off without improving the feel and, eventually, look of my hair. I followed the directions, I swear! I love reading! I know companies like us using every product in a specific line because they formulated it to work together, but the product should be able to stand alone-- especially if you pair both the conditioner and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular Tresemme shampoo and conditioner does a LOT more for my hair than this line, my hair was as dry and unmanageable as it is if I use the stuff from the 99 cent store. I wish this worked because I usually love this brand and the concept sounds great, but eh. This shampoo cleaned my hair and smelled kinda good... not qualifications to buy in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth-feeling shampoo that does not have a strong odor, so I appreciate that. Too many shampoos are overloaded with fragrance; this has just a touch. I found that it left my hair fairly smooth, although a bit of conditioner on the ends was needed to leave my hair looking right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did an online check on the ingredients. Here is the list: Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Dimethiconol, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PEG-45M, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyquaternium-28, PPG-9, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient of most concern may be DMDM Hydantoin, an antimicrobial formaldehyde-releaser preservative. Studies have found that this ingredient increases the risk of cosmetic dermatitis in consumers allergic to formaldehyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have reviewed other products with higher concerns and this one seems relatively benign, it is far from being a natural product. That may or may not matter to you, depending on your philosophy and how sensitive your body is. I am somewhat sensitive and I have not had any obvious reaction to the chemicals in this product.</li>
