            <li>This is such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a Ralph Lauren perfume. :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li>This is pretty good stuff considering I am not fond of Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, packed them very well, no leaking, in great condition.</li>

            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I chose to cheap out and use something else.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Normally Paul Mitchell products don&#x27;t get along with my hair, but the super strong is super amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Feels soft and strong!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had wonderful successes with Paul Mitchell products in the past and they are cruelty</li>
            <li>, i originally bought it on sale a Ulta.</li>
            <li>It smells great and did not strip my hair or make it feel dry.</li>
            <li>It was always so full of tangles</li>
            <li>I have been using these for about two months and my hair has grown about 1/2 and inch more then normal.</li>
            <li>Great for those who HAVE to wash their hair everyday.</li>
            <li>I like that fact that I&#x27;m getting my money worth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and they made my hair too soft and lump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>You can use it every day and your hair doesn&#x27;t get build up and stays soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually never had this kind of issue since switching to higher end products.  </li>
            <li>My hair has grown about an inch since i first bought it 2-3 months ago</li>
            <li>I would be willing to try this product again, if I bought it from a known reliable source like a salon rather than online.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have for several years.</li>
            <li>And the most important is I am able to get a comb through my wet hair to dry it.</li>
            <li>certainly will buy again.</li>
            <li>LOVEEE this shampoo as well as the other treatments in this strong product line!</li>
            <li>I think I paid too much having to order it online, almost twice the price I pay in a salon.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Really can tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and bleached but this product is gentle on my hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely my must-have hair product.</li>
            <li>This is the third different kind of Paul Mitchell I have tried, guess its just not for me...</li>
            <li>Super strong shampoo and conditioner keeps my hair (both colors) soft, strong, and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy as quickly as other products have in the past on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Made my fine hair dry, so I stopped using it and gave them to my daughter.</li>
            <li>Now it is tangle free - drys in mintues when blown dry.</li>
            <li>it, and in high school, bleached the s</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, as with all Paul Mitchell products.</li>
            <li>Hair looks better after it gets dried, exellents results after all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a steal considered what it normally sells at.</li>
            <li>Before this, my hair was so damaged from constantly bleaching and not using the right shampoo and conditioners, then my salon introduced me to this</li>
            <li>This is my new fav shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wanted to exchange it for new set</li>
            <li>It is very cheap compared to other products on the market currently.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>The size is pretty big</li>
            <li>I use pm everyday and the conditioner that I received was out of date it had a strong odor and</li>
            <li>I typically LOVE Paul Mitchell but let me tell you, this product either might not be legit, or it&#x27;s a rare fail from Paul</li>
            <li>the bottle had the old paul Mitchel logo on it I do not recommend to order from this buyer</li>
            <li>Plus, almost no salon near me caries it in strength.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is dark blonde.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite this particular failure, I&#x27;m still a Paul Mitchell fan for the fact they are cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a shampoo and conditioner that makes my very fragile color treated hair stronger without building up in my other like many other high quality salon shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I like how the bottles are so large as well, they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I was rather frustrated - but this is indeed a great product that I would recommend.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry and color treated, and my hair feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>More recently it has been colored black - which sucks all softness out of it.  </li>

            <li> (seeing as I had no way of knowing how much had leaked out, it was a real mess) and apparently this is a product that Amazon will not take back.  </li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair</li>
            <li> I can not believe I waited so long to use it.  </li>
            <li> I experienced a shocking amount of color bleed using this product, when the water when just using water alone was running clear, but after I put this through, I watched tons of my color swirl down</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the conditioner&#x27;s bottle had a crack in the bottle which caused the product to leak everywhere in the bag, but i cleaned it up and put it in my old bottle, they do ship this with tape over the lid to protect it from leaking but accidents happen.</li>
            <li> my second wash, i noticed less hair breaking off while rubbing the conditioner on my scalp.</li>
            <li> the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo strips my hair and leaves it a tangled mess, and the conditioner isn&#x27;t enough to untangle the disaster the shampoo makes.  </li>
            <li> and i adored it, only to discover that without a deal this duo was ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li> It was a chore just to get a comb through the tangle mess.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo and conditioner I have been using for a few years now.</li>
            <li> , the dried hair looks healthier and workable.</li>
            <li> Try a small bottle and see what you think.</li>
            <li> I ordered it online because it&#x27;s hard to find the liter bottles in the salons.</li>
            <li> But as far as the product, well I have bra length hair which is on the thin side, this shampoo made my hair seem thinner :(</li>
            <li> I have always had thin hair,and being a girl, of course i color it, straighten (or curl)</li>
            <li> and I would like to believe my hair would be a lot worse if I wasn&#x27;t using this product.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hated washing my hair.</li>

It made my hair brittle, and and constantly break causing split ends.&lt;br /&gt;By my second wash, i noticed less hair breaking off while rubbing the conditioner on my scalp. The more i use it, the more healthy my hair looks And feels. My hair has grown about an inch since i first bought it 2-3 months ago</li>

            <li> Honestly this is the best! Before this, my hair was so damaged from constantly bleaching and not using the right shampoo and conditioners, then my salon introduced me to this and I promise I will NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE ON MY HAIR!!!! 10 Stars!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo- see a difference in just 2 weeks.  My hair seems to be growing stronger and faster.</li>
            <li> Been using P.M. prducts for years.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I typically LOVE Paul Mitchell but let me tell you, this product either might not be legit, or it&#x27;s a rare fail from Paul Mitchell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It indicates color safe, but it assuredly is not.  I experienced a shocking amount of color bleed using this product, when the water when just using water alone was running clear, but after I put this through, I watched tons of my color swirl down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo strips my hair and leaves it a tangled mess, and the conditioner isn&#x27;t enough to untangle the disaster the shampoo makes.  I&#x27;ve actually never had this kind of issue since switching to higher end products.  I&#x27;ve had wonderful successes with Paul Mitchell products in the past and they are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But- it&#x27;s noted that you should buy from salons only on the bottle to assure it&#x27;s actually a Paul Mitchell product.  Could I have experienced the inauthentic product in a Paul Mitchell bottle it warns about?  I don&#x27;t know, but I wouldn&#x27;t encourage purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had very good luck both on color hair and hair texture after use from the Paul Mitchell - Awapuhi Wild Ginger line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this particular failure, I&#x27;m still a Paul Mitchell fan for the fact they are cruelty free.  I would be willing to try this product again, if I bought it from a known reliable source like a salon rather than online.  I&#x27;m simply not convinced based on my prior experience that this is a legitimate product.</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair dry, so I stopped using it and gave them to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about two months and my hair has grown about 1/2 and inch more then normal. I am a hairstylist..So, I have tried just about everything. This is pretty good stuff considering I am not fond of Paul Mitchell. It is very cheap compared to other products on the market currently. It smells great and did not strip my hair or make it feel dry. The treatment conditioner in this line is also in my regimen. I would reccomend using all three to better benefit..</li>
            <li> Great quality for a pretty good price! I like how the bottles are so large as well, they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo and conditioner that makes my very fragile color treated hair stronger without building up in my other like many other high quality salon shampoos and conditioners. This shampoo is a clarifying shampoo which prevents the build up of the conditioner. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I use pm everyday and the conditioner that I received was out of date it had a strong odor and the bottle had the old paul Mitchel logo on it I do not recommend to order from this buyer</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter for Christmas she loves this fast delivery and great price  very happy with this shampoo</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo and conditioner I have been using for a few years now. I ordered it online because it&#x27;s hard to find the liter bottles in the salons. I think I paid too much having to order it online, almost twice the price I pay in a salon.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell and I dont seem to see eye to eye. The product was packaged wonderful and arrived fast :) But as far as the product, well I have bra length hair which is on the thin side, this shampoo made my hair seem thinner :( It was disappointing. This is the third different kind of Paul Mitchell I have tried, guess its just not for me...now my guest bathroom has a nice smelling shampoo/conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought this product about a week ago and bought one for my sis as well. Will continue to buy it. I like that fact that I&#x27;m getting my money worth.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is dark blonde.  More recently it has been colored black - which sucks all softness out of it.  Super strong shampoo and conditioner keeps my hair (both colors) soft, strong, and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy as quickly as other products have in the past on my fine hair.  Try a small bottle and see what you think.</li>
            <li> Great for those who HAVE to wash their hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> good shampoo. great lightning fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market.  I&#x27;ve shopped around at Hair Salon&#x27;s &amp; no one carries it in SoCal.  Had to buy online.  Great Product &amp; Value!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.  I has done wonders for my damaged hair.  I was somewhat upset with the condition it arrived it - shampoo had leaked out and the bottles were covered in it.  I wanted to exchange it for new set (seeing as I had no way of knowing how much had leaked out, it was a real mess) and apparently this is a product that Amazon will not take back.  I was rather frustrated - but this is indeed a great product that I would recommend.  - Cassandra</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo. always awesome.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners on the market. My hair is dry and color treated, and my hair feels so soft after I use it. The shampoo is good to use with the conditioner. I highly recommend it, as with all Paul Mitchell products.</li>
            <li> My sister used this combination shampoo and conditioner forever.  I chose to cheap out and use something else.  She used to be a hairdresser. She let me use a sample of it. I loved it. I bought these about a week ago . I cannot believe how my hair looks. I have fine hair. This makes it feel fuller and the style locks in and my hair looks in great condition. And the most important is I am able to get a comb through my wet hair to dry it. It was always so full of tangles I hated washing my hair. It was a chore just to get a comb through the tangle mess. Now it is tangle free - drys in mintues when blown dry. I can not believe I waited so long to use it.  This is the cheapest place on the web. It also compares in price at beauty outlets.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried so many and they made my hair too soft and lump. I was frustrated looking for a good shampoo. So I came across paul mitchell.I needed strength to my hair. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it I&#x27;m telling you. My hair feels stronger, looks healthier. I have never found a shampoo I really liked .I would settle fir cheaper brands that did nothing. So I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try this. Thanks so much. He has a large selection of products which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> LOVEEE this shampoo as well as the other treatments in this strong product line!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Really can tell a difference in my hair. Feels soft and strong!!</li>
            <li> Always use Paul Mitchell good product and price</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! My hair feels healthy and hydrated .</li>
            <li> 😂he&#x27;s not a regional I recommend you buy it in the Beauty salon</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and conditioner, smells good, but I like it a bit stronger. Very fast shipping, packed them very well, no leaking, in great condition. certainly will buy again.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo works as it promisses, the dried hair looks healthier and workable. Hair looks better after it gets dried, exellents results after all.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Great quality and price. My hair is color treated and bleached but this product is gentle on my hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell products. ..this is one of my favorite shampoo. .</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price was right. It took awhile to get here but I wasn&#x27;t inconvenienced</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product. It is absolutely my must-have hair product. You can use it every day and your hair doesn&#x27;t get build up and stays soft and healthy.  The smell reminds me of a Ralph Lauren perfume. :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner since my hair stylist suggested that I try it. I haven&#x27;t bought anything else since! I have long blonde hair and I would like to believe my hair would be a lot worse if I wasn&#x27;t using this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft. The size is pretty big so they will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo, i originally bought it on sale a Ulta. I decided to try it out and i adored it, only to discover that without a deal this duo was ridiculously priced. Plus, almost no salon near me caries it in strength. I knew i had to snatch this deal up when i saw it, 35 for both big bottles? it&#x27;s a steal considered what it normally sells at. My only complaint is that the conditioner&#x27;s bottle had a crack in the bottle which caused the product to leak everywhere in the bag, but i cleaned it up and put it in my old bottle, they do ship this with tape over the lid to protect it from leaking but accidents happen.</li>
            <li> Really good shampoo and conditioner. Normally Paul Mitchell products don&#x27;t get along with my hair, but the super strong is super amazing! My hair grows an extra 1/4 inch between trims now.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have for several years. I use it every day and have for some time now. I can not always get to a store where it is sold so it is good to find it on line now and I can get that way. Thank you</li>
