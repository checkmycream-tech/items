            <li> Not good for me in front of others , and we are in the Middle East as soon as the weather is too hot to touch hair dye I see in the hand</li>

            <li> This is good color stick but a little runny at first. The longer I have it, the less runny it is. I would recommend it over any other stick.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Much neater that using mascara or color crayon.  I just recently ordered two more!</li>
            <li> YES!!! This is the answer to \\&quot;What covers gray hair and is not absorbed by your brain?\\&quot;  Application is easy and smooth.  Easy to color specific strands. A tiny bit expensive but well worth the price!!!! Received by scheduled shipment date.  There was no damage to shipment as packaging was excellent.</li>
            <li> A little icky; however it did the job.</li>
            <li> Although I receivd the prduct asap, I found the product to be not what I expected. It is more like a back marker and does not color the hair that well. It also runs on your fingers a lot.</li>
            <li> Covers grey at a touch. No fuss no mess. Easy to apply and great to clean up. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> My husband love it !!! He is 40&#x27; and has thinning edges. It is very convient. Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> Love it. Covers my reddish grey roots and has already saved me money because I haven&#x27;t had to dye as often. Easy as coloring with a marker.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it.  It is the best grey coverage I have ever used and I have used many.</li>
            <li> I felt that this product did what the product maker proclaimed that it would do. I does however lighten with combing of the hair as well as with washing. A note of advice...if your hair is between colors go with the lighter color.</li>
            <li> Useful between color appointments,does not drip but you need to use the comb to keep it off your skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister to cover her roots between colorings.  She was using all sorts of inferior products to save money.  She said this was easy to use.  Great deal and arrived promptly,</li>
            <li> Makes my hair kinda frizzy but definitely covers all my roots perfectly. I wish it wasnt so expensive and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my horse was almost twenty and he was greying at the temples. Not kidding. So, when I use this marker just a little bit on his bangs, it magically takes off five years! I call it &amp;#34;Just for Mane&amp;#34;...and if it can work on my horse, it can work for you, too!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I bought this item so that I can touch up some unwanted gray hair but this product just does not stay on at all.. I would expect the product to stay on for the day and not need frequent touch ups... The color just does not dye the gray hair and when it does its just not dark enough... The color also comes of pretty easily sometimes just with a towel.. I would expect a product which is so expensive for the amount that it comes in to have better usablity.. overall extremely disappointed..</li>
            <li> I used this product prior to this purchase and liked it.  I use it to cover the gray between coloring.  It is not a fix all but does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is a great quick touch-up took. It works better then other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I like that you don&#x27;t have to use water like other products! It lasted a pretty long time as well.</li>
            <li> Works like a wide tip marker.  Does no pull hair, chip or damage hair.  Fast and easy, stays on well.</li>
            <li> I use this. Sadly my hair is greying and this is my lifeline before I can re dye my hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply and it ends up on your forehead! Not worth the price at all, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i would purchase this product again, finding that it wears off quickly&lt;br /&gt;and has a odor of dye when used.  just wanted something for a quick touch up, and&lt;br /&gt;this wasn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
            <li> Not good for me in front of others , and we are in the Middle East as soon as the weather is too hot to touch hair dye I see in the hand</li>
            <li> I bought this product twice and both times it only lasted a few times before it was empty.  Not worth the money for only a few uses before you have to discard it.</li>
