            <li>The comb attachment is great also.</li>
            <li>The price is great for a quality dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great hair dryer</li>
            <li>Why I am happy...  </li>
            <li>The best part, my daughter now just dries her own hair with it for two reasons.  </li>
            <li>great dryer,quite, does the job.</li>
            <li>I had hopes that I had found a great dryer for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with its performance and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  </li>
            <li>Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it&#x27;s not a decorative accessory.</li>
            <li>It is BRIGHT orange</li>
            <li>DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>but I have heard really good things about this brand</li>
            <li>I have the Babyliss Thermal Ionic Dryer, which I thought was really good.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>but it is an awesome dryer worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>This dryer--even after the 1st use--was so much better!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!</li>
            <li>This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he&#x27;s SO jealous!  </li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead and try it out, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>The nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout.</li>
            <li>I saw this on sale for an AMAZING price, and decided to add it to my order.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels amazing</li>
            <li>This is a nice dryer.  </li>
            <li>It would have been really nice if it had come with a diffuser though.  </li>
            <li>I know some people didn&#x27;t have a good time with their dryer, but I can attest to the many who have.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I have found you.</li>
            <li>The comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on.</li>
            <li>My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone looking for a very good hair dryer at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It heats up nicely (can get too hot) and straightens beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This is buy far the best hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li>But So Strong!  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer after reading such great reviews, but still wondered what could be so great about a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but very light weight.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many hairdryers over the years...</li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this item.    </li>
            <li>You will Love it  :-)</li>
            <li>this model was among the best reviewed and it was definitely the most affordable.       </li>
            <li>and I love this one even more.  </li>
            <li>I love it and love the color.</li>
            <li>Ok, here is a fat-free review:    </li>
            <li>I have been really satisfied with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t pay more than that for something that I don&#x27;t have time for.</li>
            <li>and I plan on keeping it for years :)</li>
            <li>I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li>love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Orange...</li>
            <li>I sure as hell couldn&#x27;t find it.     </li>
            <li>Once I recieved it and tried it out I fell completely in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it has much more volume now even when i don&#x27;t use volumizing products on it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I bought this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but I love the dryer anyway.</li>
            <li>that said how many watts it has,</li>
            <li>I also love the color too.</li>
            <li>But this one is much, much better.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, it was definitely worth what I paid--probably way more!</li>
            <li>I used many cheap (</li>
            <li>My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price.  </li>
            <li>The air output is sufficient for me, and I am fine with the two heat settings.</li>
            <li>Size and weight are fine.  </li>
            <li>Noise level is fine.  </li>
            <li>For $40, its fine.  </li>
            <li>It is everything that was advertised and is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This dryer doesnt even sound like it  is on.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price - $40 is a LOT cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models I&#x27;ve looked into.</li>
            <li>It it quiet, has a great cooling feature, and helps create the style you are trying to schieve...versus fighting you.   </li>
            <li>The dyer is also light weight which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and decided to give this hair dryer a chance since it was such a great price.</li>
            <li>JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this one.  </li>
            <li>So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    </li>
            <li>When I stumbled upon this one, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>None has been anything to get excited about.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty confident this would be a well made product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s \\&quot;original</li>
            <li>I live in hot and humid South Texas and it leaves my hair soft,smooth and silky WELL worth waiting for!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and worth $40...</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the hair dryer very much when it worked!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything special about this dryer and my mother&#x27;s 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was defective, I did return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>, it shoots cool air even after the dryer has been going for a while.</li>
            <li>Okay - maybe not 2 seconds, but it really is fast.</li>
            <li>THis is a super blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer dries my hair quickly with no frizz.</li>
            <li>While it dries hair quickly,  </li>
            <li>but, it dries quickly )</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is perfectly adequate.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love this produce and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The very nice thing is that it did not develop the burned plastic smell that I&#x27;ve often gotten with other ceramic dryers.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find myself wanting \\&quot;more power,\\&quot; as some reviewers have mentioned, but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I can get my hair smooth like my stylist does.  </li>
            <li>and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just trying to say that this definitely isn&#x27;t some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser has a Chi Professional dryer and she hasn&#x27;t ever been fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer in hopes that it would do a better job than my old Revlon Ceramic Ion dryer.</li>
            <li>This number is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This dryer is worth the investment</li>
            <li>I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I&#x27;ve purchased this blow drier.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a \\&quot;powerful  1300 watts.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>POWERFUL 1300 WATTS?</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But these two pros aren&#x27;t worth the cons.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it is not as powerful as i thought.</li>
            <li>This purchase was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The whole \\&quot;deep brilliance\\&quot; line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, \\&quot;originally higher priced\\&quot; items.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is top notch &amp; is very reasonable in price in comparison to other top notch hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>It is the most quiet hair dryer that I have owned, it is easy to take the filter out to clean, it doesn&#x27;t eat my hair when it is too close to my head, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but the best thing is that it gets hot enough to dry my hair and has enough power to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment is my favorite part - it kind of massages my head while I use it and it makes my hair less frizzy (and that&#x27;s saying something since I live in Texas!).</li>
            <li>The cool shot works really well</li>
            <li>This dryer also has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li>If you want a high end hair dryer for the right price, you&#x27;ve come to the right place!</li>
            <li>Same great product different packaging and on sale!</li>
            <li>When the blowdryer isn&#x27;t a great one, my hair  is more poofy and frizzy, making it difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li>I was even happier to get a more expensive one at a great price.  </li>
            <li>The on/off buttons can be switched easily while using if held directly by the buttons</li>
            <li>and it used to dry my hair very fast with a nice shine and no frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and very light wait.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive my new dryer.  </li>
            <li>The setting that this dryer has for \\&quot;low\\&quot; on the heat side would be about as hot</li>
            <li>I have one other highend hair dryer and I love it!</li>
            <li>The only thing that might make it better is if the output was a lighter higher/harder, but it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>This dryer seems to work well, although I guess I&#x27;m used to smaller, more compact dryers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying one as a back up and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>It is larger than most hairdryers...</li>
            <li>Try hot tools ceramic hair dryer for @</li>
            <li>The attachment was so hot</li>
            <li>This blow dryer gets really, really hot.</li>
            <li>god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.</li>
            <li>the &#x27;blow&#x27; component isn&#x27;t all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that&#x27;s probably partly why it&#x27;s so light)  </li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical when i purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li>This one is quieter and even though it doesn&#x27;t blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t move it around easily in the middle of styling.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very quiet and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough, it was plenty, and the lower wattage made it quieter to run.</li>
            <li>I absolutely don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely gently and leaves my hair softer and more manageable than it has been in a very long time.</li>
            <li>very high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Because there isn&#x27;t a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I&#x27;d really like it to be</li>
            <li>my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work.</li>
            <li>That in itself is so frustrating that I can&#x27;t see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great.</li>
            <li>When I mentioned to her that I was looking to get a Chi like hers, she encouraged me to shop around and look at the different ones available.</li>
            <li>My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than the conair it replaced.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight as can be, and it does make a difference in the texture of the hair regardless.</li>
            <li>VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I</li>
            <li>IT.IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was drying my hair faster.</li>
            <li>This dryer dries the hair fast without frizzing it out.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very quie too.</li>
            <li>After my last cheap one stopped working, I saw this and figured I would splurge.    </li>
            <li>It is light and quiet.  </li>
            <li>People who haven&#x27;t seen me started commenting on how much nicer and fuller my hair has been looking.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the attachments, they&#x27;re a bit too bulky for my taste.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am really in control,</li>
            <li>With this dryer, I can hold it really close to my hair and keep it there.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>Instead of looking forward to getting ready</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the Babyliss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer.</li>
            <li>Within MINUTES of turning this quiet little thing on (compared to the many many blowdryers I&#x27;ve used in life) and putting it to my hair it was shiny, soft and professionally straight!  </li>
            <li>I have long hair that easily gets frizzed from overdrying.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and pleased that it is light wieght, and dried my hair in a 1/2 hour instead of the usual 1 hr...</li>
            <li>The cord is extra long and the bright orange color is WOW.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it</li>
            <li>My hair felt so much more silkier than with my other blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made of high quality materials.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much difference a high quality blow dryer makes.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>It did take some getting used to that the dryer has only two settings plus  a cool shot.  </li>
            <li>My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>It is pretty quiet and dries my naturally curly afro-american hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>My roots were as straight as they are when my hair is newly relaxed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super quiet</li>
            <li>As a mom I don&#x27;t have hours to style my hair and feel good... but now with this flat iron (and I also got the Farouk Deep Brilliance Flat Iron)</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>the high setting dries my hair in no time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER.</li>
            <li>A high air-flow dryer would blow everything away.  </li>
            <li>I used the comb attachment and used it on high, and my hair came out almost like it was flat-ironed.</li>
            <li>The air is HOT HOT HOT, it dries my hair VERY quickly and my hair is no longer frizzy and a knotted mess after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power.</li>
            <li>This dryer has less power than my regular dryer but dries quicker and without the frizzies - love it!</li>
            <li>It is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  </li>
            <li>It is heavier than a normal dryer.</li>
            <li>I am generally pretty cheap when it comes to beauty products, but I recently decided to let my wavy hair grow long.  </li>
            <li>I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot</li>
            <li>The Farouk Deep Brilliance Professional Hair Dryer works excellent on hard to dry hair--</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft - again, having chemically treated, porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  </li>
            <li>since my baby&#x27;s bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)</li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>Took out my new hairdryer, plugged it in, and</li>
            <li>Our family needed a new hair dryer when our hair dryer stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I have had this dryer for 1 month now and am looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight however it is very loud</li>
            <li>This one leaves my hair feeling very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The heat is noticeably very hot and dry.  </li>
            <li>And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>It is SOOOOO QUIET which is exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>It gets fairly hot, and is quiet.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!</li>
            <li>WoW!  </li>
            <li>dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was \\&quot;originally $259.95\\&quot; or even for any other price.</li>
            <li>When I first starting using it, I would accidentally hit the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned it on and heard how quiet it was...</li>
            <li>Whisper quite and dries hair super fast with less frizz.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for carrying such High Quality Products...</li>
            <li>i originally ordered the farouk deep brilliance because my old conair hair dryer finally went to hair appliance heaven.  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries super fast and leaves hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love the way this hair dryer works on my hair - WAY less frizzies than my regular old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish I get just from the dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about, but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair, so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake.  </li>
            <li>This dryer has won me over completely.</li>
            <li>It worked quickly, quietly, and gently.</li>
            <li>In fact, my mom wants one now and she has short hair...</li>
            <li>I figured my old one would break eventually.</li>
            <li>It dries faster than my old one</li>
            <li>The hair dries soft and maintains shine.  </li>
            <li>The result was wow.    </li>
            <li>and it is much quieter than our last dryer.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t take as long to straighten my hair because it was almost straight with the hair dryer!</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li>It only took a few times to get used to using it and that doesn&#x27;t happen any more.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer because I wanted to dry my highlighted, curly, longish hair as quickly and as frizz-free as possible.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I do believe this is the same Exact hair dryer, it just doesn&#x27;t have CHI printed on the side of it.  </li>
            <li>It has a Low &amp; High, and 2 heat settings...</li>
            <li>The only negatives I can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly (thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use), and perhaps for someone with very thick hair, 1300 watts won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can clean the air filter as apposed to my previous hair dryers!</li>
            <li>I want to add, I first learnt about Farouk Chi products from my sister who got her flat iron and hair dryer as a gift from a friend who&#x27;s hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron/hair dryer but packaged as \\&quot;Deep Brilliance\\&quot; line.  </li>
            <li>This product is just the thing for those with thick hair which is hard to control &amp; wanting great drying results.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair and my old dryer was very loud and it got very hot</li>
            <li>I never realized a hair dryer could actually make your hair feel soft!</li>
            <li>No regrets here!  </li>
            <li>I use the comb attachment and that gets my hair straight enough to flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to pay the same for a high end regular hair dryer at a drug store or department store.  </li>
            <li>Although the opening is small, this dries my hair, even right out of the shower, in less than half the time of the old dryers (most Conair or Revlon).</li>
            <li>Better that I expected always used a comb dryer,I am a changed person no more combs for me</li>
            <li>THEY WILL TAKE YOUR SHIPPING MONEY AND RETURN THE DRYER BACK TO YOU WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCT CAN NOT BE FIXED - WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>With my old dryer, I would twist the attachment constantly...</li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet, makes my hair feel so soft, and dries my hair faster than any hairdryer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer gave just enough heat to dry my hair fastly and did not frizz my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair also has less static and the dryer is substantially quieter than even a previous \\&quot;extra quiet\\&quot; model.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz.</li>
            <li>But it dries my nieces hair much faster than other dryers.</li>
            <li>My only complaint, really, is that the attachment \\&quot;nozzle\\&quot; gets really hot</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much quiter than the average blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>i cannot say that i find it to be a whole lot different from other dryers i have owned</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time a few days ago and I was amazed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only blowing cool air now, hard to believe it&#x27;s a salon dryer.</li>
            <li>With my old Revlon it took me 20 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go in less time.  </li>
            <li>When I wash my hair, blow drying only got my hair dry enough to put in a pony tail, then I would wait until the next day for my hair to be completely dry before I would use the flat iron, or hot comb to straighten it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how, but it makes your hair smoother and it seems to dry it so much quicker than any other dryer we&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  </li>
            <li> Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it&#x27;s not a decorative accessory.</li>
            <li> It is BRIGHT orange</li>
            <li> DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> but I have heard really good things about this brand</li>
            <li> I have the Babyliss Thermal Ionic Dryer, which I thought was really good.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> but it is an awesome dryer worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> This dryer--even after the 1st use--was so much better!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!</li>
            <li> This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he&#x27;s SO jealous!  </li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead and try it out, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> The nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout.</li>
            <li> I saw this on sale for an AMAZING price, and decided to add it to my order.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels amazing</li>
            <li> This is a nice dryer.  </li>
            <li> It would have been really nice if it had come with a diffuser though.  </li>
            <li> I know some people didn&#x27;t have a good time with their dryer, but I can attest to the many who have.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I have found you.</li>
            <li> The comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on.</li>
            <li> My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone looking for a very good hair dryer at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It heats up nicely (can get too hot) and straightens beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This is buy far the best hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li> But So Strong!  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer after reading such great reviews, but still wondered what could be so great about a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but very light weight.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many hairdryers over the years...</li>
            <li> The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this item.    </li>
            <li> You will Love it  :-)</li>
            <li> this model was among the best reviewed and it was definitely the most affordable.       </li>
            <li> and I love this one even more.  </li>
            <li> I love it and love the color.</li>
            <li> Ok, here is a fat-free review:    </li>
            <li> I have been really satisfied with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t pay more than that for something that I don&#x27;t have time for.</li>
            <li> and I plan on keeping it for years :)</li>
            <li> I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Orange...</li>
            <li> I sure as hell couldn&#x27;t find it.     </li>
            <li> Once I recieved it and tried it out I fell completely in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it has much more volume now even when i don&#x27;t use volumizing products on it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I bought this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but I love the dryer anyway.</li>
            <li> that said how many watts it has,</li>
            <li> I also love the color too.</li>
            <li> But this one is much, much better.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, it was definitely worth what I paid--probably way more!</li>
            <li> I used many cheap (</li>
            <li> My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price.  </li>
            <li> The air output is sufficient for me, and I am fine with the two heat settings.</li>
            <li> Size and weight are fine.  </li>
            <li> Noise level is fine.  </li>
            <li> For $40, its fine.  </li>
            <li> It is everything that was advertised and is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This dryer doesnt even sound like it  is on.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price - $40 is a LOT cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models I&#x27;ve looked into.</li>
            <li> It it quiet, has a great cooling feature, and helps create the style you are trying to schieve...versus fighting you.   </li>
            <li> The dyer is also light weight which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to give this hair dryer a chance since it was such a great price.</li>
            <li> JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this one.  </li>
            <li> So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    </li>
            <li> When I stumbled upon this one, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> None has been anything to get excited about.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty confident this would be a well made product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s \\&quot;original</li>
            <li> I live in hot and humid South Texas and it leaves my hair soft,smooth and silky WELL worth waiting for!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and worth $40...</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the hair dryer very much when it worked!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this dryer and my mother&#x27;s 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was defective, I did return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> , it shoots cool air even after the dryer has been going for a while.</li>
            <li> Okay - maybe not 2 seconds, but it really is fast.</li>
            <li> THis is a super blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair quickly with no frizz.</li>
            <li> While it dries hair quickly,  </li>
            <li> but, it dries quickly )</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is perfectly adequate.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love this produce and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The very nice thing is that it did not develop the burned plastic smell that I&#x27;ve often gotten with other ceramic dryers.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find myself wanting \\&quot;more power,\\&quot; as some reviewers have mentioned, but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick.  </li>
            <li> For the first time I can get my hair smooth like my stylist does.  </li>
            <li> and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just trying to say that this definitely isn&#x27;t some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has a Chi Professional dryer and she hasn&#x27;t ever been fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer in hopes that it would do a better job than my old Revlon Ceramic Ion dryer.</li>
            <li> This number is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This dryer is worth the investment</li>
            <li> I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I&#x27;ve purchased this blow drier.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a \\&quot;powerful  1300 watts.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> POWERFUL 1300 WATTS?</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But these two pros aren&#x27;t worth the cons.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it is not as powerful as i thought.</li>
            <li> This purchase was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;deep brilliance\\&quot; line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, \\&quot;originally higher priced\\&quot; items.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is top notch &amp; is very reasonable in price in comparison to other top notch hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> It is the most quiet hair dryer that I have owned, it is easy to take the filter out to clean, it doesn&#x27;t eat my hair when it is too close to my head, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but the best thing is that it gets hot enough to dry my hair and has enough power to get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is my favorite part - it kind of massages my head while I use it and it makes my hair less frizzy (and that&#x27;s saying something since I live in Texas!).</li>
            <li> The cool shot works really well</li>
            <li> This dryer also has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li> If you want a high end hair dryer for the right price, you&#x27;ve come to the right place!</li>
            <li> Same great product different packaging and on sale!</li>
            <li> When the blowdryer isn&#x27;t a great one, my hair  is more poofy and frizzy, making it difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> I was even happier to get a more expensive one at a great price.  </li>
            <li> The on/off buttons can be switched easily while using if held directly by the buttons</li>
            <li> and it used to dry my hair very fast with a nice shine and no frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and very light wait.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive my new dryer.  </li>
            <li> The setting that this dryer has for \\&quot;low\\&quot; on the heat side would be about as hot</li>
            <li> I have one other highend hair dryer and I love it!</li>
            <li> The only thing that might make it better is if the output was a lighter higher/harder, but it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> This dryer seems to work well, although I guess I&#x27;m used to smaller, more compact dryers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one as a back up and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> It is larger than most hairdryers...</li>
            <li> Try hot tools ceramic hair dryer for @</li>
            <li> The attachment was so hot</li>
            <li> This blow dryer gets really, really hot.</li>
            <li> god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;blow&#x27; component isn&#x27;t all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that&#x27;s probably partly why it&#x27;s so light)  </li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical when i purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li> This one is quieter and even though it doesn&#x27;t blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t move it around easily in the middle of styling.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very quiet and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough, it was plenty, and the lower wattage made it quieter to run.</li>
            <li> I absolutely don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely gently and leaves my hair softer and more manageable than it has been in a very long time.</li>
            <li> very high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Because there isn&#x27;t a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I&#x27;d really like it to be</li>
            <li> my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work.</li>
            <li> That in itself is so frustrating that I can&#x27;t see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great.</li>
            <li> When I mentioned to her that I was looking to get a Chi like hers, she encouraged me to shop around and look at the different ones available.</li>
            <li> My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than the conair it replaced.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight as can be, and it does make a difference in the texture of the hair regardless.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I</li>
            <li> IT.IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was drying my hair faster.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries the hair fast without frizzing it out.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very quie too.</li>
            <li> After my last cheap one stopped working, I saw this and figured I would splurge.    </li>
            <li> It is light and quiet.  </li>
            <li> People who haven&#x27;t seen me started commenting on how much nicer and fuller my hair has been looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the attachments, they&#x27;re a bit too bulky for my taste.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am really in control,</li>
            <li> With this dryer, I can hold it really close to my hair and keep it there.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> Instead of looking forward to getting ready</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than the Babyliss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer.</li>
            <li> Within MINUTES of turning this quiet little thing on (compared to the many many blowdryers I&#x27;ve used in life) and putting it to my hair it was shiny, soft and professionally straight!  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that easily gets frizzed from overdrying.  </li>
            <li> Love it, and pleased that it is light wieght, and dried my hair in a 1/2 hour instead of the usual 1 hr...</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long and the bright orange color is WOW.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it</li>
            <li> My hair felt so much more silkier than with my other blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made of high quality materials.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much difference a high quality blow dryer makes.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li> It did take some getting used to that the dryer has only two settings plus  a cool shot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> It is pretty quiet and dries my naturally curly afro-american hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> My roots were as straight as they are when my hair is newly relaxed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super quiet</li>
            <li> As a mom I don&#x27;t have hours to style my hair and feel good... but now with this flat iron (and I also got the Farouk Deep Brilliance Flat Iron)</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> the high setting dries my hair in no time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER.</li>
            <li> A high air-flow dryer would blow everything away.  </li>
            <li> I used the comb attachment and used it on high, and my hair came out almost like it was flat-ironed.</li>
            <li> The air is HOT HOT HOT, it dries my hair VERY quickly and my hair is no longer frizzy and a knotted mess after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power.</li>
            <li> This dryer has less power than my regular dryer but dries quicker and without the frizzies - love it!</li>
            <li> It is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  </li>
            <li> It is heavier than a normal dryer.</li>
            <li> I am generally pretty cheap when it comes to beauty products, but I recently decided to let my wavy hair grow long.  </li>
            <li> I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot</li>
            <li> The Farouk Deep Brilliance Professional Hair Dryer works excellent on hard to dry hair--</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft - again, having chemically treated, porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  </li>
            <li> since my baby&#x27;s bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Took out my new hairdryer, plugged it in, and</li>
            <li> Our family needed a new hair dryer when our hair dryer stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for 1 month now and am looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight however it is very loud</li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair feeling very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The heat is noticeably very hot and dry.  </li>
            <li> And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It is SOOOOO QUIET which is exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> It gets fairly hot, and is quiet.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!</li>
            <li> WoW!  </li>
            <li> dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was \\&quot;originally $259.95\\&quot; or even for any other price.</li>
            <li> When I first starting using it, I would accidentally hit the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned it on and heard how quiet it was...</li>
            <li> Whisper quite and dries hair super fast with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for carrying such High Quality Products...</li>
            <li> i originally ordered the farouk deep brilliance because my old conair hair dryer finally went to hair appliance heaven.  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries super fast and leaves hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love the way this hair dryer works on my hair - WAY less frizzies than my regular old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish I get just from the dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about, but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair, so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake.  </li>
            <li> This dryer has won me over completely.</li>
            <li> It worked quickly, quietly, and gently.</li>
            <li> In fact, my mom wants one now and she has short hair...</li>
            <li> I figured my old one would break eventually.</li>
            <li> It dries faster than my old one</li>
            <li> The hair dries soft and maintains shine.  </li>
            <li> The result was wow.    </li>
            <li> and it is much quieter than our last dryer.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t take as long to straighten my hair because it was almost straight with the hair dryer!</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few times to get used to using it and that doesn&#x27;t happen any more.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I wanted to dry my highlighted, curly, longish hair as quickly and as frizz-free as possible.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I do believe this is the same Exact hair dryer, it just doesn&#x27;t have CHI printed on the side of it.  </li>
            <li> It has a Low &amp; High, and 2 heat settings...</li>
            <li> The only negatives I can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly (thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use), and perhaps for someone with very thick hair, 1300 watts won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can clean the air filter as apposed to my previous hair dryers!</li>
            <li> I want to add, I first learnt about Farouk Chi products from my sister who got her flat iron and hair dryer as a gift from a friend who&#x27;s hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron/hair dryer but packaged as \\&quot;Deep Brilliance\\&quot; line.  </li>
            <li> This product is just the thing for those with thick hair which is hard to control &amp; wanting great drying results.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and my old dryer was very loud and it got very hot</li>
            <li> I never realized a hair dryer could actually make your hair feel soft!</li>
            <li> No regrets here!  </li>
            <li> I use the comb attachment and that gets my hair straight enough to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to pay the same for a high end regular hair dryer at a drug store or department store.  </li>
            <li> Although the opening is small, this dries my hair, even right out of the shower, in less than half the time of the old dryers (most Conair or Revlon).</li>
            <li> Better that I expected always used a comb dryer,I am a changed person no more combs for me</li>
            <li> THEY WILL TAKE YOUR SHIPPING MONEY AND RETURN THE DRYER BACK TO YOU WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCT CAN NOT BE FIXED - WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> With my old dryer, I would twist the attachment constantly...</li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet, makes my hair feel so soft, and dries my hair faster than any hairdryer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer gave just enough heat to dry my hair fastly and did not frizz my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair also has less static and the dryer is substantially quieter than even a previous \\&quot;extra quiet\\&quot; model.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz.</li>
            <li> But it dries my nieces hair much faster than other dryers.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, really, is that the attachment \\&quot;nozzle\\&quot; gets really hot</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much quiter than the average blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> i cannot say that i find it to be a whole lot different from other dryers i have owned</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time a few days ago and I was amazed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only blowing cool air now, hard to believe it&#x27;s a salon dryer.</li>
            <li> With my old Revlon it took me 20 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go in less time.  </li>
            <li> When I wash my hair, blow drying only got my hair dry enough to put in a pony tail, then I would wait until the next day for my hair to be completely dry before I would use the flat iron, or hot comb to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how, but it makes your hair smoother and it seems to dry it so much quicker than any other dryer we&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..</li>
            <li> I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it&#x27;s a little more  heavy than other blow dryers.....</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and this dryer dries my hair fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> (my other dryer was incredibly loud).</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer so much, I am afraid to show it to one of my dearest friends for fear of hurting her feelings, as she just got a new pink CHI hair dryer for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s, my hair is thick, but bleached and permed,so it&#x27;s pretty fragile.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer actualy got my hair dry enough to flat iron in the same day!!</li>
            <li> Long cord  Quiet    </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use my flat iron to blend it in with my straitened hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is also really soft and getting less breakage.   </li>
            <li> The low airflow is designed that way for styling, in order to quickly dry hair in the shape you created.  </li>
            <li> With other dryers my hair is left frizzy, but I can tell a big difference with this one.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little hard to grip sometimes when I&#x27;m using it--my thumb will hit the cool or on buttons.  </li>
            <li> I was worried before I got it that it wouldn&#x27;t have enough power to dry my hair because I have long hair that takes a while to dry.  </li>
            <li> Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> It has a long cord.  </li>
            <li> The one strange thing is I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere</li>
            <li> I dread washing my hair knowing how long it will take.  </li>
            <li> It is also light weight and have soft volume ( hate loud hair dryer )</li>
            <li> My hair is almost shoulder length, very textured and thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparently 1800 watts, but it feels like it&#x27;s half that.</li>
            <li> I quickly became frustrated by the amount of time it took to dry and style, so I looked into a high end flat iron (chi turbo).  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my hairstylist recommended I invest in a ceramic dryer, since I&#x27;ve generally avoided heat styling on my VERY bleached hair for fear of further damage.</li>
            <li> My other dryer was killing my scalp in that it was causing burns and constant flakes from drying me out.</li>
            <li> I noticed it is a bit different than other dryers:    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer a chore to blow dry my hair...</li>
            <li> I would normally dry my hair...</li>
            <li> but since there&#x27;s no speed setting to choose from, I&#x27;d be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for one week now and it takes about 8 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use ear plugs just to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter (10 years old) has chronic headaches and for obvious reasons has never liked me to dry her hair.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I am one of the few african american women that doesn&#x27;t use relaxers to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> whereas with my drugstore brand dryer, I felt like hair was just blowing randomly, even when I was really trying to direct it.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve always had to hold the dryer far away, which defeated the use of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for this product...</li>
            <li> It takes half the time to dry my hair and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> I spend a lot less time drying my hair now...and can hear the doorbell and phone ring while doing it! :O)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not high maintenance</li>
            <li> I find it a little more difficult to maneuver than my previous dryers, but all in all</li>
            <li> I use minimal product on my hair now with this dyer.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying another one a few months later.</li>
            <li> A few people said it was too big and that the on/off switch was positioned ackwardly.  </li>
            <li> Not powerful enough, airflow is just not strong enough  Switches are inconveniently located right where you hold the dryer!  </li>
            <li> I saw the difference after a few uses-my hair bacame sofer, significantly less frizzy with much more volume (I have thin wavy hair with very little volume).  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair that normally takes me 40-45 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> This thing isn&#x27;t the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li> It actually felt like it took longer than usual.</li>
            <li> The air flow is lower than all the other dryers I&#x27;ve ever had.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, within seconds of turning on this dryer, it got extremely hot and started smoking.</li>
            <li> Takes me half as long to dry my long thick hair now, and it&#x27;s not as frizzy either.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer took less than half the time to get my hair dry</li>
            <li> It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the &#x27;blow&#x27; action of it is really weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as exhuberant as some other reviewers, but I can&#x27;t really find anything wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference!  </li>
            <li> This product cut drying time by at least half, my hair was less frizzy, and I only had minimal hair loss while drying it.    </li>
            <li> The only negative thing i can say about it -- is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I am a person with naturally thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> i was skeptical, but after using this product,it dries my hair much faster and with less frizz</li>
            <li> If you have some money- put some down on this</li>
            <li> My hair....used the dryer as I was brushing my teeth and wiping down the counter</li>
            <li> It usually take me 15 min to dry it and with this Farouk is just 5 min</li>
            <li> so I hardly have to use the flat iron!.  </li>
            <li> The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar</li>
            <li> It dries hair in about half the time as others I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have to get it straghtened if I want less hassle in management.  </li>
            <li> , my hair was a bit less frizzy than with my previous ionic dryer.</li>
            <li> After drying her hair with the comb attachment is was softer and less frizzy.   </li>
            <li> It cuts my drying time in half and makes it</li>
            <li> The buttons are in odd positions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and have type 4A-4B hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that usually takes anywhere from 30 to 40  minutes to blow dry.....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s tight, so</li>
            <li> or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that i wish it had come with a diffuser!</li>
            <li> Not sure how much is due to the dryer.  </li>
            <li> It does get a little heavy after a while</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, coarse, and wavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s whisper quiet and dried my chemically treated frizzy hair in about 5 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> Heavy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this dryer heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> Just purchased this a few months ago but didn&#x27;t start using it until a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it heavy at all, although I&#x27;m a gym rat</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had too much trouble with that issue.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have trouble with them.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that usually takes an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> Overall, not too bad so far, but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with some of the negative things I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a cheaper, dumbed down version of a quality, more expensive Farouk product that has been released at a cheaper price so that the company has a range of affordable to higher-end priced products to widen their consumer base and profits.</li>
            <li> Having hard to manage, thick, curly hair requires a hair dryer that will not harm the hair &amp; yet can dry a thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is just about at the end of drying which takes only a few minutes the base of the dryer gets a little awkward and heavy but no other complains.   </li>
            <li> I usually spend 150 dollars on a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I am past the shoulder lenghth hair, which I relax so</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy and very thin hair.</li>
            <li> ( it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is blowing hard...</li>
            <li> but it made my hair feel hard and burned afterwards.  </li>
            <li> hair dryer one, which all were a big disappointment.   </li>
            <li> and it stopped working, it only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> THE DRYER ONLY BLEW OUT COLD AIR  </li>
            <li> No wonder it sucks.</li>
            <li> I think I understand the reason for some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> it is thick...</li>
            <li> I have waist length chemically straightened hair that is normally  thick course and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This thing is so bulky and heavy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again.</li>
            <li> When I read the previous reviews I was skeptical</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair this may work for you, but I have thick wavey hair and this dryer has no power or heat to style me.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer has 2 speed&#x27;s, slow and slower!  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to set it down.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product finding it performs about as well as a 20.00 dryer we keep in the guest bath.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.</li>
            <li> Did I receive the wrong hairdryer or something?</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that,</li>
            <li> So, needless to say the dryer will be returned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of anyone that uses that crazy comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> this one makes it very difficult to do so.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I&#x27;d be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way this hair dryer works on my hair - WAY less frizzies than my regular old hair dryer. The cord is extra long and the bright orange color is WOW. However, the unit is a bit heavier than what I&#x27;m used to.  Also, the location of the Hi, Low and Off button is such that I find myself accidentally changing the heat setting while in use. Otherwise, I love this produce and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just what you would expect for a $250 blow dryer!!! I work at a hair salon and have told all of the girls about this deal! The air is HOT HOT HOT, it dries my hair VERY quickly and my hair is no longer frizzy and a knotted mess after I blow dry it. It is SOOOOO QUIET which is exactly what I needed (my other dryer was incredibly loud). This dryer doesnt even sound like it  is on. It has a Low &amp; High, and 2 heat settings... its working great for me! I would HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a nice dryer.  It dries hair in about half the time as others I have used.  It would have been really nice if it had come with a diffuser though.  I can&#x27;t find a diffuser that fits this, so I have not gotten to use it on myself yet.  But it dries my nieces hair much faster than other dryers.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical, but after using this product,it dries my hair much faster and with less frizz</li>
            <li> This dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about, but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair, so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake.  That in itself is so frustrating that I can&#x27;t see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer. I have very thick, wavy hair that normally takes me 40-45 minutes to dry. Now, I have cut my drying time to 15-20 minutes. Unbelievable! It&#x27;s no longer a chore to blow dry my hair...I look forward to it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my hairstylist recommended I invest in a ceramic dryer, since I&#x27;ve generally avoided heat styling on my VERY bleached hair for fear of further damage. This dryer has won me over completely. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft - again, having chemically treated, porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy. Not so with Deep Brilliance! I think it&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price - $40 is a LOT cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models I&#x27;ve looked into. For someone with damaged hair needing TLC, this is awesome. I can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish I get just from the dryer. I didn&#x27;t find myself wanting \\&quot;more power,\\&quot; as some reviewers have mentioned, but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick.  The only negatives I can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly (thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use), and perhaps for someone with very thick hair, 1300 watts won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy and very thin hair. It usually take me 15 min to dry it and with this Farouk is just 5 min w minimum frizz!  I used many cheap (under $40) hair dryer one, which all were a big disappointment.   I bought this Orange Farouck 2 months ago and I am very happy w it.  To begin with the price was wonderful ( 250.00 actual price and I bought $45.00 on Amazon). It is also light weight and have soft volume ( hate loud hair dryer ) and it dries my hair in 5 minutes. If this dryer had  shorter cord or had retractable Cord I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! I&#x27;ll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again. This one is quieter and even though it doesn&#x27;t blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well. My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days. She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it. A great deal too!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for \\&quot;low\\&quot; on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there&#x27;s no speed setting to choose from, I&#x27;d be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there&#x27;s not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn&#x27;t the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It&#x27;s overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer today and just had to immediately try it. Let me tell you, it was definitely worth what I paid--probably way more! My hairdresser has a Chi Professional dryer and she hasn&#x27;t ever been fully satisfied with it. When I mentioned to her that I was looking to get a Chi like hers, she encouraged me to shop around and look at the different ones available. When I stumbled upon this one, I was so excited. My hair is very thick, coarse, and wavy. I have to straighten it with a Chi iron after blowdrying. My other dryer was killing my scalp in that it was causing burns and constant flakes from drying me out. This dryer--even after the 1st use--was so much better! It worked quickly, quietly, and gently. TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many hairdryers over the years...they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death.  None has been anything to get excited about.  I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it&#x27;s not a decorative accessory. The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  I have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time.  I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  It still provides plenty of heat to set the curve, but the air velocity doesn&#x27;t blow my hair off the brush.  My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> This dryer has less power than my regular dryer but dries quicker and without the frizzies - love it!</li>
            <li> This was so so I like the drying but when i use the comb it always slips off with every 4 to 5 combings</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the hair dryer very much when it worked! I have very curly hair and it used to dry my hair very fast with a nice shine and no frizz.I used it for maybe 10 times in a yr and it stopped working, it only blows cold air. I have had a conair hair dryer that I bought for $25.00 5 yrs ago and it still works.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, I love my Farouk D.B. Hair Dryer!  As a mom I don&#x27;t have hours to style my hair and feel good... but now with this flat iron (and I also got the Farouk Deep Brilliance Flat Iron) I can straighten/style my hair in 20 min (I have just over the shoulder length hair that&#x27;s wavy).    I want to add, I first learnt about Farouk Chi products from my sister who got her flat iron and hair dryer as a gift from a friend who&#x27;s hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron/hair dryer but packaged as \\&quot;Deep Brilliance\\&quot; line.  Same great product different packaging and on sale!</li>
            <li> Love this item.    Very Quiet    You will Love it  :-)</li>
            <li> i originally ordered the farouk deep brilliance because my old conair hair dryer finally went to hair appliance heaven.  this model was among the best reviewed and it was definitely the most affordable.       i cannot say that i find it to be a whole lot different from other dryers i have owned but i feel like it dries a bit faster so it does save me time.  my only complaint is that i wish it had come with a diffuser!</li>
            <li> I have one other highend hair dryer and I love it! So I bought this one after reading reviews.  I was not happy with the product finding it performs about as well as a 20.00 dryer we keep in the guest bath.  Maybe it was defective, I did return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Long cord  Quiet    Cons:  Not powerful enough, airflow is just not strong enough  Switches are inconveniently located right where you hold the dryer!  Not enough heating/power options  Heavy</li>
            <li> THis is a super blow dryer.  It it quiet, has a great cooling feature, and helps create the style you are trying to schieve...versus fighting you.   My last purchase of a quality hairdryer was a T2 and I love this one even more.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair quickly with no frizz. I love it and love the color. The only thing that might make it better is if the output was a lighter higher/harder, but it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer in hopes that it would do a better job than my old Revlon Ceramic Ion dryer. My hair is almost shoulder length, very textured and thick.  With my old Revlon it took me 20 minutes to dry my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for one week now and it takes about 8 minutes to dry my hair. While it dries hair quickly,  it&#x27;s extremely gently and leaves my hair softer and more manageable than it has been in a very long time. I&#x27;m thrilled with its performance and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Ok, here is a fat-free review:    I am a person with naturally thick, coarse hair.  I have to get it straghtened if I want less hassle in management.  When the blowdryer isn&#x27;t a great one, my hair  is more poofy and frizzy, making it difficult to manage.  Within MINUTES of turning this quiet little thing on (compared to the many many blowdryers I&#x27;ve used in life) and putting it to my hair it was shiny, soft and professionally straight!  This number is well worth the money.  I know some people didn&#x27;t have a good time with their dryer, but I can attest to the many who have.  If you have some money- put some down on this you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for a great price. You&#x27;ll have to pay the same for a high end regular hair dryer at a drug store or department store.  It gets fairly hot, and is quiet.  It is heavier than a normal dryer.</li>
            <li> Better that I expected always used a comb dryer,I am a changed person no more combs for me</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. Whisper quite and dries hair super fast with less frizz. Well worth the money would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I wanted to dry my highlighted, curly, longish hair as quickly and as frizz-free as possible.  I have been really satisfied with this dryer.  I don&#x27;t have to go over all of it with a straightening iron anymore to eliminate kinks and frizz.  I now just have to touch it up and I&#x27;m ready to go in less time.  My hair is also really soft and getting less breakage.   It did take some getting used to that the dryer has only two settings plus  a cool shot.  I don&#x27;t find this dryer heavy at all.  It is much lighter than the conair it replaced. The cool shot works really well, it shoots cool air even after the dryer has been going for a while. It didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser either, so i picked up a universal one at a beauty supply.  This dryer also has a nice long cord.  I tried out a $135.  Chi and this dryer is identical to it.  Excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this a few months ago but didn&#x27;t start using it until a few weeks ago.  It&#x27;s only blowing cool air now, hard to believe it&#x27;s a salon dryer. While it worked, it worked well but I can&#x27;t return it now and it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I have frizzy hair and live in a humid climate.  I had no idea a quality dryer could help with these issues.  My life has changed since I started using the Chi iron to straighten my hair, and with this dryer I didn&#x27;t even need the iron.  This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODCUT ONLINE - IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THIS PRODUCT FAROUK WILL NOT FIX IT.  THEY WILL TAKE YOUR SHIPPING MONEY AND RETURN THE DRYER BACK TO YOU WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCT CAN NOT BE FIXED - WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT THE DRYER ONLY BLEW OUT COLD AIR  THIS IS A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION AND THEY WONT FIX IT FOR ME</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not high maintenance but I really like the dryer except that it is a litte heavy and it&#x27;s not as quiet as I anticipated from the reviews. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and worth $40...I just can&#x27;t pay more than that for something that I don&#x27;t have time for. It would be great for people with longer, thicker, or even curly hair. My hair is straight as can be, and it does make a difference in the texture of the hair regardless. In fact, my mom wants one now and she has short hair...she says her hair stayed up all day compared to using a different hair dryer. This dryer is worth the investment and I plan on keeping it for years :)</li>
            <li> This blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price! I used it and it was SO quiet I couldnt believe it. It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting. I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft. I recommend this dryer. Its not a looker but it gets the job done. Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all. The comb attachment is great also.</li>
            <li> LOVED this hair dryer! Didn&#x27;t even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I figured my old one would break eventually. I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it. WOW! I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was! My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz. I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying. But with this dryer, I don&#x27;t need to use anything! My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty. It dries faster than my old one and it&#x27;s quieter (big plus since my baby&#x27;s bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)</li>
            <li> IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS MY CHI DRYER.THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER. IM A HAIRDRESSER AND EVERYONE I WORK WITH WAS INTERSTED IN IT WHEN THEY SAW THE COLOR OF IT.IT REALLY WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.</li>
            <li> Pros:  ceramic heating component  lightweight  quiet    Cons:  the &#x27;blow&#x27; component isn&#x27;t all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that&#x27;s probably partly why it&#x27;s so light)  obnoxious color    This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power. I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews. It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the &#x27;blow&#x27; action of it is really weak. To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting. Because there isn&#x27;t a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I&#x27;d really like it to be and I worry about damaging my hair... I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I&#x27;ve purchased this blow drier. I&#x27;m going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer. It&#x27;s ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it I noticed immediately that it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was drying my hair faster. It actually felt like it took longer than usual. So I went back to Amazon to search for product specifics and couldn&#x27;t find the wattage for this dryer anywhere. Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a \\&quot;powerful  1300 watts.\\&quot; POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it&#x27;s good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; they got. No way would I ever pay $268 for this dryer. The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!</li>
            <li> This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he&#x27;s SO jealous!  Takes me half as long to dry my long thick hair now, and it&#x27;s not as frizzy either.  GREAT dryer!  OH, and it&#x27;s SO quiet too, I don&#x27;t have to worry about waking anyone in the next room when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this blow dryer.  I have had blow dryers before which I have purchased at Target or Walgreens but when my current one broke I thought I would try a more expensive one.  I was even happier to get a more expensive one at a great price.  This dryer dries the hair fast without frizzing it out.  The hair dries soft and maintains shine.  My hair felt so much more silkier than with my other blow dryer.  The dyer is also light weight which is a plus.  I now know it pays to get a more expensive model.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> It takes half the time to dry my hair and is very quiet.  I like the fact that you can clean the air filter as apposed to my previous hair dryers! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just received this item and started using it in my salon.  The price has gone up since I ordered it, but my co-workers are watching for it to lower again.  Everyone that has borrowed it LOVES it.  The only negative thing i can say about it -- is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a diffuser. I don&#x27;t know of anyone that uses that crazy comb attachment.  I usually spend 150 dollars on a hairdryer.  So far, so good with this one.  ( it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is blowing hard... but, it dries quickly )</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that usually takes anywhere from 30 to 40  minutes to blow dry.....with this blow dryer it was cut to 15 minutes!  Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..it&#x27;s much quiter than the average blow dryer.  I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon. The only draw back is that it&#x27;s a little more  heavy than other blow dryers.....but I figure that&#x27;s good for my arms!  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> Love it, and pleased that it is light wieght, and dried my hair in a 1/2 hour instead of the usual 1 hr...I am past the shoulder lenghth hair, which I relax so it is thick...love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This dryer seems to work well, although I guess I&#x27;m used to smaller, more compact dryers.  I find it a little more difficult to maneuver than my previous dryers, but all in all it&#x27;s not too bad.  It seems a little hard to grip sometimes when I&#x27;m using it--my thumb will hit the cool or on buttons.  Overall, not too bad so far, but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to give this hair dryer a chance since it was such a great price. I have to say that it&#x27;s lighter then the one I had before and it&#x27;s super quiet and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use ear plugs just to dry my hair. It dries my hair quickly. I thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn&#x27;t make a difference. I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer and I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this blow dryer.  It was made by Farouk the makers of Chi so I was pretty confident this would be a well made product.  It is pretty quiet and dries my naturally curly afro-american hair quickly.  I use the comb attachment and that gets my hair straight enough to flat iron.  The only problem is just about at the end of drying which takes only a few minutes the base of the dryer gets a little awkward and heavy but no other complains.   Worth the money I spent.  Excellent bargain.  Thanks Amazon.com!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have owned this dryer for about two weeks.  For the first time I can get my hair smooth like my stylist does.  With other dryers my hair is left frizzy, but I can tell a big difference with this one.  The price is great for a quality dryer.  The air output is sufficient for me, and I am fine with the two heat settings.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of dryers. Although the opening is small, this dries my hair, even right out of the shower, in less than half the time of the old dryers (most Conair or Revlon). My hair also has less static and the dryer is substantially quieter than even a previous \\&quot;extra quiet\\&quot; model. I don&#x27;t find it heavy at all, although I&#x27;m a gym rat so maybe that&#x27;s a factor.</li>
            <li> If you want a high end hair dryer for the right price, you&#x27;ve come to the right place! I was looking into Chi hairdryers ($200-$300) when I found this one by Farouk. I decided to go ahead and try it out, and I love it! The comb attachment is my favorite part - it kind of massages my head while I use it and it makes my hair less frizzy (and that&#x27;s saying something since I live in Texas!). The nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout. It&#x27;s just a great hair dryer and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Oh My Gosh...This hair dryer is So perfect.  I opened the box the night it arrived at my door.  Took out my new hairdryer, plugged it in, and WoW!  You could just Feel the Power, Yet So Quiet, But So Strong!  It heated up immediated.  It&#x27;s very well made of high quality materials. Take it from me, I am one of the biggest sceptics you could ever meet.  I love this hair dryer so much, I am afraid to show it to one of my dearest friends for fear of hurting her feelings, as she just got a new pink CHI hair dryer for Christmas.  Personally, I do believe this is the same Exact hair dryer, it just doesn&#x27;t have CHI printed on the side of it.  Who doesn&#x27;t love Orange...Go Illini.  Thanks again Amazon for carrying such High Quality Products...I am thrilled that I have found you.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned. I have waist length chemically straightened hair that is normally  thick course and curly hair. I have about 5 inches of curly re-growth and I don&#x27;t need to use my flat iron to blend it in with my straitened hair. This dryer dries super fast and leaves hair soft and less frizzy. Very quie too. I use minimal product on my hair now with this dyer. Well worth the money. I&#x27;m buying one as a back up and have recommended it to many of my friends. Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews for this hairdryer. Did I receive the wrong hairdryer or something? For starters, how can the product description say \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot;??? This thing is so bulky and heavy!! And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s apparently 1800 watts, but it feels like it&#x27;s half that. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because for one, it&#x27;s incredibly quiet and I&#x27;ve never heard a dryer this quiet and two, my hair was a bit less frizzy than with my previous ionic dryer. But these two pros aren&#x27;t worth the cons. I don&#x27;t see anything special about this dryer and my mother&#x27;s 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    Also, has anyone done any research on this product? Google it. Have you noticed that it isn&#x27;t sold in any salons, on the Farouk website, or anywhere else where you can see it&#x27;s \\&quot;original $259.95\\&quot; price?? I believe this is a cheaper, dumbed down version of a quality, more expensive Farouk product that has been released at a cheaper price so that the company has a range of affordable to higher-end priced products to widen their consumer base and profits. Nothing wrong with that, but I&#x27;m just trying to say that this definitely isn&#x27;t some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer. The whole \\&quot;deep brilliance\\&quot; line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, \\&quot;originally higher priced\\&quot; items. I dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was \\&quot;originally $259.95\\&quot; or even for any other price. I sure as hell couldn&#x27;t find it.     Try the hairdryer for yourself, this is just my two cents.</li>
            <li> This is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price.  After my last cheap one stopped working, I saw this and figured I would splurge.    Why I am happy...  It is light and quiet.  It dries hair quickly.  It has a long cord.  The comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on. It is BRIGHT orange so you will not lose it ;)    Both myself and DD have fizzy hair.  After drying her hair with the comb attachment is was softer and less frizzy.   The result was wow.    My hair....used the dryer as I was brushing my teeth and wiping down the counter so it still came out frizzy but when I used my CHI iron on it, the process was quicker and my hair was smoother.      This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Our family needed a new hair dryer when our hair dryer stopped working.  My daughter (10 years old) has chronic headaches and for obvious reasons has never liked me to dry her hair.  I purchased this dryer after reading such great reviews, but still wondered what could be so great about a hair dryer.  We love it! I don&#x27;t understand how, but it makes your hair smoother and it seems to dry it so much quicker than any other dryer we&#x27;ve had.  The best part, my daughter now just dries her own hair with it for two reasons.  It comes with a built in comb that glides through her hair as she dries it and it is much quieter than our last dryer.  I recommend it for all hair styles!</li>
            <li> I am one of the few african american women that doesn&#x27;t use relaxers to straighten my hair. I also don&#x27;t have \\&quot;good\\&quot; hair. My hair is long, thick and coarse. When I wash my hair, blow drying only got my hair dry enough to put in a pony tail, then I would wait until the next day for my hair to be completely dry before I would use the flat iron, or hot comb to straighten it. This hair dryer actualy got my hair dry enough to flat iron in the same day!! The comb on the end of the dryer didn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair and pull out!! It also didn&#x27;t take as long to straighten my hair because it was almost straight with the hair dryer! This was the best investment I have ever made for a hair care product!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is wonderful!  I was worried before I got it that it wouldn&#x27;t have enough power to dry my hair because I have long hair that takes a while to dry.  Once I recieved it and tried it out I fell completely in love with it.  It is the most quiet hair dryer that I have owned, it is easy to take the filter out to clean, it doesn&#x27;t eat my hair when it is too close to my head, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair but the best thing is that it gets hot enough to dry my hair and has enough power to get the job done quickly. It does get a little heavy after a while but what hair dryer of that size doesn&#x27;t?  The on/off buttons can be switched easily while using if held directly by the buttons but I haven&#x27;t had too much trouble with that issue.</li>
            <li> I never realized a hair dryer could actually make your hair feel soft! This one does that and dries my hair in 2 seconds. Okay - maybe not 2 seconds, but it really is fast.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical when i purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews but it didn&#x27;t dissapoint me. I saw the difference after a few uses-my hair bacame sofer, significantly less frizzy with much more volume (I have thin wavy hair with very little volume).  People who haven&#x27;t seen me started commenting on how much nicer and fuller my hair has been looking. I&#x27;ve noticed that it has much more volume now even when i don&#x27;t use volumizing products on it.  I don&#x27;t really use the attachments, they&#x27;re a bit too bulky for my taste. Don&#x27;t have any problems with the buttons being in my way.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked better than I expected.  I have long hair that easily gets frizzed from overdrying.  This hair dryer gave just enough heat to dry my hair fastly and did not frizz my hair.  This hair dryer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I just got this and I started to use it and I LOVE IT!!!!! It&#x27;s whisper quiet and dried my chemically treated frizzy hair in about 5 minutes!!! It is a styling tool as well and I used both the comb and the anion attachment.I live in hot and humid South Texas and it leaves my hair soft,smooth and silky WELL worth waiting for!!!!</li>
            <li> great dryer,quite, does the job. the best dryer i have ever used. my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work.</li>
            <li> I am generally pretty cheap when it comes to beauty products, but I recently decided to let my wavy hair grow long.  I quickly became frustrated by the amount of time it took to dry and style, so I looked into a high end flat iron (chi turbo).  I saw this on sale for an AMAZING price, and decided to add it to my order.  No regrets here!  It cuts my drying time in half and makes it so I hardly have to use the flat iron!.  I can&#x27;t believe how much difference a high quality blow dryer makes.  I feel like I am really in control, whereas with my drugstore brand dryer, I felt like hair was just blowing randomly, even when I was really trying to direct it.  It heats up nicely (can get too hot) and straightens beautifully.  My only complaint, really, is that the attachment \\&quot;nozzle\\&quot; gets really hot and it&#x27;s tight, so you can&#x27;t move it around easily in the middle of styling.  With my old dryer, I would twist the attachment constantly...this one makes it very difficult to do so.  Even my husband loves this thing!  Again, you won&#x27;t regret this one!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight however it is very loud and it is not as powerful as i thought. I ended up buying another one a few months later.</li>
            <li> The Farouk Deep Brilliance Professional Hair Dryer works excellent on hard to dry hair--something I know all about!  This hair dryer is top notch &amp; is very reasonable in price in comparison to other top notch hair dryers.  Having hard to manage, thick, curly hair requires a hair dryer that will not harm the hair &amp; yet can dry a thick head of hair.  This product is just the thing for those with thick hair which is hard to control &amp; wanting great drying results.  I recommend this to everyone looking for a very good hair dryer at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This is buy far the best hair dryer ever! I have thick curly hair that usually takes an hour to dry. This hair dryer took less than half the time to get my hair dry</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this hairdryer. It is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I bought this hairdryer.  It is extremely quiet, makes my hair feel so soft, and dries my hair faster than any hairdryer I have ever used.  I have to disagree with some of the negative things I read in other reviews.  A few people said it was too big and that the on/off switch was positioned ackwardly.  It is larger than most hairdryers...but very light weight.  When I first starting using it, I would accidentally hit the on/off switch.  It only took a few times to get used to using it and that doesn&#x27;t happen any more.  This purchase was worth the money.  When I first turned it on and heard how quiet it was...I thought...what a joke this thing isn&#x27;t going to work.  I spend a lot less time drying my hair now...and can hear the doorbell and phone ring while doing it! :O)</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  When I read the previous reviews I was skeptical but I have heard really good things about this brand so tried it.  This hair dryer is very quiet and it dries very quickly.  I have thick hair and my old dryer was very loud and it got very hot but it made my hair feel hard and burned afterwards.  This one leaves my hair feeling very soft and manageable.  I love this hair dryer.  The buttons are in odd positions but I love the dryer anyway.</li>
            <li> This dryer is perfectly adequate.  I&#x27;m not as exhuberant as some other reviewers, but I can&#x27;t really find anything wrong with it.  Size and weight are fine.  Noise level is fine.  I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot and I don&#x27;t have trouble with them.  I don&#x27;t think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  Not sure how much is due to the dryer.  The one strange thing is I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that said how many watts it has, and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  For $40, its fine.  Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I&#x27;d be disappointed.  I&#x27;ve never used the more expensive models though so I don&#x27;t know if they are any different.</li>
            <li> I noticed it is a bit different than other dryers:    1) The heat is noticeably very hot and dry.  The very nice thing is that it did not develop the burned plastic smell that I&#x27;ve often gotten with other ceramic dryers.    2) The air flow is lower than all the other dryers I&#x27;ve ever had.    I think I understand the reason for some of the negative reviews. The low airflow is designed that way for styling, in order to quickly dry hair in the shape you created.  A high air-flow dryer would blow everything away.  In the past, I&#x27;ve always had to hold the dryer far away, which defeated the use of the dryer.  With this dryer, I can hold it really close to my hair and keep it there.    Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is so shiny and soft afterwards. I also love the color too. Great product!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference!  This one does.  Hair feels amazing and it&#x27;s incredibly fast.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  I am in my 50&#x27;s, my hair is thick, but bleached and permed,so it&#x27;s pretty fragile.  This product cut drying time by at least half, my hair was less frizzy, and I only had minimal hair loss while drying it.    I didn&#x27;t take this dryer with me on my last trip and used the one at the hotel.  Boy, was that a mistake!  [[ASIN:B001AY1874 Farouk Deep Brilliance Orange Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has 2 speed&#x27;s, slow and slower!  It takes forever to dry hair.  Instead of looking forward to getting ready I dread washing my hair knowing how long it will take.  I have had this dryer for 1 month now and am looking for a new one.  If you have thin hair this may work for you, but I have thick wavey hair and this dryer has no power or heat to style me.  I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for this product...this is no salon dryer!! Very disappointed :(  Try hot tools ceramic hair dryer for @ the same price (amazon has none in stock at the moment) but it is an awesome dryer worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive my new dryer.  I had hopes that I had found a great dryer for a fraction of the price.  Unfortunately, within seconds of turning on this dryer, it got extremely hot and started smoking. YIKES!  The attachment was so hot I was afraid to set it down.  So, needless to say the dryer will be returned.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time a few days ago and I was amazed. I have the Babyliss Thermal Ionic Dryer, which I thought was really good. But this one is much, much better. I&#x27;m black and have type 4A-4B hair. I used the comb attachment and used it on high, and my hair came out almost like it was flat-ironed. My roots were as straight as they are when my hair is newly relaxed. It&#x27;s much lighter than the Babyliss. The wattage on the Babyliss is 2000 and the wattage on this is only 1300. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough, it was plenty, and the lower wattage made it quieter to run.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and this dryer dries my hair fairly quickly.  It&#x27;s quiet and very light wait.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional Hair Dryer and the best one I have ever owned.  It is everything that was advertised and is light and easy to use.  I have recommended it to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer gets really, really hot. It&#x27;s a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> very high quality product.  it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.</li>
