            <li>This is great dental adhesive.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT ALSO.  </li>
            <li>Great price and quality.</li>
            <li>I was a good price for the amount and shipping time was great.</li>
            <li>most excellent tooth goo.</li>
            <li>and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li>This one is better than most, but not quite the ideal fix.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the plate off at the end of the day very easily either.</li>
            <li>I like polident better.</li>
            <li>The woman I take care of seems to love it.  </li>
            <li>Well .. none of this stuff is outstanding ...</li>
            <li>Fixodent is MUCH better than Poly-grip though.</li>
            <li>Crappy fitting dentures...</li>
            <li>The price is also better at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Or is it the dentures that after spending lots of cash, here and there, we have yet to find the ideal fit for big mama.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few years and have found it excellent.</li>
            <li>With this way you have double holding power which is nice if you have a nice meal.</li>
            <li>fixodent fresh is exactly what i ordered, cost a lot more than walmart, but was a lot easier to buy from amazon</li>
            <li>It certainly shuts the window in friendly smiles, so when teeth are gone, dentures must be.</li>
            <li>The mint really does help keep your mouth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>Once a day with very minimum application</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are looking for a denture adhesive that is strong and works all day long.</li>
            <li>unfortunately I sometimes forget it at the market so having it automaticly coming to my home without thought is amazing!</li>
            <li>She is not easily impressed, so i take it as a good sign for the products effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described and works as expected.</li>
            <li>It has a slight fresh mint taste, and holds throughout the day.</li>
            <li>As someone who has witnessed for far too long the minuses of wearing dentures, and the constant struggle for them to stay in place, I have yet to find one adhesive that can fulfill that tall order.</li>

            <li> It works, just as it always has....  No complaints.</li>
            <li> fixodent fresh is exactly what i ordered, cost a lot more than walmart, but was a lot easier to buy from amazon</li>
            <li> I like polident better.</li>

            <li> Very good product. I would recommend it.</li>

            <li> Works great- never any problems or defects with Fixodent. Will always use product when needed. Best brand name on the market.</li>
            <li> This is great dental adhesive. It keeps my partial in place all day. The mint really does help keep your mouth feel cleaner.</li>

            <li> My husband says this product contains zinc and irritates his gums. Does not want to purchase again.</li>
            <li> The woman I take care of seems to love it.  She is not easily impressed, so i take it as a good sign for the products effectiveness.  Any questions, please ask...  I will find out.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT ALSO.  ESPECIALLY THE MINT FLAVOR.</li>
            <li> As someone who has witnessed for far too long the minuses of wearing dentures, and the constant struggle for them to stay in place, I have yet to find one adhesive that can fulfill that tall order. This one is better than most, but not quite the ideal fix. Or is it the dentures that after spending lots of cash, here and there, we have yet to find the ideal fit for big mama. Well, life goes on, with or without test, but I do agree that not wearing at least some kind of dentures makes for a very sad image, somewhere between uncared and distasteful. It certainly shuts the window in friendly smiles, so when teeth are gone, dentures must be. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> Well .. none of this stuff is outstanding ... but then, neither are dentures.  Fixodent is MUCH better than Poly-grip though.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!!!  This out of all fixodents seems to work best. However i spread a thin layer over whole ridge and palette and let dentyres sit for 5  Mins before you swish your mouth with water and insert dentures. I also gave applied a thin layer and sprized with a spray bottle and then put layer of the fixodent powder, sprize very lighly again, let sit for 10 mins and then inserted denture.

            <li> great product - great price - great seller</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> All as I would have expected.  No surprises!  Only con is the product is not zinc-free, which for some reason I thought it was.</li>
            <li> Crappy fitting dentures... most excellent tooth goo.</li>
            <li> works well to hold my parcial in place</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and have found it excellent. Once a day with very minimum application and it is good to go.  Each tube lasts for over a month and the price is low.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little help tightening their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest Amazon as the place to buy, as the drugstores do not always carry the one labeled \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot;.  I ordered a few which will last me several months. The price is also better at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too slimy and gooey. Does not work as well as Polygrip. Slides out from underneath plates.</li>
