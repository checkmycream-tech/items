            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>product did a better job for 1/10th the price</li>
            <li>I love Schwarzkopf hair products - specifically those designed for volume.</li>
            <li>Used sparingly, it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in either humid or dry weather.</li>
            <li>Not stiff, great smell.</li>
            <li>Light &amp; easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling light and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The clear product is so much superior.</li>
            <li>It feels like cheap hair gel and not the original product.</li>
            <li>Works great for hair that is basically flat.</li>
            <li>and I remain a loyal fan.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair and this product gave me volume that i wanted.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair and this really adds volume and thickness without weighing my hair done.</li>
            <li>The original was clear and easy to apply - unlike this product.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>and it arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>The place I ordered it from sent the exact product i wanted</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it promises it will do.</li>
            <li>Once I tried it I really wanted to keep it for myself!</li>
            <li>After trying pretty much every thickening spray gel, serum, etc I have found one I have settled with.</li>
            <li>Definitely volumizes and plumps fine hair up.</li>
            <li>It really does add volume, body and shine.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much volume from this at all</li>
            <li>Make my hair sticky, and don&#x27;t give much volume.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have hair with volume and that looks thicker</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I mix it with Osis soft lube for a longer lasting bouncy curl.  </li>
            <li>Just use a small  amount and blow dry and volume is increased nicely; I would recommend for light volume&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>Great for thin fine hair and priced less than the store.</li>
            <li>also highly -- HIGHLY -- recommend their OSIS</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for last 2 years and this bottle came filled with clear serum where it should be white.</li>
            <li>Volumizing products usually leave my hair feeling stiff and producty, but this one is great, still leaving my hair soft, but with some volume.</li>
            <li>I have never tried this exact product, but have used other products form the Osis family.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered the clear formula with the same product name, package, and details.</li>
            <li>A little heavy for my fine, straight, grey hair.</li>
            <li>I can apply it after towel drying my hair, let it dry naturally, and go!</li>
            <li>I have thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my mom who has fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> Apply half a dime size amount to mainly  the roots and dry or air dry for all day results.  </li>

            <li> Little bit goes a long way on short hair.</li>

            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> makes hair oily and heavy</li>
            <li> Not too stiff - recommended my hair sylist</li>
            <li> Instead, I received a thick, milky colored substance that leaves my hair sticky, no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li> I had been using a very expensive product to help my newly thinning hair look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but my hair continued very very limp!!  </li>

            <li> I have never tried this exact product, but have used other products form the Osis family.  I have straight fine hair and this product gave me volume that i wanted. Volumizing products usually leave my hair feeling stiff and producty, but this one is great, still leaving my hair soft, but with some volume. The place I ordered it from sent the exact product i wanted and it arrived right on time. thanks!</li>
            <li> I used this before and liked it a lot. This one says it&#x27;s the same but it&#x27;s not. Thick and gooey, it left my hair sticky. The label, description, etc. were the same but the product wasn&#x27;t. The original was clear and easy to apply - unlike this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Little bit goes a long way on short hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way......great for volume.</li>

            <li> I had ordered the clear formula with the same product name, package, and details. Instead, I received a thick, milky colored substance that leaves my hair sticky, no matter how little I use. The clear product is so much superior. I felt as if it were a bait and switch.</li>
            <li> NOT ANYTHING GREAT, I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO STICKY AND AM NOT USING IT. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Hair seems fuller and has great shine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many brands and am glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It really does add volume, body and shine.  I can apply it after towel drying my hair, let it dry naturally, and go!</li>

            <li> makes hair oily and heavy</li>
            <li> Gives body to the roots of my short limp hair.  The lift lasts all day and the next day too.  Apply half a dime size amount to mainly  the roots and dry or air dry for all day results.  Schwarzkopf products were recommended to me by my stylist years ago and I remain a loyal fan.  thanks.</li>
            <li> Seems different than the bottles I bought in the store. No hold whatsoever.</li>
            <li> great product.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for my fine, straight, grey hair. Used sparingly, it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in either humid or dry weather. It keeps my style whether I blow dry or allow hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. After trying pretty much every thickening spray gel, serum, etc I have found one I have settled with. Definitely volumizes and plumps fine hair up. Seems to keep hair from getting too dry/flyaway/staticky too.</li>
            <li> Adds body to hair, but it is a little heavy. I have very thin hair and I think it just weights it down by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been using Schwarzkopf Osis products for many years and have always been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I had been using a very expensive product to help my newly thinning hair look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;This product did a better job for 1/10th the price</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have fine wavy hair and this really adds volume and thickness without weighing my hair done. Worth it</li>
            <li> Try this - it will change the way you hair looks and feels!</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby fine hair.  This product makes my hair look full and gives great body.  Best product for my hair!</li>
            <li> This is not Schwarzkopf Body Me.  It is a knock off.  It is not a cream.  It is a gel.  Schwarzkopf does not make a gel.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Works great for hair that is basically flat.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much volume from this at all</li>
            <li> Make my hair sticky, and don&#x27;t give much volume.</li>
            <li> Great product! It gives my hair instant volume. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have hair with volume and that looks thicker</li>
            <li> Light &amp; easy to apply.  I like the lightness &amp; fullness it has on my hair.  Not too stiff - recommended my hair sylist</li>
            <li> Great for thin fine hair and priced less than the store.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!  I love this product, I mix it with Osis soft lube for a longer lasting bouncy curl.  Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> I love Schwarzkopf hair products - specifically those designed for volume. I have lots of hair, it&#x27;s just very fine. This cream is perfect for adding all-over volume. Now that I&#x27;ve found it, I will continue to use it - it does exactly what it promises it will do. I hate the feeling of having gunk in my hair. This leaves my hair feeling light and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly -- HIGHLY -- recommend their OSIS Dust It powder. It is a miracle worker!! You simply tap a small amount of the powder to your part and/or crown, rub it into the roots, and you get instant, there-til-you-wash-it-out mega lift. It&#x27;s a 10 second process that will enhance your hairstyle. It&#x27;s my hair product workhorse!!</li>
            <li> Not stiff, great smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent light body! I got this for my mom who has fine, thin hair. It made a noticeable difference for her. Once I tried it I really wanted to keep it for myself!</li>
            <li> Good lightweight volumizer.Just use a small  amount and blow dry and volume is increased nicely; I would recommend for light volume&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Osis Body Me did not meet my expectations.  I followed the instructions but my hair continued very very limp!!  I think I should have bought the stronger one!!  I need to say that all other Schwarzkopf products that I bought until today met my expectations!!</li>
