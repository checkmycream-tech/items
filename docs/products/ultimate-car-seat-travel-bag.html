            <li>Happy travels!</li>
            <li>So all in all, a wonderful concept in function</li>
            <li>this bag fits it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this bag about a year ago and it worked perfect for our Chicco Keyfit30 Infant car seat.  </li>
            <li>and it fits this travel bag perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>The best way to put the car seat into the backpack</li>
            <li>Great travel bag - fits our Britax perfectly!  </li>
            <li>We checked our carseat and the bag held up great.  </li>
            <li>BUT it seems great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy with this purchase and will update if anything changes.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>greatly appreciate the backpack straps, makes it a lot easier to lug</li>
            <li>The weight is surprisingly well distributed.  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the good points that we like about this car seat travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Very glad that we purchased this bag for the trip.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it for many years!</li>
            <li>This car seat bag is amazing.</li>
            <li>This bag nicely protected the car seat when it was checked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is really nice.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to get the car seat in and out of the bag.  </li>
            <li>I found the best way to get the car seat into the bag was to recline the seat to the 2nd position and to put the head rest up.</li>
            <li>Most airlines don&#x27;t provide plastic bags anymore for car seats, so I wanted to protect the bag from damage from baggage handling.</li>
            <li>If it was made of better quality fabric, the price would reflect it.</li>
            <li>I just received this and am pleased with how my Safety 1st</li>
            <li>We put more items in like diapers, blankets, clothes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We were able to move things around and into these bags...</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It can hold a lot more stuff than just the car seat.  </li>
            <li>We bought two of these for our Britax Marathon (2009/2010 version, not the most recent) car seats, and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is also a large seat but fits perfectly in this bag and travel has been much easier.</li>
            <li>Nothing nicer than being able to travel hands free</li>
            <li>After researching many bags to fit our [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Britax makes a bag specifically for their seats, and I want to purchase another Britax seat after our son outgrows this one, but many reviewers said that they were cheap and the zippers broke.</li>
            <li>straps for easy carrying</li>
            <li>I also tried my Evenflo Tribute 5 convertible car seat in the bag and that fits fine also</li>
            <li>It fits in the travel bag just fine, which I worried about before buying.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably comfortable to carry on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag and zippers seem durable and the backpack straps are relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li>I stuffed in a Recaro child seat, and it BARELY fit.  </li>
            <li>However, that inconveninece is WELL worth it to me to be able to gate</li>
            <li>I have a toddler car seat; the Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat to be precise.  </li>
            <li>When closing the zippers around the car seat, we find it to be a snug fit at two points, but it still closes without any issues (no breakage, no zipper</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy bag that offers good protection for gate checking your car seat.  </li>
            <li>We own a First Years True Fit C670 Premier which is a very large seat</li>
            <li>A waist strap and chest cilp might be a good adds for stability and comfort but might also be overkill given the amount of time one is likely to wear this as a true backpack.</li>
            <li>It seems to have adequate padding and the material seems pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>Spirit did slice a hole in the top of one (and a hole in the top of the carseat cover that is actually ON the seat...)</li>
            <li>First of all, I wish I&#x27;d bought these (or, rather, known they existed) three years ago!  </li>
            <li>Not only is this backpack large enough to fit most car seats, it also allows you to be hand-free so you can juggle your own luggage, a stroller, and your child!</li>
            <li>The bottom of the car seat fit perfectly but it was difficult to zip up the bag on the sides of the head rest.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased this on sale and it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>, both let us gate check this big bag which is really nice</li>
            <li>Having arms and hands free to carry  or to address other stuff (a child about to knock something over, for example) is nice.  </li>
            <li>(gate check means you leave it at the doorway of the airplane, they pick it up, and then when you get off the airplane you pick it up right there, no need to go to baggage claim).</li>
            <li>These suckers held up beautifully on the way out there.  </li>
            <li>It fit our car seat snug, but well enough, and it held up just fine when we checked it along with our luggage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, we like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>a Britax other wise made really well.</li>
            <li>I expected much more given all the positive reviews of this bag and the relatively light use it has had.  </li>
            <li>The sides of the Evenflo Symphony e3 are well padded and pretty bulky.</li>
            <li>One person alone definitely would not be able to get this car seat into this bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the time it&#x27;s on my back.  </li>
            <li>Bought and used for baby&#x27;s first plane travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been mentioned before, but you WILL look like a fool if you try to carry this thing on your back, not to mention how many people you will know over every time you turn.</li>
            <li>Being able to shove extra stuff in these is a LIFESAVER in todays airline world.  </li>
            <li>It worked exactly as one would expect it to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being able to toss extra stuff into this thing then</li>
            <li>You need to be careful while having this on your back, as it is easy to forget that you have it on!!!</li>
            <li>I am able to travel through the airport with a toddler, a large check only bag, a checked toiletry bag, a stroller, diaper bag and purse.</li>
            <li>and I had concerns that it would not fit this carry bag, but it couldn&#x27;t fit more like a glove if it was custom designed for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great that you can throw the car seat on your back when you are traveling with a child and are either holding them or trying to hold their hand while you walk through the airport and deal with all of your other stuff.  </li>
            <li>We used it to haul our Recaro ProRide which is pretty much the largest car seat you can find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped to use this backpack for gate check as well as the times when she won&#x27;t ride in the car seat through the airport but wants to walk (assuming we have time to cater to her desires).  </li>
            <li>We really struggled to get the car seat into this bag.  </li>
            <li>The quality is better than to be expected for the price.</li>
            <li>This bag was so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>I ordered this bag online since it wasn&#x27;t available locally, and with my prime account, It got here in time for our trip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the bag at home doing a test run since I know it can be stressful in the airport</li>
            <li>fit larger seat when baby grows</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I found it much easier to navigate the airport with this backpack than with the carseat attached to a roller.</li>
            <li>It really expands the amount of stuff you can bring with you and not have to check in (then retrieve at baggage claim).  </li>
            <li>Hand and arms free though is key.  </li>
            <li>sure how it will hold up with other car seats.  </li>
            <li>Even though we pretty much only used it for the airport, it was still a life-save to be able to strap this guy on your back</li>
            <li>The new Frontier 85 SICT is wider at the top, and the bag won&#x27;t zip around it unless multiple people stand on the carseat to cave in the SICT pads, and have another 2 people on hand to struggle with getting the zipper to barely close.  </li>
            <li>A huge bonus about this bag is since car seats check for free on all airlines, you can use the extra space in this backpack to pack other items.</li>
            <li>It has adequate padding and the back pack style of carrying it</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bag is more designed to hold a bigger car seat, so when you are using an infant seat you have plenty of extra room to spare.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>careful about fit -</li>
            <li>But for the price, this backpack is definitely worth it, even if it only lasts a few more trips...</li>
            <li>so you have both hands free to carry other things.  </li>
            <li>We bought this product based on the good reviews by other customers, but now realize that those reviews were based on previous models of the Britax Frontier.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly it&#x27;s a huge car seat with side padding that makes the car seat very wide.  </li>
            <li>So we double this bag as the baby&#x27;s travel bag for diapers, food, clothes, and other misc stuff - and it all checks for free!</li>
            <li>The rips aren&#x27;t anything big, but I doubt the bag will last more than 10-12 trips total.</li>
            <li>and there is plenty of space on top of the seat to hold a small duffel bag of the baby&#x27;s clothes and assorted items.</li>
            <li>Overall, a Great Carseat bag, just wish they made it a little bigger for the new larger model car seats.</li>
            <li>We recently took our 1 year old on her first flight and used this bag to carry her car seat in (still an infant car seat -- Chicco Keyfit 30 ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably good for older models or other brands, but was a total waste of money for us.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use the back-pack strap style carrier than the similar one with the wheels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One of the zippers broke early on.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to get the seat in when the sippers are fully open.</li>
            <li>bag is padded everywhere except the zipper flap portion, which theoretically i guess doesnt really need to be padded because that&#x27;s where the seat goes</li>
            <li>The trick we find is to put the additional items into soft bags (plastic bags or those eco-friendly grocery bags), because the additionals would be easier to remove and replace during the security check at the airport.  </li>
            <li>Nowadays, it seems like the overhead compartments are smaller andsmaller, and the airlines really wants travelers to check in as much of their luggage as possible at the counter.  </li>
            <li>No rips (so far, knock on wood).  </li>
            <li>We recently went to Disney World and flew Spirit Airlines back (first time with that airline).  </li>
            <li>One of the straps is starting to disconnect from the top of the bag but only a little.</li>
            <li>So far, the straps have held up (we&#x27;ve had 6 roundtrips), but I fear the straps will also break in the next several trips...</li>
            <li>Maybe other car seats are too big and bulge out the zipper too much?)</li>
            <li>Since car seats are free to check in, make use of all the extra room and stuff it tight so your other bags aren&#x27;t overweight.  </li>
            <li>is really convenient especially with a little child.</li>
            <li>do have to say that carrying a child&#x27;s car seat on your back, while this bag made that as comfortable as possible, is still awkward as a car seat is large.  </li>

            <li> A huge bonus about this bag is since car seats check for free on all airlines, you can use the extra space in this backpack to pack other items.</li>
            <li> It has adequate padding and the back pack style of carrying it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bag is more designed to hold a bigger car seat, so when you are using an infant seat you have plenty of extra room to spare.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> careful about fit -</li>
            <li> But for the price, this backpack is definitely worth it, even if it only lasts a few more trips...</li>
            <li> so you have both hands free to carry other things.  </li>
            <li> We bought this product based on the good reviews by other customers, but now realize that those reviews were based on previous models of the Britax Frontier.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly it&#x27;s a huge car seat with side padding that makes the car seat very wide.  </li>
            <li> So we double this bag as the baby&#x27;s travel bag for diapers, food, clothes, and other misc stuff - and it all checks for free!</li>
            <li> The rips aren&#x27;t anything big, but I doubt the bag will last more than 10-12 trips total.</li>
            <li> and there is plenty of space on top of the seat to hold a small duffel bag of the baby&#x27;s clothes and assorted items.</li>
            <li> Overall, a Great Carseat bag, just wish they made it a little bigger for the new larger model car seats.</li>
            <li> We recently took our 1 year old on her first flight and used this bag to carry her car seat in (still an infant car seat -- Chicco Keyfit 30 ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably good for older models or other brands, but was a total waste of money for us.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use the back-pack strap style carrier than the similar one with the wheels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One of the zippers broke early on.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to get the seat in when the sippers are fully open.</li>
            <li> bag is padded everywhere except the zipper flap portion, which theoretically i guess doesnt really need to be padded because that&#x27;s where the seat goes</li>
            <li> The trick we find is to put the additional items into soft bags (plastic bags or those eco-friendly grocery bags), because the additionals would be easier to remove and replace during the security check at the airport.  </li>
            <li> Nowadays, it seems like the overhead compartments are smaller andsmaller, and the airlines really wants travelers to check in as much of their luggage as possible at the counter.  </li>
            <li> No rips (so far, knock on wood).  </li>
            <li> We recently went to Disney World and flew Spirit Airlines back (first time with that airline).  </li>
            <li> One of the straps is starting to disconnect from the top of the bag but only a little.</li>
            <li> So far, the straps have held up (we&#x27;ve had 6 roundtrips), but I fear the straps will also break in the next several trips...</li>
            <li> Maybe other car seats are too big and bulge out the zipper too much?)</li>
            <li> Since car seats are free to check in, make use of all the extra room and stuff it tight so your other bags aren&#x27;t overweight.  </li>
            <li> is really convenient especially with a little child.</li>
            <li> do have to say that carrying a child&#x27;s car seat on your back, while this bag made that as comfortable as possible, is still awkward as a car seat is large.  </li>
            <li> I only had it on for a few minutes and the straps are decent but not long or with any extra padding to speak of.  </li>
            <li> 5 total flights and no major signs of wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> Our last travel where we checked-in the travel bag unfortunately involved a layover and a flight transfer (so it was handled a lot), but the bag held up fine.  </li>
            <li> bag did not make it through a single trip (only 1 layover).</li>
            <li> But given the price of this backpack, I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
            <li> far, we&#x27;ve traveled a few times with it without a problem.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will stuff some clothes and other things too since they check or gate-check any seats/strollers for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> several stuffed animals (purchases), shoes, clothes, and tons of other items  and save ourselves 100$ on overweight luggage.  </li>
            <li> We have an Evenflo Symphony e3 and it was pretty tough getting it into this travel bag.</li>
            <li> Took the family on a trip to Hawaii this past November and we needed to bring the car seat for our 18-month old.  </li>
            <li> We (I) carry the thing on my back all the way down the jetway then hand it off by the airplane door, and the airline will stow the travel bag with the rest of the luggage during the flight.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when we had to change to a toddler carseat, Britax Advocate 70CS, It fit about 90% in, but we were unable to close the zipper all the way and had to put an airline plastic bag over the whole thing so that it didn&#x27;t fall out of it.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this bag and really is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not comfortable to wear on your back.  </li>
            <li> only annoying thing about this bag is that it is so big that it wont fit through the security scanner conveyor belt.</li>
            <li> I try not to flout the rules like that, but DW with 2 kids under 4 is enough trouble as it is.  </li>
            <li> Even though they were both that heavy, wearing it like a backpack didn&#x27;t hurt my back or shoulders at all.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to hit anybody with the bag when turning or when say, in an elevator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to spin 360° with it on or do the tango with it, but there is still plenty of movement possible.  </li>
            <li> One of us had to press the sides together while the other one zipped.  </li>
            <li> We saw other couples trying to carry their car seat without a bag through the airport.  </li>
            <li> and it created a little extra room in there where I could stuff a blanket and some little toys for him without taking up room in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Other time we checked in the lady had no comments at all, so it may depend on how onerous your airline is.</li>
            <li> I know airline cargo loaders are very rough on baggage.  </li>
            <li> This bag has a bad design and the zipper is cheap.</li>
            <li> On average, it goes on 2 airplane trips per year.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Britax Advocate 70 cs owners do not buy it does NOT fit no matter how hard you try!!!! do not buy if you have a Britax other wise made really well.</li>
            <li> We bought this bag to protect our Britax Boulevard car seat when travelling by air. It fit our car seat snug, but well enough, and it held up just fine when we checked it along with our luggage. It does not move quite as well on its wheels as my luggage does, but it does work well enough.</li>
            <li> Great travel bag - fits our Britax perfectly!  It is much easier to use the back-pack strap style carrier than the similar one with the wheels.</li>
            <li> We have an Evenflo Symphony e3 and it was pretty tough getting it into this travel bag. The bottom of the car seat fit perfectly but it was difficult to zip up the bag on the sides of the head rest. The sides of the Evenflo Symphony e3 are well padded and pretty bulky. I found the best way to get the car seat into the bag was to recline the seat to the 2nd position and to put the head rest up. But even with changing the position, there was about a 3 inch gap between the two zippers and I had to McGuyver it close with a rubber twisty tie. I recommend trying your car seat in the bag before travel day and save yourself some frustration. I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;3\\&quot; woman and carrying the car seat on my back around the house wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought. Carrying it from the car to the check in counter at the airport shouldn&#x27;t be a problem but trekking around the airport might be tough. I&#x27;ll update this review after we use it in the airport. Happy travels!</li>
            <li> This backpack was a lifesaver for me, as I&#x27;ve traveled solo with my infant son several times. Most airlines don&#x27;t provide plastic bags anymore for car seats, so I wanted to protect the bag from damage from baggage handling. Not only is this backpack large enough to fit most car seats, it also allows you to be hand-free so you can juggle your own luggage, a stroller, and your child! A huge bonus about this bag is since car seats check for free on all airlines, you can use the extra space in this backpack to pack other items. So we double this bag as the baby&#x27;s travel bag for diapers, food, clothes, and other misc stuff - and it all checks for free! The reason I give this four stars is because the fabric has already ripped after just a couple trips. The rips aren&#x27;t anything big, but I doubt the bag will last more than 10-12 trips total. But given the price of this backpack, I&#x27;m not surprised. If it was made of better quality fabric, the price would reflect it. The other negative again has to do with the quality - the straps themselves. So far, the straps have held up (we&#x27;ve had 6 roundtrips), but I fear the straps will also break in the next several trips... So all in all, a wonderful concept in function but it could definitely use some quality improvement. But for the price, this backpack is definitely worth it, even if it only lasts a few more trips...</li>
            <li> Received the backpack and think it is well made - the zippers took some pulling and yanking and didn&#x27;t give. Unfortunately, with the new convertible car seat I purchased inside, the zipper will not zip all the way around. I purchased the EvenFlo as a travel seat to give us the flexibility over time of rear facing, front facing and booster; it&#x27;s heavy though at just over 20# and if our daughter \\&quot;chooses\\&quot; not to ride in it on our carry-on suticase, it&#x27;ll be a lot to lug.  I&#x27;d hoped to use this backpack for gate check as well as the times when she won&#x27;t ride in the car seat through the airport but wants to walk (assuming we have time to cater to her desires).  I only had it on for a few minutes and the straps are decent but not long or with any extra padding to speak of.  A waist strap and chest cilp might be a good adds for stability and comfort but might also be overkill given the amount of time one is likely to wear this as a true backpack.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy bag that offers good protection for gate checking your car seat.  It is reasonably comfortable to carry on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful about fit - We have a Britax Advocate 70 CS.  Admittedly it&#x27;s a huge car seat with side padding that makes the car seat very wide.  We really struggled to get the car seat into this bag.  One of us had to press the sides together while the other one zipped.  One person alone definitely would not be able to get this car seat into this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: We got a second car seat, a Britax Boulevard 70.  It is also a large seat but fits perfectly in this bag and travel has been much easier.</li>
            <li> We own a First Years True Fit C670 Premier which is a very large seat and I had concerns that it would not fit this carry bag, but it couldn&#x27;t fit more like a glove if it was custom designed for it. For the price of this bag and really is a no brainer. Nothing nicer than being able to travel hands free and there is plenty of space on top of the seat to hold a small duffel bag of the baby&#x27;s clothes and assorted items. The quality is better than to be expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I just received this and am pleased with how my Safety 1st Onboard Air 35 and base fits.  It leaves plenty of room for me to put clothes, diapers, etc (as suggested by another reviewer.)  It seems to have adequate padding and the material seems pretty strong.  I just bought this car seat so I&#x27;m hoping this bag does the job, but I know airline cargo loaders are very rough on baggage.  I also tried my Evenflo Tribute 5 convertible car seat in the bag and that fits fine also (that one is going on the plane).  I&#x27;ll update my review and let you know how it holds up on both flights!</li>
            <li> We just flew using this bag this past weekend.  Checked the car seat on the outbound trip and carried the car seat on the plane for the inbound trip.  This bag nicely protected the car seat when it was checked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great that you can throw the car seat on your back when you are traveling with a child and are either holding them or trying to hold their hand while you walk through the airport and deal with all of your other stuff.  We saw other couples trying to carry their car seat without a bag through the airport.  This bag was so much easier.  Very glad that we purchased this bag for the trip. Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that carrying a child&#x27;s car seat on your back, while this bag made that as comfortable as possible, is still awkward as a car seat is large.  You need to be careful while having this on your back, as it is easy to forget that you have it on!!!</li>
            <li> We recently purchased this bag and used it on a trip with our Britax Boulevard.  My husband had no problem carrying it on his back while rolling the rest of our luggage.  We checked our carseat and the bag held up great.  It was very easy to get the car seat in and out of the bag.  I purchased this on sale and it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> We just bought this bag for our upcoming vacation so we haven&#x27;t yet traveled with it BUT it seems great.  We have the Britax Marathon and it this bag fits it perfectly.  The bag and zippers seem durable and the backpack straps are relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> Purchased this bag about a year ago and it worked perfect for our Chicco Keyfit30 Infant car seat.  Very durable and it created a little extra room in there where I could stuff a blanket and some little toys for him without taking up room in my suitcase.  Unfortunately when we had to change to a toddler carseat, Britax Advocate 70CS, It fit about 90% in, but we were unable to close the zipper all the way and had to put an airline plastic bag over the whole thing so that it didn&#x27;t fall out of it.  Overall, a Great Carseat bag, just wish they made it a little bigger for the new larger model car seats.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned this cover for about 3 years now.  On average, it goes on 2 airplane trips per year.  We&#x27;ve been really unhappy with the performance of this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it for a Graco Nautilus.  The seat itself fits well.  We also use it for a Britax Advocate CS.  That fits as well.  The basic utilization pattern is that we put the Graco in the travel bag before we go on a trip.  It goes from from the back of the car to the shuttle in the airport parking lot.  The seat gets taken out in security and then gets put back in for the walk to the terminal.  Most of the time it&#x27;s on my back.  I take the seat out once we&#x27;re on the plane and the bag goes under the seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the zippers broke early on.  Now the bottom of the bag has holes in it.  It&#x27;s also not comfortable to wear on your back.  On our last trip one of the plastic buckles broke.  I expected much more given all the positive reviews of this bag and the relatively light use it has had.  It might have been checked once in its entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought and used for baby&#x27;s first plane travel. Putting in an infant car seat (Graco Snugride 35) was a little awkward with the base. The bag looks to be designed for a convertible car seat. Carrying was a little awkward and dug into my hips a bit, but not a big issue. We also stuffed jackets and diapers into the extra space, although one of the airline check-in person says we&#x27;re not allowed to do so and have it count as a car seat (no charge for checking in car seat). He even implied that we were not allowed to use a bag like this! Other time we checked in the lady had no comments at all, so it may depend on how onerous your airline is.</li>
            <li> We brought our Graco My Ride 65 Convertible Car Seat on our trip and it fits this travel bag perfectly.  The car seat is in the same condition when we arrived to our destination and on our flight back.  It has adequate padding and the back pack style of carrying it is really convenient especially with a little child.</li>
            <li> After researching many bags to fit our [[ASIN:B0050386O4 Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black]] I decided on this bag. Britax makes a bag specifically for their seats, and I want to purchase another Britax seat after our son outgrows this one, but many reviewers said that they were cheap and the zippers broke. AND it was much more expensive than this bag. I ordered this bag online since it wasn&#x27;t available locally, and with my prime account, It got here in time for our trip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the bag at home doing a test run since I know it can be stressful in the airport and we were going to gate check the seat. It is much easier to get the seat in when the sippers are fully open. We didn&#x27;t take the base, but I would guess that it would fit too since there is a LOT of room. We also put the infant seat adapters from the [[ASIN:B0050GD2AO Britax B-Agile Stroller, Black]] and our [[ASIN:B0010PW3A4 Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining]] in the bag with the seat. Next time I will stuff some clothes and other things too since they check or gate-check any seats/strollers for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;seems sturdy after one use on plane&lt;br /&gt;Extra room for storage or base&lt;br /&gt;Will fit larger seat when baby grows&lt;br /&gt;backpack straps for easy carrying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;very bulky to carry when child is using the seat&lt;br /&gt;large to store when not in use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this purchase and will update if anything changes. Will use this bag again on our trip to Puerto Rico in July and hopefully it holds up! I plan to use it for many years!</li>
            <li> This car seat bag is amazing. I am able to travel through the airport with a toddler, a large check only bag, a checked toiletry bag, a stroller, diaper bag and purse. I have a method and I make look silly but I manage without hurting myself or exerting a crazy amount of energy. We have checked the bag, with a Britax convertible car seat inside, over 75 times and it is still holding up. One of the straps is starting to disconnect from the top of the bag but only a little. I will just take a heavy duty needle and thread to it!</li>
            <li> This bag has a bad design and the zipper is cheap. It will rip open.&lt;br /&gt;The bag did not make it through a single trip (only 1 layover).</li>
            <li> 6 nights in Jamaica, 2 nights in Miami, traveling from Southern California.  5 total flights and no major signs of wear and tear.  I stuffed in a Recaro child seat, and it BARELY fit.  Since car seats are free to check in, make use of all the extra room and stuff it tight so your other bags aren&#x27;t overweight.  It&#x27;s been mentioned before, but you WILL look like a fool if you try to carry this thing on your back, not to mention how many people you will know over every time you turn.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase. We recently took our 1 year old on her first flight and used this bag to carry her car seat in (still an infant car seat -- Chicco Keyfit 30 ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is padded everywhere except the zipper flap portion, which theoretically i guess doesnt really need to be padded because that&#x27;s where the seat goes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is more designed to hold a bigger car seat, so when you are using an infant seat you have plenty of extra room to spare. We put more items in like diapers, blankets, clothes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly appreciate the backpack straps, makes it a lot easier to lug around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flew United and Southwest, both let us gate check this big bag which is really nice (gate check means you leave it at the doorway of the airplane, they pick it up, and then when you get off the airplane you pick it up right there, no need to go to baggage claim). At your gate you just ask the person at the desk for a gate check tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only annoying thing about this bag is that it is so big that it wont fit through the security scanner conveyor belt. I had to take everything OUT (carseat, etc) and run each item one-by-one through security. However, that inconveninece is WELL worth it to me to be able to gate check it, instead of checking it in and having to pick it up at baggage claim.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wish I&#x27;d bought these (or, rather, known they existed) three years ago!  They&#x27;re AWESOME.  Being able to shove extra stuff in these is a LIFESAVER in todays airline world.  We bought two of these for our Britax Marathon (2009/2010 version, not the most recent) car seats, and they fit perfectly. We recently went to Disney World and flew Spirit Airlines back (first time with that airline).  We did not notice that the weight limit was 40 lbs, not 50, for that airline.  We got to the ticket counter and were told it would be 50$ extra each bag for the overweight. We were able to move things around and into these bags...several stuffed animals (purchases), shoes, clothes, and tons of other items  and save ourselves 100$ on overweight luggage.  I try not to flout the rules like that, but DW with 2 kids under 4 is enough trouble as it is.  These suckers held up beautifully on the way out there.  Spirit did slice a hole in the top of one (and a hole in the top of the carseat cover that is actually ON the seat...) that looks like it was hit with a razor.  The bag still functions okay though. I think we&#x27;ll have to sew it up and duct tape it so it doesn&#x27;t rip wider the next time, but I&#x27;ll admit the thing was probably 50 lbs by the time it went through their luggage.  Even though they were both that heavy, wearing it like a backpack didn&#x27;t hurt my back or shoulders at all.  The weight is surprisingly well distributed.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It worked exactly as one would expect it to.  I have a toddler car seat; the Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat to be precise.  It fits in the travel bag just fine, which I worried about before buying.  I found it much easier to navigate the airport with this backpack than with the carseat attached to a roller.</li>
            <li> We use this product with our Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car seat.  The car seat fits in this backpack.  The best way to put the car seat into the backpack (in our opinion) is have the car seat attached to the base, and put the base along the side that will be alongside your back.  When closing the zippers around the car seat, we find it to be a snug fit at two points, but it still closes without any issues (no breakage, no zipper damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the good points that we like about this car seat travel bag.  It can hold a lot more stuff than just the car seat.  We stuff a lot of additional things into this bag, it&#x27;s crazy.  The trick we find is to put the additional items into soft bags (plastic bags or those eco-friendly grocery bags), because the additionals would be easier to remove and replace during the security check at the airport.  Rather than taking out additional items one by one, just having a bag or two to remove works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time we traveled, we had just north of 35 lbs of stuff in it (car seat included), and the travel bag worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, we&#x27;ve traveled a few times with it without a problem.  We&#x27;ve gate-checked the bag twice, and we&#x27;ve counter checked-in the bag twice.  One travel was on an international flight.  Our last travel where we checked-in the travel bag unfortunately involved a layover and a flight transfer (so it was handled a lot), but the bag held up fine.  From all of these travels, we haven&#x27;t had any damage to our travel bag or to the car seat inside.  I was a bit concerned during the times we decided to check in the travel bag at the airport counter (less for me to carry to the gate), but everything turned out fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to toss extra stuff into this thing then gate-check it is really nice.  It really expands the amount of stuff you can bring with you and not have to check in (then retrieve at baggage claim).  Nowadays, it seems like the overhead compartments are smaller andsmaller, and the airlines really wants travelers to check in as much of their luggage as possible at the counter.  We can use smaller carry-on items (or smaller pullmans), and stuff the travel bag with items that we don&#x27;t need during the flight (no liquids no sharps, of course).  We (I) carry the thing on my back all the way down the jetway then hand it off by the airplane door, and the airline will stow the travel bag with the rest of the luggage during the flight.  When we arrive and deplane, the travel bag is waiting for us at the jetway.  Gate check-in.  Never did it before, but now a big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus feature of this style of bag is that it&#x27;s a backpack.  Having arms and hands free to carry  or to address other stuff (a child about to knock something over, for example) is nice.  It&#x27;s not easy to spin 360° with it on or do the tango with it, but there is still plenty of movement possible.  Hand and arms free though is key.  Just be careful not to hit anybody with the bag when turning or when say, in an elevator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We kept the plastic bag that it came in (which is zippered shut).  When we are not using the travel bag, we pack it up, keep it in the plastic bag, and then just store it in the closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we like this product very much.  No damage and no zipper problems.  No rips (so far, knock on wood).  Hands-free.  Arms-free.  Convenient extra space for gate checks.  Works well with the Chicco Keyfit 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Not sure how it will hold up with other car seats.  Maybe other car seats are too big and bulge out the zipper too much?)</li>
            <li> We bought this product based on the good reviews by other customers, but now realize that those reviews were based on previous models of the Britax Frontier.  The new Frontier 85 SICT is wider at the top, and the bag won&#x27;t zip around it unless multiple people stand on the carseat to cave in the SICT pads, and have another 2 people on hand to struggle with getting the zipper to barely close.  I had to use it for a trip because I had no time to return it beforehand.  It took 3-4 people to get the carseat in the bag on both legs of travel, and I definitey can&#x27;t use it again (the seams around the zipper are already ripping from the strain).  Probably good for older models or other brands, but was a total waste of money for us.</li>
            <li> Took the family on a trip to Hawaii this past November and we needed to bring the car seat for our 18-month old.  Even though we pretty much only used it for the airport, it was still a life-save to be able to strap this guy on your back so you have both hands free to carry other things.  We used it to haul our Recaro ProRide which is pretty much the largest car seat you can find.  Highly recommend this.</li>
