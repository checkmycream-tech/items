            <li>Love Sunflowers.  </li>
            <li>EXCELENTES CONDICIONES, ORIGINAL Y EN BUEN ESTADO, RECOMENDADO!</li>
            <li>I love this light fragrance for summer time.</li>
            <li>but i believe she was happy with the purchase as this was one of her favorite scents when she was younger</li>
            <li>so it was an easy choice.</li>
            <li>No explanation given, no tracking available.</li>
            <li>Worked out great as a Christmas present for the mother.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t that this is original.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I ever had with wearing this stuff is that, in warm weather, you will and DO attract bees!</li>
            <li>Not too sweet not too flowery.</li>
            <li>They smell sweet</li>
            <li>but I just took everything out and put it in a basket other than that it was great</li>
            <li>for this purchase; I could not believe how quickly my shipment arrived.</li>
            <li>I have loved Sunflowers since I first came across it back in the 90&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>The great pricing amazon offers allowed me to buy several perfume &amp; lotion kits like this one for my girlfriend of the time.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>She loves the fragrance and found the amounts were just right for the money.</li>
            <li>the price was right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;These box sets allow me to get the lotion and spray for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>maybe even try another scent from Elizabeth Arden since they seem to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my disabled daughter, it gives her a clean fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was ordered as a gift so the dents in the box made it hard to wrap nicely.</li>
            <li>No fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn in my nearly 50 years has ever been asked about so much as this one.  </li>
            <li>Appeared to have been handled quite roughly, but luckily the product itself wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 19 year old niece.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every bit I spent.</li>

            <li> Great package for the money</li>
            <li> Smells weird I don&#x27;t that this is original. Also I  could  tell we&#x27;re they peeled the clearance label off of it.</li>
            <li> Appeared to have been handled quite roughly, but luckily the product itself wasn&#x27;t damaged. This was ordered as a gift so the dents in the box made it hard to wrap nicely.</li>
            <li> A friend at church always wears this perfume and it smells wonderful (to me).  I would highly recommend it. Not too sweet not too flowery.</li>
            <li> This order was placed on May 7th and delivered a month later. No explanation given, no tracking available.</li>
            <li> I got it for my fiance and she said she loved it. Even said she had several people compliment her on the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really beautiful scent that I&#x27;ve been getting for my mom for years. Everytime she runs out, I get a call asking &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the name of that perfume I like so much?&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s mom&#x27;s cute way of saying, son time for replenishment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always happy to get it for her.</li>
            <li> the corners of the box were a bent up but I just took everything out and put it in a basket other than that it was great</li>
            <li> Very bad experience, very bad product packaging is completely lost, not recommended, I made a purchase of several products, the seller lost everything I pack in one box. abusers! stole a perfume</li>
            <li> i purchased this as a gift but i believe she was happy with the purchase as this was one of her favorite scents when she was younger and she didnt think she could get this product anymore.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume it smells so good and the price was right</li>
            <li> I love this light fragrance for summer time. It is inexpensive enough to apply after multiple showers or pool use. The 3-piece set is affordable and makes the scent last longer too.</li>
            <li> The great pricing amazon offers allowed me to buy several perfume &amp; lotion kits like this one for my girlfriend of the time. She loved them all and it was well worth it. Got to please the ladies boys!</li>
            <li> Sunflower spray is very nice and not over powering for anyone around the person wearing it.  I use it on my disabled daughter, it gives her a clean fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These box sets allow me to get the lotion and spray for a reasonable price.  I don&#x27;t use the bath gel a lot, but it is nice to have when I want to use it in her bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of Amazon, I don&#x27;t have to go out to look for the product.  It saves me time!</li>

            <li> No fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn in my nearly 50 years has ever been asked about so much as this one.  And I don&#x27;t even like sunflowers!</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift from the UK to the USA.  The reciprient told me that she is very , very pleased with the product and loves it all.&lt;br /&gt;  From my point of view, really excellent service and so easy.&lt;br /&gt;  Peter</li>
