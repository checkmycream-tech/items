    <ol>
            <li>This is the best file I have ever had!</li>
            <li>Works, very good price!</li>
            <li>they work great</li>
            <li>GREAT FILES --GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>Not like the one I needed to replace, but still a good nail file-</li>
            <li>Good price-</li>
            <li>they are amazing and swift.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have two so that I can put one in two purses.</li>
            <li>Files nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one is even better .</li>
            <li>The Revlon OLD STYLE has been a mainstay for me for over 40 years and was GREAT.</li>
            <li>As far as filing goes, this is a great file.  </li>
            <li>the handles is cheap but they seem to get the job done and it does say it is guaranteed for life we will see</li>
            <li>This nail file is great, one side by filing and the other to smooth the edge.  </li>
            <li>Just as nice as my twenty year old Revlon nail files.</li>
            <li>For the price, great little file</li>
            <li>These are the only ones I &#x27;ve found that have a decent point for cleaning as well as being a good file so ordered a bunch at one time.  </li>
            <li>CAUTION BUYERS OF THIS NEW STYLE!!!</li>
            <li>Very reasonable for this item.</li>
            <li>It also bent upon first use.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave 3 stars is simply because the description describes these files as having 2 distinct sides, one being to file and one to smooth.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the longer supposedly Revlon emeryl files (they weren&#x27;t Revlon), these really are Revlon files and they work as they are supposed to work.</li>
            <li>Coarse on the &#x27;China&#x27; side smooth on the reverse.</li>
            <li>i wish it had medium or finish, fast shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see they actually worked</li>
            <li>I got two - one as a replacement for my 40 year old Revlon manicure set and one for my purse.</li>
            <li>The smooth side is missing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown it away and am in a desperate search for the old kind.</li>
            <li>they filed my nails down fast..</li>

            <li> Too expensive for the way it feels and looks as compared to the photo</li>
            <li> they work great they filed my nails down fast.. the handles is cheap but they seem to get the job done and it does say it is guaranteed for life we will see</li>
            <li> GREAT FILES --GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I got two - one as a replacement for my 40 year old Revlon manicure set and one for my purse. This is the best file I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Bought for wife - she loves them!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike the longer supposedly Revlon emeryl files (they weren&#x27;t Revlon), these really are Revlon files and they work as they are supposed to work. The others were sold by Voll Market Stop and were bad. Hurrah! ONE COMMENT to add -- both sides are the same. I was so excited to see they actually worked, I didn&#x27;t realize that both sides are the same, so not exactly like the ones I used to purchase. Ah well. Like I said, they work!</li>
            <li> Not like the one I needed to replace, but still a good nail file- Good price-</li>
            <li> Works, very good price!</li>
            <li> For the price, great little file</li>
            <li> Just as nice as my twenty year old Revlon nail files. Coarse on the &#x27;China&#x27; side smooth on the reverse. My two different generic nail files have broken handles&#x27; but these ought to last twenty years too.</li>
            <li> Nice to have two so that I can put one in two purses. Files nicely.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Amazon refunded</li>
            <li> The seller was great,&lt;br /&gt;However, Revlon has not been the same in some years.&lt;br /&gt;Nail implements seem to get increasingly worse. My 8 yr. old cuticle trimmer is sharper than one I bought to replace it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> CAUTION BUYERS OF THIS NEW STYLE!!! The Revlon OLD STYLE has been a mainstay for me for over 40 years and was GREAT. This NEW STYLE is TERRIBLE. It&#x27;s made in China and made my nails rough and catch on things. It also bent upon first use. I&#x27;ve thrown it away and am in a desperate search for the old kind. REVLON...go back to making quality. This one is NOT!!!</li>
            <li> Order from PharmaFrag they are amazing and swift.  Perfection.</li>
            <li> This nail file is great, one side by filing and the other to smooth the edge.  The last Revlon nail file  lasted several years, and&lt;br /&gt;this one is even better .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to keep people from taking my files.  These are the only ones I &#x27;ve found that have a decent point for cleaning as well as being a good file so ordered a bunch at one time.  Maybe I can keep them around for awhile.</li>
            <li> These fingernail files are just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> i wish it had medium or finish, fast shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 3 stars is simply because the description describes these files as having 2 distinct sides, one being to file and one to smooth.  The smooth side is missing.  Both sides are the same.  As far as filing goes, this is a great file.  However, I was specifically looking for the Revlon file that that has both the filing and smoothing sides.  I should have read what another reviewer wrote about this before purchasing and the seller should correct the description of this item.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable for this item. These files should last for years in personal use. I&#x27;ve had one for over 10 years and it still files well. The only drawback to these is the TSA will confiscate them as they are viewed as weapons. So save your paper ones for travel.</li>
