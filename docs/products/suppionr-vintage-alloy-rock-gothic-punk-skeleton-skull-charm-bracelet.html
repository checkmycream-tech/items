            <li> It arrived way before the expected date, taking only 10 days!</li>
            <li> This took a month to arrive and when I opened it up from the package the head was broken right off, there is no fixing it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;- Not really resizable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The chain part was really tangled up. To the point I can&#x27;t get the kink out. Skeleton looks great, just can&#x27;t wear the bracelet.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured, so cute! So worth the price, I wish I had ordered 5 so I could give them as gifts!</li>
            <li> I love this bracelet. My favorite aspects include:&lt;br /&gt;- It was actually shinier than the picture made it seem. Some reviews say that this bracelet seems cheap, but I don&#x27;t agree with that at all. It&#x27;s very nice quality, especially considering the great price.&lt;br /&gt;- Much daintier and smaller than I thought - very feminine!&lt;br /&gt;- The legs and feet are jointed and are free to move! So cute!&lt;br /&gt;-  I just noticed that the eyes are shaped like hearts - adorable!!!&lt;br /&gt;- I liked it so much that I ordered one for my friend, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little tricky to put on by myself, but I&#x27;m getting better at it.&lt;br /&gt;- Not really resizable. You can hook the clasp at a different spot on the chain to make it tighter, but it looked crooked and unbalanced when I did it.</li>
            <li> It broke within three times of wearing it .still think it&#x27;s very cute but it&#x27;s very cheaply made</li>
            <li> Took awhile to receive the bracelet and it&#x27;s not as gold looking as the picture but granddaughter really likes it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece....I got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Another score for grandma within the skull jewelry!</li>
            <li> Came early looks just like the picture it is absolutely beautiful.. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I really like this bracelet. However it was not smoothed out properly and keeps snagging my blouse. I have not used it since. it has potential</li>
            <li> nice for little people</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It was very cute but one of the legs fell off within the first week and is lost forever, so I don&#x27;t wear it now.</li>
            <li> This was such an adorable bracelet. I would say the only thing that is barely fit me once I got it. Just ensure that this is a rather small bracelet and does not leave much room for larger wrists but I love it.</li>

            <li> Not as cute as I thought it was going to be.. but it does look as pictured.</li>
            <li> love it, exactly as shown. I have chubby wrists and it fits me fine</li>
            <li> Horrible. Snapped in half after an hour. Guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying a cheap item! Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved this! She&#x27;s kind of into skeletons :) came in a timely manner, was very affordable. Nice!</li>
            <li> Broken before I even got to wear it</li>
            <li> Super cute but a little small.</li>
            <li> I got this WAY before the expected arrival date. Its perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s badass chic. It literally had taken a month to get though!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this! I had to have it! I love it! So cute!! Sometimes the legs flip around and it looks like she&#x27;s sitting pretty! Lol!</li>
            <li> Love this! For the price this is very cute and arrived 2 weeks before the estimated arrival date. The coloring of it is a bit more &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; looking, giving it that vintage look. Plenty of room for adjustment for those with larger wrists. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love it! It looks just like the picture and is so cute. I would not recommend if you have a larger wrist but it fits perfectly on me. It arrived way before the expected date, taking only 10 days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and it came fast</li>
            <li> exactly as pictured. i get lots of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I have small wrist &amp; I love this. Bought it for Halloween but I wear it all the time</li>
            <li> It was really cute but it literally broke after 2 minutes of wearing it.. I was trying to find my keys and bam, just breaks and falls of my wrist. Didn&#x27;t even touch or do anything.</li>
            <li> SO CUTE! took a while to get, but fits perfect on my wrist, just be careful w/ it, its only a couple dollars, don&#x27;t expect titanium steel! lol for the money, yes, get it!</li>
            <li> Looks very nice and expensive. I wear it every day.</li>
            <li> I loved it but it broke after two days</li>
            <li> Really cute, but a little dull in color other then that i love it</li>
            <li> This took a month to arrive and when I opened it up from the package the head was broken right off, there is no fixing it. So damn cheep, but I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> i like it. fits on my tiny wrist. thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look new and its not really gold color :(</li>
