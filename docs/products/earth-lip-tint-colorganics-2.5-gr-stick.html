            <li>Happy that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my mouth to eat.  </li>
            <li>And the texture is great too.</li>
            <li>It dries my lips a bit but to be fair just about</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t stop making this gorgeous color.  </li>
            <li>Your welcome. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>The color is amazing - while it lasts.</li>
            <li>I really liked them).</li>
            <li>Not messy, just perfect.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and as important, the texture is smooth and glides on.</li>
            <li>This was very close to what I was wanting this to be like and am quite happy with the color.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found Hemp Organics.</li>
            <li>Thought it was more of a stain for the lips, and its more like a lip gloss not stain</li>
            <li>Love this -</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for just this hue (I haven&#x27;t found many stains that are this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep wearing it though, I&#x27;ll be able to tell in a couple of days if this is just another lip product that I am allergic to.    </li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>They are moist and beautiful and look so natural.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not greasy, perfect brownish red to compliment my skin</li>
            <li>I tried all of my lip balms, happened to have a tube of this handy, and this was the only thing that felt good on my lips for about a week.  </li>
            <li>The formula is smooth and buttery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li>Earth is the most pigmented of the three (more of an opaque stain whereas the others are more of a sheer tint).</li>
            <li>Great lip balm, nice colors, neutral and delicate</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend them because of 1) good pigment, 2) excellent buttery formula that feels nice on the lips and doesn&#x27;t dry them out, and 3) natural non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I just repeatedly tap it into my lips and rub them together to get a natural, healthy looking tint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and simple.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my lips comfortable; they felt like they&#x27;d been burned and were extremely sensitive to food and anything and everything.  </li>
            <li>OK, a couple of days later, I threw the tubes out (I bought two in car</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>I may try putting a gloss overtop of it, but that pretty much defeats the purpose of having a tinted balm.</li>
            <li>This lip color is great for everyday wear as it offers a nice natural looking color along with a soothing balm to combat dry lips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so much of a stain, so if  you are looking for something that stays on for hours, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little dark, but still good!</li>
            <li>(blonde over blue eyes) and most others too.  </li>
            <li>But you can apply it like a normal lipstick and easily layer it for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lip tint.</li>
            <li>You can put it on as light or as dark as you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>The color is like a medium tint on your lips not to dark not to light.</li>
            <li>I personally have never used a gloss/balm/lipstick that had tremendous lasting power, so</li>
            <li>I prefer a natural look</li>

            <li> Love this stuff - stays on for a long time. I will try a lighter color next time it&#x27;s a little dark, but still good!</li>
            <li> This was very close to what I was wanting this to be like and am quite happy with the color.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. The colors are great and as important, the texture is smooth and glides on. Other gluten-free lipsticks I have tried have been so dry as to be unusable. These are a pleasure to use. Glad to have found Hemp Organics.</li>
            <li> I recently picked up these lip tints in &amp;#34;Earth&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Kiss&amp;#34; at a local organic foods shop ($6.99 each). Earth is the most pigmented of the three (more of an opaque stain whereas the others are more of a sheer tint). I prefer a natural look so I just repeatedly tap it into my lips and rub them together to get a natural, healthy looking tint. But you can apply it like a normal lipstick and easily layer it for a more dramatic look. The formula is smooth and buttery. I personally have never used a gloss/balm/lipstick that had tremendous lasting power, so I guess I&#x27;d say these are about average (no better no worse). Overall I highly recommend them because of 1) good pigment, 2) excellent buttery formula that feels nice on the lips and doesn&#x27;t dry them out, and 3) natural non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago I was going through what I now know was a sort of chemical toxic poisoning in my body.  I couldn&#x27;t get my lips comfortable; they felt like they&#x27;d been burned and were extremely sensitive to food and anything and everything.  I tried all of my lip balms, happened to have a tube of this handy, and this was the only thing that felt good on my lips for about a week.  Thank goodness for this product, and for the full-body cleanse I did that removed the toxins.  I am eternally grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm, nice colors, neutral and delicate but they stay put.  You can get these for about 5-6$ on luckyvitamin though.</li>
            <li> Thought it was more of a stain for the lips, and its more like a lip gloss not stain</li>
            <li> It dries my lips a bit but to be fair just about everything does and they are very dry anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this - I bought the &amp;#34;earth&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s just a perfect color.  You can put it on as light or as dark as you&#x27;d like.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my lips out like other lipsticks.  Happy that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my mouth to eat.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lip tint. Unfortunately, the other reviews I read were on-point. The color is amazing - while it lasts. I&#x27;ve probably re-applied every hour. And it&#x27;s not moisturizing. I may try putting a gloss overtop of it, but that pretty much defeats the purpose of having a tinted balm. The tube is smaller than a standard lipbalm, and overpriced. I&#x27;d recommend that you keep looking for other options.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  I have been looking for just this hue (I haven&#x27;t found many stains that are this dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much of a stain, so if  you are looking for something that stays on for hours, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply several coats for deeper, darker color.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s nice and simple. Not messy, just perfect. The color is like a medium tint on your lips not to dark not to light. Just right. And the texture is great too. Not to oily and not to dry. It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago, I developed an allergy to lipstick and other lip products. Everything that I put on my lips cause them to dry out andd eventually peel. I&#x27;ve tried vasoline, different kinds of Chapsticks, Carmex, Blistex, everything. I even tried olive oil for some relief. I like the color of this tint, but it already feels like it&#x27;s drying out my lips. I&#x27;ll keep wearing it though, I&#x27;ll be able to tell in a couple of days if this is just another lip product that I am allergic to.    OK, a couple of days later, I threw the tubes out (I bought two in car I really liked them). There was no moisture in the product, it dried out my lips, and worse, made my lips look thin. I&#x27;m disappointed. My Quest goes on.</li>
            <li> The color is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  I used to wear high-end brands (Bobbi Brown, Lancome, Dior, etc) but these are perfect.  They are moist and beautiful and look so natural. They blend well and never clump.  Love them!</li>
            <li> This lip color is great for everyday wear as it offers a nice natural looking color along with a soothing balm to combat dry lips.  The berry shade can go from day to night and adds an element of depth to your lips.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop making this gorgeous color.  Smooth, not greasy, perfect brownish red to compliment my skin (blonde over blue eyes) and most others too.  I get asked all the time,  what color is that?  Secret: brownish lip color makes your teeth look whiter.  Your welcome. &#x3D;)</li>
