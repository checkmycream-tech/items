            <li>This is a very natural and refreshing and light scent that is never overpowering.</li>
            <li>I usually found this product for a relly good price but the shipping and handling costs more.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered!  </li>
            <li>They have discontinued this scent, but it is by far my favorite scent from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>Fresh feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>So crisp and fresh.</li>
            <li>I like using Juniper Breeze because it&#x27;s scent in so fresh, natural and light.    </li>

            <li>Well when I first sprayed it I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>Juniper Breeze is one of my favorite scents, but I can only find this online.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>but after I gave it a few minutes I ended up loving it and have been using it for 10 years now.</li>

            <li>this scent never gets old (for me)</li>

Well when I first sprayed it I didn&#x27;t like it but after I gave it a few minutes I ended up loving it and have been using it for 10 years now. I buy a bottle every year when they have their buy 3 get 2 free. The smell lasts all day you don&#x27;t have to keep adding it all through out the day. Which is a plus.The body spray goes great with the lotion and anti bacterial soap.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, this does not have a juniper fragrance.  It smells more like a chemical--alcohol ?, cheap.</li>
            <li> smells so good!  love it. discontinued at Bath and Body works, glad I can get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail that I have not stopped wearing it.  It&#x27;s an old bath and body that they should bring back</li>
