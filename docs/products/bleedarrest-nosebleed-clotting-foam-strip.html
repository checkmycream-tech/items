            <li> Problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really plug the nose, so you still get some blood coming out, so it&#x27;s not really as suitable as nasalcease or something that plugs the nostril for social situations.</li>
            <li> I am flat out grateful for it.</li>
            <li> I am also a public speaker and lived for years I fear of suffering a nose bleed in the middle of a discourse or in other public places.</li>
            <li> Have a health condition with  easy bleeding and frequent bloody noses.</li>
            <li> I usually only leave it in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Hard to place into higher sinus, and a real mess if it does get into nasal cavity and stuck.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they come without warning and are major.</li>
            <li> hard to find in store though</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores,</li>
            <li> This makes those awful nosebleeds that happen in public less embarrassing and manageable.  </li>

            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for stopping bleeding--not just your nose either!</li>
            <li> These work great ......sometimes we have to use two of them depending on the blood flow.</li>
            <li> I get occasional nosebleeds. Unfortunately, they come without warning and are major. These strips are so helpful for me. They stop the bleeding quickly and without any pain.  Unlike their competitor, you don&#x27;t have to leave the strip in for 30 minutes. I usually only leave it in for a few minutes.  This makes those awful nosebleeds that happen in public less embarrassing and manageable.  I highly recommend these to anyone who gets nosebleeds!!</li>
            <li> These always work great when needed.</li>
            <li> I have nose bleeds a lot, and these BleedArrest strips work great.!  hard to find in store though, so need to order ahead to have&lt;br /&gt;them on hand in case of a nose bleed that won&#x27;t stop.  A very great product.!  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.!</li>
            <li> Have a health condition with  easy bleeding and frequent bloody noses. Wish, wish, wish they came in 1  1  1/2 times the length. Hard to place into higher sinus, and a real mess if it does get into nasal cavity and stuck.....ER visit. Would rate 5, if they were long enough, they work amazingly well. Next time will wrap in cheese cloth, place it and then should be able to retrieve if it gets stuck to a clot in the nasal passage. Hope this review doesnt gross you out......but maybe manufacturer will read and consider longer lengths.</li>
            <li> These work really well for the nosebleeds that originate high up in the nose towards the sinuses.  Problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really plug the nose, so you still get some blood coming out, so it&#x27;s not really as suitable as nasalcease or something that plugs the nostril for social situations.</li>
            <li> This product works for me and it work fast.I keep some with me at all time. If I can,t  find it in stores, I will go online. I only use BleedArrest. Love it !  I will tell all my friends about BleedArrest.</li>
            <li> would not be without them they have saved my life more than once&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis M Beaver I need at least 4 more boxes to be safe thanks for a true working product P M B</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Became acquainted with these in local emergency room when I sliced off tip of finger and it wouldn&#x27;t stop bleeding. They placed over wound and held in place with bandage.  Hard to find in stores, but I keep on hand in car first aid kit, at work and at home. Time to stock up again.</li>
            <li> Works well for lower sinus nose bleeding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product my whole life. I get nosebleeds in dry weather and am now on blood thinners, so my nosebleeds can be quite epic. I have tried a variety of methods and products but nothing has ever helped as much as BleedArrest. I am flat out grateful for it.</li>
            <li> Product and service is great.</li>
            <li> Love it stops the blood!</li>
            <li> WoundSeal Powder and Applicator did the trick.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic nose bleeds and the problem is aggravated by the use of a woodstove for heating. I am also a public speaker and lived for years I fear of suffering a nose bleed in the middle of a discourse or in other public places. Bleed arrest completely eliminates this fear. Not only does it stop the bleeding after holding it in place for a couple of minutes but I feel completely safe in blowing my nose right after removing it , as when I&#x27;m expaweriencing a cold and frequently needing to blow my nose. It is just as though it had been cauterized and feel noa threat for several days or more. It has truly given me peace of mind. I always carry one in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;  I would wholeheartedly recommend it to others for the reasons mentioned above</li>
            <li> These things have worked great in the past and have become extremely difficult to find at Walgreens, CVS, etc. Hopefully, I won&#x27;t have any use for them for awhile but it&#x27;s good to have them around</li>
            <li> This is the only product that stops my wifes nose bleeds almost immediately</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in stores.  My daughter has really bad nose bleeds and plays a lot of sports.  I have these in every first aid kit.  They stop a nose bleed immediately.</li>
