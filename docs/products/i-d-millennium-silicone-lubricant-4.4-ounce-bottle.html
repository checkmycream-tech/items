    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff, but, the bottom line here is the FACT that it stains sheets.  Stains them so bad that it won&#x27;t even come out after soaking them in oxy clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best lube that hubby and I have ever used. I love it. I would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Been using this for a almost two years now and unlike some of the other reviews I haven&#x27;t had a problem with staining.  It does have a way of getting all over the place so be careful when pouring.</li>
            <li> My GF bout this bottle a little before Valentines day. It feels good, the bottle is a pretty good size, and it cleans easily. I would suggest trying this brand if your in the market.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised!</li>
            <li> Nice and slippery.  You really do have to be careful about how much you put on. Excess thar comes off and gets on any hard surface slippery  too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lube for over 10 years and I love it. :-) This product is excellent for solo sessions and when sparingly used with partners. If your looking for a long lasting lube that feels good to all parties and is condom safe, you have found your lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couple things about the negative reviews you see around: The complaints I see about the bottle leaking and the stained sheets are accurate only if you are not careful. Both can easily be avoided if you understand the nature of this product. This is a SILICONE based lubricant. Silicone is non soluble and this exactly why this product works so well :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also means that it you should be careful using it on sheets or storing it near your clothes because its non-soluable nature means that it will not come out. Silicone will not come out. I always store it in a tiny ziplock bag by itself and it stores safely and easily anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful using it near or on slippery surfaces like bathtubs and showers and tile floors. This lube will stay here and make things dangerously slippery for all who tread the surface. It can easily be washed with soap and water off slippery surfaces makign them safe again. Just be thouough with your cleaning and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it while you are naked and don&#x27;t douse yourself with the stuff and you should have a pretty good time ;-)</li>
            <li> Gets sticky after a few minutes. Drys out too fast. Needs to be reapplied too often. I thought silicone didn&#x27;t have these problems.</li>
            <li> Great product, long lasting.  Shipping was a little slow though.  However, still satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> For those folks who don&#x27;t mind things getting just a little messy, this stuff is the best. It is effective, long lasting, and has a very mild taste</li>
            <li> I really like this silicone. Not greasy or wet feeling. No sticky feelings. Feels like satin</li>
            <li> works like a gem! for those of you who are skeptical, it is a great product! enjoy it with good health</li>
            <li> GET IT. STOP PONDERING, AND GET IT! AND GET THE 4.4 OZ.... TRUST ME...........</li>
            <li> nice for male solo!  Hard to wash off for her.</li>
            <li> This is the best lube I&#x27;ve found for taking matters in hand and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands over the years.</li>
            <li> Everything about this lubricant is what is described. Long lasting with a silky smooth fell. Highly recommend  --  at the store it is 30.00 so this was a big bargain!</li>
            <li> Sadly we never got to use this product as the bottle opened during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;However the contents that leaked were very silky and seemed to work as promised.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say? It gets it&#x27;s job done. It last a very long time and you only need to use such a small amount it can last you quite sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside the bottle will more than likely become very slippery after a few uses. The lid also NEEDS to be closed VERY TIGHTLY or it will leak bad. Be careful about spilling this on any furniture or bed sheets etc. Wash them asap because it will stain. Also does leave a kind of slimey feeling afterwards, so I would advise a shower after use of this item.</li>
