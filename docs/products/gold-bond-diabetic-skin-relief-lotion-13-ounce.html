            <li>So nice on my skin, takes care of itching/burning</li>
            <li>well others liked this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products and this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle of my own.</li>
            <li>I am a diabetic and have been looking for a lotion that is strong and feels good, I have been using it on my feel and it feels amazing</li>
            <li>She was all out so it was great that it got here so quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rate things unless I feel very strongly about them.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing lotions, but this was by far the best.</li>

            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I am a diabetic and I love this.</li>
            <li>many more chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The more chemicals listed, the more chance of allergic reactions.  </li>

            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>To all those who aren&#x27;t sure about getting this...take it from Me...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>no smell, no stain, cracked skin is gone its smooth and nicely toned.</li>
            <li>This lotion was the thickest, silkiest, most moisturizing lotion I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I am not diabetic, it is just simply the best!!!</li>
            <li>Used it and like the results, so I brought more and will order more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I HAD TRIED MANY LOTIONS</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any difference from most brand name lotions.</li>
            <li>Not cracked any more.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any lotion I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is the only one you have lol!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad they did.  </li>
            <li>When it was time to buy more lotion this is the one I picked up at the store.  </li>
            <li>I Love it.  </li>
            <li>She has been using it for several days, and says that it&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li>If only it were perfect.</li>
            <li>Definite the best skin product I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is a must item for anyone with any type of diabetes - your skin will love it and appreciate it</li>
            <li>One of the problems I have with most lotions is the hands having a greasy feel that lingers after application.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m able to play my piano, cook, etc.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams over the years and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet most evenings and on my hands two or three times every day.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it at a much better price on Amazon along with some cream for his feet.  </li>
            <li>they are softer now and he says they feel better than ever.</li>
            <li>must I have more that one around the house and one in the car.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive, so I plan to order more when needed.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have diabetes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering one more bottle for him.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will buy more of this</li>
            <li>I have just ordered 2 more 13 oz.</li>
            <li>It is the best (and only) product that has met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>This and the other products they make are excellent and effective.</li>
            <li>My skin is so Soft...non greasy...and alittle goes a long way &#x3D;D woop! Woop!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found that Gold Bond, a brand I&#x27;d already used myself and liked, had come out with this diabetic cream.</li>
            <li>I loved the feel of the lotion and the way it made my skin soft and nice feeling.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean smell!</li>
            <li>The best cure to a very dry skin 😃</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and has practically has so order, but most importantly I can feel &amp; see the difference immediately</li>
            <li>but I love fragrance free lotion for bedtime.  </li>
            <li>have no other lotions to compare with, besides my Vaseline with cocoa butter that is pretty great, too !</li>
            <li>This is a good enough lotion, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any great difference between this product and other Gold Bond lotions.  </li>
            <li>Water easily washes away lotion from your hands, after application----NOT greasy.</li>
            <li>easy to use and no smell.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize, and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>works really well, very smooth!</li>
            <li>Anyway, thought this Ultimate for diabetics would be the best choice, logically.</li>
            <li>works fine</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry skin, keeps it great for over 24 hours, no mess,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used regular fragrance free Gold Bond lotion for years, so I was happy to get this for her.  </li>
            <li>The advertisement is absolutely accurate.</li>
            <li>The product itself worked great, but the pump left quite a bit in the bottom of the bottle that was unobtainable.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much i gave a bottle to my mother in law who has problem skin on her legs...</li>
            <li>I also would recommend Gold Bond Diabetic Foot Cream, also available via amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to have diabetes to enjoy the smoothing benefits of this no scent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Makes legs smooth in a matter of minutes after applying</li>
            <li>It goes on easily soaks right in, not greasy at all!  </li>
            <li>Ingredients are extremely diversified and some great ones listed, so should be top of the line, for a skin lotion to do its&#x27; job.</li>
            <li>Besides 7 intensive moisturizers, and other great sounding ingredients--not sure why this lotion is labeled for diabetics....</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference !!!</li>
            <li>My husband has extremely dry skin and has tried many lotions and none have worked as good as this Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product was OK at first, then I broke out in rashes.  </li>
            <li>Mostly ones that smell pretty,</li>
            <li>Makes the skin look smooth and the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and found it to be a great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is great for diabetics with dry skin</li>
            <li>Works great on my diabetic dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Just the best product 4 dry , diabetic skin , u see positive results right away</li>
            <li>I’m absolutely floored not to mention delighted with its effectiveness in keeping my dry skin nice and moist over a 24 hr. period.</li>
            <li>They were right when they said non greasy!</li>
            <li>Great product for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Stops most itching and much of that &amp;#34;fire ants biting&amp;#34; feeling of neuropathy.</li>
            <li>This product is good for your skin but only two-thirds of it can be pumped from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I do recommend that you exfoliate the part of your body where you are putting this to get the maximum benefit (and that&#x27;s true for any lotion).  </li>
            <li>my hands stay nice &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my feet feel better.  </li>
            <li>Gold Bond Diabetic Dry Skin Relief is by far the best skin moisturizer I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>Very rich and really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>This worked well on my partners diabetic feet relieving the ashy look and worked quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li>I have many, many different kinds of lotions.  </li>
            <li>BUT YOU MUST USE IT REGULAR, ESPECIALLY AFTER A SHOWER, AND NIGHT IS THE BEST TIME TO.</li>
            <li>This lotoin is very easy to use and within less than an hour you feel nice relief and a moist feeling on your hands and face.  </li>
            <li>Very good lotion, not sure why it&#x27;s advertised just for diabetics, but it works well.  </li>
            <li>And while I&#x27;ve recently found some really great lotions on the market this one is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>This worked very fast!</li>
            <li>Good stuff - absorbs well and lasts a  long time</li>
            <li>works well slightly greasy great for diabetic skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed into skin quickly and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>good product, helps my dry skin</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin for whatever reason, this stuff is good and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have something made especially for diabetics and our peculiar skin.  </li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Product was as expected, good quality.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than others, I still need to add oil and other lotions to quench my thirsty hands.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing how quickly it relieves my dry skin symptoms.</li>
            <li>I chose this lotion because of our good experiences with other Gold Bond products.  </li>
            <li>I can get dressed right away after applying it.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to apply right after your morning shower.</li>
            <li>Works great, I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone with very dry skin!</li>
            <li>This cream is quite fantastic in this regard and I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering with this type of ailment.</li>
            <li>My elbows feel so smooth, and the dry patches of skin on my legs are clearing up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to  comment at a later date.</li>
            <li>Wfter the first application</li>
            <li>all of my life, this is the first product that is not oily and it eliminates the flakiness of my skin, leaving it looking refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this lotion in my local drug stores and I&#x27;m glad I pursued it on-line.  </li>
            <li>, that many pumps are needed before lotion comes out (thought pump was bad--it took lots of pumping, first time only !).</li>
            <li>Non greasy, really works!</li>
            <li>This lotion helps keep your skin smooth and soft.</li>

            <li>Costs a little more, but is a good dry skin relief lotion.</li>
            <li>It truly makes my skin soft and it feels like my skin absorbs it like  a tall cool glass of water on a hot day.</li>
            <li>Especially great as he had big toe amputated last August and feet were very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>It really is more effective than any other lotion for dry skin.  </li>

            <li>I have purchased MANY lotions claiming to make a difference in dry feet.</li>
            <li>I recently started a job where I am washing dishes in strong detergents and chemicals for about 2 hours a day.</li>

            <li>Really helps our skin be moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I was all ready for it</li>
            <li>This cream really works the minute you use it.  </li>
            <li>I changed my bath soap which did not help much either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gold Bond Diabetic relief was effective the same day and my itching was relieved instantly.</li>
            <li>My old Razac lotion does a much better job on my feet and last all</li>
            <li>So far I have recommended it to several people all of whom have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but this lotion works FABULOUS and that&#x27;s saying a lot for as dry as my skin is.  ; )</li>
            <li>This is not a problem right now but will be when it get near the bottom.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry skin due to the heat in my home!  </li>
            <li>the only cream that really stops itching is Sarna Original</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, more than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Immediate results and absorbs faster than most other creams.  </li>
            <li>This is, for whatever reason, just better than the other Gold Bond lotions we have used.  </li>
            <li>I would not have purchased it had it not been for a long wait sitting in doc&#x27;s waiting room and noticing a free sample.  </li>
            <li>Sinks right in no gummy feeling just makes skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for softening the dry areas.  </li>
            <li>I think most of the slight rash is from chlorine</li>
            <li>As I get older, my skin becomes drier.</li>
            <li>will definitely buy more in the future</li>
            <li>His podiatrist had said to look to see if any brands had urea as a main ingredient, as that&#x27;s what he relies on.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy, and deeply moisturizes your skin.  </li>
            <li>Much better for a diabetic than standard lotion and seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this to anyone not just people with diabeties</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After 1 week of using it, my super dry (to the point of hard heels) feet are so much softer and getting better every day!</li>

            <li>Lotion is nice and thick and I think it works great~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works quickly and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>Because I am diabetic, and also take Warfarin (Blood Thinner), my arms and hands have suffered from very dry skins, and blotches similar to bruises for many years.</li>
            <li>He is diabetic and even though we live in Mexico City, we find a way to get this lotion home.  </li>
            <li>this new gold bond diabetes products will rock the market once people try them .like</li>
            <li>This lotion made my skin feel like new.  </li>
            <li>Also check the contents of any new clothing.</li>
            <li>After one aplacation my skin on my legs became very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I bought at WM for $5.67) which is very hard to find as it is so popular</li>
            <li>I often smooth or pat on a little body oil just to keep the moisture in and find that my skin stays softer longer</li>
            <li>The vendors on Amazon sell it for a lot more because they know how hard it is to find.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion since it keeps my dry skin moistened longer than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>my arms appear almosr clear of any of ther symptoms.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and not itchy.</li>
            <li>Fast acting and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is lush going on with no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have diabetics I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to heal my shins damaged by old man knocks and tumbles.</li>
            <li>my legs are not as red and does not itch as much.</li>
            <li>Lotion really makes a big difference...</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel sooooooo soft and without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion leaves my skin feeling so soft and moist.</li>
            <li>Now my skin feels soft even after wearing support hose all day.  </li>
            <li>WAIT TILL YOU SEE HOW SOFT YOUR SKIN GETS.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in proper diabetic skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this lotion works on my feet.</li>
            <li>I was using a standard skin lotion (similar to Vaseline) without success.</li>
            <li>This lotion I only have to put on once a day because it is nice and thick</li>
            <li>but this was thicker and worked very fast on my dry skin and</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product for an elderly diabetic relative who has very very dry skin.</li>
            <li>In the really dry winter time, I put a coat of Hoof Maker on first.  </li>
            <li>He is not diabetic but has extremely dry skin, this is one of the first products that we have used that has helped relieve the dryness.  </li>
            <li>Note added:  There is no smell with product other than any other very light scent like hand cream.</li>
            <li>First, Gold Bond Ultimate for diabetics is a very thick lotion, unlike most others...</li>
            <li>every time i saw the commercial i became more anxious...</li>
            <li>especially if you are diabectic,I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li>Within a single application we began to see significant improvement and his rhinoceros skin is turning back into something human again!</li>
            <li>Evidently, it has been widely discovered, because it&#x27;s scarce on store shelves.</li>
            <li>but I do have plenty that I have bought trying to battle dry skin in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>It really helped me overnight, even on really dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>and this really works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be the same as the regular Gold Bond -</li>
            <li>If you use it every few days it makes a tremendous difference</li>
            <li>Actually makes my feet soft!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a major improvement.  </li>
            <li>after using it for a few weeks, I can say it&#x27;s much better than other lotions.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is a bit thicker than I generally use</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SO SOFT, BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE I GOT DIABETES.</li>
            <li>its so thick and silky and smooth when you put it on its a must buy.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice non-scented fragrance which reminds of suntan lotion (call me weird).</li>
            <li>In two weeks (after 5 or 6 years of having such fragile skin on his legs)his legs are clear!</li>
            <li>I got a slight tingling and burning at first</li>
            <li>3 days later and only using it once, my feet are still soft and don&#x27;t snag!</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin in the winter and have tried countless lotions with limited success.  </li>
            <li>My hands feel soft for a long time!</li>
            <li>generally the &amp;#34;specially&amp;#34; for something is exactly the same as other (such as eye drops for dry or red or whatever).</li>

            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> To all those who aren&#x27;t sure about getting this...take it from Me...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> no smell, no stain, cracked skin is gone its smooth and nicely toned.</li>
            <li> This lotion was the thickest, silkiest, most moisturizing lotion I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, it is just simply the best!!!</li>
            <li> Used it and like the results, so I brought more and will order more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I HAD TRIED MANY LOTIONS</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference from most brand name lotions.</li>
            <li> Not cracked any more.  </li>
            <li> This works better than any lotion I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one you have lol!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad they did.  </li>
            <li> When it was time to buy more lotion this is the one I picked up at the store.  </li>
            <li> I Love it.  </li>
            <li> She has been using it for several days, and says that it&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li> If only it were perfect.</li>
            <li> Definite the best skin product I have used.  </li>
            <li> This is a must item for anyone with any type of diabetes - your skin will love it and appreciate it</li>
            <li> One of the problems I have with most lotions is the hands having a greasy feel that lingers after application.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m able to play my piano, cook, etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams over the years and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet most evenings and on my hands two or three times every day.</li>
            <li> I was able to find it at a much better price on Amazon along with some cream for his feet.  </li>
            <li> they are softer now and he says they feel better than ever.</li>
            <li> must I have more that one around the house and one in the car.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive, so I plan to order more when needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have diabetes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering one more bottle for him.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will buy more of this</li>
            <li> I have just ordered 2 more 13 oz.</li>
            <li> It is the best (and only) product that has met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> This and the other products they make are excellent and effective.</li>
            <li> My skin is so Soft...non greasy...and alittle goes a long way &#x3D;D woop! Woop!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found that Gold Bond, a brand I&#x27;d already used myself and liked, had come out with this diabetic cream.</li>
            <li> I loved the feel of the lotion and the way it made my skin soft and nice feeling.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean smell!</li>
            <li> The best cure to a very dry skin 😃</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and has practically has so order, but most importantly I can feel &amp; see the difference immediately</li>
            <li> but I love fragrance free lotion for bedtime.  </li>
            <li> have no other lotions to compare with, besides my Vaseline with cocoa butter that is pretty great, too !</li>
            <li> This is a good enough lotion, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any great difference between this product and other Gold Bond lotions.  </li>
            <li> Water easily washes away lotion from your hands, after application----NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> easy to use and no smell.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize, and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> works really well, very smooth!</li>
            <li> Anyway, thought this Ultimate for diabetics would be the best choice, logically.</li>
            <li> works fine</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry skin, keeps it great for over 24 hours, no mess,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used regular fragrance free Gold Bond lotion for years, so I was happy to get this for her.  </li>
            <li> The advertisement is absolutely accurate.</li>
            <li> The product itself worked great, but the pump left quite a bit in the bottom of the bottle that was unobtainable.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much i gave a bottle to my mother in law who has problem skin on her legs...</li>
            <li> I also would recommend Gold Bond Diabetic Foot Cream, also available via amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to have diabetes to enjoy the smoothing benefits of this no scent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes legs smooth in a matter of minutes after applying</li>
            <li> It goes on easily soaks right in, not greasy at all!  </li>
            <li> Ingredients are extremely diversified and some great ones listed, so should be top of the line, for a skin lotion to do its&#x27; job.</li>
            <li> Besides 7 intensive moisturizers, and other great sounding ingredients--not sure why this lotion is labeled for diabetics....</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference !!!</li>
            <li> My husband has extremely dry skin and has tried many lotions and none have worked as good as this Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product was OK at first, then I broke out in rashes.  </li>
            <li> Mostly ones that smell pretty,</li>
            <li> Makes the skin look smooth and the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and found it to be a great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is great for diabetics with dry skin</li>
            <li> Works great on my diabetic dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just the best product 4 dry , diabetic skin , u see positive results right away</li>
            <li> I’m absolutely floored not to mention delighted with its effectiveness in keeping my dry skin nice and moist over a 24 hr. period.</li>
            <li> They were right when they said non greasy!</li>
            <li> Great product for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Stops most itching and much of that &amp;#34;fire ants biting&amp;#34; feeling of neuropathy.</li>
            <li> This product is good for your skin but only two-thirds of it can be pumped from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I do recommend that you exfoliate the part of your body where you are putting this to get the maximum benefit (and that&#x27;s true for any lotion).  </li>
            <li> my hands stay nice &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my feet feel better.  </li>
            <li> Gold Bond Diabetic Dry Skin Relief is by far the best skin moisturizer I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Very rich and really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> This worked well on my partners diabetic feet relieving the ashy look and worked quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li> I have many, many different kinds of lotions.  </li>
            <li> BUT YOU MUST USE IT REGULAR, ESPECIALLY AFTER A SHOWER, AND NIGHT IS THE BEST TIME TO.</li>
            <li> This lotoin is very easy to use and within less than an hour you feel nice relief and a moist feeling on your hands and face.  </li>
            <li> Very good lotion, not sure why it&#x27;s advertised just for diabetics, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> And while I&#x27;ve recently found some really great lotions on the market this one is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li> This worked very fast!</li>
            <li> Good stuff - absorbs well and lasts a  long time</li>
            <li> works well slightly greasy great for diabetic skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed into skin quickly and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> good product, helps my dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin for whatever reason, this stuff is good and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have something made especially for diabetics and our peculiar skin.  </li>
            <li> but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected, good quality.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than others, I still need to add oil and other lotions to quench my thirsty hands.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing how quickly it relieves my dry skin symptoms.</li>
            <li> I chose this lotion because of our good experiences with other Gold Bond products.  </li>
            <li> I can get dressed right away after applying it.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to apply right after your morning shower.</li>
            <li> Works great, I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone with very dry skin!</li>
            <li> This cream is quite fantastic in this regard and I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering with this type of ailment.</li>
            <li> My elbows feel so smooth, and the dry patches of skin on my legs are clearing up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to  comment at a later date.</li>
            <li> Wfter the first application</li>
            <li> all of my life, this is the first product that is not oily and it eliminates the flakiness of my skin, leaving it looking refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this lotion in my local drug stores and I&#x27;m glad I pursued it on-line.  </li>
            <li> , that many pumps are needed before lotion comes out (thought pump was bad--it took lots of pumping, first time only !).</li>
            <li> Non greasy, really works!</li>
            <li> This lotion helps keep your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and my mother ordered it here first.</li>

            <li> WORKS GREAT ON MY HANDS , JUST WISH IT WOULD DO THE SAME ON MY DRY FEET...</li>
            <li> Costs a little more, but is a good dry skin relief lotion.</li>
            <li> It truly makes my skin soft and it feels like my skin absorbs it like  a tall cool glass of water on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Especially great as he had big toe amputated last August and feet were very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> It really is more effective than any other lotion for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> As he has grown older, his legs developed huge scab-like things which the doc could not remedy.</li>

            <li> I recently started a job where I am washing dishes in strong detergents and chemicals for about 2 hours a day.</li>

            <li> Sinks right in no gummy feeling just makes skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for softening the dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I think most of the slight rash is from chlorine</li>
            <li> As I get older, my skin becomes drier.</li>
            <li> will definitely buy more in the future</li>
            <li> His podiatrist had said to look to see if any brands had urea as a main ingredient, as that&#x27;s what he relies on.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy, and deeply moisturizes your skin.  </li>

            <li> Diabetic dad loves it...comparable to high priced diabetic creams</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be posting an update after using the product for a few more months.</li>
            <li> Lotion is nice and thick and I think it works great~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works quickly and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Because I am diabetic, and also take Warfarin (Blood Thinner), my arms and hands have suffered from very dry skins, and blotches similar to bruises for many years.</li>
            <li> He is diabetic and even though we live in Mexico City, we find a way to get this lotion home.  </li>
            <li> this new gold bond diabetes products will rock the market once people try them .like</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin feel like new.  </li>
            <li> Also check the contents of any new clothing.</li>
            <li> After one aplacation my skin on my legs became very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I bought at WM for $5.67) which is very hard to find as it is so popular</li>
            <li> I often smooth or pat on a little body oil just to keep the moisture in and find that my skin stays softer longer</li>
            <li> The vendors on Amazon sell it for a lot more because they know how hard it is to find.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion since it keeps my dry skin moistened longer than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> my arms appear almosr clear of any of ther symptoms.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and not itchy.</li>
            <li> Fast acting and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is lush going on with no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have diabetics I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to heal my shins damaged by old man knocks and tumbles.</li>
            <li> my legs are not as red and does not itch as much.</li>
            <li> Lotion really makes a big difference...</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel sooooooo soft and without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves my skin feeling so soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Now my skin feels soft even after wearing support hose all day.  </li>
            <li> WAIT TILL YOU SEE HOW SOFT YOUR SKIN GETS.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference in proper diabetic skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this lotion works on my feet.</li>
            <li> I was using a standard skin lotion (similar to Vaseline) without success.</li>
            <li> This lotion I only have to put on once a day because it is nice and thick</li>
            <li> but this was thicker and worked very fast on my dry skin and</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product for an elderly diabetic relative who has very very dry skin.</li>
            <li> In the really dry winter time, I put a coat of Hoof Maker on first.  </li>
            <li> He is not diabetic but has extremely dry skin, this is one of the first products that we have used that has helped relieve the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Note added:  There is no smell with product other than any other very light scent like hand cream.</li>
            <li> First, Gold Bond Ultimate for diabetics is a very thick lotion, unlike most others...</li>
            <li> every time i saw the commercial i became more anxious...</li>
            <li> especially if you are diabectic,I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> Within a single application we began to see significant improvement and his rhinoceros skin is turning back into something human again!</li>
            <li> Evidently, it has been widely discovered, because it&#x27;s scarce on store shelves.</li>
            <li> but I do have plenty that I have bought trying to battle dry skin in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> It really helped me overnight, even on really dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing to dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> and this really works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be the same as the regular Gold Bond -</li>
            <li> If you use it every few days it makes a tremendous difference</li>
            <li> Actually makes my feet soft!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing a major improvement.  </li>
            <li> after using it for a few weeks, I can say it&#x27;s much better than other lotions.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is a bit thicker than I generally use</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SO SOFT, BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE I GOT DIABETES.</li>
            <li> its so thick and silky and smooth when you put it on its a must buy.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice non-scented fragrance which reminds of suntan lotion (call me weird).</li>
            <li> In two weeks (after 5 or 6 years of having such fragile skin on his legs)his legs are clear!</li>
            <li> I got a slight tingling and burning at first</li>
            <li> 3 days later and only using it once, my feet are still soft and don&#x27;t snag!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter and have tried countless lotions with limited success.  </li>
            <li> My hands feel soft for a long time!</li>
            <li> generally the &amp;#34;specially&amp;#34; for something is exactly the same as other (such as eye drops for dry or red or whatever).</li>
            <li> It is worth the trouble!!</li>
            <li> Not any better or worse than any other simalar product....</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, I fight dry skin constantly, and this product not only alleviates the dryness immediately, it even lasts through a shower.</li>
            <li> I only received the Gold Bond Ultimate rough &amp; bumpy skin Daily Therapy Cream which seems to be working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs instantly with no greasy feel and lasts for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Very dry climate, very low humidity (central Idaho Mountains)</li>
            <li> I especially like how this product moisturizes my legs (which are dry).</li>
            <li> but my left foot is unusually dry</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with winter related dry skin also.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product if you have dry, calloused feet!</li>
            <li> It might just do the job on feet unless they are in real bad shape but this like other item is 100% best have ever used</li>
            <li> As a diabetic my skin (especially my feet) and my husband&#x27;s are very dry, I have always us Gold Bond Lotion</li>
            <li> I had a very dry patch on the back of my leg</li>
            <li> My skin is so very dry especially during heating season.  </li>
            <li> I had re-applied my normal lotion at least 20 times and was doing it constantly.</li>
            <li> Upon perusing its long list of chemicals:  water, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, dimethicone, jojoba esters, petrolatum, cetyl alcohol, distearyldimonium chloride, aloe leaf juice, stearyl alcohol, cycloper..., ceteryl alchohol, behe...., chamomilla flower extract .....</li>
            <li> I cut the bottle  when nearly empty and put the remaining lotion in a different container.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy as long as it works.</li>
            <li> This lotion give me relieve immediately and as long as I keep using it</li>
            <li> I have been using Gold Bond Ultimate for my feet because it was recommended by the Wound Care Center that has treated me often.</li>
            <li> As we all know this has been one of the coldest winters in a long long time.</li>
            <li> Several other items damaged or spilled in box.  </li>
            <li> While the other Gold Bond lotions did help this diabetic lotion seemed to actually help heal my cuts and scratches.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and my skin was dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> if you have dry  skin on legs .</li>
            <li> He does not have diabeties, but it works on his dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband is a diabetic and has dry skin and  rashes that itch.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Living with extremely dry skin (Ichthyosis)</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife as she has had problems with dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes my dry patches without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hands used to be like a cheese grater, they were so dry and scratchy.</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic but have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I bought this because my diabetes seems to trigger cellulitis.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and takes care of dry skin in no time.</li>
            <li> I use on my dry feet.</li>
            <li> I always had dry skin before I was ever diagnosed with Diabetes</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who is diabetic, it soothes his dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry.  </li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, but I do know that the battle of dry skin is non-stop for a person who is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and would get this dry flaky skin on sides of my nose and in between my eyes.</li>
            <li> Heard about it on TV &amp; my skin is so dry</li>
            <li> Am diabetic and have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> STARTED USING THIS, ALL MY DRY SKIN, AND HARDNESS IS GONE.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry flaking shin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin, even before diabetes.  </li>
            <li> Yet my hands look &amp; feel like I don&#x27;t have a dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry it cracks</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re diabetic with dry skin</li>
            <li> Helped my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN FROM ANY CAUSE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, but my mother-in-law was and know this product would have been a miracle for her dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> I have diabetes and my husband has really dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so rich and thick, it is hard to pump it out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that can help his dry skin due to diabetes and dialysis!</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and we can already see vast improvement on his dry feet!</li>
            <li> Dry skin drives me nuts!</li>
            <li> He has diabetes and at nearly 92, he suffers with dry skin (especially since he insists he needs a hot bath daily!)  </li>
            <li> have very dry skin from swimming in a pool 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> My feet and skin are still very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> It penetrates the very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a diabetic but have very dry skin on my hands until way into Spring.</li>
            <li> It instantly relieves the itchy tight feeling on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it also heals as it says, but am anxious to find out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but my rough heels were an issue.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I expected it.</li>
            <li> I notice if anything my feet are drier after only a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  perform as I expected.</li>
            <li> The lotion is too heavy for the pump, my only recourse is to cut the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just replace the substandard pump (which is unable to handle the thickness of the lotion) or merely spoon it from the bottle, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help my husband with the rash he had on his arms, due to this rash....</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> this provides extreme comfort for her almost immediately.</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time on your skin - not like other products that vanish after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is quite thicker than other lotions, out on the market.</li>
            <li> My husband has severe skin problems due to diabetes and no lotion or cream has made a difference - until now.</li>
            <li> Not many lotions work the same</li>
            <li> and I have even told some other people who also are diabetic about it.</li>
            <li> After applying, I usually put on socks and wear slippers for a few hours to keep the lotion on as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way and who wouldn&#x27;t want that !</li>
            <li> but it may work like a charm for other</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and I can personally vouch for that not just for diabetic feet but for feet that have a tendency to be tough due to other medical conditions.</li>
            <li> if this can help my dry feet according to my wife it will turn rocks to mud pies!!!</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, but the harsh winter here in Chicago made my skin bone dry.  </li>
            <li> With Diabetes, my skin is very dry and flakes all over!!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry, dry skin for years and could hardly wait to try this.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this locally.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and one third is wasted by being left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I frequently deal with deep painful cracks on my hands, especially on the fingertips &amp; knuckles as well as on my feet.  </li>
            <li> only negative (and</li>
            <li> the dry cold really dries out my hands .</li>
            <li> commercial says you will likely notice a difference in 1 hour ,Believe it or Not Lol !</li>
            <li> I just started on my fourth bottle, and sadly it will be last purchase unless the manufacturers begin to sell it in jars.</li>
            <li> walmart  had it for 100 less</li>
            <li> My husband is Type 1 Diabetic (had it from juvenile) and his feet and legs get VERY dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this lotion by itself the first time, because I was desperate to get rid of this snagging skin.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to locate but worth the time.</li>
            <li> FOR MY ELBOWS AND FACE, WHICH WERE SO DRY, AND HARD.</li>
            <li> but the prices seem a little lower than in the stores</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing the item, however, it works instantly soothing the skin and taking the dry marks out.  </li>
            <li> After a few days the itching has almost disappeared</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a messy feel on my hands after using it either.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes after application, the slippery feeling is gone</li>
            <li> i bought this for him a few weeks ago and</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and in some places I have it worse then others.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my dry skin which is worse because of my diabetes.</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, however, I have poor circulation and very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Delivery a little slow, 3 weeks, but</li>
            <li> So I think it was a waste of my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> Problem: very itchy skin (not diabetic) with some ugly patchy skin.</li>
            <li> No more itchiness and rash.  </li>
            <li> and she told me she uses hers everyday!  </li>
            <li> I still had to reapply a couple of times, but I used small amounts.</li>
            <li> The itching, flaking and irritation are now a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance free anything seems to be difficult or impossible to find except on-line.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my neighbors after they realized how hard it is to find in stores.</li>
            <li> absorbs into skin nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> at least not for me</li>
            <li> - have your changed anything lately?  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, with no scent.  </li>
            <li> Too thick to be pumped...</li>
            <li> The lotion is so thick that all of it cannot be pumped out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> so thick</li>
            <li> Being so thick, any lotion remaining @</li>
            <li> This lotion is not as thick as I thought it would be based on the foot lotion.</li>
            <li> its REALLY THICK like glue almost.</li>
            <li> It is too thick for the pump.</li>
            <li> I tried other means to get it out, and it was extremely difficult.  </li>
            <li> I have jars of very expensive, high-end department store creams with French names, but they just were not doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I just don&#x27;t like the packaging (I think it&#x27;s ... ugly)</li>
            <li> bottom when rest is used up, might be hard to get out--so use your imagination on that !</li>
            <li> This factor could be a problem for people who have weak or arthritic hands.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: try to get to the root cause of the itch.</li>
            <li> Very thick and moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thick, non-greasy, virtually odorless.  </li>
            <li> the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the lotion is very, very thick.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for so long to find a cream that is not so oily that it holds the moisture in behind it as I suffer with leg ulcers and this is the worst scenario.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> I am arthritic, and cutting the bottle is tedious for me.</li>
            <li> It is difficult or impossible to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I am not using this for diabetic skin problems but rather for my keratosis pilaris or chicken skin condition.  </li>
            <li> I have had this all my life and during the winter months it gets really unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The skin on the bottom of my feet would snag on fabrics, and it was driving my crazy!</li>
            <li> It was annoying and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience my company is upset.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this would help my husband with the rash he had on his arms, due to this rash....but it wasn&#x27;t as helpful as another product.</li>
            <li> This is very beneficial to my husband in helping with his psoriasis.</li>
            <li> The extraordinary best for us diabetic&#x27;s</li>
            <li> OMG!! I have diabetes and my skin was dry and cracked. I tried all the lotions on the drug store shelf and they did nothing. They made my skin drier and itchy. I saw this on TV and thought, I tried everything might as well try this. IT WORKS!! My skin is soft and not itchy. My skin is smooth and looks great. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The best cure to a very dry skin 😃</li>
            <li> This product could not be found in local stores, but Amazon had it. Delivery a little slow, 3 weeks, but no biggie, this is a very good product for diabetes patients.</li>
            <li> As a diabetic my skin (especially my feet) and my husband&#x27;s are very dry, I have always us Gold Bond Lotion but when we were in the USA last winter I bought some Diabetic Gold Bond I really thought it would be the same as the regular Gold Bond - but this was thicker and worked very fast on my dry skin and feet - Thanks Gold Bond</li>
            <li> My partner has had type II diabetes for many years. As he has grown older, his legs developed huge scab-like things which the doc could not remedy. Within a week of using the cream on his legs, the scab things started disappearing. In two weeks (after 5 or 6 years of having such fragile skin on his legs)his legs are clear! It seems like a miracle to me. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> This worked well on my partners diabetic feet relieving the ashy look and worked quickly.  He uses it every day now.  Especially great as he had big toe amputated last August and feet were very dry and cracked. Not anymore.  Yeah!</li>
            <li> This lotoin is very easy to use and within less than an hour you feel nice relief and a moist feeling on your hands and face.  Not greasy or sticky feeling so nice to work with an positve results.  Note added:  There is no smell with product other than any other very light scent like hand cream.</li>
            <li> Great product for skin that needs added moisture. I can&#x27;t stand scented lotions on my hands or lotions that stay on top of the skin instead of entering it this brand is excellent for both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for Gold Bond to add a Diabetic product line. This and the other products they make are excellent and effective.</li>
            <li> This is a good enough lotion, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any great difference between this product and other Gold Bond lotions.  Expected more.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I noticed immediate changes shortly after I applied it. The lotion is very soothing and does not leave a greasy film on the skin. I had a very dry patch on the back of my leg and now it is has practically disappeared. Thank you Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and I love this. I wish they made it in bigger bottles</li>
            <li> I do like this lotion.  My skin is so very dry especially during heating season.  This lotion brings relief.  The only thing I would change is the bottle it comes in.  This lotion is so rich and thick, it is hard to pump it out of a bottle.  I transferred it into a jar and find it easier to apply from there.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be diabetic to appreciate and benefit from  this product.  It truly makes my skin soft and it feels like my skin absorbs it like  a tall cool glass of water on a hot day. It also is unscented which I especially appreciate.  I won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic but my father is. This lotion is great for my hands and for his feet! Helps prevent cracking and drying out, not greasy at all. No smell either.</li>
            <li> This product was OK at first, then I broke out in rashes.  Upon perusing its long list of chemicals:  water, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, dimethicone, jojoba esters, petrolatum, cetyl alcohol, distearyldimonium chloride, aloe leaf juice, stearyl alcohol, cycloper..., ceteryl alchohol, behe...., chamomilla flower extract .....many more chemicals.  What alarmed me was chamomilla flower, which is in the ragweed family.  I&#x27;m allergic to ragweed.  The more chemicals listed, the more chance of allergic reactions.  I stopped this product, and used NOW avocado oil, or NOW almond oil instead.  No more itchiness and rash.  Not the best product for folks with allergies.  The plus of this product:  it&#x27;s thick, with no scent.  But I prefer food-based lotion like avocado oil or almond oil, since I can handle food without worrying of chemical taste contamination.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who is diabetic and in her mid 80&#x27;s. She said it makes her legs feel wonderful. I just bought her 2 more bottles!!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product for an elderly diabetic relative who has very very dry skin. They really liked the product for their hands &amp; feet. Then, I received a sample in a magazine and now this has become my favorite all around moisturizer. I especially like how this product moisturizes my legs (which are dry). It&#x27;s not greasy and has practically has so order, but most importantly I can feel &amp; see the difference immediately AND it lasts all day. My only complaint is that I just don&#x27;t like the packaging (I think it&#x27;s ... ugly) and I would of never purchase this product had I not received a sample. It would also be nice if the cream came in a tube so that I could have one for my purse or car.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion since it keeps my dry skin moistened longer than other lotions I&#x27;ve used. I recommend for anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself worked great, but the pump left quite a bit in the bottom of the bottle that was unobtainable.  I tried other means to get it out, and it was extremely difficult.  For that reason alone, I won&#x27;t buy this again.  Packaging needs some work.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have used it for a month now. Only thing is I wish they had bigger bottles. lol. I love it cause its not greasy when you put it on. And no smell. I have dry skin and in some places I have it worse then others. This seems to help it and heal it. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This lotion lives up to what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin from swimming in a pool 3 days a week. After one aplacation my skin on my legs became very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend this to anyone not just people with diabeties</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it works well.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is the best diabetc cream I  have ever used. It is the ony none prescription cream that has ever worked.</li>
            <li> Great lotion!  Totally non-greasy.  I can play the piano after applying without residue on the keys.  Feels great.</li>
            <li> Pump does not work. The lotion itself is great. Just replace the substandard pump (which is unable to handle the thickness of the lotion) or merely spoon it from the bottle, and you&#x27;re good to go. Stops most itching and much of that &amp;#34;fire ants biting&amp;#34; feeling of neuropathy.</li>
            <li> Too thick to be pumped...it should be in a tube or bottle. I use the pump stick to put it in my hands to apply. The lotion is great tho.</li>
            <li> good product,  good price</li>
            <li> This lotion feels so good. I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it, and will order it again.</li>
            <li> my  husband uses this lotion  for  his dry  leg skin and  usesit every day he just love it  his  skin is looking  better every day.  do recommend to buy  if you have dry  skin on legs .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my neighbors after they realized how hard it is to find in stores. She was all out so it was great that it got here so quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that this pricey lotion served it&#x27;s purpose.  My feet and skin are still very, very dry.  So I think it was a waste of my hard earned money.  I&#x27;ll stick with vaseline.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my legs and arms.  This product is fantastic for softening the dry areas.  I would recommend it for anyone and will buy it again myself.</li>
            <li> I think this got to the plant without being damaged.  Needed for 50th Anniversary celebration next week.  Several other items damaged or spilled in box.  Horrible experience my company is upset.</li>
            <li> Very thick and moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling on your skin. Great for heels, elbows and knees. Also for legs just after shaving.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is ome of the best lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> I NEEDED THIS WORKD ON MY SKIN WHICH TENDS TO FLAKE BEING A DIABETIC MY SKIN IS IMPROVING EACH DAY I USE THIS.</li>
            <li> My husband has extremely dry skin and has tried many lotions and none have worked as good as this Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion.  He does not have diabeties, but it works on his dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this item over the weekend from one of the local drug stores after seeing a TV ad and doing the research. I’m absolutely floored not to mention delighted with its effectiveness in keeping my dry skin nice and moist over a 24 hr. period. There’s no oily, slimy residue after use either and as a man, like the fact that it’s unscented. I highly recommend this product and would gladly make a commercial for it gratis! Kudos to the manufacturers for coming up with an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, however, I have poor circulation and very dry skin.  This lotion is amazing how quickly it relieves my dry skin symptoms.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember ordering this yet nor have I received it. I only received the Gold Bond Ultimate rough &amp; bumpy skin Daily Therapy Cream which seems to be working. I&#x27;ll be able to  comment at a later date.</li>
            <li> This cream almost instantly moisturises my skin. Initially purchased for my parents who are diabetic. But now the entire family uses it because of the great results!</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED &amp; USED GOLD BOND PRODUCTS WITH GOOD RESULTS, AND THIS PRODUCT IS NO EXCEPTION. WORKS GREAT ON MY HANDS , JUST WISH IT WOULD DO THE SAME ON MY DRY FEET...BUT THEN AGAIN IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE TO TRULY FIND SOMETHING THAT DOES...JUST THE SAME , WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT...</li>
            <li> Bought for someone else. Seems to be good feedback.</li>
            <li> Because I am diabetic, and also take Warfarin (Blood Thinner), my arms and hands have suffered from very dry skins, and blotches similar to bruises for many years. Wfter the first application I notice a change in appareance for my hands and arms. The conditions have gradually gotten better. Spmetimes my arms appear almosr clear of any of ther symptoms. Thanks for making this great producr</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Diabetic Dry Skin Relief is by far the best skin moisturizer I have ever used!! It penetrates the very dry skin. I buy it in bulk from Amazon. There are no cons, just pros!!</li>
            <li> I chose this lotion because of our good experiences with other Gold Bond products.  My husband is a diabetic and has dry skin and  rashes that itch.  We would suggest a different container (dispenser).  The lotion is so thick that all of it cannot be pumped out of the bottle.  I cut the bottle  when nearly empty and put the remaining lotion in a different container.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already rated this.  I bought more.  And I will continue to buy  more until I cab find the stuff in my city.</li>
            <li> This product is good for your skin but only two-thirds of it can be pumped from the bottle. It is very thick and one third is wasted by being left in the bottle. This cream should be in a jar. Gold Bond needs to do an online survey. I think I&#x27;ll send them an email. Too costly for two-thirds of the product. I buy this product often for my Mom who is a diabetic.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter and have tried countless lotions with limited success.  Gold Bond Diabetic is the answer; it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Living with extremely dry skin (Ichthyosis) all of my life, this is the first product that is not oily and it eliminates the flakiness of my skin, leaving it looking refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this lotion in my local drug stores and I&#x27;m glad I pursued it on-line.  Ilove this lotion.  Finally something for diabetics that is as advertised.  Fast acting and non-greasy.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I liked it very much. It&#x27;s excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a diabetic, but I love this lotion.  I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever found for moisturizing my hands.</li>
            <li> Nongreasy.  Immediate results and absorbs faster than most other creams.  No bothersome odor or scent.  Good value for this type of product.</li>
            <li> My nail tech recommended during a pedicure. I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but my rough heels were an issue. Made a huge difference after one week of use!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife as she has had problems with dry itchy skin.  After a few days the itching has almost disappeared</li>
            <li> Costs a little more, but is a good dry skin relief lotion. Works quickly and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Will return to review product and re-rate item if necessary, after testing ! First, Gold Bond Ultimate for diabetics is a very thick lotion, unlike most others...so thick, that many pumps are needed before lotion comes out (thought pump was bad--it took lots of pumping, first time only !). Being so thick, any lotion remaining @ bottom when rest is used up, might be hard to get out--so use your imagination on that ! Ingredients are extremely diversified and some great ones listed, so should be top of the line, for a skin lotion to do its&#x27; job. Water easily washes away lotion from your hands, after application----NOT greasy. No smell ! Besides 7 intensive moisturizers, and other great sounding ingredients--not sure why this lotion is labeled for diabetics....have no other lotions to compare with, besides my Vaseline with cocoa butter that is pretty great, too ! Would like to see the differences between the several Gold Bond lotions---Anyway, thought this Ultimate for diabetics would be the best choice, logically. Hypoallergenic, too. 13 oz. plastic bottle, AND just a dab will do ya !</li>
            <li> Not any better or worse than any other simalar product....the only cream that really stops itching is Sarna Original</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this thinking it was the diabetic foot cream but it wasn&#x27;t.  Still for the purpose advertised I am confident it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Works great, I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone with very dry skin!</li>
            <li> this lotion is like heaven for your skin its so thick and silky and smooth when you put it on its a must buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my dry skin which is worse because of my diabetes. This lotion is superior to anything that i tried. I liked it so much i gave a bottle to my mother in law who has problem skin on her legs...this provides extreme comfort for her almost immediately. She wants me to order additional bottles. Thisis the only lotion that calms the irratation.. great product!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li> Glad to see Amazon has this--I bought a bottle at Wal-Mart yesterday and applied it to legs, arms, hands, and feet yesterday.  In awe of the results.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Call me a skeptic.. generally the &amp;#34;specially&amp;#34; for something is exactly the same as other (such as eye drops for dry or red or whatever). This ingredient list is different, and so I thought I&#x27;d try it. It really helped me overnight, even on really dry skin. I have many types of lotions but this one is going to become a staple.</li>
            <li> Very good hand lotion especially if you are diabectic,I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> As I get older, my skin becomes drier. This lotion is the best that I have found to keep my skin comfortable and healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It does what it says it will do. I&#x27;ve been a diabetic for 53 years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I have been greatly impressed by this product, and I am so glad that amazon carries it. It is difficult or impossible to find in my area. As a diabetic, I fight dry skin constantly, and this product not only alleviates the dryness immediately, it even lasts through a shower. By using it daily, I have no problem now. I also would recommend Gold Bond Diabetic Foot Cream, also available via amazon.com. It works great on my feet and nothing else has ever worked. Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Great product for very dry skin.  It goes on easily soaks right in, not greasy at all!  It really makes a difference !!!</li>
            <li> works well.  a bit thicker than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
            <li> With Diabetes, my skin is very dry and flakes all over!!  Gold Bond Diabetic relief was effective the same day and my itching was relieved instantly.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, more than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Wonder that it is not sticky or greasy either.</li>
            <li> Good product still enjoying the benefits of it and will definitly buy it again. Really like the feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion for diabetic dry skin.  I use it after every shower or bath .. and have purchased it many times again.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin for whatever reason, this stuff is good and worth the price.  I order it every month.</li>
            <li> I wondered how this would differ from the regular Gold Bond healing cream I had, but it is definitely a winner.  It moisturizes my dry patches without being greasy.  There is all day relief from the itching and flaking skin with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father who is diabetic.  He wakes up at night with itchy skin and has tried just about everything.  This didn&#x27;t help him.  Won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Lotion is nice and thick and I think it works great~&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Very good lotion, not sure why it&#x27;s advertised just for diabetics, but it works well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a messy feel on my hands after using it either.</li>
            <li> Nice to have something made especially for diabetics and our peculiar skin.  It seems to work well for daily use.</li>
            <li> After just one application, my hands were softer than they have ever been.  And it lasts a long time on your skin - not like other products that vanish after a few minutes.  I do recommend that you exfoliate the part of your body where you are putting this to get the maximum benefit (and that&#x27;s true for any lotion).  Even if you don&#x27;t exfoliate, it&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found, and I have tried many. Not greasy, no wierd smell. My hands used to be like a cheese grater, they were so dry and scratchy. This did the trick, now I use it all over. I even keep a spare bottle at work.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion! I&#x27;m diabetic, and I laughed at the commercials... Until I tried it! Non greasy, really works!</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic but have dry skin.  This is lush going on with no greasy feel.  I will continue to buy as long as it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and have had medical problems. While I don&#x27;t have diabetics I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to heal my shins damaged by old man knocks and tumbles. While the other Gold Bond lotions did help this diabetic lotion seemed to actually help heal my cuts and scratches.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I bought this because my diabetes seems to trigger cellulitis. This lotion helps more than anything on the market!</li>
            <li> My husband has been hospitalized with Diabetic skin issues and this lotion helps his legs.</li>
            <li> My family has 3 diabetics and we love this lotion.  It is not greasy and takes care of dry skin in no time. It has a clean smell!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this locally.  It must be popular!  Glad I found it on Amazon so I could give it a try.  It really is more effective than any other lotion for dry skin.  It instantly relieves the itchy tight feeling on my arms and legs.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> This is, for whatever reason, just better than the other Gold Bond lotions we have used.  It is not just for diabetics!  Evidently, it has been widely discovered, because it&#x27;s scarce on store shelves.</li>
            <li> I use on my dry feet. Not a heel crack one. Dont have diabetes, but the richer formula is very effective.</li>
            <li> This lotion is quite thicker than other lotions, out on the market. It absorbs well &amp; makes my arms &amp; legs feel quite moisturized. I wish I would have found it before my graveyard of lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps keep your skin smooth and soft. If you use it every few days it makes a tremendous difference</li>
            <li> Just the best product 4 dry , diabetic skin , u see positive results right away</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I expected it.</li>
            <li> My husband has severe skin problems due to diabetes and no lotion or cream has made a difference - until now. His podiatrist had said to look to see if any brands had urea as a main ingredient, as that&#x27;s what he relies on. Luckily, I found that Gold Bond, a brand I&#x27;d already used myself and liked, had come out with this diabetic cream. Within a single application we began to see significant improvement and his rhinoceros skin is turning back into something human again!</li>
            <li> my legs are not as red and does not itch as much. easy to use and no smell. works fine</li>
            <li> Lotion really makes a big difference...My Podiatrist recommends this...it really is superb</li>
            <li> Lotion works great.  It&#x27;s absorbed into skin quickly and does not feel greasy.  Also has a very light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This Lotion is so amazing!! I searched every market, every store...every time i saw the commercial i became more anxious...once i found it on Amazon !! Yaaaay!! Ooooweeee!! I am a Happy Camper &#x3D;) Finally someone got it righ3!! My skin is so Soft...non greasy...and alittle goes a long way &#x3D;D woop! Woop!! Thanx again!!  You&#x27;ve made my Life much better and Happier!! To all those who aren&#x27;t sure about getting this...take it from Me...this is the One!! Get it!! Be Happy!! I am all Smiles Now...</li>
            <li> The same goes for this . We have also ordered this for my Step Daughter . Also she is using the Diabetic Cook book</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice and soaks in easily without leaving your skin all greasy and smelly.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my back, legs, feet, hands and arms. It has a really nice non-scented fragrance which reminds of suntan lotion (call me weird).</li>
            <li> Works great.  Seems like it would be greasy but not at all.  Really helped with leg skin problems.  Like the pump.</li>
            <li> Great great cream...have never used anything better, whether your a diabetic or not, this is a great cream and it works like it said...</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, but the harsh winter here in Chicago made my skin bone dry.  I have jars of very expensive, high-end department store creams with French names, but they just were not doing the trick.  I saw a commercial on TV for this, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  I am so glad I did.  It is nothing short of a miracle.  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy, and deeply moisturizes your skin.  The effect lasts, too.  It&#x27;s not a temporary fix.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry skin, keeps it great for over 24 hours, no mess, no smell, no stain, cracked skin is gone its smooth and nicely toned.</li>
            <li> This lotion was the thickest, silkiest, most moisturizing lotion I have ever bought. I bought it for my boyfriend who is diabetic but now I also buy it for myself and I am not diabetic, it is just simply the best!!!</li>
            <li> personally it worked well for me and my mother ordered it here first. It works as advertised and I can personally vouch for that not just for diabetic feet but for feet that have a tendency to be tough due to other medical conditions. Great!</li>
            <li> Used it and like the results, so I brought more and will order more when it runs out. great product.</li>
            <li> I always had dry skin before I was ever diagnosed with Diabetes but it became even more dry after I got Diabetes.  This lotion give me relieve immediately and as long as I keep using it my hands stay nice &amp; soft.  IF I stop using it then the dryness comes back...but this lotion works FABULOUS and that&#x27;s saying a lot for as dry as my skin is.  ; )</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  Will come back to purchase again for sure. Makes your skin feel sooooooo soft and without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great cream! for diabetic&#x27;s i recommend it. works wonder.</li>
            <li> The best of the bottled skin lotions. I have been using this for years and found it to be a great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for hubby&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who is diabetic, it soothes his dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and there was no difference than regular Gold Bond noticed.</li>
            <li> BEEN DIABETIC I HAD TRIED MANY LOTIONS BUT NONE OF THEM DID WHAT THIS LOTION DID FOR ME. I SUFFER WITH SEVERE DRYNESS AND THIS LOTION WITH HIS TICK FORMULA IT PENETRATES DEEPLY IN MY SKIN AND IT LAST ALL DAY PREVENTING ITCHING. THIS LOTION HAS BECAME MY GOOD FRIEND AND I WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference from most brand name lotions.</li>
            <li> great product &amp; Service</li>
            <li> I have purchased MANY lotions claiming to make a difference in dry feet. Until Gold Bond, not one of them did. This stuff works great! After 1 week of using it, my super dry (to the point of hard heels) feet are so much softer and getting better every day! I didn&#x27;t see a difference in 1 hour like it claims &#x27;some&#x27; people do, but I am seeing a difference and that works for me. I definitely recommend this product if you have dry, calloused feet!</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased it had it not been for a long wait sitting in doc&#x27;s waiting room and noticing a free sample.  Reception staff said I could take it and I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs instantly with no greasy feel and lasts for quite a long time.  In the really dry winter time, I put a coat of Hoof Maker on first.  Cracks heal within 36 hours with noticeable improvement overnight.  .</li>
            <li> I have just been diagnosed with diabetes so this was a great product for me! works really well, very smooth!</li>
            <li> I am not using this for diabetic skin problems but rather for my keratosis pilaris or chicken skin condition.  I have had this all my life and during the winter months it gets really unpleasant.  This works well and is wonderfully ungreasy....I can get dressed right away after applying it.  I often smooth or pat on a little body oil just to keep the moisture in and find that my skin stays softer longer</li>
            <li> Yes indeed - finally. This lotion leaves my skin feeling so soft and moist. Not many lotions work the same say this one does. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it also heals as it says, but am anxious to find out.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just as advertised.  You do see and feel relief in just an hour.  I wish that I had known of this product sooner.  My skin has been so dry.  Now my skin feels soft even after wearing support hose all day.  I highly recommend this lotion for diabetics.</li>
            <li> Product has improved skin quality.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I have suffered from dry, dry skin for years and could hardly wait to try this. I was amazed at how quickly it worked. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> I have many, many different kinds of lotions.  Mostly ones that smell pretty, but I do have plenty that I have bought trying to battle dry skin in certain areas.  I am amazed at how well this stuff works.  I am not diabetic, but I do know that the battle of dry skin is non-stop for a person who is.  My elbows feel so smooth, and the dry patches of skin on my legs are clearing up very quickly.  If you are looking for a lotion that does what it claims, this is it!</li>
            <li> It really makes my feet feel better.  I will be buying it again, when I run out.</li>
            <li> It has helped my husband&#x27;s skin to be so much smoother.  Not cracked any more.  He is happy!  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles and gave 1 to my sister-in-law.  I&#x27;m impressed with mine and she told me she uses hers everyday!  Can&#x27;t get a better recommendation than that!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Will do business again.</li>
            <li> This works better than any lotion I have tried.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  moisturizes, soothes - good stuff...actually &amp;#34;great stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not as thick as I thought it would be based on the foot lotion. I am not a diabetic, but take care of my skin. Really take care of my skin... It is the only one you have lol! I recommend it even for day time use. It is easier to apply right after your morning shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rate things unless I feel very strongly about them. I recently started a job where I am washing dishes in strong detergents and chemicals for about 2 hours a day. I was almost in tears last night from the pain and discomfort of my skin. I had re-applied my normal lotion at least 20 times and was doing it constantly. I had a free sample of this in my drawer and it workrd instantly. Instant soothing and smoothing, and not greasy at all. No residue. I still had to reapply a couple of times, but I used small amounts. I&#x27;m ordering. And just for the record I am not a diabetic.</li>
            <li> Great! It was delivered on time. Eeeeexcellent product!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. Only thing I didn&#x27;t care for is, when you get close to the bottom (won&#x27;t pump out any more)it leavesquite a bit on bottom and sides. It doesn&#x27;t even drain out. I will have to cut up the bottle to get the rest. There is quite a bit left just to throw away.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  Very rich and really moisturizes.  Does not feel greasy or slimy.  I wish it was somewhat scented, but I am not opposed to the scent of it even though it says \\&quot;unscented.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It help my skin a lot</li>
            <li> works well slightly greasy great for diabetic skin</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart deciding since it is especially for people with diabetes.  While it works well on my arms and legs it doesn&#x27;t work on my feet.  I notice if anything my feet are drier after only a few hours.  My old Razac lotion does a much better job on my feet and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good body lotion - don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for feet.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and have been looking for a lotion that is strong and feels good, I have been using it on my feel and it feels amazing, it is  not greasy at all, and it&#x27;s relaxing. when U put it on. I will be ordering another one soon and I have even told some other people who also are diabetic about it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  perform as I expected.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond sent me a sample of this lotion in the mail and I&#x27;m so glad they did.  I loved the feel of the lotion and the way it made my skin soft and nice feeling.  When it was time to buy more lotion this is the one I picked up at the store.  And while I&#x27;ve recently found some really great lotions on the market this one is my current favorite.  The lotion is a bit thicker than I generally use but I like it, it works great and smells like mostly nothing.</li>
            <li> Made me so happy. I&#x27;m diabetic and would get this dry flaky skin on sides of my nose and in between my eyes. It was annoying and embarrassing. This product ameliorated the issue immediately.</li>
            <li> Works as described. It is very soothing to dry itchy skin. Also, since I started to use it, I no longer see the white ash trail on my skin when I draw my nail over it.</li>
            <li> Heard about it on TV &amp; my skin is so dry I decided to try it.  I Love it.  It works really fast too.  Stops the itching at night.</li>
            <li> Much better for a diabetic than standard lotion and seems to last longer.  After applying, I usually put on socks and wear slippers for a few hours to keep the lotion on as long as possible. I also use the foot cream(which I bought at WM for $5.67) which is very hard to find as it is so popular and it works!  The vendors on Amazon sell it for a lot more because they know how hard it is to find.  I already wrote to Amazon about the price discrepancy.  I&#x27;m still looking for another online source so I can have it delivered.</li>
            <li> This is that moisturizer you are always looking for to seep into your skin and not feel greasy. You don&#x27;t have to have diabetes to enjoy the smoothing benefits of this no scent moisturizer. Also, a little goes a long way and who wouldn&#x27;t want that !</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic but I love fragrance free lotion for bedtime.  This stuff is nice.</li>
            <li> Am diabetic and have really dry skin. This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend.  She has been using it for several days, and says that it&#x27;s wonderful!  Her skin is smoother, doesn&#x27;t scale off, and feels good.  She also likes the fact that it is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used regular fragrance free Gold Bond lotion for years, so I was happy to get this for her.  She&#x27;d been looking in local stores and hadn&#x27;t found the Diabetic version.  Fragrance free anything seems to be difficult or impossible to find except on-line.</li>
            <li> This is great for diabetics with dry skin</li>
            <li> Another great product from Gold Bond. Best body lotion that I have used. Very dry climate, very low humidity (central Idaho Mountains) and this is absolutely the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job for my diabetic feet.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cream! The only thing that can help his dry skin due to diabetes and dialysis!</li>
            <li> This product is the best skin cream that I have ever used. The advertisement is absolutely accurate. So far I have recommended it to several people all of whom have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I have struggled for so long to find a cream that is not so oily that it holds the moisture in behind it as I suffer with leg ulcers and this is the worst scenario.  This cream is quite fantastic in this regard and I would highly recommend it to anyone suffering with this type of ailment.</li>
            <li> This lotion works perfect. Makes the skin look smooth and the smell is not bad at all. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If only it were perfect. Though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than others, I still need to add oil and other lotions to quench my thirsty hands.</li>
            <li> Actually makes my feet soft!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST, BOUGHT IT ALSO ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO. FOR MY ELBOWS AND FACE, WHICH WERE SO DRY, AND HARD. STARTED USING THIS, ALL MY DRY SKIN, AND HARDNESS IS GONE. MY SKIN IS SO SOFT, BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE I GOT DIABETES. WHAT A WONDERFUL PRODUCT TO, I WILL BE BUYING THIS FROM NOW ON TO. WAIT TILL YOU SEE HOW SOFT YOUR SKIN GETS. BUT YOU MUST USE IT REGULAR, ESPECIALLY AFTER A SHOWER, AND NIGHT IS THE BEST TIME TO. I USE IT IN THE MORING, AND AT NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP.</li>
            <li> So nice on my skin, takes care of itching/burning</li>
            <li> Good stuff - absorbs well and lasts a  long time</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!  Not greasy and makes my hands feel wonderful.  Now if I could only remember to put it on every time I wash my hands, I&#x27;d be set.</li>
            <li> worked great from the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Definite the best skin product I have used.  I have extremely dry flaking shin.  This product has helped heal my skin - leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a must item for anyone with any type of diabetes - your skin will love it and appreciate it</li>
            <li> I have been using Gold Bond Ultimate for my feet because it was recommended by the Wound Care Center that has treated me often. I don&#x27;t have diabetes but my left foot is unusually dry so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin, even before diabetes.  I frequently deal with deep painful cracks on my hands, especially on the fingertips &amp; knuckles as well as on my feet.  I heard about this product at my diabetes support group &amp; after using it for a few weeks, I can say it&#x27;s much better than other lotions.  One of the problems I have with most lotions is the hands having a greasy feel that lingers after application.  This product does not stay greasy.  Within a few minutes after application, the slippery feeling is gone &amp; I&#x27;m able to play my piano, cook, etc. without getting any lotion on anything.  Yet my hands look &amp; feel like I don&#x27;t have a dry skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be posting an update after using the product for a few more months.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion is the only lotion for me ! As we all know this has been one of the coldest winters in a long long time. the dry cold really dries out my hands . Thank you for making this great lotion Gold Bond ! Could not find this lotion in Southern Ontario so I ordered 3 bottles from Amazon.com . The price was great and the delivery was as fast as predicted ! Thanks again Amazon.com , you came through once again !!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams over the years and this one is my favorite. I use it on my feet most evenings and on my hands two or three times every day. It&#x27;s a great cream.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product.  It really does make a difference in proper diabetic skin care routine.</li>
            <li> works well. absorbs into skin nicely, not greasy. I would recommend this to anyone with winter related dry skin also.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my senior friend, who says it works! She says her feet feel noticeably softer! So on her behalf, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> My mom found this product at Wal-Mart and says it works wonders on my dad&#x27;s itchy legs.  I was able to find it at a much better price on Amazon along with some cream for his feet.  He has diabetes and at nearly 92, he suffers with dry skin (especially since he insists he needs a hot bath daily!)  I am very happy that I was able to get this for them at a far better price than they were able to get it at Wal-Mart.  They had to buy a larger quantity to get the free shipping but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband is Type 1 Diabetic (had it from juvenile) and his feet and legs get VERY dry. especially his feet. i bought this for him a few weeks ago and hes used it every morning and sometimes at night too. its REALLY THICK like glue almost. a little goes a long way and we can already see vast improvement on his dry feet! they are softer now and he says they feel better than ever. i havent even bought this stuff off amazon yet but the prices seem a little lower than in the stores so i will buy the next bottle here. this stuff is AWESOME- get it</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  My skin is so dry it cracks and it is very sensitive.  This lotion I only have to put on once a day because it is nice and thick and I&#x27;m already seeing a major improvement.  I don&#x27;t even have diabetes but a friend who does recommended it to me.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works...........&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re diabetic with dry skin this is the stuff you need.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on and it&#x27;s not greasy works fairly fast 30 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;A must I have more that one around the house and one in the car.</li>
            <li> this works gives me relief all day</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thick, non-greasy, virtually odorless.  Helped my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion.  He is diabetic and even though we live in Mexico City, we find a way to get this lotion home.  It is worth the trouble!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN FROM ANY CAUSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JHE</li>
            <li> This is the best skin lotion I have ever used.  It keeps my skin moisturized all day.  I have several calluses on my feet and they have gradually softened with the use of this product.  I am not diabetic, but my mother-in-law was and know this product would have been a miracle for her dry and cracked skin.  I would highly recommend this product for everyone.  Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive, so I plan to order more when needed.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there!  My hands feel soft for a long time!</li>
            <li> this new gold bond diabetes products will rock the market once people try them .like commercial says you will likely notice a difference in 1 hour ,Believe it or Not Lol ! word of option of this lotion,You might want to try this on entire body including feet before buying foot cream.It might just do the job on feet unless they are in real bad shape but this like other item is 100% best have ever used</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Even helps my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, it works!  Very difficult to locate but worth the time.I will be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
            <li> well others liked this. I am.  diabetic and wanted something that was a healing/moisterizer foe my feet. It didn&#x27;t work as I thought it should. at least not for me but it may work like a charm for other</li>
            <li> A nurse suggested this product for my dad&#x27;s legs.  He is not diabetic but has extremely dry skin, this is one of the first products that we have used that has helped relieve the dryness.  We also purchased the foot cream for his feet.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do wihhout this -- it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected to help my diabetic itching legs. I&#x27;ve used many products and this is a good one.</li>
            <li> This lotion does get the job done. I am a diabetic, and I have been using a variety of lotions, but this is the one I have been using since last year. It does moisturize, and rubs in easily. I did not give it 5 star, because after it reaches a level  of 1/3 in the bottle it becomes a hassle to pump out the lotion. The lotion is too heavy for the pump, my only recourse is to cut the bottle. I am arthritic, and cutting the bottle is tedious for me. Three times, i have done this. I just started on my fourth bottle, and sadly it will be last purchase unless the manufacturers begin to sell it in jars. I am very disappointed because it is a good product. I really wanted to stay with this product.ni just cannot afford to lose so much.</li>
            <li> This is the second Gold Bond skin relief product I purchased to help my wife deal with the skin problems associated with diabetes.</li>
            <li> great price and it works well</li>
            <li> moist but not oily --very good results on feet</li>
            <li> Works great on my diabetic dry skin. Makes legs smooth in a matter of minutes after applying</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with diabetes! It really is effective!</li>
            <li> I love this product I have diabetes and this really works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing lotions, but this was by far the best.</li>
            <li> great product---my diabetic dad loves it---highly recommend</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever.  Really helps our skin be moisturized.  I have diabetes and my husband has really dry skin.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I had ever used! The skin on the bottom of my feet would snag on fabrics, and it was driving my crazy! I tried foot files, ped egg and then applied a regular lotion, and it didn&#x27;t work. My partner who was a diabetic, had some of this lotion left, so I thought I would give it try, even though I&#x27;m not a diabetic. I didn&#x27;t use this lotion by itself the first time, because I was desperate to get rid of this snagging skin. So, while in the shower, I used a pumice stone then applied the lotion. They were right when they said non greasy! This worked very fast! My feet felt like baby&#x27;s skin within minutes. 3 days later and only using it once, my feet are still soft and don&#x27;t snag! I immediately went out and bought another bottle. I highly recommend this lotion. It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> My dad has been suffered by severe itchy skin caused by  diabetes. I bought this lotion for him and he is very satisfied with it. I&#x27;m ordering one more bottle for him. (I think it works only for diabetic itchy skin because it didn&#x27;t work for mosquito bites on my leg.)</li>
            <li> good product, helps my dry skin</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion out there! I am not diabetic, I do wash my hands a lot. Dry skin drives me nuts! I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and gives me relief instantly.</li>
            <li> I had to wait about 3 weeks to get this item I was all ready for it I don&#x27;t think I will buy more of this it don&#x27;t work like you see on tv by the time it got here walmart  had it for 100 less</li>
            <li> I have basically use up 1 13 oz. bottle.  It is great for dry skin due to the heat in my home!  It is suppose to be good for diabetes, but mine is not gone, yet!  I have just ordered 2 more 13 oz. bottles, wishing!</li>
            <li> This cream really works the minute you use it.  I was skeptical of purchasing the item, however, it works instantly soothing the skin and taking the dry marks out.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin feel like new.  It is the best (and only) product that has met my expectations.  The itching, flaking and irritation are now a thing of the past.  My hat is off to Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin. Helps to sooth the irritation and dryness caused by diabetes, without leaving an oily feel to the skin. Highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> if this can help my dry feet according to my wife it will turn rocks to mud pies!!!</li>
            <li> Diabetic dad loves it...comparable to high priced diabetic creams</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this lotion works on my feet. Usually claims are hot air but not this one. end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a diabetic but have very dry skin on my hands until way into Spring. One of my colleagues said, &amp;#34;Try this.&amp;#34; I did and does the job. I ordered a bottle of my own.</li>
            <li> I buy the one for Diabetics and is wonderful.  Sinks right in no gummy feeling just makes skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This is good lotion for my husband!</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion, 13 Ounce is great.  It is keeping my skin from drying out and cracking.</li>
            <li> Problem: very itchy skin (not diabetic) with some ugly patchy skin. I was using a standard skin lotion (similar to Vaseline) without success. I think most of the slight rash is from chlorine - I swim 2-3 times a week. I also suspect my dryer sheets and have changed to sheets without any scent. While I can change dryer sheets or laundry detergent, I can not give up swimming, so I needed something to help. I tried anti-itch creams and they did not help. I changed my bath soap which did not help much either.&lt;br /&gt;Most of my itchy skin was relieved in a short time. I got a slight tingling and burning at first but it soon stopped and started working. I still have some red rashes, but have been using the lotion for only 2 days. Those spots do not itch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the lotion is very, very thick. It is too thick for the pump. I have to unscrew the cap and squeeze out the lotion. This is not a problem right now but will be when it get near the bottom. This factor could be a problem for people who have weak or arthritic hands.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: try to get to the root cause of the itch. From experience I knew to check my laundry detergent and anything I use for washing like dryer sheets or bath soap. Also check the contents of any new clothing. You could be having a reaction to the fabric or the material it was packed in. Finally look at your diet - have your changed anything lately?  The last time I had itchy skin I changed laundry detergent and that solved the problem.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Would definitely  recommend this!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected, good quality. I would recommend. A little goes a long way. I could not find this in the store anywhere.</li>
            <li> Works just as described; thank you!</li>
