            <li> I discovered this moisturizer while on a trip to So. Calif. because I had forgotten my then favorite and had to find another brand.  It was a happy discovery, and I have been using it ever since.  It is light, non-greasy, and I would be lost without it!</li>
            <li> Love all Skin Medica products!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s just great for the hot dry summer.  It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer and the price here is lower than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer for under my makeup. I had a few sun spots coming up and they are no longer there, they faded with my day and night cream. This cream really keeps the sun from aging my face, so it is great.</li>
            <li> just got this but I really like it already - sinks right in and makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li> I just started using it but I already see an improvement in the appearance of my face.  It seems much more moist and younger looking.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I have order this product. Amazon has the best price and I like this product.</li>
            <li> I have to be so careful what products I put on my face to avoid swelling and hives from allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to use this product with no reactions. So happy I found this brand of products !!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Tried others and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS AND FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful light skin cream. I use it morning under make up and put it on at night before bed. Keeps my face soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely dry before this product.  I love this product and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy.  I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good for a daily moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way. Not sure if it helps diminish fine line or dark spots.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve come across and I&#x27;ve been doing this for many years.  It&#x27;s not greasy, stays moist throughout the day and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot - the tube lasts a long time!  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is ok. The consistency is not as  what I expected, it is a little sticky when you put on.  The fragrance is too strong and has a masculinity smell.  I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I like several of the SkinMedica moisturizers, including the Rejuvenative Moisturizer.  It is light, but effective. I combine it with&lt;br /&gt;SkinMedica TNS Recovery Complex. You can supplement with extra sunscreen if you wish.</li>
            <li> skinmedica skin moisturizer is the best because of its contents. non oily and vitimins. 2nd time buying this product.. highly recommend. I use daily. it smells great also. [[ASIN:B000R94S3O SkinMedica SkinMedica Rejuvenative Moisturizer - disc]]</li>
            <li> This is a little thick for my liking of a moisturizer. I will use this product and not buy again.</li>
            <li> Thought it would last long/work longer. I put it on about 6am and needed to re apply by noon. Otherwise fine not great.</li>
            <li> At my age, you need a decent product! I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years at age 55 and my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> I am new to Skinmeddica, but was willing to give it a try after the recommendation of an esthetician working in a respected medical office.  I am satisified with the results.  Certainly, it is no fountain of youth, but the products make a difference that is measurable, smoothing and brightening my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night after I used some anti aging product.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it is non greasy .</li>
