            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Great hold ,strong.</li>
            <li>great gel; strong hold and nice smell; no flaking - just as advertised</li>
            <li>Works great for light hold for both of my boys.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>When my son and hubby tried they both found it amazing with the way it held their hair.</li>
            <li>Scored this deal for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>There is no flaky residue at the end of the day like I have experienced with cheap brands.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this gel based on Amazon reviews when Garnier changed the formula for &amp;#34;Surf Hair&amp;#34; and I no longer liked how it worked.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice and styled.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my boyfriend, he was looking for a product that would hold his hairstyle the way he liked without leaving his hair looking grease.</li>
            <li>He loved it and asked me to get more.</li>
            <li>Nice manly smell, without being over powering.</li>
            <li>Stay together nicely and holds hair</li>
            <li>However, what I can comment on is the nice shine that it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good for men who don&#x27;t want the spikey punk look, but need good clean hold.  </li>
            <li>it works great and pretty good price.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great because I don&#x27;t like my hair to look super shiny, but I still want the hold.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use with</li>
            <li>This gel smells so good and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Strictly for styling, not for strong hold!</li>
            <li>As with all Krieger &amp; Sohne products I&#x27;ve used, this one is exceptional, offering light but practical hold with a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Im glad i was able to review this and provide my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves hair soft to the touch for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;But holds perfectly.</li>
            <li>meet barber shop, is quick and easy to apply if you&#x27;re in a hurry, and leaves hair feeling and looking great.  </li>
            <li>Nice and strong.</li>
            <li>If you want it stiffer you use more.  </li>
            <li>Does the job, better than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>

            <li>I love the gel.</li>
            <li>My husband has used Crew for many years for shampoo and styling gel.  </li>
            <li>but he raved about the hair gel saying it holds so much better than Crew.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light.</li>
            <li>It is a great fit for his teen lifestyle and had a great smell.</li>
            <li>He loves using it will continue to buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>They scream sophisticated and stylish.</li>
            <li>If you pick this up be sure to grab the shampoo them make as well.</li>

            <li>I love the quality of this gel.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li>It is more of a medium, styling gel.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to a friend :)</li>
            <li>Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell as well which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Light, effective hold with a nice and mild scent</li>
            <li>There is also a nice mild scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more light and non sticky then most.</li>
            <li>Great hold, not stiff.  </li>
            <li>Already ran out and time to buy more, we love this in my house good hold but not stiff</li>

            <li>My second impression was amazing as well at how good this product smells, I don&#x27;t think i ever smelled a hair gel like this one.</li>
            <li>The product does not dispense easily on this bottle.</li>
            <li>He said it worked well &amp; was easy on his hair with a strong hold.</li>
            <li>Not sticky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too weak...it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy in my hair and my wife likes the smell</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold like we had thought.</li>
            <li>In strong wind, it wouldn&#x27;t do a lot.  </li>
            <li>Strong hold means strong hold.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good high quality gel.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good high quality gel.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying, I have never spent over $5 on a bottle of hair gel, but end up throwing away gels that flake off all over your shirt, so when I got a great price on this  Premium Styling Hair Gel for Men - Salon for my review the test was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gel smells good and has a good hold without feeling crunchy like other gels do.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to water in the duration of its hold.&lt;br /&gt;Not giving it 1 because it smells fine and</li>
            <li>Not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super crunchy!</li>
            <li>And if you read reviews before you read the product description, this product IS paraben free as well.</li>
            <li>It’s also alcohol and paraben free.</li>
            <li>The smell was fantastic.</li>
            <li>His hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so light weight.</li>
            <li>Overall i think this is a great prodct and would say any man would like this ite,.</li>
            <li>Waiting on posting my review because I really wanted to see how my husband liked it.  </li>
            <li>The product is smooth and non greasy and non sticky.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive my product in the mail, shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>The gel is super strong hold.  </li>
            <li>It applies perfectly and feels good in the hair, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a pretty good product!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking to look their best for those special occasions and everyday use!</li>
            <li>This stuff blends right in with my hair and holds literally ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>such a nice clean scent doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky!</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural scent to it not a chemical smell or flowery smell.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good conpany, but that was my personal expirience with the product.</li>
            <li>Also when applying it feels more like a wax and really stiffens your hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very well designed and the scent is more manly</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural scent and does not leave any flaking.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a men&#x27;s gel for my 11 year old twins who wanted a product of their own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not running at all, but not too thick.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have much hair to review :).  </li>
            <li>He says it provides a very good hold without being sticky or too stiff.</li>
            <li>It helps for better distribution and to dry up nicely without leaving flakes.</li>
            <li>It goes on great not that sticky goo other have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as waxy as the Surf Hair or Bed Head, and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth rather than waxy, making it more &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;, while still leaving some hold so it can be reshaped with hands trivially.  </li>
            <li>Many products claim these same things, but most don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>Super hold with this gel.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets flaky and super crunchy.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell to it and it is not sticky but gives just enough hold.  </li>
            <li>am not too sure how much else I can tell you about &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34;  other than it is good quality and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li>This does not dry out his scalp either and washes out nicely.</li>
            <li>It does make their hair  very pliable and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>The gel does exactly like it says...holds well!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to all that love their hair and want a great hold for the whole day without the sticky and hard looking gel.</li>
            <li>He loves it so much and wants me to buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too stiff and leaves his hair a great consistency.  </li>
            <li>Its wasnt so strong as the product we normal use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake, holds well but not stiff or hard and it smell great!</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit, and my hair looked great for 2 days!</li>
            <li>, product wasn&#x27;t really meant for my hair, but it seems like very HIGH quality and would work with smooth, lighter hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very well designed, Its a nice blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it creates a very strong bond to their hair and once the hair is set in place it stays all day long.</li>
            <li>it creates a very strong bond to your hair and once you set your hair in place it should stay all day long</li>
            <li>Did not create hard hair and was still great at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It does not leave hard spikes but holds great and let&#x27;s him do the styles he likes.</li>
            <li>The Krieger remains the first line of attack, however..  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is that the size is greater than TSA allows, so you can&#x27;t take it when you travel, whereas the Bed Head you can.</li>
            <li>every hair type out there, and gives you exactly what you are looking for in every use.</li>
            <li>, I must&#x27;ve tried most of the big brands in the market.</li>
            <li>This gel holds pretty well, but I don&#x27;t know if I would call it &amp;#34;strong.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>So very versatile!</li>
            <li>Thanks 4 letting me try it out!</li>
            <li>So last night he asked me to grab him some more cus</li>
            <li>It was a beautiful blue not girly looking like other brands.</li>
            <li>he likes a certain gel</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a large bottle of very concentrated gel</li>
            <li>S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s Styling Gel is smooth, long lasting, and really does the trick to hold your hair in place when you want to achieve a unique style!</li>
            <li>The most fantastic part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hubby&#x27;s hair hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean your hand it doesn&#x27;t stick and messy.  </li>
            <li>i have very wavy frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The product he used to use had a real issue with flaking.</li>
            <li>he likes it just as much as the shampoo and keeps his hair neat all day.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my son and it holds the whole day without flaking.</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky about his hair products.</li>
            <li>Really helpful to the hair styling and not sticky.</li>
            <li>The gel itself holds my hair style really well</li>
            <li>Hold very well and does not flake at tall.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and actually really blends into your hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>AND REALLY LIKES IT.</li>
            <li>he really did not say much about it</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband after my friend raved about it and he&#x27;s really liking it.</li>
            <li>Like most gels, it gives hair a slightly wet look.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to use much for their hair.</li>
            <li>I have bought a couple of products from this company and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need a whole lot they both said and</li>
            <li>The bottle is 8oz, and I don&#x27;t have to use much in order to cover my whole head.  </li>
            <li>Strong hold, but not so much that it looks super stiff.</li>
            <li>A lot of other cheaper gels worked as well or better for me.</li>
            <li>When I tight up my hair in the morning, I will put a little on the top layer, keep the hair look really nice all day.</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>It would be better if it is packaged in a squeeze tube like most gels are, but I would definitely buy this product again because it works for my young son&#x27;s hair, styles it but does not leave it stiff.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m so used to hair gels in tubes which makes for a quick and simple dispensing.  </li>
            <li>It is certainly a high end product.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>If I want a little more tufty spikes when my hair is shorter I can either use a little more of this, or augment with the Bed Head, which does have stiffer hold while sacrificing ease of application and post-application feel.  </li>
            <li>and my boys really stay busy with school, sports, running around,</li>
            <li>The true test is how it holds up all day long.  </li>
            <li>It went on nicely, and although there was the typical gel &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; to his hair, it was definitely still touchable.  </li>
            <li>It is strong enough for coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit older and prefer simple volume and medium hold and not complicated tufts and spikes.  </li>
            <li>It is the exact opposite of the description.</li>
            <li>For styling, you simply use more or less depending on the look you are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>I have been using an old spice styling hair gel</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s masculine without being too pungent and a woman could even get by using it.</li>
            <li>I am a professional stylist, I want this for my business .</li>
            <li>I used it on my five year old and it seems gone gone after 7 hours.  </li>
            <li>Wow my husband loves this hair gel</li>
            <li>This gel doesn&#x27;t leave any flakes, and it also looks natural.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old saw my using it</li>
            <li>It still has that natural look.  </li>
            <li>My four year old loves to spike his hair,  </li>
            <li>This gel arrived in a nice deep blue plastic bottle, professionally packed in a small box to prevent any damage during transit.</li>
            <li>Will buy more and dumb the old brand</li>
            <li>but he&#x27;s pretty rough on gel.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t take very much for him to style his hair so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair at least still there, I was loosing a lot before and seems like it did stopped fortunately.</li>
            <li>Definitely hold hair in place but keep it looking soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need very much at all, even when I let my hair grow a little longer between cuts.  </li>
            <li>I also am a big fan of the wet look and this absolutely provides that</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Great hold ,strong.</li>
            <li> great gel; strong hold and nice smell; no flaking - just as advertised</li>
            <li> Works great for light hold for both of my boys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> When my son and hubby tried they both found it amazing with the way it held their hair.</li>
            <li> Scored this deal for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> There is no flaky residue at the end of the day like I have experienced with cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this gel based on Amazon reviews when Garnier changed the formula for &amp;#34;Surf Hair&amp;#34; and I no longer liked how it worked.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and styled.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend, he was looking for a product that would hold his hairstyle the way he liked without leaving his hair looking grease.</li>
            <li> He loved it and asked me to get more.</li>
            <li> Nice manly smell, without being over powering.</li>
            <li> Stay together nicely and holds hair</li>
            <li> However, what I can comment on is the nice shine that it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li> Good for men who don&#x27;t want the spikey punk look, but need good clean hold.  </li>
            <li> it works great and pretty good price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great because I don&#x27;t like my hair to look super shiny, but I still want the hold.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use with</li>
            <li> This gel smells so good and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Strictly for styling, not for strong hold!</li>
            <li> As with all Krieger &amp; Sohne products I&#x27;ve used, this one is exceptional, offering light but practical hold with a pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> Im glad i was able to review this and provide my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves hair soft to the touch for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;But holds perfectly.</li>
            <li> meet barber shop, is quick and easy to apply if you&#x27;re in a hurry, and leaves hair feeling and looking great.  </li>
            <li> Nice and strong.</li>
            <li> If you want it stiffer you use more.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, better than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this gel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure we will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love the gel.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Crew for many years for shampoo and styling gel.  </li>
            <li> but he raved about the hair gel saying it holds so much better than Crew.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light.</li>
            <li> It is a great fit for his teen lifestyle and had a great smell.</li>
            <li> He loves using it will continue to buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> They scream sophisticated and stylish.</li>
            <li> If you pick this up be sure to grab the shampoo them make as well.</li>
            <li> Love using this for my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I received this 2 days ago and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> This was able to do it with no problem.  </li>
            <li> my husband fell in  love with this gel.</li>
            <li> Much better styling gel than I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he was looking for a better hair product then what yoiu would find at the store .</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this gel.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> It is more of a medium, styling gel.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell as well which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Light, effective hold with a nice and mild scent</li>
            <li> There is also a nice mild scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more light and non sticky then most.</li>
            <li> Great hold, not stiff.  </li>
            <li> Already ran out and time to buy more, we love this in my house good hold but not stiff</li>
            <li> You see my son&#x27;s hair is more important to him</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my husbands hair soft</li>
            <li> Within the first use he loved the products grease free hold.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and looks natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more light and non sticky then most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My second impression was amazing as well at how good this product smells, I don&#x27;t think i ever smelled a hair gel like this one.</li>
            <li> The product does not dispense easily on this bottle.</li>
            <li> He said it worked well &amp; was easy on his hair with a strong hold.</li>
            <li> Not sticky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too weak...it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy in my hair and my wife likes the smell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold like we had thought.</li>
            <li> In strong wind, it wouldn&#x27;t do a lot.  </li>
            <li> Strong hold means strong hold.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good high quality gel.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good high quality gel.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I have never spent over $5 on a bottle of hair gel, but end up throwing away gels that flake off all over your shirt, so when I got a great price on this  Premium Styling Hair Gel for Men - Salon for my review the test was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gel smells good and has a good hold without feeling crunchy like other gels do.</li>
            <li> I would compare it to water in the duration of its hold.&lt;br /&gt;Not giving it 1 because it smells fine and</li>
            <li> Not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super crunchy!</li>
            <li> And if you read reviews before you read the product description, this product IS paraben free as well.</li>
            <li> It’s also alcohol and paraben free.</li>
            <li> The smell was fantastic.</li>
            <li> His hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so light weight.</li>
            <li> Overall i think this is a great prodct and would say any man would like this ite,.</li>
            <li> Waiting on posting my review because I really wanted to see how my husband liked it.  </li>
            <li> The product is smooth and non greasy and non sticky.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my product in the mail, shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> The gel is super strong hold.  </li>
            <li> It applies perfectly and feels good in the hair, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a pretty good product!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking to look their best for those special occasions and everyday use!</li>
            <li> This stuff blends right in with my hair and holds literally ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> such a nice clean scent doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky!</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural scent to it not a chemical smell or flowery smell.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good conpany, but that was my personal expirience with the product.</li>
            <li> Also when applying it feels more like a wax and really stiffens your hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very well designed and the scent is more manly</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural scent and does not leave any flaking.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a men&#x27;s gel for my 11 year old twins who wanted a product of their own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not running at all, but not too thick.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have much hair to review :).  </li>
            <li> He says it provides a very good hold without being sticky or too stiff.</li>
            <li> It helps for better distribution and to dry up nicely without leaving flakes.</li>
            <li> It goes on great not that sticky goo other have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as waxy as the Surf Hair or Bed Head, and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth rather than waxy, making it more &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;, while still leaving some hold so it can be reshaped with hands trivially.  </li>
            <li> Many products claim these same things, but most don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Super hold with this gel.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets flaky and super crunchy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell to it and it is not sticky but gives just enough hold.  </li>
            <li> am not too sure how much else I can tell you about &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34;  other than it is good quality and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li> This does not dry out his scalp either and washes out nicely.</li>
            <li> It does make their hair  very pliable and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> The gel does exactly like it says...holds well!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to all that love their hair and want a great hold for the whole day without the sticky and hard looking gel.</li>
            <li> He loves it so much and wants me to buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too stiff and leaves his hair a great consistency.  </li>
            <li> Its wasnt so strong as the product we normal use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake, holds well but not stiff or hard and it smell great!</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit, and my hair looked great for 2 days!</li>
            <li> , product wasn&#x27;t really meant for my hair, but it seems like very HIGH quality and would work with smooth, lighter hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very well designed, Its a nice blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it creates a very strong bond to their hair and once the hair is set in place it stays all day long.</li>
            <li> it creates a very strong bond to your hair and once you set your hair in place it should stay all day long</li>
            <li> Did not create hard hair and was still great at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It does not leave hard spikes but holds great and let&#x27;s him do the styles he likes.</li>
            <li> The Krieger remains the first line of attack, however..  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the size is greater than TSA allows, so you can&#x27;t take it when you travel, whereas the Bed Head you can.</li>
            <li> every hair type out there, and gives you exactly what you are looking for in every use.</li>
            <li> , I must&#x27;ve tried most of the big brands in the market.</li>
            <li> This gel holds pretty well, but I don&#x27;t know if I would call it &amp;#34;strong.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> So very versatile!</li>
            <li> Thanks 4 letting me try it out!</li>
            <li> So last night he asked me to grab him some more cus</li>
            <li> It was a beautiful blue not girly looking like other brands.</li>
            <li> he likes a certain gel</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a large bottle of very concentrated gel</li>
            <li> S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s Styling Gel is smooth, long lasting, and really does the trick to hold your hair in place when you want to achieve a unique style!</li>
            <li> The most fantastic part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hubby&#x27;s hair hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean your hand it doesn&#x27;t stick and messy.  </li>
            <li> i have very wavy frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The product he used to use had a real issue with flaking.</li>
            <li> he likes it just as much as the shampoo and keeps his hair neat all day.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my son and it holds the whole day without flaking.</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about his hair products.</li>
            <li> Really helpful to the hair styling and not sticky.</li>
            <li> The gel itself holds my hair style really well</li>
            <li> Hold very well and does not flake at tall.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and actually really blends into your hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> AND REALLY LIKES IT.</li>
            <li> he really did not say much about it</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband after my friend raved about it and he&#x27;s really liking it.</li>
            <li> Like most gels, it gives hair a slightly wet look.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to use much for their hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought a couple of products from this company and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a whole lot they both said and</li>
            <li> The bottle is 8oz, and I don&#x27;t have to use much in order to cover my whole head.  </li>
            <li> Strong hold, but not so much that it looks super stiff.</li>
            <li> A lot of other cheaper gels worked as well or better for me.</li>
            <li> When I tight up my hair in the morning, I will put a little on the top layer, keep the hair look really nice all day.</li>
            <li> It smells great and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It would be better if it is packaged in a squeeze tube like most gels are, but I would definitely buy this product again because it works for my young son&#x27;s hair, styles it but does not leave it stiff.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m so used to hair gels in tubes which makes for a quick and simple dispensing.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly a high end product.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> If I want a little more tufty spikes when my hair is shorter I can either use a little more of this, or augment with the Bed Head, which does have stiffer hold while sacrificing ease of application and post-application feel.  </li>
            <li> and my boys really stay busy with school, sports, running around,</li>
            <li> The true test is how it holds up all day long.  </li>
            <li> It went on nicely, and although there was the typical gel &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; to his hair, it was definitely still touchable.  </li>
            <li> It is strong enough for coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit older and prefer simple volume and medium hold and not complicated tufts and spikes.  </li>
            <li> It is the exact opposite of the description.</li>
            <li> For styling, you simply use more or less depending on the look you are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> I have been using an old spice styling hair gel</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s masculine without being too pungent and a woman could even get by using it.</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist, I want this for my business .</li>
            <li> I used it on my five year old and it seems gone gone after 7 hours.  </li>
            <li> Wow my husband loves this hair gel</li>
            <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t leave any flakes, and it also looks natural.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old saw my using it</li>
            <li> It still has that natural look.  </li>
            <li> My four year old loves to spike his hair,  </li>
            <li> This gel arrived in a nice deep blue plastic bottle, professionally packed in a small box to prevent any damage during transit.</li>
            <li> Will buy more and dumb the old brand</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s pretty rough on gel.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t take very much for him to style his hair so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair at least still there, I was loosing a lot before and seems like it did stopped fortunately.</li>
            <li> Definitely hold hair in place but keep it looking soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need very much at all, even when I let my hair grow a little longer between cuts.  </li>
            <li> I also am a big fan of the wet look and this absolutely provides that</li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way for super hold.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little product, which is good because it&#x27;s rather expensive.</li>
            <li> but It was a white paste and would not completely blend into my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy scent or a heavy and greasy product</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel for spiking his hair and it holds all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair gel for my husband and he&#x27;s been using it for a few days so far.</li>
            <li> It keeps his hair in place all day long and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering but does not stink at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy scent or a heavy and greasy product</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like this at first, thought it was too weak, but after using now for over a month, I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Definitely will be looking for other products in this line.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave him with and itchy or dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the way it holds my hair when it&#x27;s getting a little long</li>
            <li> If you want softer style you only use a little.  </li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a little bigger</li>
            <li> but you only need a little at a time.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> My husband uses gel in his hair everyday and hates using gel that leaves white flakes in his hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make their hair look wet or greasy.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to use crew in his hair bit sometimes tries other products</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so it will take only a small amount for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really super thick hair and getting any sort of product to hold it down is tough.  </li>
            <li> little difficult to squeeze out of the container, but it is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> To this end a small dab is enough to add a little volume and hold to make flat hair have a little character.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using this on slightly damp or wet hair.</li>
            <li> A bonus is this product also gives my very short hair added shine and does not make it hard to the touch.</li>
            <li> This gel gets the job done and is not super gooey or sticky like some of the other products out there!  </li>
            <li> the stiff gooey feel other leave you.</li>
            <li> They both have thick hair and this gel held both styles all day long.</li>
            <li> They both have thick hair and this gel held both styles all day long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue behind like other gels</li>
            <li> His hair is still holding it&#x27;s shape a little.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but high-quality and the hold lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Just a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle is hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> But after a few days of using this one.</li>
            <li> The color is green and I like the smell of it, if you worry about the smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue behind.</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t look stiff though.  </li>
            <li> No more waxy stiff hair for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who usually gets styling gel at the hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> A small dab will do.</li>
            <li> He is not the type to usually care one way or another about whatever I buy him so for him to have this reaction</li>
            <li> We used this to spike his hair for a soccer game and it held up extremely well.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint he had was that it was difficult for him to squeeze out of the bottle, so I had to subtract one star.  </li>
            <li> item worked very well for my husbands crazy hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to not keep this as a gift for my tween son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that creates separation and hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick but leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li> It goes on thick and holds hair in place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thin or too thick or sticky.</li>
            <li> Does a poor job holding for any period of time over an hour or so.</li>
            <li> The hold is not great either.</li>
            <li> Not good at all don&#x27;t recommend it expensive for nothing</li>
            <li> but it was way to expensive.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s cowlicks go crazy</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really Love this stuff! I have been using an old spice styling hair gel and I did like it, but It was a white paste and would not completely blend into my hair. This stuff is great because I don&#x27;t like my hair to look super shiny, but I still want the hold. This stuff blends right in with my hair and holds literally ALL DAY! Great Company too!</li>
            <li> My Son  had me research this product for him after a friend who owns a salon told him about it. You see my son&#x27;s hair is more important to him then the world..lol  So after ordering it i was first impressed with the quickness in getting the item to me and them the beautiful bottle. It was a beautiful blue not girly looking like other brands. Believe me men don&#x27;t want to use a product that looks like a women&#x27;s product ..my son reminds me of this all the time lol. My second impression was amazing as well at how good this product smells, I don&#x27;t think i ever smelled a hair gel like this one. It has a nice natural scent to it not a chemical smell or flowery smell. So i gave to my son who was impressed as well the way the bottle looked and smelled but the question is did it work the way his friend bragged to him ,,,,,Yes my son loved it and had me try it being i have very wavy frizzy hair. It goes on great not that sticky goo other have and it hold the hair well in place and it gives u a shine like hair serums do!!  I loved the silky feel not the stiff gooey feel other leave you. So Bravo for this product if i could give it ten stars i would...</li>
            <li> Bought this styling gel for my husband. The product he used to use had a real issue with flaking. This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that, it is easy to use, and smells good too! Also, it doesn&#x27;t take very much for him to style his hair so it should last a long time. Very glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> After my son began using the Krieger + Söhne Men&#x27;s Shampoo, I decided to order the styling gel for him as well.  he likes it just as much as the shampoo and keeps his hair neat all day.  He has recommended it to his friends as well.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Works great for light hold for both of my boys. I like that it does not make your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...Not too strong, not too weak...it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy in my hair and my wife likes the smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loved it. It&#x27;s alcohol free and the scent is great. A little goes a long way. Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Awesome product works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome price for gel!!!! I use it for my son and it holds the whole day without flaking.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my sons hair and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this via promotion as a gift for my brother-in-law. I am impressed by the packaging and the scent. He is going to be thrilled with this! It&#x27;s really hard to not keep this as a gift for my tween son. Back to the scent- it&#x27;s masculine without being too pungent and a woman could even get by using it. And if you read reviews before you read the product description, this product IS paraben free as well. For styling, you simply use more or less depending on the look you are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, doesn&#x27;t flake, and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I realize that since this is for &amp;#34;all hairtypes&amp;#34; there&#x27;ll be a range of expiriences, but this didn&#x27;t do wonders for me. A lot of other cheaper gels worked as well or better for me. This seems like a good conpany, but that was my personal expirience with the product.</li>
            <li> This gel works just how you want it to.  If you want softer style you only use a little.  If you want it stiffer you use more.  I like the consistency and they way you can use it either way.  Works good and smells good too.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Does the job, better than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great mens gel! Smells great and will not make her hair flaky either!  My husband is very picky about his hair products. But after a few days of using this one. He told me he would reorder this one in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and I must say it smells AMAZING! He said felt great, and wasn&#x27;t oily. It looked great. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Really helpful to the hair styling and not sticky. like it.</li>
            <li> Love this gel! It doesn&#x27;t get greasy Looking and holds well!</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  I plan to be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> little difficult to squeeze out of the container, but it is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> The product does not dispense easily on this bottle. I guess I&#x27;m so used to hair gels in tubes which makes for a quick and simple dispensing.  The gel itself holds my hair style really well but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my husbands hair soft</li>
            <li> great gel; strong hold and nice smell; no flaking - just as advertised</li>
            <li> smells so good and works great</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist, I want this for my business . Great hold ,strong. Shiny</li>
            <li> Strictly for styling, not for strong hold! Product is good!</li>
            <li> Awesome styling Gel !!</li>
            <li> The gel is perfect for a combover.  It is strong enough for coarse hair.  The consistency is thick but leaves no residue.  I received a discount to try this product.</li>
            <li> Great smelling product. Not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super crunchy!</li>
            <li> This was so-so for my husband. Didn&#x27;t have that strong of a hold like we had thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Nice and strong. I especially like the way it holds my hair when it&#x27;s getting a little long</li>
            <li> This should be called hair wax and not hair gel because it is thicker then gel. Also when applying it feels more like a wax and really stiffens your hair. It also leaves white flakes in your hair if you rub it out. To this day Crew men&#x27;s hair gel is the only gel that doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like this at first, thought it was too weak, but after using now for over a month, I like it a lot.  Good for men who don&#x27;t want the spikey punk look, but need good clean hold.  Bought it again.</li>
            <li> Already ran out and time to buy more, we love this in my house good hold but not stiff</li>
            <li> I used it on my five year old and it seems gone gone after 7 hours.  His hair is still holding it&#x27;s shape a little.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great! Good hold/coverage! My only complaint is that the bottle is hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just for men! I used this to keep my blowout in place for humid days. You only need a little bit, and my hair looked great for 2 days!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this gel based on Amazon reviews when Garnier changed the formula for &amp;#34;Surf Hair&amp;#34; and I no longer liked how it worked.  I got this and the Bed Head matte wax/putty and prefer the Krieger&#x27;s functional ease, feel and smell.  I don&#x27;t need very much at all, even when I let my hair grow a little longer between cuts.  I&#x27;m a bit older and prefer simple volume and medium hold and not complicated tufts and spikes.  To this end a small dab is enough to add a little volume and hold to make flat hair have a little character.  It&#x27;s not as waxy as the Surf Hair or Bed Head, and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth rather than waxy, making it more &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;, while still leaving some hold so it can be reshaped with hands trivially.  If I want a little more tufty spikes when my hair is shorter I can either use a little more of this, or augment with the Bed Head, which does have stiffer hold while sacrificing ease of application and post-application feel.  The Krieger remains the first line of attack, however..  It smells great, sort of apples meet barber shop, is quick and easy to apply if you&#x27;re in a hurry, and leaves hair feeling and looking great.  No more waxy stiff hair for me. Only drawback is that the size is greater than TSA allows, so you can&#x27;t take it when you travel, whereas the Bed Head you can.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean your hand it doesn&#x27;t stick and messy.  Hold very well and does not flake at tall.</li>
            <li> Great product for men or women!  A little pricey but high-quality and the hold lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just as advertised! Makes my hair nice and styled.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li> This styling gel is top notch! Very easy to use with every hair type out there, and gives you exactly what you are looking for in every use. I recommend this product to anyone looking to look their best for those special occasions and everyday use!</li>
            <li> Not as good I thought it would be</li>
            <li> This gel arrived in a nice deep blue plastic bottle, professionally packed in a small box to prevent any damage during transit. The push type dispenser on the top of the bottle, and the beautiful scent of the gel appeared to be very impressive. When my son and hubby tried they both found it amazing with the way it held their hair. They both have thick hair and this gel held both styles all day long. They are using this daily now. It does not make their hair feel glued or stuck together- it creates a very strong bond to their hair and once the hair is set in place it stays all day long.This gel has the perfect consistency. It’s also alcohol and paraben free. It&#x27;s not too thin or too thick or sticky. I recommend using this on slightly damp or wet hair. It helps for better distribution and to dry up nicely without leaving flakes. It’s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good high quality gel.Received at a discounted price in exchange for reviews.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I have never spent over $5 on a bottle of hair gel, but end up throwing away gels that flake off all over your shirt, so when I got a great price on this  Premium Styling Hair Gel for Men - Salon for my review the test was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large bottle of very concentrated gel so it will take only a small amount for my hair.  It is not sticky and actually really blends into your hair very well.  The true test is how it holds up all day long.  3 hours later, no flakes!  this is good stuff.  still no flakes at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Results: Smells good and works great.&lt;br /&gt;I am not too sure how much else I can tell you about &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34;  other than it is good quality and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  So  5 stars for me</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend, he was looking for a product that would hold his hairstyle the way he liked without leaving his hair looking grease. Within the first use he loved the products grease free hold. I loved how his hair was no crunchy(like most gels cause) and the smell was awesome. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wow my husband loves this hair gel and I do too. It smells amazing and has so many awesome botanical ingredients. It is certainly a high end product. The most fantastic part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hubby&#x27;s hair hard or crunchy. It keeps his hair perfectly in place all day and looks like a gel, but doesn&#x27;t feel like one. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like a pomade either. It&#x27;s the prefect balance of hold and flexibility . I really like it. I know it&#x27;s for men, but I think I might try it out when I&#x27;m going for a beachy wavey look. It&#x27;s hard to find a product that creates separation and hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and flaky. I am so impressed with this product. Many products claim these same things, but most don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Awesome product I recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> My hair at least still there, I was loosing a lot before and seems like it did stopped fortunately.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who usually gets styling gel at the hair dresser.  He loved it and asked me to get more.</li>
            <li> A small dab will do. I love this gel.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  such a nice clean scent doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky!</li>
            <li> It does awesome things for his hair.</li>
            <li> When I received this styling gel we were so impressed with the bottle and the smell. The bottle is very well designed and the scent is more manly then I expected. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent or a heavy and greasy product it&#x27;s more light and non sticky then most. When my son and hubby tried they both were very impressed with the way it held their hair. They both have thick hair and this gel held both styles all day long. They are using this daily now and I&#x27;m sure we will be ordering again. I would recommend to all that love their hair and want a great hold for the whole day without the sticky and hard looking gel. Thank you..</li>
            <li> I received a coupon for this so I thought I&#x27;d try it! This gel smells good and has a good hold without feeling crunchy like other gels do. My husband loves this gel for spiking his hair and it holds all day long. It has a clean smell as well which is nice.  I have also used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair when she goes to gymnastics as her hair needs to stay in place. It holds throughout all of her tumbling, rolling, and jumping around. Great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good high quality gel.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND DID NOT WANT TO TRY THIS GEL, HE IS A MOUSE GUY, BUT HE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS AND REALLY LIKES IT.</li>
            <li> I love the gel. Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue behind like other gels</li>
            <li> My husband has asked me to rebuy this product already.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband because he is a total hair freak. He loves it so much and wants me to buy more. Definitely hold hair in place but keep it looking soft.</li>
            <li> As great as their shampoo!</li>
            <li> My husband has used Crew for many years for shampoo and styling gel.  He has recently tried these products and while he likes the shampoo he really did not say much about it but he raved about the hair gel saying it holds so much better than Crew.  He is not the type to usually care one way or another about whatever I buy him so for him to have this reaction I know it is really good stuff!  I will definitely buy it again.  I wish the bottle was a little bigger but that is about it.</li>
            <li> Strong hold, but not so much that it looks super stiff. No white flakes</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s cowlicks go crazy so I&#x27;ve been using hair gel on him for years, and believe me, I must&#x27;ve tried most of the big brands in the market. This gel definitely does not disappoint! It has a nice natural scent and does not leave any flaking. It would be better if it is packaged in a squeeze tube like most gels are, but I would definitely buy this product again because it works for my young son&#x27;s hair, styles it but does not leave it stiff. I love it!</li>
            <li> Got this today and hubby used it when we had to run to the store and he likes it!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! I bought it for my husband after my friend raved about it and he&#x27;s really liking it.</li>
            <li> Not good at all don&#x27;t recommend it expensive for nothing</li>
            <li> This gel holds pretty well, but I don&#x27;t know if I would call it &amp;#34;strong.&amp;#34;  In strong wind, it wouldn&#x27;t do a lot.  Like most gels, it gives hair a slightly wet look.  The scent is nice and light.</li>
            <li> My son loves this gel. It is a great fit for his teen lifestyle and had a great smell.</li>
            <li> It smells great and a little goes a long way!  My husband uses gel in his hair everyday and hates using gel that leaves white flakes in his hair.  This gel doesn&#x27;t leave any flakes, and it also looks natural.  It&#x27;s not too stiff and leaves his hair a great consistency.  He loves using it will continue to buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have used,</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD customer service, product wasn&#x27;t really meant for my hair, but it seems like very HIGH quality and would work with smooth, lighter hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair gel for my husband and he&#x27;s been using it for a few days so far. He says it provides a very good hold without being sticky or too stiff. It doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, so if you want a softer appearance but still have good hold then you will like this stuff!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband to try and he said he loves it!  It has a nice clean smell to it and it is not sticky but gives just enough hold.  He is sold on it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my product in the mail, shipping was quick! It came just in time for picture day for my sons. Didn&#x27;t have to use much for their hair. They came home from school and it was set in place! I know the product states for mens hairstyling, but I have used it as well. So very versatile! Recommending to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Strong hold means strong hold.  This product does what it says.  Works great!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! It keeps his hair in place all day long and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering but does not stink at all. We love it!!</li>
            <li> Does a poor job holding for any period of time over an hour or so. I would compare it to water in the duration of its hold.&lt;br /&gt;Not giving it 1 because it smells fine and the residue doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky... Then again water doesn&#x27;t do that either.</li>
            <li> We immediately opened this when we received it. The smell was fantastic. It was not sticky on your hands after use and held up through the day. Did not create hard hair and was still great at the end of the day. Definitely will be looking for other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Another great gift for a guy. I have bought a couple of products from this company and I really like them. They scream sophisticated and stylish. great quality and really great packaging. If you pick this up be sure to grab the shampoo them make as well.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this gel, works great!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this styling gel!  Keeps his hair in place even at work!  Highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> My husband says it has an amazing hold that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Love using this for my son&#x27;s hair.  Great hold, not stiff.  Great scent</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:dcb7279632889579986ba47722faea67]] Krieger + S&amp;ouml;hne&#x27;s Styling Gel is smooth, long lasting, and really does the trick to hold your hair in place when you want to achieve a unique style!</li>
            <li> As with all Krieger &amp; Sohne products I&#x27;ve used, this one is exceptional, offering light but practical hold with a pleasing scent. A bonus is this product also gives my very short hair added shine and does not make it hard to the touch. Good product.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to use crew in his hair bit sometimes tries other products and he loves this! It does not leave hard spikes but holds great and let&#x27;s him do the styles he likes. This does not dry out his scalp either and washes out nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product and hold! Nice manly smell, without being over powering. It takes very little product, which is good because it&#x27;s rather expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his hair.  It doesnt leave him with and itchy or dry scalp.  His hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Scored this deal for an amazing price. Been using it and it&#x27;s so light weight. My 2 year old saw my using it so now he just copies me with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel for my husband to try.  It went on nicely, and although there was the typical gel &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; to his hair, it was definitely still touchable.  Seemed to keep his hair in place without looking greasy or oily.  The only complaint he had was that it was difficult for him to squeeze out of the bottle, so I had to subtract one star.  Overall it was a pretty good product!</li>
            <li> I received this 2 days ago and I have to say I love it.  The gel is super strong hold.  It&#x27;s way stronger than any gel I have ever purchased from CVS or Walgreens or Amazon.  It goes on thick and holds hair in place.  I have really super thick hair and getting any sort of product to hold it down is tough.  This was able to do it with no problem.  I also am a big fan of the wet look and this absolutely provides that look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel does not make your hair feel glued or stuck together- it creates a very strong bond to your hair and once you set your hair in place it should stay all day long</li>
            <li> my husband fell in  love with this gel. it works great and pretty good price. it does what it says it does! he likes a certain gel but it was way to expensive.</li>
            <li> Super hold with this gel.  All 3 of my boys and my husband use this and it holds their hair through just about anything.  It is the perfect consistency.  It leaves their hair flexible/moldable yet it has great staying power...and my boys really stay busy with school, sports, running around, etc...  If this gel can keep their hair in place it can hold just about anyone&#x27;s hair in place.  IT doesn&#x27;t look stiff though.  It still has that natural look.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Just started using this on my sons hair and I love it! Great product!</li>
            <li> It came so well packed. Great looking bottle and gel too! My husband loves it! It doesn&#x27;t flake, holds well but not stiff or hard and it smell great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li> This product smells great and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Much better styling gel than I have been using for years.  A very small amount goes a long way for super hold.  Will buy more and dumb the old brand this is the best you will ever find.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The color is green and I like the smell of it, if you worry about the smell.</li>
            <li> Works well... holds hair where it should be...</li>
            <li> Good Gel. Stay together nicely and holds hair</li>
            <li> Loves this! Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he was looking for a better hair product then what yoiu would find at the store . We were so impressed with the bottle and the smell. The bottle is very well designed, Its a nice blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is manly and  was perfect for my husband. . It&#x27;s not a heavy scent or a heavy and greasy product it&#x27;s more light and non sticky then most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item worked very well for my husbands crazy hair! Overall i think this is a great prodct and would say any man would like this ite,.Im glad i was able to review this and provide my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> Works great and does what its suppose 2! Thanks 4 letting me try it out!</li>
            <li> Great product! Received at a discount through a great program. I was looking for a men&#x27;s gel for my 11 year old twins who wanted a product of their own.This product is perfect for their hair and easy for them to use. Will buy again when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband that was totally against Gel, but he loves it. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave his hair crunchy. He now prefers this over his molding clay. The smell is wonderful and not over powering.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this gel. It works well on my hair as well as my sons hair. He runs around all day and his hairstyle remains in place. There is no flaky residue at the end of the day like I have experienced with cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my brother! He loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Definitely works well on hair and not greasy</li>
            <li> I got this for my bf &amp; i style his hair. Its wasnt so strong as the product we normal use.</li>
            <li> Light, effective hold with a nice and mild scent</li>
            <li> Great product, no flakes holds well, pleasent smell.</li>
            <li> perfcet for my husban</li>
            <li> It is the exact opposite of the description. My hair gets flaky and super crunchy. The hold is not great either. It&#x27;s sitting in a drawer now, trash can soon.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;No sticky or clumpy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft to the touch for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;But holds perfectly.</li>
            <li> This gel smells so good and goes on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue behind. My son loves it</li>
            <li> My husband and son absolutely LOVE it!!! It does make their hair  very pliable and easy to manage. Don&#x27;t need a whole lot they both said and it keeps shape all day.  It doesn&#x27;t make their hair look wet or greasy.</li>
            <li> This gel is perfect.  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, not running at all, but not too thick.  It applies perfectly and feels good in the hair, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> Waiting on posting my review because I really wanted to see how my husband liked it.  So last night he asked me to grab him some more cus he was almost out.  He said it worked well &amp; was easy on his hair with a strong hold.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, but ended up using it myself. When I tight up my hair in the morning, I will put a little on the top layer, keep the hair look really nice all day. Some times I want to try some different look, it servers the purpose as well</li>
            <li> The gel does exactly like it says...holds well!  The product is smooth and non greasy and non sticky.  There is also a nice mild scent.  Just a little on the pricey side but you only need a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have much hair to review :).  However, what I can comment on is the nice shine that it gives my hair.  The bottle is 8oz, and I don&#x27;t have to use much in order to cover my whole head.  Note, that this product doesn&#x27;t appear to be a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; hold product (think spiked hair).  It is more of a medium, styling gel.  For those purposes, it works great.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. Not sticky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Great styler my husband loves it ! Perfect for when you want your hair to look &amp;#34;stylish&amp;#34;. I would recommend this product to a friend :)</li>
            <li> This hair gel is very nice and my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> This styling gel works wonders on my husband and sons hair! They both spike up their hair and my son styles his hair in a mohawk.  This gel gets the job done and is not super gooey or sticky like some of the other products out there!  Smells great and lasts all day with no issues!</li>
            <li> My four year old loves to spike his hair,  but he&#x27;s pretty rough on gel.  We used this to spike his hair for a soccer game and it held up extremely well.  I was pretty impressed.</li>
