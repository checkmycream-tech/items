            <li>Best advice after using this product ...</li>
            <li>but this is the best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best when paired with the ion color brilliance developer.  </li>
            <li>This bleach is perfect.</li>
            <li>Win!</li>
            <li>, it will help to prevent more breakage (this is bleach, breakage will happen w/hair)!!!  </li>
            <li>obsess with this stuff, smells so good, has condition oil in it good for your hair and it works !!</li>
            <li>Great product, lightens hair fast!&lt;br /&gt;You have to know what you&#x27;re doing while dealing with bleach..</li>
            <li>is a very effective lightener.</li>
            <li>and i honestly don&#x27;t wanna have to bleach my roots a twice lol.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>highlights and lowlights came out amazing, no signs of the coconut oil inhibiting color absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after we did all that the change in my hair was amazing</li>
            <li>Decided to take matters into my own hands and will start doing my own hair at home</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found the right product to do my own hair.</li>
            <li>i read about this product many reviews</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more of this as needed</li>
            <li>Safe to use for on scalp application.</li>
            <li>But I did start off with really healthy asian-black hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a couple more hours waiting just preoiling my hair again for highlights and lowlights</li>
            <li>The formula is quite potent so if you are doing an on-scalp application, never use more than a 25-30 volume developer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get anything more than a purple tint.</li>
            <li>and so would many others</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not impossible to highlight your own hair, it just takes longer but</li>
            <li>really its amazing for lighter</li>
            <li>This is a great buy, i still have some amount left</li>
            <li>It is important to apply evenly to get even bleaching.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff...works really well and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp at all.</li>
            <li>sometimes 2 hours mainly cuz i need it to be very light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super please with this stuff</li>
            <li>I have this and Proof 10&#x27;mild to me .. a blessing..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a good guideline for how long your hair will take to get desired level.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Word to the wise - only use the bare minimum for your hair type and apply gingerly with a toothbrush or fine toothed comb to prevent over exposure and processing, be delicate and dainty with your application even if you want ash blonde/white hair!)</li>
            <li>up with regular protein reconstruction and moisture treatments and the hair will stay strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any brassiness at all, my hair just looked quite golden.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very strong effective bleach, as long as you use the proper concentration of peroxide.</li>
            <li>I wanted purple hair the first time ( no shocker)</li>
            <li>It can bleed or overprocess fast!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this bleach to anyone; the price is very reasonable and the product is very versatile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not quite positive on this</li>
            <li>I used a brush to apply to my hair, and it bleached my hair pretty well and fast.  </li>
            <li>I only did half ( better safe than sorry) and the amount of color it lifted was great !</li>
            <li>up with regular protein reconstruction and moisture treatments and the hair will stay strong and healthy.ll cause irritation or leave chemical burns even if you leave it on for just 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>*brown &amp; quick blue left it only a bright orange after 2 processes and 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend doing a test strand first on your hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well and isn&#x27;t very damaging.</li>
            <li>My hair was virgin but even I still did a test strand to see how well and how fast the bleach would perform with the coconut</li>
            <li>/&gt;Preoiling your hair with virgin coconut oil a few hours before then applying the bleach right on top of that(don&#x27;t wash the oil off) will minimize the damage dramatically.</li>
            <li>Before this I bought the loreal quick blue with salon care and tried it in my mannequins first.</li>
            <li>Been using this to put blonde into the underside of my dark dark brown hair, works great!</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and even got a little sample from sallys :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo, apply reconstructor, shampoo, then applied a light layer of coconut oil then let blew dry hair.</li>
            <li>I use quick blue with salon care developer 30 to do an balayage .</li>
            <li>This product has a decent smell and works as it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this technique for anyone who plans on any bleaching or coloring process.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and packaged well.</li>
            <li>The bleach will still process, there was no uneven color nor time</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s how my virgin hair naturally</li>
            <li>but I want it mailed to me directly..</li>
            <li>Takes 30 minutes to lighten dark hair to a light blonde.</li>
            <li>product is more than capable to lifting hair to any desired level, however do not forget to tone or apply desired shade to hair because it will leave either some faint yellowness or brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>product is more than capable to lifting hair to any desired level, however do not forget to tone or apply desired shade to hair because it will leave either some faint yellowness or brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Be very careful about the toner you use, and leave it on only the time prescribed for your hair or your hair will become very brittle!!  </li>
            <li>but I came across this nifty trick that cuts down the lightening damage dramatically right of the bat and totally prevent any scalp irritation from bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will lighten virgin black hair to a level 9-10 after first application.</li>
            <li>It lifts my stubborn dark brown hair very well</li>

            <li> It lifts my stubborn dark brown hair very well</li>
            <li> It will bleach your natural hair faster than dyed hair, so if you have roots coming out dark, apply to your roots last.</li>
            <li> my hair is only about 1/8 in long</li>
            <li> It lightens my naturally auburn hair, but a little goes a loooonnngggg wayyy!  </li>
            <li> i have naturally dark brown hair which i bleach to blonde on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li> It gets my hair which is usually a dark brown color to bleach blonde in one to two bleaches and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Like I said before I have black hair and after the bleach it was a really ugly red/ blonde color that I could easily dye over.</li>
            <li> Compared to other bleach powders, this causes minimal irritation to my scalp, even when I leave it on for 45 minutes to strip stubborn color.</li>
            <li> 45 min will take me down to a pale blonde.  </li>
            <li> I used other brand</li>
            <li> Be careful blonding!</li>
            <li> I have med/long thick asian hair</li>
            <li> Continent of black dyed hair..</li>
            <li> It was a little streaky</li>
            <li> have very very dark hair from years of hair dye</li>
            <li> and  less damaging in my opinion, i do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past when lightening my hair</li>
            <li> Big disappointment</li>
            <li> I do leave it on my head for at least an hour-</li>
            <li> I mean it your risking your hair falling out people!</li>
            <li> No more than 20 mixtures and never on your roots!!</li>
            <li> this way I can get my hair whenever I need it and won&#x27;t have to go through that awkward situation.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i read about this product many reviews but when i ordered iam nt sur if that will be work or nt&lt;br /&gt;but really its amazing for lighter and it didnt damage ur hair&lt;br /&gt;thnx</li>
            <li> i have naturally dark brown hair which i bleach to blonde on a weekly basis.  my hair is only about 1/8 in long so i am using this for on scalp application.  I combine this with the ion color brilliance 20 volume developer and experience no irritation. 45 min will take me down to a pale blonde.  love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past when lightening my hair and I absolutely love it i will be ordering more of this as needed</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...works really well and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp at all. Arrived early and packaged well. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works very well and isn&#x27;t very damaging. Safe to use for on scalp application. Takes 30 minutes to lighten dark hair to a light blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser but I&#x27;m tire of waiting for people to do my hair. I have med/long thick asian hair so who ever does it seems to always complaine. Decided to take matters into my own hands and will start doing my own hair at home so I pick this up at Sally. It&#x27;s not impossible to highlight your own hair, it just takes longer but this way I can get my hair whenever I need it and won&#x27;t have to go through that awkward situation. Before this I bought the loreal quick blue with salon care and tried it in my mannequins first. I use quick blue with salon care developer 30 to do an balayage . Left product on for 60 mins and it barly lift. Big disappointment so I rehighlighted her with the same thing for another hour and still nothing. My mannequin was a level 5 *brown &amp; quick blue left it only a bright orange after 2 processes and 2 hrs. So there was no way I was gonna put that in my hair. Took it back and bought the ion bleach this time. Before I put it on myself I use it on my mannequin again. This time it actually lift. So I proceed to my hair which was also a level 5 got got to 9 in one process. I would say it took me 45 mins. The description doesn&#x27;t say enough but i&#x27;am obsess with this stuff, smells so good, has condition oil in it good for your hair and it works !! I&#x27;m so happy I found the right product to do my own hair.</li>
            <li> granddaughter swears by it</li>
            <li> I got this 2 years ago,  I am now platinum blonde and have used it like 4 times and I still have plenty of it left&lt;br /&gt;good and  less damaging in my opinion, i do recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product has a decent smell and works as it was supposed to.  Plenty of product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It lightens my naturally auburn hair, but a little goes a loooonnngggg wayyy!  Be very careful about the toner you use, and leave it on only the time prescribed for your hair or your hair will become very brittle!!  Best advice after using this product ... CONDITION, CONDITION, CONDITION ... in and out of the shower, it will help to prevent more breakage (this is bleach, breakage will happen w/hair)!!!  (Word to the wise - only use the bare minimum for your hair type and apply gingerly with a toothbrush or fine toothed comb to prevent over exposure and processing, be delicate and dainty with your application even if you want ash blonde/white hair!)</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, i still have some amount left and i have a lot of hair. It arrived fast and even got a little sample from sallys :)</li>
            <li> ***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;BIG TIP: PRE_OIL YOUR HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to go blonde, and I had a lot left over so I used this. I was going to get some Goldwell Silklift but I came across this nifty trick that cuts down the lightening damage dramatically right of the bat and totally prevent any scalp irritation from bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preoiling your hair with virgin coconut oil a few hours before then applying the bleach right on top of that(don&#x27;t wash the oil off) will minimize the damage dramatically. The bleach will still process, there was no uneven color nor time inhibition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite positive on this but the oil might have helped even everything and might have speed up the process as well. But I did start off with really healthy asian-black hair and I reapplied another layer of bleach in the 30 minute mark. I didn&#x27;t have any brassiness at all, my hair just looked quite golden. But that&#x27;s how my virgin hair naturally bleaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo, apply reconstructor, shampoo, then applied a light layer of coconut oil then let blew dry hair. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a couple more hours waiting just preoiling my hair again for highlights and lowlights so I just applied it to damp hair as a conditioner/barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlights and lowlights came out amazing, no signs of the coconut oil inhibiting color absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this technique for anyone who plans on any bleaching or coloring process. But I highly recommend doing a test strand first on your hair. Especially for those with existing dye on their hair. My hair was virgin but even I still did a test strand to see how well and how fast the bleach would perform with the coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color Pay-off:&lt;br /&gt;This is a very effective lightener. It will lighten virgin black hair to a level 9-10 after first application. The formula is quite potent so if you are doing an on-scalp application, never use more than a 25-30 volume developer. A 40 volume will cause irritation or leave chemical burns even if you leave it on for just 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This product is more than capable to lifting hair to any desired level, however do not forget to tone or apply desired shade to hair because it will leave either some faint yellowness or brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Health:&lt;br /&gt;The health of your hair will always be compromised whatever chemical treatment you undergo, although starting health of hair, formula, reconstruction will affect the end result. It doesn&#x27;t come as a shock that the hair will feel drier after this process but, after applying some protein reconstructor and moisture treatment, the hair will feel silky and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up with regular protein reconstruction and moisture treatments and the hair will stay strong and healthy.ll cause irritation or leave chemical burns even if you leave it on for just 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This product is more than capable to lifting hair to any desired level, however do not forget to tone or apply desired shade to hair because it will leave either some faint yellowness or brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Health:&lt;br /&gt;The health of your hair will always be compromised whatever chemical treatment you undergo, although starting health of hair, formula, reconstruction will affect the end result.

            <li> I used other brand but this is the best</li>
            <li> So I did a ton of research in this product and finally decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have very very dark hair from years of hair dye you wouldn&#x27;t believe the amount of built up. I decided one day I wanted purple hair the first time ( no shocker) I didn&#x27;t get anything more than a purple tint. So I went back and bought the lighter and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;First follow directions to a T I mean it your risking your hair falling out people! No more than 20 mixtures and never on your roots!! Second do the strand test DO IT&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a good guideline for how long your hair will take to get desired level.&lt;br /&gt;So after we did all that the change in my hair was amazing I only did half ( better safe than sorry) and the amount of color it lifted was great ! Like I said before I have black hair and after the bleach it was a really ugly red/ blonde color that I could easily dye over. It was a little streaky but I think that was user error. Not product&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t stink doesn&#x27;t burn doesn&#x27;t run my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like straw so all in all I&#x27;m super please with this stuff</li>
            <li> Great product, lightens hair fast!&lt;br /&gt;You have to know what you&#x27;re doing while dealing with bleach.. It can bleed or overprocess fast!</li>
            <li> This product comes in a powder form, and you have to mix it with the [[ASIN:B005NISMBI Creme Developer]] to use.  I used a brush to apply to my hair, and it bleached my hair pretty well and fast.  It is important to apply evenly to get even bleaching.  It will bleach your natural hair faster than dyed hair, so if you have roots coming out dark, apply to your roots last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best when paired with the ion color brilliance developer.  If you are looking for an inexpensive bleach that does the job, this is it.  It gets my hair which is usually a dark brown color to bleach blonde in one to two bleaches and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.  I would suggest getting this.</li>
            <li> Been using this to put blonde into the underside of my dark dark brown hair, works great! Be careful blonding!</li>
            <li> I am in Asia.. Continent of black dyed hair.. I have this and Proof 10&#x27;mild to me .. a blessing.. but I want it mailed to me directly.. and I&#x27;d happoly buy it from TaoBao... and so would many others</li>
            <li> This bleach is perfect. It lifts my stubborn dark brown hair very well and i haven&#x27;t had any chemical burns. I do leave it on my head for at least an hour-sometimes 2 hours mainly cuz i need it to be very light and i honestly don&#x27;t wanna have to bleach my roots a twice lol.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ion Color Brilliance Powder Lightener for 4 years. Compared to other bleach powders, this causes minimal irritation to my scalp, even when I leave it on for 45 minutes to strip stubborn color. It&#x27;s also a very strong effective bleach, as long as you use the proper concentration of peroxide. I would recommend this bleach to anyone; the price is very reasonable and the product is very versatile. Win!</li>
