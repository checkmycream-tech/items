            <li>What an awesome product!</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t like to use hairspray and this is a perfect substitute for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>She thinks it&#x27;s &#x27;the best&#x27; for her hair.  </li>
            <li>It also moisturizes my face, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This serum is an incredible detangler (and I have tried them all).</li>
            <li>With it my hair is beautiful.</li>
            <li>People are complimenting me again on how beautiful my hair is.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Love my Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Works perfect with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product is 10 times better than anything else on the market!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, we were happy with the substitution on our order.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Picture a long-haired poodle and that would describe my hair without this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>i love this hair product works great makes it feel soft &amp; silky &amp; look good always fresh &amp; good</li>
            <li>If you have more hair you can use more of it without worrying about making your hair oily.</li>
            <li>The product works really good, would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>my first impression is ok, but I think I need more time to evaluate it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll lightly dab on my roots to prevent Frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years to smooth my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>However, we feel that the new product, Loma Pearitin Fortifying Repairaitive LOTION, is even better!  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser in Missouri originally turned me onto a sample</li>
            <li>This is great if your hair is in good condition now or if it&#x27;s in the worse condition.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first!</li>
            <li>My husband has fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>even if you have thin and fine hair it will work great.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, blonde, highlighted hair and whenever I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>Buyers should be made aware that Loma no longer makes a repairative SERUM.</li>
            <li>I get my hair lightened regularly and I always using Loma after washing my hair and my hair is healthy to this day.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This serum is very lightweight so</li>
            <li>I live out in the boonie!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and soft, even though my hair has been colored.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the green, &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, but still fantastic.</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft, rejuvenated and not greasy</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a very long way too, so it&#x27;s quite economical despite the initial higher cost.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse hair that has natural curl AND frizz.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a major improvement in my hair since I started using this product and I can definitely tell the difference when I do not use it.</li>

            <li> I use it to bring out the curl in my hair after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> The supplier just needs to replace the ad and picture of the  Serum with one of the Lotion to avoid confusion and the possible  claim of false advertising.</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling and looking a little tired and dry.</li>
            <li> I had bad hair day after bad hair day.  </li>

            <li> What an awesome product! I cannot do without the serum! I order this regularly. I live out in the boonie!</li>
            <li> This serum is an incredible detangler (and I have tried them all). A little bit goes a very long way too, so it&#x27;s quite economical despite the initial higher cost.</li>

            <li> I have very coarse hair that has natural curl AND frizz. This smooths and calms it and makes it feel silky. That&#x27;s a first!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My hair was chemically damaged so my stylist suggested I purchase this item. I have noticed a major improvement in my hair since I started using this product and I can definitely tell the difference when I do not use it. I&#x27;m hooked on this and praying that they never stop selling it or try changing it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy looking and is weightless. I can even use it in between hair washes and it doesn&#x27;t build up. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I find it to be extremely over priced for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair. Picture a long-haired poodle and that would describe my hair without this amazing product. My hairdresser turned me onto it. It makes my hair silky and soft, even though my hair has been colored. My husband has fine, straight hair. He doesn&#x27;t like to use hairspray and this is a perfect substitute for him. Don&#x27;t pass this one by. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come in this bottle. It&#x27;s the green, &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, but still fantastic. Hair is so soft, rejuvenated and not greasy</li>
            <li> Really nice. Won&#x27;t leave hair oily</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years now. My hairdresser in Missouri originally turned me onto a sample and I have always had some on hand ever since.I have very fine, blonde, highlighted hair and whenever I get out of the shower it&#x27;s a struggle to brush through the tangles but with this product I put about a quarter sized drop on my hand and apply it from the middle to the ends and the remaining amount I&#x27;ll lightly dab on my roots to prevent Frizz. It&#x27;s pricey but a little goes a long way so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> my first impression is ok, but I think I need more time to evaluate it</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my daughter-in-law.  She thinks it&#x27;s &#x27;the best&#x27; for her hair.  Just rub some on your hands and run hem hrough your hair...</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a little mousse. Works perfect with my fine hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is 10 times better than anything else on the market! Just a tiny dab goes a long way, and helps control the frizzies. My local hair salon refuses to carry this and insists on the over priced PM products. Love my Amazon!!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff, without it I had bad hair day after bad hair day.  With it my hair is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I color and highlight my hair often. My hair was feeling and looking a little tired and dry. I was told to try Loma and WOW....it made all the difference in the world. People are complimenting me again on how beautiful my hair is. Thank you Loma!</li>
            <li> i love this hair product works great makes it feel soft &amp; silky &amp; look good always fresh &amp; good</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years to smooth my frizzy hair. It also moisturizes my face, and smells wonderful. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This serum is very lightweight so even if you have thin and fine hair it will work great. If you have more hair you can use more of it without worrying about making your hair oily. I get my hair lightened regularly and I always using Loma after washing my hair and my hair is healthy to this day. This is great if your hair is in good condition now or if it&#x27;s in the worse condition. You can also add it to any deep mask.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I use it to bring out the curl in my hair after it&#x27;s dried.  Been using it for years. Have tried other products, but they are wimps compared to Pearatin.</li>
