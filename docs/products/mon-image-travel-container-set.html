            <li>Thanks!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Classic group of travel bottles that come in very handy for travel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend trying to fit more items in the bag than the set of bottles that comes with it.</li>
            <li>This container worked fine, even with the spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>spray bottle was used, in my case, to hold mouthwash (since I needed a special mouthwash) and I just unscrewed it when needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The pop-top squirt bottle was used to hold a special astringent that I require for my face.  </li>
            <li>But they seem to be good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>but most things I have are blue, my favorite color.</li>
            <li>The plastic is on the thin side, not the best quality.</li>
            <li>I did use a couple items, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to be as useful as I wanted.</li>
            <li>Being plastic they aren&#x27;t good for natural ingredients like essential oils ( tea tree, lavender,etc) unless diluted, they ne glass bottles.</li>
            <li>The set I got was in a bright pink, which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it was exactly what I needed for traveling with a carry on.</li>
            <li>Pretty durable.</li>
            <li>Nice little travel pack for the money.</li>
            <li>There was more in the package than I expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty average quality item, it&#x27;s pretty cheap though</li>
            <li>bag itself has a plastic zipper, and it held everything together nicely for TSA to pointlessly analyze.  </li>
            <li>But more important is that the bottles were thin and have sort of worn marks on them.</li>
            <li>3 stars because I received them not in blue but in clear.</li>
            <li>There was a bit of a mess, but fortunately I&#x27;d had the bag in an outer pocket and away from my clothes and other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottles were different colors, clear and pink.</li>

            <li> Good price. Handy for travels.</li>
            <li> One of the small containers spilled. The plastic is on the thin side, not the best quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered blue one but I received white</li>
            <li> There was more in the package than I expected. Which is actually perfect because I pack a lot of toiletries. The bottles were different colors, clear and pink.</li>
            <li> Nice little travel pack for the money.</li>
            <li> Very cute and convenient!!</li>
            <li> The bottles are great. Sturdy design. I have not actually taken my trip yet so I can not attest to how these hold up during a flight. The bag that they are in is not of good quality. It broke after I zipped it open a second time. I just put them in a zip lock bag. The bottles most importantly are good.</li>
            <li> Item just as pictured.</li>
            <li> Great travel pack the zip bag is a good plus</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend trying to fit more items in the bag than the set of bottles that comes with it. I split the zipper by doing that. Otherwise it was exactly what I needed for traveling with a carry on. No leaks!</li>
            <li> And you might wonder how a person can review a bunch of plastic items.  Well, it&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double-flap container was used to hold flight medications.  In this it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two cylinder containers are I presume for makeup.  I didn&#x27;t use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle was used, in my case, to hold mouthwash (since I needed a special mouthwash) and I just unscrewed it when needed.  This container worked fine, even with the spray nozzle.  I had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-top squirt bottle was used to hold a special astringent that I require for my face.  This bottle was a fail.  It leaked all in the zipper bag, and it ruined some other stuff I had in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap-top squirt bottle was used to hold a facial toner.  This bottle was also a fail, as it leaked and mixed with the astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag itself has a plastic zipper, and it held everything together nicely for TSA to pointlessly analyze.  Problem is that when the other bottles leaked, they also managed to escape through the plastic zipper (since plastic zippers do not hold too well).  There was a bit of a mess, but fortunately I&#x27;d had the bag in an outer pocket and away from my clothes and other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggest looking for a different bottle pack.  Concept is sound, application is terrible.</li>
            <li> Got what I paid for. Bag did not last the trip. It did not shut close. Bottles are just okay.</li>
            <li> Good variety of containers. 3 stars because I received them not in blue but in clear. And one of the bottle caps had a crack. I&#x27;d return it but I had to travel.</li>
            <li> The set is perfect for travelling. I ordered blue but got pink. It&#x27;s ok for the purpose but most things I have are blue, my favorite color. The bottle are great for shampoo, conditioner, and toiletries. Being plastic they aren&#x27;t good for natural ingredients like essential oils ( tea tree, lavender,etc) unless diluted, they ne glass bottles.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Thanks!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> We used these on our trip to Jamaica and they worked great! We had no problems getting through airline security because they meet the requirements for liquids. I ordered two sets for my mom and I and both of us liked them.</li>
            <li> Worked out well for last trip. Pretty durable.</li>
            <li> Nice set for traveling.  Quality product for the price</li>
            <li> The set I got was in a bright pink, which I don&#x27;t really like. But more important is that the bottles were thin and have sort of worn marks on them. I&#x27;m concerned to use them now because I&#x27;m afraid that I might not be the first owner. Plus, one of them (the most left one) has a broken lid! Maybe it was just my bad luck, but I do suggest that you give a second thought on buying this set!</li>
            <li> Was not same color as picture shown. I received brought pink instead of blue bottles. But they seem to be good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Classic group of travel bottles that come in very handy for travel. They&#x27;re sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty average quality item, it&#x27;s pretty cheap though so perhaps you get what you&#x27;re paying for.  The plastic was a bit harder so made it difficult to squeeze.  The bag would not seal hardly at all, kept opening.  I did use a couple items, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to be as useful as I wanted.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.  Worked perfectly for her carry on.</li>
