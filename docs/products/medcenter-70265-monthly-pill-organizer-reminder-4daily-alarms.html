            <li>The clock and alarm were easy for me to set with 4 seperate alarms you can use or turn off if you don&#x27;t need them all.</li>
            <li>Pill dispenser [Medcenter Jumbo System] is working fine in the beep mode.</li>
            <li>But for us it&#x27;s fine.</li>

            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This is our first pill case that holds more than one week at a time.</li>
            <li>The timer and alarms are easy to program, and the buttons on top very clear to their purpose.</li>
            <li>The second one has been more reliable, even with the dropping of it more than once!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this system to anyone who needs to take pills on time and more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I was having to spend every free minute making sure my mother in law took her medications properly.</li>
            <li>it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the effort to get use to organizing monthly.</li>
            <li>I also like that since I fill a months worth at a time, I am aware ahead of time if I need to renew a prescription.    </li>
            <li>When I get a month&#x27;s worth of pills from the drug store, I set up the whole month at once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very persistant!</li>
            <li>Thought first it was pricey but after using it for Mom</li>
            <li>It has large colored buttons for alarm acknowledge to help her know which button to push.</li>
            <li>I use this to set up a month&#x27;s worth of pills and vitamins for a 98 year old.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really a very well designed product.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up &amp; loud enough to be heard as a reminder that it is now time to take pills.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>The only drawback was the size of the jumbo pill case doesn&#x27;t fit in the \\&quot;today&#x27;s pills\\&quot; place next to the alarm.  </li>
            <li>The pill boxes are large enough to hold all of her medications.</li>
            <li>The talking reminder speaks clearly and repeats until the person presses a button to acknowledge it.</li>
            <li>It does not take the medication for them but the reminders are clear.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 74 year old Father.  </li>
            <li>We no longer have to fill her pill box every 7 days, but now fill it only once a month, which is also very helpful.</li>
            <li>The alarm/voice is loud and can be heard all over the house and will continue to go off until she comes to shut it off.  </li>
            <li>The color coding of green and red is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Finally a 7day 4xdaily pill organizer that is large enough for a transplant patients needs.  </li>
            <li>For the pill that she only takes once a week at a special time, I tuck in a little paper slip that says \\&quot;weekly pill\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>I use the lowest volume, and it&#x27;s loud enough.</li>
            <li>I have not personally seen it because it was sent directly to my Dad as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>Although it takes a little time to fill it each month, the ease of pill taking from then on makes the extra time well worth it.    </li>
            <li>The voice alarm is loud enough she can hear it even if she is not in the same room.</li>

            <li> I use this to set up a month&#x27;s worth of pills and vitamins for a 98 year old.  She is forgetful, so having the reminder is essential.  She doesn&#x27;t have worry that she will forget a pill. I don&#x27;t need to constantly remind her, the box does.    It is easy to set up. When I get a month&#x27;s worth of pills from the drug store, I set up the whole month at once. Although she only takes pills twice a day, the box can be set up for four times a day. For the pill that she only takes once a week at a special time, I tuck in a little paper slip that says \\&quot;weekly pill\\&quot;.     I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends, and even to her doctor.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother.  She was forgetting to take medications.  This was a great solution and the size of the containers make it easy for her to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Pill dispenser [Medcenter Jumbo System] is working fine in the beep mode. I cannot use the times that are automatically shown as pills have to be taken 6AM ;7AM; 11:30 AM and 5pM. Is it possible to to change voice announcement? This would be a great help.      Thanks</li>
            <li> Great system!! A wonderful time saver! I was having to spend every free minute making sure my mother in law took her medications properly. I can now set up her meds and check once a week that she is taking her meds. It is easy for her to understand and use. It gives her a since of control and me comfort in knowing she is taking her meds properly. The pill containers are perfect size for multiple large pills.Love the timer. I would highly recommend this system. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Knowing that my mom is taking her medications on time and getting all of her vitamins is a huge stress reliever!  The monthly set-up of all the pills/vitamins can be time consuming - especially if there are a lot of medications involved.  But the end result of having all of them in one spot is great!  The color coding of green and red is fantastic!  At a glance I can see when she&#x27;s going to have a medication run out and can plan in advance.  She was notorious for running out of a medication and not having it refilled until days later - so in the meantime, she was suffering with pain, etc.  Also getting a pharmacy that delivers her medications ONCE a month and has synchronized them to all renew on the same date was a life saver!  The only drawback was the size of the jumbo pill case doesn&#x27;t fit in the \\&quot;today&#x27;s pills\\&quot; place next to the alarm.  But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for everything it does do!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my elderly Mom and it is perfect.  I can prepare her meds for a whole month and the audio reminder is a great feature for her!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dispenser for my ailing father. It&#x27;s easy for both my mother and him to manage.  Prior to purchasing this system, my father would confuse his daytime and nighttime meds.  The Medcenter helps keep everything organized for the entire month.  He doesn&#x27;t use the timer, but he may need to in the future.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my over 80 parents who either forgot if they had taken their meds or took them at the wrong time.  Not only does it remind them of the pills, it helps them with the day of the month.  And, the reminder voice is easy to understand and polite:)</li>
            <li> I am older, and disabled, and was having a hard time with my meds. I couldn&#x27;t remember if I had taken them already or not, so I missed a lot of doses because I was afraid to overdose. I bought this unit three months ago, and I haven&#x27;t missed a dose since. The audio reminder will repeat until you press the acknowledge button, in short increments. If you happen to be away when a dose is due, it will still remind you when you return. It&#x27;s very persistant! Also loud enough for someone that is hard of hearing. I use the lowest volume, and it&#x27;s loud enough. I also like that since I fill a months worth at a time, I am aware ahead of time if I need to renew a prescription.    It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny! If you have an older family member that needs help remembering this product is perfect!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly mother who was forgetting to take her medicine at least once every day. I could not find anything to help her until I decided to try this. It is the solution to my problem. The voice alarm is loud enough she can hear it even if she is not in the same room. If she does not respond immediately it will repeat the alarm about every 5 minutes until she acknowledges it. The date is given as part of the alarm so she knows which pill box to use. The pill boxes are large enough to hold all of her medications. The clock and alarm were easy for me to set with 4 seperate alarms you can use or turn off if you don&#x27;t need them all. It has large colored buttons for alarm acknowledge to help her know which button to push. This has been the solution to my problem. I highly recommend this item to anyone of any age who has trouble remembering to take their medication.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 74 year old Father.  I was hesitant because of the price but decided to take a chance based on the reviews.  Wow!!  It was simple to set up and both my Dad and I have the peace of mind that he will be taking his meds as directed and we only need to fill it once a month.  The talking reminder is genius!</li>
            <li> This product was ordered for my elderly mother who just recently began to take medicine 4 different times a day.  The intergrated alarm, calendar, clock and voice system kept track of all the times for her, reminding her with either a voice or an alarm at the preset time to take her medicine.  The vials are dated and coincide with the calendar date.  We no longer have to fill her pill box every 7 days, but now fill it only once a month, which is also very helpful. The alarm/voice is loud and can be heard all over the house and will continue to go off until she comes to shut it off.  This is a great reminder for her.  I have even suggested this product to several doctors and nurses to suggest for their patients with multiple meds, too.</li>
            <li> This medicine organizer is a great tool. It holds medicines for an entire month, up to four doses per day. The talking reminder speaks clearly and repeats until the person presses a button to acknowledge it. My mother laughs everytime she hears it.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you what a godsend the MedcenterSystem Talking Monitor Pill Reminder and Organizer has been to me.  I am presently involved in a five year study of Macular Degeneration at UCLA.  I was finding it difficult to remember to take my pills on time and because this is in my opinion, a very important study, I wanted to do my very best in participating.    Since receiving the Medcenter System, I have not missed taking medications on time.  Although it takes a little time to fill it each month, the ease of pill taking from then on makes the extra time well worth it.    I highly recommend this system to anyone who needs to take pills on time and more than once a day.</li>
            <li> We purchased this item for my wife who recently had transplant surgery. She has a number of meds which must be taken at precise time throughout the day. This product works perfectly to organize her meds, and announce loudly each time meds need to be taken. It&#x27;s relatively compact sitting on the counter in the kitchen, holding up to a month of meds. We also like the visual red/green cues. The timer and alarms are easy to program, and the buttons on top very clear to their purpose. The only very minor drawback is that the pill compartments are relatively small -- smaller than the previous pill organizer she had. Her 9:00 AM meds just fit. But for us it&#x27;s fine. Really a very well designed product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to set up &amp; loud enough to be heard as a reminder that it is now time to take pills. Thought first it was pricey but after using it for Mom it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Finally a 7day 4xdaily pill organizer that is large enough for a transplant patients needs.  We do not need the reminder messages but are glad that it is offered for those that do need it.  Did not take long to figure out to put dates in order starting with Sunday through Saturday and line them up so I could distribute pills on correct days of the week as the days change with the different months.  This is our first pill case that holds more than one week at a time. It is worth the effort to get use to organizing monthly.</li>
            <li> this is a great idea.  my husband was forgetting to take his medicine and now has a polite lady telling him to take his medicine.  how great is that!</li>
            <li> The second one has been more reliable, even with the dropping of it more than once!&lt;br /&gt;The problem we have is grandma remembering to take the pills when she turns off the alarm.  Either that or she doesn&#x27;t want to!</li>
            <li> I am a nurse practitioner and I am using this for my mother and father.  I find it invaluable to improve compliance.  It does not take the medication for them but the reminders are clear.  I pour the medication for my mother and she just needs to take it.  She is on over 30 pills at varying times.  I cannot recommend this enough!!</li>
            <li> The idea of this item is great.  I have not personally seen it because it was sent directly to my Dad as a Christmas gift.  I upgraded the product to the larger pill holders expecting them to be at least as big as the ones he is using now which only hold a week at a time. But that was not the case.  He could not get all of his medications and vitamins in the containers, which pretty much makes it useless.  After paying over $70 for it, I expected it to hold them.  I have see how many pills he takes at one time (the most being in the am and pm) and it isn&#x27;t that many!  They fit in a $5 weekly pill holder from Walgreens just fine, with room to spare.  I am disappointed to say the least.</li>
