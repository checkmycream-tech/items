            <li>Thanks Andis, Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just received this item, and it works really great, just exactly how the product description says it&#x27;s suppose to, I am very happy with my purchase, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Best Hair rod used so far..much better than even high cost rods..</li>
            <li>it is easily a cheaper substitute that get the job done!</li>
            <li>I like very much did not need additional plug it was great as is.</li>
            <li>It makes beautiful curls and can also make your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>These are great and get really hot.</li>
            <li>Gets hot size is great, but the minute I put it to my hair</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair very smooth when I straighten.</li>
            <li>It pulls my hair and feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I received the product the next day which was so great!!</li>
            <li>Bought this hoping I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener though.</li>
            <li>I love the wave you can achieve with the curved edge and so do a lot of my clients, so I ordered this one to replace it...</li>
            <li>MAKE sure</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair, it works fantastic! :)</li>
            <li>returned home to a burned counter top.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the curved edges.  </li>
            <li>I love the curved edges on it</li>
            <li>I love the 1\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love the curved edges for a whispy flip.  </li>
            <li>so you can heat it safely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $50, but I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this more for the dual wattage.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use it for a month</li>
            <li>Love it for straightening or making some curls.  </li>
            <li>Love the comfort of the handles, as well as the temperature controls.</li>
            <li>Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li>This curved edge flat iron works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, my boyfriend bought me the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for Christmas because it had the best reviews.</li>
            <li>I was nervous buying a flat iron online, but this one is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Nice flat iron for the price works great.  </li>
            <li>I love the curved edges and it gets nice and hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I don&#x27;t think mine was ever able to fully heat up (maybe why the light never turned off?)</li>
            <li>But, since my mom loved it so much, I gave mine to her..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to give the ends a quick bit of curve, no matter how you&#x27;re holding the wand.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to snag on a hair or two.</li>
            <li>and I found it really easy to use.</li>
            <li>This heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can flip my hair easily with this iron too.  </li>
            <li>here it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It straightens fine, but pulls my hair and rips it out.</li>
            <li>my hair is huge and curly, FYI.  </li>
            <li>When the power is on, the device makes an electric buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>The light on mine never stopped blinking, not even after about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves smooth and silky look to my hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works very well and is great!</li>
            <li>This works great for flat iron, curls and waves around your face.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works great to both straighten and curl your hair.  </li>
            <li>The bevel edge makes it super easy to even curl with it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I bought this as something cheap but full sized that I could bring overseas since it was dual voltage.</li>
            <li>I am always having to clean hair out of the crack between the metal and plastic.</li>
            <li>it will burn the counter top and when doing curls in thr back of your own head you cannot see the iron I&#x27;ve burnt myself on the side ceramic.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is by far, the best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li>this flat iron is nice for me because it curves at the ends and looks better for my hair style.</li>
            <li>Worth more than what was paid ;)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the only good thing about it</li>
            <li>While it says on the packaging that it heats up in 30 seconds, it takes about 2-3 minutes to get up to full temperature.  </li>
            <li>The curved edges are nice for curling hair as long as you remember not to get it too close to ears or scalp:)</li>
            <li>The finger grip doesn&#x27;t get hot at all so you can easily hold the tip of the tool.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Was just as described and was deliverd quickly.</li>
            <li>Weirdly enough, this flat iron is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron last year &amp; it is still working perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it claimed to heat up in 30 seconds and then the light would stop blinking to indicate that it was hot.</li>
            <li>Good buy if you have medium and long strands of hair.</li>
            <li>The curved edge makes it really easy to grab the shorter hair on my hairline&#x27;s edges really close to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair rarely gets snagged or caught - and this thing is HOT!  </li>
            <li>I heard a loud popping noise followed by a snap of light, sounds like a light bulb exploding.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>Curls can be achieved, super straight hair and volume!</li>
            <li>I was able to touch my fingers briefly to the plates without burning myself, even though it was turned all the way up, so I think it just wasn&#x27;t hot enough to work... which is kind of the point of a flat iron and sort of negates all of the good features...</li>
            <li>Nice flat iron.</li>
            <li>thing about it got my kinky coily hair really straight and smooth and heats up really hot</li>
            <li>Only downside is that the flat iron falls over easily and won&#x27;t sit on the counter that good.</li>
            <li>I used it today to straighten my hair, and it straightened quickly and easily on a lower setting, leaving my hair straight, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a good straightener because I was using a straightener and a curling iron previously</li>
            <li>The varying heat settings made it easy to set it hot enough to really hold the curl for a good, long time without a ton of product.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t catch my hair, I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li>I love the curved edge b/c I have short hair.</li>
            <li>However, I think my hair needs to stay on the hot surface for longer.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>If you squeeze it harder they will touch, but you&#x27;ll effectively put a dent in your hair.</li>
            <li>and it takes me about 15-20 minutes to do my whole head!</li>
            <li>you know the temperature you want, it does heat up FAST!</li>
            <li>this iron does not get too hot</li>
            <li>The control and heating were exactly as described .</li>
            <li>I use this wand on level 2 out of 20 and it straightens every bit of my frizzy or curly bit of \\&quot;frizz halo\\&quot;  without turning the ends crisp.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>I placed it on it&#x27;s side to heat and it left a scorch mark on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li>Now I just place a hot pad under it</li>
            <li>Iron plates don&#x27;t completely close and the &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light won&#x27;t stop blinking.</li>
            <li>I ended up tossing in the garbage and using my friends BaByliss tiny travel iron, which was immensely better.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice at first, but now I like it.</li>
            <li>Can not use it continuously because it won&#x27;t stay hot.</li>
            <li>The first I was about to use this item</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>This guy gets pretty hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron .</li>
            <li>I really love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>so I can achieve a wave if I want as well as straightening and it doesn&#x27;t put dents in my hair like so many flat irons do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Andis flat irons and curling irons.</li>
            <li>Love it, I use the flat iron with my 2 inch iron.</li>
            <li>I was shopping for a curved edge flat iron, Babyliss has one much more money, settled for this for 1/3 of the cost.  </li>
            <li>It has performed to my expectations and fulfilled what I was looking for in a flat iron, so there isn&#x27;t much more that I can say.</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron so much, I&#x27;m going to buy another.  </li>
            <li>I was getting ready for a date and the first amount of my hair I started on</li>
            <li>I have used Andis products in the past and loved them.  </li>
            <li>not so much, it heats up really well</li>
            <li>No biggie as it does heat fast, probably 1 minute.</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>It really works with my hair and I&#x27;ve never burnt my hair using it,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I would say purchase it but know that you&#x27;ll have to purchase another really soon.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by the hairdresser and my wife really loves it.</li>
            <li>so it makes the process much faster.  </li>
            <li>Do not lay this unit sideways on your counter or prop it against anything while it is on and make sure to keep the plates securely closed while it&#x27;s heating</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Heats really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this iron much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive professional tools offer more protection for your hair, but so far I love this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works for someone that has really really thin hair but definitely not for someone with good hair!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an overall good product.</li>
            <li>because after I blow out my hair this is so easy to use, heats up quickly, and I can go over my trouble areas.  </li>
            <li>This was not worth the $20, maybe more like $10.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like the heat shuts off and will not get hot until I put it down and let warm back up.</li>
            <li>Another thing to think about that I did not, you cannot set the iron down with the ceramic on both sides for a better curl</li>
            <li>I was quite excited to obtain this particular flat iron after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>, I had no problems returning it or getting my money back quickly, which can sometimes be an issue with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron because it looked to be a real good one, but unfortunately I could not use it.</li>
            <li>It does do the job as far as getting your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>I like that you can also makes curls with this flat iron because the plates are curved over the sides where most flat iron aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I wish I would not have bought this particular style because it gets really hot around the area you actually hold to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>Only thing, it doesn&#x27;t run along the hair as smoothly as the titanium, nor does it leave the same shine...  </li>
            <li>The green light does not come on to show it is ready to use.</li>
            <li>It straightens my long thick hair nicely!</li>
            <li>Finally, a flat iron with smooth rounded edges and a low heat setting!</li>
            <li>so you can use two hands for smaller sections, but depending on the setting, your fingers will get hot.</li>
            <li>It also gets hot enough to straighten/curl.</li>
            <li>With a little practice, I think this should be fairly easy to overcome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I ended up contacting Andis directly (seller return time period had expired) and they sent me a new unit at no charge.</li>
            <li>But, less than 2 months after I started to use it, the coating is rubbed off of the plates and the blinking light just keeps blinking . . .</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that you have to be careful when curling or flipping because the rounded edges make it really easy to accidentally touch the plates to your fingers or head.</li>
            <li>Green ready light blinks continuously, does not shut off after the promised 30 second heat up.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this &amp; am going to buy one for my mother very soon.</li>
            <li>The curved edges keep you from getting crimp lines near the scalp</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to family, friends, and professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to cool down when straightening, even with slightly damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I should have listened to the other reviews - the green light does not stop blinking and it doesn&#x27;t heat up much.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re looking for a straightener that really grabs onto hair and that you can use one-handed, this will do so but only with larger sections of hair.  </li>
            <li>and it cant clamp all the way down unless I force it in the right position.</li>
            <li>Works well, had doubts at first due to gap between the plates.</li>
            <li>The only negatives would be that the ceramic plates are a bit short and constantly catch and pull your hair where the plates meet the control area and the unit gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>But there were a couple of major</li>
            <li>I have fine hair - it shouldn&#x27;t have been that hard to straighten and/or curl</li>
            <li>I have tried many different flat irons in the past but none have given me the results this one has.</li>
            <li>So I was only able to use this flat iron for about 30 seconds and not satisfied or like this situation at all....</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to invest a new flat iron (the one I had before this one lasted for over 2 years!).</li>
            <li>Clearly someone sent this back after they used it</li>
            <li>No different than any other straightening tool really.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for anyone that has a full head of hair or thick hair.</li>
            <li>This product had so many of the things I wanted in a flat iron:  swivel cord, feature to keep it closed, rounded edges, thick barrel.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thanks Andis, Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just received this item, and it works really great, just exactly how the product description says it&#x27;s suppose to, I am very happy with my purchase, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Best Hair rod used so far..much better than even high cost rods..</li>
            <li> it is easily a cheaper substitute that get the job done!</li>
            <li> I like very much did not need additional plug it was great as is.</li>
            <li> It makes beautiful curls and can also make your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> These are great and get really hot.</li>
            <li> Gets hot size is great, but the minute I put it to my hair</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair very smooth when I straighten.</li>
            <li> It pulls my hair and feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> I received the product the next day which was so great!!</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener though.</li>
            <li> I love the wave you can achieve with the curved edge and so do a lot of my clients, so I ordered this one to replace it...</li>
            <li> MAKE sure</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair, it works fantastic! :)</li>
            <li> returned home to a burned counter top.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love the curved edges.  </li>
            <li> I love the curved edges on it</li>
            <li> I love the 1\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love the curved edges for a whispy flip.  </li>
            <li> so you can heat it safely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $50, but I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this more for the dual wattage.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use it for a month</li>
            <li> Love it for straightening or making some curls.  </li>
            <li> Love the comfort of the handles, as well as the temperature controls.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li> This curved edge flat iron works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, my boyfriend bought me the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for Christmas because it had the best reviews.</li>
            <li> I was nervous buying a flat iron online, but this one is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron for the price works great.  </li>
            <li> I love the curved edges and it gets nice and hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I don&#x27;t think mine was ever able to fully heat up (maybe why the light never turned off?)</li>
            <li> But, since my mom loved it so much, I gave mine to her..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to give the ends a quick bit of curve, no matter how you&#x27;re holding the wand.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to snag on a hair or two.</li>
            <li> and I found it really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can flip my hair easily with this iron too.  </li>
            <li> here it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It straightens fine, but pulls my hair and rips it out.</li>
            <li> my hair is huge and curly, FYI.  </li>
            <li> When the power is on, the device makes an electric buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> The light on mine never stopped blinking, not even after about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves smooth and silky look to my hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very well and is great!</li>
            <li> This works great for flat iron, curls and waves around your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great to both straighten and curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> The bevel edge makes it super easy to even curl with it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I bought this as something cheap but full sized that I could bring overseas since it was dual voltage.</li>
            <li> I am always having to clean hair out of the crack between the metal and plastic.</li>
            <li> it will burn the counter top and when doing curls in thr back of your own head you cannot see the iron I&#x27;ve burnt myself on the side ceramic.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is by far, the best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li> this flat iron is nice for me because it curves at the ends and looks better for my hair style.</li>
            <li> Worth more than what was paid ;)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the only good thing about it</li>
            <li> While it says on the packaging that it heats up in 30 seconds, it takes about 2-3 minutes to get up to full temperature.  </li>
            <li> The curved edges are nice for curling hair as long as you remember not to get it too close to ears or scalp:)</li>
            <li> The finger grip doesn&#x27;t get hot at all so you can easily hold the tip of the tool.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Was just as described and was deliverd quickly.</li>
            <li> Weirdly enough, this flat iron is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron last year &amp; it is still working perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it claimed to heat up in 30 seconds and then the light would stop blinking to indicate that it was hot.</li>
            <li> Good buy if you have medium and long strands of hair.</li>
            <li> The curved edge makes it really easy to grab the shorter hair on my hairline&#x27;s edges really close to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair rarely gets snagged or caught - and this thing is HOT!  </li>
            <li> I heard a loud popping noise followed by a snap of light, sounds like a light bulb exploding.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> Curls can be achieved, super straight hair and volume!</li>
            <li> I was able to touch my fingers briefly to the plates without burning myself, even though it was turned all the way up, so I think it just wasn&#x27;t hot enough to work... which is kind of the point of a flat iron and sort of negates all of the good features...</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron.</li>
            <li> thing about it got my kinky coily hair really straight and smooth and heats up really hot</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the flat iron falls over easily and won&#x27;t sit on the counter that good.</li>
            <li> I used it today to straighten my hair, and it straightened quickly and easily on a lower setting, leaving my hair straight, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a good straightener because I was using a straightener and a curling iron previously</li>
            <li> The varying heat settings made it easy to set it hot enough to really hold the curl for a good, long time without a ton of product.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t catch my hair, I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I love the curved edge b/c I have short hair.</li>
            <li> However, I think my hair needs to stay on the hot surface for longer.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> If you squeeze it harder they will touch, but you&#x27;ll effectively put a dent in your hair.</li>
            <li> and it takes me about 15-20 minutes to do my whole head!</li>
            <li> you know the temperature you want, it does heat up FAST!</li>
            <li> this iron does not get too hot</li>
            <li> The control and heating were exactly as described .</li>
            <li> I use this wand on level 2 out of 20 and it straightens every bit of my frizzy or curly bit of \\&quot;frizz halo\\&quot;  without turning the ends crisp.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I placed it on it&#x27;s side to heat and it left a scorch mark on my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li> Now I just place a hot pad under it</li>
            <li> Iron plates don&#x27;t completely close and the &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light won&#x27;t stop blinking.</li>
            <li> I ended up tossing in the garbage and using my friends BaByliss tiny travel iron, which was immensely better.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice at first, but now I like it.</li>
            <li> Can not use it continuously because it won&#x27;t stay hot.</li>
            <li> The first I was about to use this item</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> This guy gets pretty hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron .</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> so I can achieve a wave if I want as well as straightening and it doesn&#x27;t put dents in my hair like so many flat irons do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Andis flat irons and curling irons.</li>
            <li> Love it, I use the flat iron with my 2 inch iron.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a curved edge flat iron, Babyliss has one much more money, settled for this for 1/3 of the cost.  </li>
            <li> It has performed to my expectations and fulfilled what I was looking for in a flat iron, so there isn&#x27;t much more that I can say.</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much, I&#x27;m going to buy another.  </li>
            <li> I was getting ready for a date and the first amount of my hair I started on</li>
            <li> I have used Andis products in the past and loved them.  </li>
            <li> not so much, it heats up really well</li>
            <li> No biggie as it does heat fast, probably 1 minute.</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li> It really works with my hair and I&#x27;ve never burnt my hair using it,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I would say purchase it but know that you&#x27;ll have to purchase another really soon.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the hairdresser and my wife really loves it.</li>
            <li> so it makes the process much faster.  </li>
            <li> Do not lay this unit sideways on your counter or prop it against anything while it is on and make sure to keep the plates securely closed while it&#x27;s heating</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Heats really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this iron much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive professional tools offer more protection for your hair, but so far I love this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for someone that has really really thin hair but definitely not for someone with good hair!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s an overall good product.</li>
            <li> because after I blow out my hair this is so easy to use, heats up quickly, and I can go over my trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> This was not worth the $20, maybe more like $10.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like the heat shuts off and will not get hot until I put it down and let warm back up.</li>
            <li> Another thing to think about that I did not, you cannot set the iron down with the ceramic on both sides for a better curl</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to obtain this particular flat iron after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> , I had no problems returning it or getting my money back quickly, which can sometimes be an issue with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron because it looked to be a real good one, but unfortunately I could not use it.</li>
            <li> It does do the job as far as getting your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> I like that you can also makes curls with this flat iron because the plates are curved over the sides where most flat iron aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wish I would not have bought this particular style because it gets really hot around the area you actually hold to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> Only thing, it doesn&#x27;t run along the hair as smoothly as the titanium, nor does it leave the same shine...  </li>
            <li> The green light does not come on to show it is ready to use.</li>
            <li> It straightens my long thick hair nicely!</li>
            <li> Finally, a flat iron with smooth rounded edges and a low heat setting!</li>
            <li> so you can use two hands for smaller sections, but depending on the setting, your fingers will get hot.</li>
            <li> It also gets hot enough to straighten/curl.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, I think this should be fairly easy to overcome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I ended up contacting Andis directly (seller return time period had expired) and they sent me a new unit at no charge.</li>
            <li> But, less than 2 months after I started to use it, the coating is rubbed off of the plates and the blinking light just keeps blinking . . .</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that you have to be careful when curling or flipping because the rounded edges make it really easy to accidentally touch the plates to your fingers or head.</li>
            <li> Green ready light blinks continuously, does not shut off after the promised 30 second heat up.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this &amp; am going to buy one for my mother very soon.</li>
            <li> The curved edges keep you from getting crimp lines near the scalp</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to family, friends, and professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to cool down when straightening, even with slightly damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews - the green light does not stop blinking and it doesn&#x27;t heat up much.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re looking for a straightener that really grabs onto hair and that you can use one-handed, this will do so but only with larger sections of hair.  </li>
            <li> and it cant clamp all the way down unless I force it in the right position.</li>
            <li> Works well, had doubts at first due to gap between the plates.</li>
            <li> The only negatives would be that the ceramic plates are a bit short and constantly catch and pull your hair where the plates meet the control area and the unit gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> But there were a couple of major</li>
            <li> I have fine hair - it shouldn&#x27;t have been that hard to straighten and/or curl</li>
            <li> I have tried many different flat irons in the past but none have given me the results this one has.</li>
            <li> So I was only able to use this flat iron for about 30 seconds and not satisfied or like this situation at all....</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to invest a new flat iron (the one I had before this one lasted for over 2 years!).</li>
            <li> Clearly someone sent this back after they used it</li>
            <li> No different than any other straightening tool really.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for anyone that has a full head of hair or thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product had so many of the things I wanted in a flat iron:  swivel cord, feature to keep it closed, rounded edges, thick barrel.  </li>
            <li> New record for any other flat iron i have ever had.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is similar to the more expensive flat irons, and I did not pay alot for it.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair and i flat ironed it and no dye came out</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever use another flat iron &amp; it&#x27;s never left any dents in my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the &amp;#34;auto shut off&amp;#34; after about 20 minutes of me using it, the flat iron will turn off.</li>
            <li> The true test will be if it works there and doesn&#x27;t burn up like my other flat irons have done in the past.  </li>
            <li> When clamping down to do a curl , the iron seems to not close tight and slips right out of the hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very thick and curly, so I was surprised when I only had to make two or three passes to make my hair completely straight.</li>
            <li> I just bought this flat iron this month from walmart.</li>
            <li> however this flat iron</li>
            <li> However, the curls don&#x27;t last long in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and owned the titanium version of this curved edge flat iron..</li>
            <li> It is like the flat iron at her hair salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for the curved flat iron to make the flip I desire to make.</li>
            <li> I refused to pay the prices I saw in store for a name brand flat iron.</li>
            <li> The Andis 67410 Flat Iron works</li>
            <li> The flat iron does the job.</li>
            <li> When i use this andis flat iron to straighten my hair its like i have been to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I am referring this flat iron to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I think this flat iron is a case of you-get-what-you-pay-</li>
            <li> they are not good for salon use,made the  hair look dry,but  they did get really hot</li>
            <li> I  have used several other flat irons that did not leave that smell.</li>
            <li> that sometimes happen when you straighten a long piece of hair.  </li>
            <li> You really have to watch how thick your section is when ironing to prevent this.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is more unpleasant to use than one it is replacing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair when you try to make a curl in it like other flat irons do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent up to $80 on other flat irons, and while this doesn&#x27;t match those...</li>
            <li> My hair is average thickness and length (just past shoulders), slightly wavy/frizzy, and very obstinate.</li>
            <li> ceramic)i only used it at least twice so far and it already has little burned marks and coating coming off</li>
            <li> Be careful that you do not burn your fingers.  </li>
            <li> the cracks where the plates are joined to the rest of the iron will catch your hair and pull it out if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works like I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> Total Waste of money.</li>
            <li> only down side is that because the blades are curved, the edges can burn the surface that you set it down on.</li>
            <li> It pulls your hair and it burns your fingers due to the curved edges.</li>
            <li> Finally, there are small cracks between the plates and plastic where hair gets stuck in every pass-through.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was doing my daughters hair at the kitchen table the first time I used this</li>
            <li> well you just have to be very careful while using the device.</li>
            <li> This one sucks bad thing I now own two of them.</li>
            <li> They pinch part of your hair and don&#x27;t even clamp on the other half.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing technically wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates wore down after about 3 months of weekly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was competitive and it shuts down automatically if still plugged in after awhile.</li>
            <li> I give it four not five stars because is does take a little longer to straighten my hair than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I thought that the heated section would be slightly longer than it appears in the photo which is a bit of a let down.</li>
            <li> But even when I use a lower setting, it leaves a slightly burnt scent in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, with this price, I normally would have gone right by this, assuming that it was crap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible mine was just defective... or maybe it&#x27;s just not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair</li>
            <li> but it still did a little.</li>
            <li> $25 is lot of money to me to be wasted</li>
            <li> Just a few strands at a time, but every time I used it.</li>
            <li> Poor quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> Also when you do push down hard to try to curl the two ceramics do an over bite.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as bad as when i first began using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure of auto shut off as I have not tested that feature.</li>
            <li> I have always use Andis  products and have used their products in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more dents/creases if I pause too long!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I always assumed this flat iron must have been expensive, so</li>
            <li> Flat iron fail.</li>
            <li> you would have a hard time using it on it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t was your hard earned money on it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this thing, but it disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I wasnt my money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I threw away my box</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> This product is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate it when you can see iron marks in my hair, so this eliminates them.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> The plates are terrible and don&#x27;t line up.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst iron for curls.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love how thus curls my hair-!</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WAS A GREAT BUT FOR THE PRICE. THANK YOU HAIRS CURLS AND STRAIGHTENS PERFECT! WILL BUY FROM AGAIN,......</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife when she travels this summer. i do hope the 220v works there. here it works just fine. i guess we&#x27;ll just&lt;br /&gt;have to see.</li>
            <li> Worth more than what was paid ;)</li>
            <li> I just bought this flat iron this month from walmart. it costed $25.have already tried two andis styling tools curved vibrate titanium iron and their blow dryer both are great however this flat iron not so much, it heats up really well but the downfall of it is the coating comes off,(not buying anything else with nano ceramic)i only used it at least twice so far and it already has little burned marks and coating coming off and it cant clamp all the way down unless I force it in the right position. $25 is lot of money to me to be wasted but it was inexpensive so i don&#x27;t feel so bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great thing about it got my kinky coily hair really straight and smooth and heats up really hot that&#x27;s the only good thing about it</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. It pulls your hair and it burns your fingers due to the curved edges. The curved edges are supposed to be for curling and no crimps but this product won&#x27;t curl. Why you ask? Because the plates do not even touch together. Not to mention when I received this package it obviously was used. Clearly someone sent this back after they used it and they resent it to me. The product itself had dirt on it and had wear and tear. And the package was stapled together. Come on!</li>
            <li> Stopped working 10 min after it heated up</li>
            <li> It works well but it is easy to snag on a hair or two.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron. Heats up quickly and stays hot. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It straightens fine, but pulls my hair and rips it out. I am always having to clean hair out of the crack between the metal and plastic. If it didn&#x27;t catch my hair, I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool. I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive professional tools offer more protection for your hair, but so far I love this product. My hair is average thickness and length (just past shoulders), slightly wavy/frizzy, and very obstinate. I used it yesterday to curl my hair and I found it really easy to use. The varying heat settings made it easy to set it hot enough to really hold the curl for a good, long time without a ton of product. I used it today to straighten my hair, and it straightened quickly and easily on a lower setting, leaving my hair straight, soft, and shiny. The only drawback is that you have to be careful when curling or flipping because the rounded edges make it really easy to accidentally touch the plates to your fingers or head. With a little practice, I think this should be fairly easy to overcome. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a week but it works great, the price is great, it shipped in one day. I love the curved edge b/c I have short hair. I&#x27;ve spent up to $80 on other flat irons, and while this doesn&#x27;t match those...it is easily a cheaper substitute that get the job done!</li>
            <li> This guy gets pretty hot pretty fast. It also leaves my hair very smooth when I straighten. However, the curls don&#x27;t last long in my hair. I think I am going to have to buy a separate curling iron. The way you curl your hair with these, you&#x27;re constantly moving your hair through the device. However, I think my hair needs to stay on the hot surface for longer. I&#x27;m sure this works great for people with more compliant hair!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot quickly and is easy to use.  But even when I use a lower setting, it leaves a slightly burnt scent in my hair.  I  have used several other flat irons that did not leave that smell.</li>
            <li> Green ready light blinks continuously, does not shut off after the promised 30 second heat up. No biggie as it does heat fast, probably 1 minute. Not sure of auto shut off as I have not tested that feature. Works well, had doubts at first due to gap between the plates. I have short bob type haircut and id adds nice volume and almost waves! Very happy over all.</li>
            <li> I like my curling irons to have a curved edge.  It helps reduce split ends from fried hair.  This heats up very quickly.  Be careful that you do not burn your fingers.  However, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great straightener! I was thinking with the curved plates my hair wouldn&#x27;t get snagged but it still did a little. It may be just improper technique though. I received the product the next day which was so great!!</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping I&#x27;d love it. I do except for one thing...the cracks where the plates are joined to the rest of the iron will catch your hair and pull it out if you aren&#x27;t careful. You really have to watch how thick your section is when ironing to prevent this. Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> This works great for flat iron, curls and waves around your face. Heats up in 30 seconds. I love it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is similar to the more expensive flat irons, and I did not pay alot for it. Works just as well too!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this thing, but it disappointed. The metal plates don&#x27;t touch, so there&#x27;s a gap, which totally defeats the purpose of the tool (I posted a photo). If you squeeze it harder they will touch, but you&#x27;ll effectively put a dent in your hair. I was hoping it was just a defect on mine, but now that I looked through all the reviews I see that it&#x27;s not. I would not recommend buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I ended up contacting Andis directly (seller return time period had expired) and they sent me a new unit at no charge. It works great! I love the curved edges and it gets nice and hot. I also appreciate a manufacturer with good customer service.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat well. My hair kept getting stuck in the grooves of the iron and so it constantly pulls strands of hair off my head. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just started beauty school and my mom gave me this straightenr when I mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the one the school gave me. I love this straightener though. The bevel edge makes it super easy to even curl with it. The finger grip doesn&#x27;t get hot at all so you can easily hold the tip of the tool. All in all, for the price it&#x27;s a really nice straightener, I would tell you to defiantly get it.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Worth the price!  Naturalistas, this is a must have product.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and owned the titanium version of this curved edge flat iron.. But, since my mom loved it so much, I gave mine to her.. I love the wave you can achieve with the curved edge and so do a lot of my clients, so I ordered this one to replace it... Only thing, it doesn&#x27;t run along the hair as smoothly as the titanium, nor does it leave the same shine...  Go with the titanium!!!</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a smell when it heats up but it isn&#x27;t as bad as when i first began using it. It heats up extremely fast. Curls can be achieved, super straight hair and volume! I have really long thick hair and it takes me about 15-20 minutes to do my whole head! New record for any other flat iron i have ever had. MAKE sure you know the temperature you want, it does heat up FAST! I recently dyed my hair and i flat ironed it and no dye came out, it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair, it works fantastic! :)</li>
            <li> this flat iron is nice for me because it curves at the ends and looks better for my hair style.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li> This Will snag on hair, and didn&#x27;t provide the best straightening. Im going back to my trusted conair infinitis. This was not worth the $20, maybe more like $10.</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron. Heats up quickly. Curved edges are great for greeting a smooth texture. Only downside is that the flat iron falls over easily and won&#x27;t sit on the counter that good. All-in-all a nice iron.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Weirdly enough, this flat iron is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;- It really works with my hair and I&#x27;ve never burnt my hair using it, no smoke, no smell.&lt;br /&gt;- It has heat setting which is the best, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The only letdown is that it&#x27;s obviously a cheaper straightener so it&#x27;s life isn&#x27;t the longest.&lt;br /&gt;- The ceramic plates wore down after about 3 months of weekly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would say purchase it but know that you&#x27;ll have to purchase another really soon.</li>
            <li> When the power is on, the device makes an electric buzzing sound. The green light does not come on to show it is ready to use. Finally, there are small cracks between the plates and plastic where hair gets stuck in every pass-through. This flat iron is more unpleasant to use than one it is replacing. I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake I made.  I turned it off by switching it off on the appliance...returned home to a burned counter top.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very well and is great! It arrived on time and was just as described.</li>
            <li> Every time my wife uses it the curls hold all day.  She is very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It straightens my long thick hair nicely! I give it four not five stars because is does take a little longer to straighten my hair than other products I have used. It&#x27;s similar to my CHI straightener.</li>
            <li> This product is very disappointing. I am sorry that I wasnt my money. It pulls my hair and feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing technically wrong with it. My only criticism is it sometimes pulls a strand or two of my hair out. No different than any other straightening tool really. With that being said, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Was just as described and was deliverd quickly.</li>
            <li> this iron does not get too hot if you have you met me here you would have a hard time using it on it</li>
            <li> Dual voltage worked wonderfully in Italy, Greece, Croatia, Turkey and on two cruises!!!</li>
            <li> I like very much did not need additional plug it was great as is.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron last year &amp; it is still working perfectly. I absolutely love this flat iron . I have natural hair so it&#x27;s very thick and curly, so I was surprised when I only had to make two or three passes to make my hair completely straight. I won&#x27;t ever use another flat iron &amp; it&#x27;s never left any dents in my hair. My hair is always shiny and sleek after I straighten it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t frizz up either. I definitely recommend this &amp; am going to buy one for my mother very soon.</li>
            <li> This curved edge flat iron works perfectly. I bought it for a trip to Germany since it has dual voltage so it was perfect for Europe and now the USA. My curling iron blew out the second day of the trip so I used this iron solely and it did not disappoint for straightening or curling.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the hairdresser and my wife really loves it. It is like the flat iron at her hair salon.</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron. It makes beautiful curls and can also make your hair bone straight. I recommend this product. The only problem I have is the &amp;#34;auto shut off&amp;#34; after about 20 minutes of me using it, the flat iron will turn off. Other than that, it&#x27;s an overall good product.</li>
            <li> I have always use Andis  products and have used their products in the past.  I was quite excited to obtain this particular flat iron after reading the reviews. They were perfect for the price and use of hairdressing for a quick style. I purchased these for the curved flat iron to make the flip I desire to make. Of course it was perfect for what I intended for. The control and heating were exactly as described .</li>
            <li> Love this - and it&#x27;s ability to travel!  Very nice feature to have dual voltage, and I love the curved edges.  My hair rarely gets snagged or caught - and this thing is HOT!  I use it on the lowest setting and it still straightens in seconds!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my trip to Greece (which I haven&#x27;t gone on yet) because it is dual voltage.  The true test will be if it works there and doesn&#x27;t burn up like my other flat irons have done in the past.  Otherwise, it works like I expected it to.  I love the curved edges on it so I can achieve a wave if I want as well as straightening and it doesn&#x27;t put dents in my hair like so many flat irons do.</li>
            <li> Finally, a flat iron with smooth rounded edges and a low heat setting! I use this wand on level 2 out of 20 and it straightens every bit of my frizzy or curly bit of \\&quot;frizz halo\\&quot;  without turning the ends crisp.  The curved edges keep you from getting crimp lines near the scalp and it&#x27;s very easy to give the ends a quick bit of curve, no matter how you&#x27;re holding the wand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Andis flat irons and curling irons. I wish I would not have bought this particular style because it gets really hot around the area you actually hold to straighten your hair. It does do the job as far as getting your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> Seriously, with this price, I normally would have gone right by this, assuming that it was crap.  My best friend is a hair stylist and when we were living together (she had one) I was always using hers- my hair is huge and curly, FYI.  I love the 1\\&quot; because after I blow out my hair this is so easy to use, heats up quickly, and I can go over my trouble areas.  She also showed me how to use it as a curling iron!  I always assumed this flat iron must have been expensive, so I  could not believe it when I found it on here for this price!  No brainer, I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I love the curved edges for a whispy flip.  The price was competitive and it shuts down automatically if still plugged in after awhile.</li>
            <li> Needed something for Europe.</li>
            <li> This is a good straightener because I was using a straightener and a curling iron previously so it makes the process much faster.  While it says on the packaging that it heats up in 30 seconds, it takes about 2-3 minutes to get up to full temperature.  At times I have found it does not keep an even temperature, but it still works on my hair.  Also, if you&#x27;re looking for a straightener that really grabs onto hair and that you can use one-handed, this will do so but only with larger sections of hair.  There are rubber finger grips on the end of the straightener so you can use two hands for smaller sections, but depending on the setting, your fingers will get hot.</li>
            <li> I refused to pay the prices I saw in store for a name brand flat iron. I shopped around until I found what I wanted through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Andis 67410 Flat Iron works well you just have to be very careful while using the device. The only negatives would be that the ceramic plates are a bit short and constantly catch and pull your hair where the plates meet the control area and the unit gets extremely hot.  Do not lay this unit sideways on your counter or prop it against anything while it is on and make sure to keep the plates securely closed while it&#x27;s heating so you can heat it safely.  I placed it on it&#x27;s side to heat and it left a scorch mark on my bathroom counter top.  As with any device there is a learning curve and adjustment period.  The flat iron does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. I have tried many different flat irons in the past but none have given me the results this one has. When i use this andis flat iron to straighten my hair its like i have been to the salon.  Thanks Andis, Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought that the heated section would be slightly longer than it appears in the photo which is a bit of a let down. The curved edges are nice for curling hair as long as you remember not to get it too close to ears or scalp:)</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great! It will straighten or curl my hair very nicely. The curved ceramic plates help a lot when I use it to curl my hair. No more dents/creases if I pause too long!&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that because the blades are curved, the edges can burn the surface that you set it down on. Unfortunately I was doing my daughters hair at the kitchen table the first time I used this and there are now two burn marks on my table. Now I just place a hot pad under it and there is no issue.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews - the green light does not stop blinking and it doesn&#x27;t heat up much. Unfortunately I threw away my box it came in and can&#x27;t return the item. I would not recommend this product as it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> they are not good for salon use,made the  hair look dry,but  they did get really hot but i don&#x27;t like them doesn&#x27;t leave that shine like the ceramic do</li>
            <li> Not what is promised but quit good for the price. Iron plates don&#x27;t completely close and the &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light won&#x27;t stop blinking.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price..I am referring this flat iron to everyone I know.Please buy it and see for yourself. .</li>
            <li> This product had so many of the things I wanted in a flat iron:  swivel cord, feature to keep it closed, rounded edges, thick barrel.  But, less than 2 months after I started to use it, the coating is rubbed off of the plates and the blinking light just keeps blinking . . . and blinking . . . and blinking, like it&#x27;s waiting to heat up.  Sigh.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to invest a new flat iron (the one I had before this one lasted for over 2 years!).</li>
            <li> These are great and get really hot.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great to both straighten and curl your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair when you try to make a curl in it like other flat irons do.  It also gets hot enough to straighten/curl.</li>
            <li> Love it, I use the flat iron with my 2 inch iron. Good buy if you have medium and long strands of hair. If you have shoulder length you could use only a 2 inch.</li>
            <li> Total Waste of money. Had to send it back twice since May. Does great when working.</li>
            <li> Biggest problem is that the rounded edges caught my hair a bit. Just a few strands at a time, but every time I used it. I tried a variety of things to fix this - no dice. I loved the idea of the rounded edges - no creases! - but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It tends to grab hair between the plastic and the metal and pull out a few strands as well as not heating up very well</li>
            <li> Worked great----ONCE!!!!!  Now  I have to go through the hassle of returning it. Don&#x27;t was your hard earned money on it.</li>
            <li> Poor quality flat iron. I bought this as something cheap but full sized that I could bring overseas since it was dual voltage. The plates are terrible and don&#x27;t line up. They pinch part of your hair and don&#x27;t even clamp on the other half. I ended up tossing in the garbage and using my friends BaByliss tiny travel iron, which was immensely better.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this flat iron. The swivel cord worked well, the plates were rounded nicely, the buttons weren&#x27;t in an awkward spot or anything. But there were a couple of major problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it claimed to heat up in 30 seconds and then the light would stop blinking to indicate that it was hot. The light on mine never stopped blinking, not even after about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I don&#x27;t think mine was ever able to fully heat up (maybe why the light never turned off?) because it just didn&#x27;t work on my hair. I was able to touch my fingers briefly to the plates without burning myself, even though it was turned all the way up, so I think it just wasn&#x27;t hot enough to work... which is kind of the point of a flat iron and sort of negates all of the good features... so I returned it. It&#x27;s possible mine was just defective... or maybe it&#x27;s just not a good product. I have fine hair - it shouldn&#x27;t have been that hard to straighten and/or curl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I had no problems returning it or getting my money back quickly, which can sometimes be an issue with Amazon. Still, I&#x27;d go with another. I think this flat iron is a case of you-get-what-you-pay-for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, my boyfriend bought me the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for Christmas because it had the best reviews. It&#x27;s $50, but I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it. I suggest that one over the Andis.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a curved edge flat iron, Babyliss has one much more money, settled for this for 1/3 of the cost.  IMPRESSED AND SATISFIED!</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift, but the person I bought it for aleady had it. So I kept it for myself. Takes some practice at first, but now I like it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace one I had, dropped, and broke. This one sucks bad thing I now own two of them. I bought one and someone bought me one at the same time. They both suck!! Gets hot size is great, but the minute I put it to my hair it&#x27;s like the heat shuts off and will not get hot until I put it down and let warm back up. Can not use it continuously because it won&#x27;t stay hot. I would not recommend this for anyone that has a full head of hair or thick hair. Maybe it works for someone that has really really thin hair but definitely not for someone with good hair!!!</li>
            <li> Heats really well. Leaves smooth and silky look to my hair. Good deal for the price</li>
            <li> When clamping down to do a curl , the iron seems to not close tight and slips right out of the hair. Probably the worst iron for curls. Also when you do push down hard to try to curl the two ceramics do an over bite. I don&#x27;t use this iron much.  Another thing to think about that I did not, you cannot set the iron down with the ceramic on both sides for a better curl it will burn the counter top and when doing curls in thr back of your own head you cannot see the iron I&#x27;ve burnt myself on the side ceramic.</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron for the price works great.  I like that you can also makes curls with this flat iron because the plates are curved over the sides where most flat iron aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good flat iron. The curved edge makes it really easy to grab the shorter hair on my hairline&#x27;s edges really close to the scalp.  It has performed to my expectations and fulfilled what I was looking for in a flat iron, so there isn&#x27;t much more that I can say.</li>
            <li> I suppose you get what you pay for. This iron isn&#x27;t made well, so there is a part at the bottom of the heating element where the plastic doesn&#x27;t quite line up - when you pull your hair through it, hairs catch there and it&#x27;s painful. Flat iron fail.</li>
            <li> Makes spiral curls easily and perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much, I&#x27;m going to buy another.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the curved edge.  I hate it when you can see iron marks in my hair, so this eliminates them.  I can flip my hair easily with this iron too.  GREAT IRON!</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron because it looked to be a real good one, but unfortunately I could not use it. The first I was about to use this item I was getting ready for a date and the first amount of my hair I started on I heard a loud popping noise followed by a snap of light, sounds like a light bulb exploding.  So I was only able to use this flat iron for about 30 seconds and not satisfied or like this situation at all....</li>
            <li> Great straightener but it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> I purchased this more for the dual wattage.  It did not grip or hold hair well to flatten.</li>
            <li> Best Hair rod used so far..much better than even high cost rods..</li>
            <li> Just received this item, and it works really great, just exactly how the product description says it&#x27;s suppose to, I am very happy with my purchase, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews. I was able to use it for a month and then it stopped heating altogether. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This iron is great!  Love it for straightening or making some curls.  Also the rounded edges prevent getting that &#x27;crimp&#x27; that sometimes happen when you straighten a long piece of hair.  Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to cool down when straightening, even with slightly damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the locking mechanism, too.</li>
            <li> I have used Andis products in the past and loved them.  I would recommend this product to family, friends, and professional hair stylist.  Love the comfort of the handles, as well as the temperature controls.</li>
            <li> I was nervous buying a flat iron online, but this one is wonderful! It is by far, the best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
