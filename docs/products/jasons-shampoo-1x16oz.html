            <li>It also smells good, which is always a plus</li>
            <li>and I loved</li>
            <li>I bought this product as it seemed &#x27;organic&#x27; and had good ingredients.</li>
            <li>but it does not do a good job cleaning the hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel good.</li>
            <li>I have already bought two more bottles and do not plan to go without this great product.  </li>
            <li>I had used another one of their shampoos before, and was also very pleased.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product a lot!!</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful shampoo and not expensive.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love all their products!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews on this and thought id give it a try.</li>
            <li>He  did not tell me how many bottles he order except he said it was a good supply.</li>
            <li>But your hair feels kind of knotty until you use the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I did NOT stop losing hair immediately, as Biotin can take weeks/months to be effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using JASON Shampoo for more than a year right now, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, shipped quickly and very pleased with the seller.  </li>
            <li>Great product that makes your hair silky and clean.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair feel really clean and healthy!!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have used so far!</li>
            <li>lather, nice middle-of-the-road scent and a good clean feeling after rinse all combine to make this a very fine and effective shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li>The product is great; however, was not that happy with the leaking of fluid from the bottle when I received it.</li>
            <li>My hair felt healthy and beautiful for the first time in weeks, restoring my self-confidence and hopes that my hair will heal.  </li>
            <li>It feels really clean and you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to make a good lather.</li>
            <li>Smells good, works well, my hair feels clean</li>
            <li>For me, it did a great job of cleaning and removing grease, but it did so without completely stripping it of some of the good oils that keep hair shiny/silky and healthy.  </li>
            <li>plus the the softness is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>but I am quite satisfied with the results .</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d be able to match...</li>
            <li>but I think its the conditioner because that has Stearyl Alcholol at the top of the ingrediants which means theres a lot of it in there...</li>
            <li>but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the dryinga lot of it in there...</li>
            <li>but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the drying</li>
            <li>it smells like a cheap scented rose candle</li>
            <li>It feels so much better now.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so healthy</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I only use this products because i found they are great with my hair and scalp!</li>
            <li>I love how this shampoos cleans and softens my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it helps and promotes healthy and improved hair growth for thinning hair</li>
            <li>And i love the scent of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is making my hair thicker.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>The outer wrapping was damaged and the cap opened leaking most of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the Jason biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Hope it continues to give me such great results!</li>
            <li>The smell is just OK.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, the organic ingredients, and the thickness it&#x27;s given to my hair (probably because of the biotin)</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great, isn&#x27;t tested on animals, doesn&#x27;t build up and has really, really stopped breakage.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>, I ordered this one from Amazon, since this is my favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li>, he called to say his hair looked so much better</li>
            <li>tried the shampoo and conditioner out and absolutely love the products.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>Anyhoo, here are the ingredients, many of which are just science-ese for coconut based products, sugar based products and Vitamin E:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like washing your hair with conditioner and never being able to fully wash the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li>~ love this one and aloe</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was even able to switch to 3 days per week washings.  </li>
            <li>It is not my favorite</li>
            <li>Love love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Need to wrap more better.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to get more and more greasy every time I wash it with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I actually love it but don&#x27;t think I will order it again.</li>
            <li>however many of the ingredients are in the SLS family:</li>
            <li>Thanks JƒÅs&amp;ouml;n!!!! :)</li>
            <li>At first I loved it, but after a week</li>
            <li>packaging was a lil tricky do to manufacture of the bottle the top spins off to easy</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo, it&#x27;s silky and untangles easy with my fingers during wash.</li>
            <li>5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone....</li>
            <li>5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone....</li>
            <li>love the product, it works for my curly fine hair.  </li>
            <li>She said it was a very good deal from what she pays at the local health food store.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really smooth, and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t damage my extensions.</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, bouncy, healthy and smells so good.</li>
            <li>, I am more of a co-wash natural, but I like to have a good shampoo when I do.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but not to strong.  </li>
            <li>love the shine and specially the scent it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and great smelling, and as someone who is conscious of ingredients now, I feel good about using this for my body.</li>
            <li>Love it and am willing to pay more if I can&#x27;t find at tjmaxx</li>
            <li>Biotin was recommended to help strengthen fine hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just not formulated for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I applied Shea butter and castor oil and everything worked out fine.</li>
            <li>its strong and stinky.. turns out because of the cheap smelling perfume they dumped in it...</li>
            <li>Cleans well, but for those with allergies, it contains both lavender and fragrance (parfum), so you&#x27;ll want to avoid this and instead get the JASON - Fragrance Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Again, don&#x27;t expect it to grow hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle shampoo that makes the hair look nice and volumizes it, this is for you.</li>
            <li>It is important that if does not contain any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>i SUPOUSE WAS FREE FRAGANCIA</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and free of many harmful chemicals, but if it doesn&#x27;t get the job done, I&#x27;d be better off using nothing.</li>
            <li>Also it states it is SLS free</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and smells so good.</li>
            <li>I wish I could thank someone personally for the fact that I can legitimately love my hair again!!</li>
            <li>I bought this originally because of the biotin.</li>
            <li>If anyone is familiar with NaturallyCurly.com</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for some problem scalp issues..which I think has helped a bit...but not much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be committed to this product for a while.</li>
            <li>The hand soap is also great for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Lathering is not an issue, but cleaning is---a shampoo has to remove grease and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Jason as far as not being able to rinse thoroughly or not lathering this safe to use on locs as well</li>
            <li>I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>but Jason Natural Biotin is definitely my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Best type of natural and safe Shampoo found so far that leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>You had it right!</li>
            <li>Might not be the right formula for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is so wonderful it gives my limp lifeless thinning hair so much volume and shine!</li>
            <li>THICKER, very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Now I shampoo and leave it in while I wash the rest of me, so I get the full thickening effect.</li>
            <li>i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  </li>
            <li>i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  </li>
            <li>It has a different smell but its a good smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo, feels so much better, no build up</li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this Jason shampoo and conditioner for about a month and cannot say enough good things about the products.  </li>
            <li>and I actually started to see good changes in my hair.</li>
            <li>very nice shampoo and conditioner, works well on my hair, leaves them smooth and silky after a wash&lt;br /&gt;Available almost at 50% less price in stores...</li>
            <li>This was a great shampoo that left my hair full and straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It has a light natural smell which I love.</li>
            <li>I have kinky curly African American hair and my hair absolutely love it, I wash my hair once a week with it and it cleans my hair so good and leaves it soft, manageable, and smelling good.</li>
            <li>It is natural and sulfate free which is good for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>or so my scalp started becoming really irritated.</li>
            <li>After a long day of house cleaning and yard work, my hair needed a good washing.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>most products end up making my hair volumous, but dry, this does the volume while maintaining a healthy moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product twice thus far, and I feel no irritation on my scalp, my hair looks fuller, and the scent is very light (smells a bit like roses).</li>
            <li>At first it put me off a bit too, but once my hair dried, I loved the look!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t using enough, but once i figured out how to get a good lather, it really made my hair really shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>First a note on the scent: it is kind of like if original Herbal Essences and Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Shampoo were mixed together, it would result in this scent.</li>
            <li>We really notice a difference when we are traveling and use the cheap hotel shampoos.  </li>
            <li>But when I have (I occasionally use the leave in kind)</li>
            <li>so they put tape around the top the clear type tape...</li>
            <li>It also contains dimethicone, which is not something harmful, but many self-claimed natural shampoo (not conditioner, though) will try to avoid adding it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the Natural Biotin Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Weeks later I am still loving it.  </li>
            <li>thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li>Since using Jason Natural Biotin products, my hair texture has improved significantly and it has LOTS of body again!  </li>
            <li>a lot like the shampoo i&#x27;d been using for 10 plus years until they decided to stop making it -creme of nature (the original older version) -  which</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for younger folks hair as well, since my teenage daughter loves it as well.  </li>
            <li>Finally found a natural shampoo that smells good and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>No problem becuz this shampoo is also very GENTLE.</li>
            <li>Well i dislike it very much.</li>
            <li>so when you use it, it comes out very fast.  </li>
            <li>and it is very gentle on my hair...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo, and I like it.</li>
            <li>It is probably normal but to me it makes me think my hair isn&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li>Beautiful, subtle fragrance that works for both genders.</li>
            <li>Been using it a few years,leaves hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference the first time I used the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually bought this in stores for many years</li>
            <li>They recently improved it, as they put it..and they were correct: it is better than ever.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer needs to use an inner seal between the bottle and the cap so shipping loss does not occur and to make the product more tamper-proof.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I son was complaining about his hour, I mentioned Jason&#x27;s shampoo to him when he got his first bottle and had used it awhile</li>
            <li>Before it arrived, I looked over the description (yes, I should have done that first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware) and in the ingredients list it says \\&quot;methylparaben\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a paraben free, natural shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the first time, I had split ends in ages after just my first wash.</li>
            <li>Thanks Jason !</li>
            <li>shampoo was already open and spilled most of it in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>However, JASON shampoo makes your hair feel and look thicker from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Only the conditioner was sealed in a plastic bag &amp; I was able to return the portion leaked to the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I do have to wash my hair periodically with a clarifying shampoo as my hair gets too heavy, but the ingredients in the shampoo have been really good for my hair.</li>
            <li>then a couple days later went from great to dry to breaking off... turns out its the alcohol they put in it..</li>
            <li>so make sure you are careful when dispensing as it will come out of the bottle really quick</li>
            <li>This would likely be a GREAT product for very dry damaged hair</li>
            <li>Instead of feeling bad about my hair loss I feel good because my hair looks so good.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was fast as expected and have been loving this product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product not sure if i notice hair lose</li>
            <li>The new formula rarely washes out of your hair and it makes it feel crunchy;(  Please don&#x27;t going messing with your toothpaste too.</li>
            <li>It made my hair even more dry</li>
            <li>My hair was wonderfully soft after the very first use (with matching conditioner).</li>
            <li>Secondly, the shampoo leaves my hair in fine condition for house-puttering and errand-running, but for a night out</li>
            <li>Really like this product</li>
            <li>After a month I could tell a real difference in the health of my scalp.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I detangle my hair with my fingers while it&#x27;s wet, and this conditioner is fantastic at detangling!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i used this about 2 times before i finally really read the back only because when i used it i actually liked how it made my hair look</li>
            <li>and it works really well  --</li>
            <li>He has bi racial hair and this works really well on it  --</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m expecting too much out of a shampoo, as that is not it&#x27;s role, I&#x27;m going to buy the conditioner and see what happens.</li>
            <li>She says it works really well and help stop ur hair from falling out so much.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for regarding hair care.</li>
            <li>and you will have way too much in your hands.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but when I ran out for a couple of months I really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>mY HAIR ISN&#x27;T Flling out as much</li>
            <li>The experience has been very pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My husband and I decided to switch all of our hygiene and household cleaning products to paraben free, for obvious health reasons.</li>
            <li>They do contain alcohol and parfum, so they are not entirely chemical free, but they do the job nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gets the job done at a very affordable price point.  </li>
            <li>Jason Biotincleanses my hair gently and the conditioner adds bounce and shine while minimizing my frizz</li>
            <li>I do recommend by from the vitamin shoppe or whole foods that way</li>
            <li>and I can tell that it is really making a difference in my hair</li>
            <li>, it feels much healthier, stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was SLS free and could potentially help my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so fast with this shampoo too</li>
            <li>It also lasts so much longer than cheaper shampoos for some reason.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh, leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I lost 100 hairs more than average.</li>
            <li>Typically harsh chemicals like sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are added to the coconut oil molecule to make them effective as cleansers.</li>
            <li>:) Overall, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with really long hair and wanting to make it soft, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li>my hair suddenly was getting dry and breaking after being super healthy so this stuff literally reversed my hair in 1 wash.</li>
            <li>I have found it on many other websites for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo left my hair sparkling clean, shiny, and really manageable.</li>
            <li>gentle enough but gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li>I first bought this shampoo and conditioner at Whole Foods when seeking a natural alternative to the garbage I have been using my whole life.</li>
            <li>I got both the Jason Pure Natural Shampoo and Conditioner, hoping to use these two every other day (the other days using Oribe for Beautiful Color or the Moroccan Oil shampoo/cond set you can buy virtually anywhere).</li>
            <li>It is truly natural, leaves the hair fuller, and is very gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great</li>
            <li>I used for the second time, again I lost more than regular.</li>
            <li>As I grow older</li>
            <li>I am still going to reach for a high performance shampoo like L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>The JASON Restorative Biotin - Pure &amp; Natural Shampoo does not contains any parabens, phthalates, or sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate (SLS), but does contain sodium laurel sulfoacetate.</li>
            <li>The product I purchased is JASON Restorative Biotin Pure Natural Shampoo,&lt;br /&gt;ASIN:</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rinse the new formula clean at all (after running water through my hair for about 5 minutes, which is way too long) - feels like it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very beneficial for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried recently and, after using it for the past 2 months or so (2-3 times a week), I can definitely say it has made my hair stronger and overall healthier-looking.</li>
            <li>This one had just enough lather to effectively clean, but was gentle enough on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it says it&#x27;s \\&quot;New &amp; Improved.\\</li>
            <li>I will follow up with the new ingredients list, as the one in the product description does not apply to this formulation.</li>
            <li>I am adding an addendum to this review to state that I am noticing new hair growth since I changed the way I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This NEW formula added Amine Hydrochloride and it drastically changed this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The NEW formula is breaking my hear off.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the new bottles.</li>
            <li>I now have very healthy shiny hair and no more split ends!!</li>
            <li>I put off looking for a new natural shampoo for a while because its hard as hell to find shampoo with exactly what i want (3 or 4 main natural ingrediants that make my hair look really good) without the companies adding a crapload of other stuff i dont want in my hair...</li>
            <li>but i only look for the first 4...</li>
            <li>but i only look for the first 4...</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally slightly curly, fine, and I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>In other words, the original source material may come from coconut, but then it‚Äôs chemically processed and converted into unnatural materials.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural!</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo that actually does seem to be making a difference.</li>
            <li>I have curly, frizzy hair, and this stuff has tamed it and makes it so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>It destroyed my hair after the old fixed it;( Please stop messing with products that are already good because you made this worse.</li>
            <li>At 61, my hair has had a lot of abuse, although I have never bleached it or colored it, but I live a busy life, and don&#x27;t take time to pamper my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I use all-natural products, I&#x27;m pretty use to the fact that natural shampoos feel different on hair.  </li>
            <li>One thing to note:  it is not a very thick shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and leaves the hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Hair does not feel as clean with this product, but again it may be due to my soft water.</li>
            <li>at all... i would never put any kind of alcohol in my hair unless i was trying to eff it up on purpose... dry it out and give myself dead ends...  </li>
            <li>I have oily fine hair that I have to wash everyday</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with the previous formulation, but I can tell this one lathers up just fine on the first try and doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry.</li>
            <li>i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves</li>
            <li>i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves</li>
            <li>I have been using Jason Pure Natural Shampoo for approximately one year and love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>After using this, it started to clear up and is gone.  </li>
            <li>it clearly says on the bottle \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Only have used it once so far, but will update review after about a month to see how i really like it</li>
            <li>i used it with the conditioner and it left my hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my hair soft and defines the curls well.</li>
            <li>for me it feels like a residue on my hair if not rinsed out completely</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s natural, the smell</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft and moisturized-feeling as I thought it might.  </li>
            <li>So whatever they did to the old formula, did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>unless I can find the old formula, I&#x27;m going to have to find another shampoo...again.</li>
            <li>Basically, I stopped losing hair once I changed from old shampoo to JASON, and given that all men in my family are bald, stopping the hair lose was an issue for me.</li>
            <li>When I went to my daughter&#x27;s for a visit, while I was there I used their shower as I am worried about falling in the bathtub to shower, and was I surprised to see that my son in law used it also.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several bottles and am ready for another one.</li>
            <li>all natural too</li>
            <li>When I went natural</li>
            <li>If you already have a sensitive scalp, I would suggest just using Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I had tried several shampoos and was ready to give up when I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li>Like it because of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t find a natural shampoo that cleans well.</li>
            <li>I have to say of the 3 shampoo/conditioner sets I use, this is the least favorite.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft and thicker feeling.</li>
            <li>Its soft-</li>
            <li>I managed to find an old bottle to compare to see what they did.</li>
            <li>CUSTOMERS if you have an old bottle of this</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and this washed clean, gave bounce and color and made my hair actually grow.</li>
            <li>but the combo of this plus jason&#x27;s aloe vera conditioner both have the same ingrediants as creme of nature (the main 3 or 4 i look for )...  </li>
            <li>I went to the health food store near my home and made my  first purchase, when that bottle was almost empty</li>
            <li>but I bought the last three bottles of old off the shelf and will not touch the new formula again.</li>
            <li>that plus the perfume.. which is alcohol on top of alcohol.. not good for your hair..</li>
            <li>Natural shampoo needs to clean the scalp without stripping the natural oils, but I think this product would benefit from additional herbal agents (mint/rosemary) that attack bad bacteria and fungus more aggressively.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USNG THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG-TIME, PROBABLY ABOUT 2 OR MORE YEARS, AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO KEEP IN THE HOUSE,  NOT ONLY</li>
            <li>Then, I forgot to buy a new bottle and found Jason&#x27;s shampoo in the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s a new formula, but definitely not improved.</li>
            <li>For anyone who was wondering, this is actually the New and Improved formulation of Jason&#x27;s Biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li>Time will tell whether or not it leads to new growth, but the biotin is low enough on the new ingredients list to make me concerned about that.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right, not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Her hair was really ruined by sun, swimming, and the dry Denver air.  </li>
            <li>It left my fine hair very limp.</li>
            <li>This was a shampoo that I not only brought but had overnighted to me when I ran out and was not anywhere near a health food store.</li>
            <li>the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oribe is by far and away the ONLY shampoo/cond set I&#x27;ve tried that has resulted in silken, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>It will have Amine Hydrocholoride on the label next to Lavender extract - old bottles do not.</li>
            <li>It is a little thinner than you may be used to and comes out of the bottle quickly, but it is terrific!</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, and over time has helped me regrow some of my very thin hair.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this shampoo and now will not use any other.</li>
            <li>But as long as you get your hair thoroughly wet and then applying it should lather pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops of tea tree oil in the shampoo to help combat the dandruff this shampoo was causing, which did help, but it did not improve the greasy, over-conditioned feeling very much.</li>
            <li>I decided to stop and bought my former chemical-free shampoo: it took a week, but the amount of hair loss reduced (first 30, then 80, then 98 less).</li>
            <li>This conditioner has really cut down on this.</li>
            <li>This shampoo did nothing to restore my hair -- made it look extremely dry and wild.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist said that it was pretty common for all natural shampoo and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a fact that after using the Oribe shampoo/cond, my fine, thin hair glistens &amp;#34;like a teenagers&amp;#34</li>
            <li>the Jason Pure is the dull, frizzy, completely uncontrollable effect it has on my thin, fine hair.</li>

            <li> and I loved</li>
            <li> I bought this product as it seemed &#x27;organic&#x27; and had good ingredients.</li>
            <li> but it does not do a good job cleaning the hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel good.</li>
            <li> I have already bought two more bottles and do not plan to go without this great product.  </li>
            <li> I had used another one of their shampoos before, and was also very pleased.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product a lot!!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful shampoo and not expensive.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love all their products!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews on this and thought id give it a try.</li>
            <li> He  did not tell me how many bottles he order except he said it was a good supply.</li>
            <li> But your hair feels kind of knotty until you use the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I did NOT stop losing hair immediately, as Biotin can take weeks/months to be effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using JASON Shampoo for more than a year right now, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly and very pleased with the seller.  </li>
            <li> Great product that makes your hair silky and clean.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair feel really clean and healthy!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have used so far!</li>
            <li> lather, nice middle-of-the-road scent and a good clean feeling after rinse all combine to make this a very fine and effective shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is the best natural shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li> The product is great; however, was not that happy with the leaking of fluid from the bottle when I received it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt healthy and beautiful for the first time in weeks, restoring my self-confidence and hopes that my hair will heal.  </li>
            <li> It feels really clean and you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to make a good lather.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well, my hair feels clean</li>
            <li> For me, it did a great job of cleaning and removing grease, but it did so without completely stripping it of some of the good oils that keep hair shiny/silky and healthy.  </li>
            <li> plus the the softness is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> but I am quite satisfied with the results .</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d be able to match...</li>
            <li> but I think its the conditioner because that has Stearyl Alcholol at the top of the ingrediants which means theres a lot of it in there...</li>
            <li> but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the dryinga lot of it in there...</li>
            <li> but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the drying</li>
            <li> it smells like a cheap scented rose candle</li>
            <li> It feels so much better now.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so healthy</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I only use this products because i found they are great with my hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> I love how this shampoos cleans and softens my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it helps and promotes healthy and improved hair growth for thinning hair</li>
            <li> And i love the scent of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is making my hair thicker.  </li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> The outer wrapping was damaged and the cap opened leaking most of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the Jason biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Hope it continues to give me such great results!</li>
            <li> The smell is just OK.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, the organic ingredients, and the thickness it&#x27;s given to my hair (probably because of the biotin)</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, isn&#x27;t tested on animals, doesn&#x27;t build up and has really, really stopped breakage.  </li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> , I ordered this one from Amazon, since this is my favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li> , he called to say his hair looked so much better</li>
            <li> tried the shampoo and conditioner out and absolutely love the products.</li>
            <li> and I love it,</li>
            <li> Anyhoo, here are the ingredients, many of which are just science-ese for coconut based products, sugar based products and Vitamin E:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like washing your hair with conditioner and never being able to fully wash the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li> ~ love this one and aloe</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I was even able to switch to 3 days per week washings.  </li>
            <li> It is not my favorite</li>
            <li> Love love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Need to wrap more better.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to get more and more greasy every time I wash it with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I actually love it but don&#x27;t think I will order it again.</li>
            <li> however many of the ingredients are in the SLS family:</li>
            <li> Thanks JƒÅs&amp;ouml;n!!!! :)</li>
            <li> At first I loved it, but after a week</li>
            <li> packaging was a lil tricky do to manufacture of the bottle the top spins off to easy</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, it&#x27;s silky and untangles easy with my fingers during wash.</li>
            <li> 5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone....</li>
            <li> 5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone....</li>
            <li> love the product, it works for my curly fine hair.  </li>
            <li> She said it was a very good deal from what she pays at the local health food store.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really smooth, and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t damage my extensions.</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, bouncy, healthy and smells so good.</li>
            <li> , I am more of a co-wash natural, but I like to have a good shampoo when I do.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but not to strong.  </li>
            <li> love the shine and specially the scent it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and great smelling, and as someone who is conscious of ingredients now, I feel good about using this for my body.</li>
            <li> Love it and am willing to pay more if I can&#x27;t find at tjmaxx</li>
            <li> Biotin was recommended to help strengthen fine hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just not formulated for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I applied Shea butter and castor oil and everything worked out fine.</li>
            <li> its strong and stinky.. turns out because of the cheap smelling perfume they dumped in it...</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but for those with allergies, it contains both lavender and fragrance (parfum), so you&#x27;ll want to avoid this and instead get the JASON - Fragrance Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Again, don&#x27;t expect it to grow hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle shampoo that makes the hair look nice and volumizes it, this is for you.</li>
            <li> It is important that if does not contain any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> i SUPOUSE WAS FREE FRAGANCIA</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and free of many harmful chemicals, but if it doesn&#x27;t get the job done, I&#x27;d be better off using nothing.</li>
            <li> Also it states it is SLS free</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I wish I could thank someone personally for the fact that I can legitimately love my hair again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this originally because of the biotin.</li>
            <li> If anyone is familiar with NaturallyCurly.com</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for some problem scalp issues..which I think has helped a bit...but not much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be committed to this product for a while.</li>
            <li> The hand soap is also great for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Lathering is not an issue, but cleaning is---a shampoo has to remove grease and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Jason as far as not being able to rinse thoroughly or not lathering this safe to use on locs as well</li>
            <li> I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> but Jason Natural Biotin is definitely my favorite!  </li>
            <li> Best type of natural and safe Shampoo found so far that leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> You had it right!</li>
            <li> Might not be the right formula for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so wonderful it gives my limp lifeless thinning hair so much volume and shine!</li>
            <li> THICKER, very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Now I shampoo and leave it in while I wash the rest of me, so I get the full thickening effect.</li>
            <li> i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  </li>
            <li> i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  </li>
            <li> It has a different smell but its a good smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, feels so much better, no build up</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this Jason shampoo and conditioner for about a month and cannot say enough good things about the products.  </li>
            <li> and I actually started to see good changes in my hair.</li>
            <li> very nice shampoo and conditioner, works well on my hair, leaves them smooth and silky after a wash&lt;br /&gt;Available almost at 50% less price in stores...</li>
            <li> This was a great shampoo that left my hair full and straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It has a light natural smell which I love.</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly African American hair and my hair absolutely love it, I wash my hair once a week with it and it cleans my hair so good and leaves it soft, manageable, and smelling good.</li>
            <li> It is natural and sulfate free which is good for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> or so my scalp started becoming really irritated.</li>
            <li> After a long day of house cleaning and yard work, my hair needed a good washing.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> most products end up making my hair volumous, but dry, this does the volume while maintaining a healthy moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product twice thus far, and I feel no irritation on my scalp, my hair looks fuller, and the scent is very light (smells a bit like roses).</li>
            <li> At first it put me off a bit too, but once my hair dried, I loved the look!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t using enough, but once i figured out how to get a good lather, it really made my hair really shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> First a note on the scent: it is kind of like if original Herbal Essences and Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Shampoo were mixed together, it would result in this scent.</li>
            <li> We really notice a difference when we are traveling and use the cheap hotel shampoos.  </li>
            <li> But when I have (I occasionally use the leave in kind)</li>
            <li> so they put tape around the top the clear type tape...</li>
            <li> It also contains dimethicone, which is not something harmful, but many self-claimed natural shampoo (not conditioner, though) will try to avoid adding it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Natural Biotin Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Weeks later I am still loving it.  </li>
            <li> thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li> Since using Jason Natural Biotin products, my hair texture has improved significantly and it has LOTS of body again!  </li>
            <li> a lot like the shampoo i&#x27;d been using for 10 plus years until they decided to stop making it -creme of nature (the original older version) -  which</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for younger folks hair as well, since my teenage daughter loves it as well.  </li>
            <li> Finally found a natural shampoo that smells good and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> No problem becuz this shampoo is also very GENTLE.</li>
            <li> Well i dislike it very much.</li>
            <li> so when you use it, it comes out very fast.  </li>
            <li> and it is very gentle on my hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo, and I like it.</li>
            <li> It is probably normal but to me it makes me think my hair isn&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li> Beautiful, subtle fragrance that works for both genders.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few years,leaves hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference the first time I used the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually bought this in stores for many years</li>
            <li> They recently improved it, as they put it..and they were correct: it is better than ever.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer needs to use an inner seal between the bottle and the cap so shipping loss does not occur and to make the product more tamper-proof.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I son was complaining about his hour, I mentioned Jason&#x27;s shampoo to him when he got his first bottle and had used it awhile</li>
            <li> Before it arrived, I looked over the description (yes, I should have done that first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware) and in the ingredients list it says \\&quot;methylparaben\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a paraben free, natural shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the first time, I had split ends in ages after just my first wash.</li>
            <li> Thanks Jason !</li>
            <li> shampoo was already open and spilled most of it in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> However, JASON shampoo makes your hair feel and look thicker from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Only the conditioner was sealed in a plastic bag &amp; I was able to return the portion leaked to the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I do have to wash my hair periodically with a clarifying shampoo as my hair gets too heavy, but the ingredients in the shampoo have been really good for my hair.</li>
            <li> then a couple days later went from great to dry to breaking off... turns out its the alcohol they put in it..</li>
            <li> so make sure you are careful when dispensing as it will come out of the bottle really quick</li>
            <li> This would likely be a GREAT product for very dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> Instead of feeling bad about my hair loss I feel good because my hair looks so good.  </li>
            <li> Shipment was fast as expected and have been loving this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product not sure if i notice hair lose</li>
            <li> The new formula rarely washes out of your hair and it makes it feel crunchy;(  Please don&#x27;t going messing with your toothpaste too.</li>
            <li> It made my hair even more dry</li>
            <li> My hair was wonderfully soft after the very first use (with matching conditioner).</li>
            <li> Secondly, the shampoo leaves my hair in fine condition for house-puttering and errand-running, but for a night out</li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> After a month I could tell a real difference in the health of my scalp.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I detangle my hair with my fingers while it&#x27;s wet, and this conditioner is fantastic at detangling!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used this about 2 times before i finally really read the back only because when i used it i actually liked how it made my hair look</li>
            <li> and it works really well  --</li>
            <li> He has bi racial hair and this works really well on it  --</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m expecting too much out of a shampoo, as that is not it&#x27;s role, I&#x27;m going to buy the conditioner and see what happens.</li>
            <li> She says it works really well and help stop ur hair from falling out so much.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for regarding hair care.</li>
            <li> and you will have way too much in your hands.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but when I ran out for a couple of months I really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> mY HAIR ISN&#x27;T Flling out as much</li>
            <li> The experience has been very pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> My husband and I decided to switch all of our hygiene and household cleaning products to paraben free, for obvious health reasons.</li>
            <li> They do contain alcohol and parfum, so they are not entirely chemical free, but they do the job nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gets the job done at a very affordable price point.  </li>
            <li> Jason Biotincleanses my hair gently and the conditioner adds bounce and shine while minimizing my frizz</li>
            <li> I do recommend by from the vitamin shoppe or whole foods that way</li>
            <li> and I can tell that it is really making a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> , it feels much healthier, stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was SLS free and could potentially help my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so fast with this shampoo too</li>
            <li> It also lasts so much longer than cheaper shampoos for some reason.</li>
            <li> it smells fresh, leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I lost 100 hairs more than average.</li>
            <li> Typically harsh chemicals like sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are added to the coconut oil molecule to make them effective as cleansers.</li>
            <li> :) Overall, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with really long hair and wanting to make it soft, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li> my hair suddenly was getting dry and breaking after being super healthy so this stuff literally reversed my hair in 1 wash.</li>
            <li> I have found it on many other websites for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo left my hair sparkling clean, shiny, and really manageable.</li>
            <li> gentle enough but gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li> I first bought this shampoo and conditioner at Whole Foods when seeking a natural alternative to the garbage I have been using my whole life.</li>
            <li> I got both the Jason Pure Natural Shampoo and Conditioner, hoping to use these two every other day (the other days using Oribe for Beautiful Color or the Moroccan Oil shampoo/cond set you can buy virtually anywhere).</li>
            <li> It is truly natural, leaves the hair fuller, and is very gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great</li>
            <li> I used for the second time, again I lost more than regular.</li>
            <li> As I grow older</li>
            <li> I am still going to reach for a high performance shampoo like L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> The JASON Restorative Biotin - Pure &amp; Natural Shampoo does not contains any parabens, phthalates, or sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate (SLS), but does contain sodium laurel sulfoacetate.</li>
            <li> The product I purchased is JASON Restorative Biotin Pure Natural Shampoo,&lt;br /&gt;ASIN:</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rinse the new formula clean at all (after running water through my hair for about 5 minutes, which is way too long) - feels like it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very beneficial for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> So far I have been very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried recently and, after using it for the past 2 months or so (2-3 times a week), I can definitely say it has made my hair stronger and overall healthier-looking.</li>
            <li> This one had just enough lather to effectively clean, but was gentle enough on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it says it&#x27;s \\&quot;New &amp; Improved.\\</li>
            <li> I will follow up with the new ingredients list, as the one in the product description does not apply to this formulation.</li>
            <li> I am adding an addendum to this review to state that I am noticing new hair growth since I changed the way I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This NEW formula added Amine Hydrochloride and it drastically changed this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The NEW formula is breaking my hear off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the new bottles.</li>
            <li> I now have very healthy shiny hair and no more split ends!!</li>
            <li> I put off looking for a new natural shampoo for a while because its hard as hell to find shampoo with exactly what i want (3 or 4 main natural ingrediants that make my hair look really good) without the companies adding a crapload of other stuff i dont want in my hair...</li>
            <li> but i only look for the first 4...</li>
            <li> but i only look for the first 4...</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally slightly curly, fine, and I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> In other words, the original source material may come from coconut, but then it‚Äôs chemically processed and converted into unnatural materials.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural!</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo that actually does seem to be making a difference.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair, and this stuff has tamed it and makes it so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> It destroyed my hair after the old fixed it;( Please stop messing with products that are already good because you made this worse.</li>
            <li> At 61, my hair has had a lot of abuse, although I have never bleached it or colored it, but I live a busy life, and don&#x27;t take time to pamper my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I use all-natural products, I&#x27;m pretty use to the fact that natural shampoos feel different on hair.  </li>
            <li> One thing to note:  it is not a very thick shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and leaves the hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not feel as clean with this product, but again it may be due to my soft water.</li>
            <li> at all... i would never put any kind of alcohol in my hair unless i was trying to eff it up on purpose... dry it out and give myself dead ends...  </li>
            <li> I have oily fine hair that I have to wash everyday</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with the previous formulation, but I can tell this one lathers up just fine on the first try and doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry.</li>
            <li> i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves</li>
            <li> i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason Pure Natural Shampoo for approximately one year and love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> After using this, it started to clear up and is gone.  </li>
            <li> it clearly says on the bottle \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Only have used it once so far, but will update review after about a month to see how i really like it</li>
            <li> i used it with the conditioner and it left my hair soft and straight.</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my hair soft and defines the curls well.</li>
            <li> for me it feels like a residue on my hair if not rinsed out completely</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s natural, the smell</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft and moisturized-feeling as I thought it might.  </li>
            <li> So whatever they did to the old formula, did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unless I can find the old formula, I&#x27;m going to have to find another shampoo...again.</li>
            <li> Basically, I stopped losing hair once I changed from old shampoo to JASON, and given that all men in my family are bald, stopping the hair lose was an issue for me.</li>
            <li> When I went to my daughter&#x27;s for a visit, while I was there I used their shower as I am worried about falling in the bathtub to shower, and was I surprised to see that my son in law used it also.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bottles and am ready for another one.</li>
            <li> all natural too</li>
            <li> When I went natural</li>
            <li> If you already have a sensitive scalp, I would suggest just using Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I had tried several shampoos and was ready to give up when I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li> Like it because of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find a natural shampoo that cleans well.</li>
            <li> I have to say of the 3 shampoo/conditioner sets I use, this is the least favorite.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and thicker feeling.</li>
            <li> Its soft-</li>
            <li> I managed to find an old bottle to compare to see what they did.</li>
            <li> CUSTOMERS if you have an old bottle of this</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and this washed clean, gave bounce and color and made my hair actually grow.</li>
            <li> but the combo of this plus jason&#x27;s aloe vera conditioner both have the same ingrediants as creme of nature (the main 3 or 4 i look for )...  </li>
            <li> I went to the health food store near my home and made my  first purchase, when that bottle was almost empty</li>
            <li> but I bought the last three bottles of old off the shelf and will not touch the new formula again.</li>
            <li> that plus the perfume.. which is alcohol on top of alcohol.. not good for your hair..</li>
            <li> Natural shampoo needs to clean the scalp without stripping the natural oils, but I think this product would benefit from additional herbal agents (mint/rosemary) that attack bad bacteria and fungus more aggressively.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USNG THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG-TIME, PROBABLY ABOUT 2 OR MORE YEARS, AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO KEEP IN THE HOUSE,  NOT ONLY</li>
            <li> Then, I forgot to buy a new bottle and found Jason&#x27;s shampoo in the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s a new formula, but definitely not improved.</li>
            <li> For anyone who was wondering, this is actually the New and Improved formulation of Jason&#x27;s Biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> Time will tell whether or not it leads to new growth, but the biotin is low enough on the new ingredients list to make me concerned about that.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Her hair was really ruined by sun, swimming, and the dry Denver air.  </li>
            <li> It left my fine hair very limp.</li>
            <li> This was a shampoo that I not only brought but had overnighted to me when I ran out and was not anywhere near a health food store.</li>
            <li> the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oribe is by far and away the ONLY shampoo/cond set I&#x27;ve tried that has resulted in silken, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> It will have Amine Hydrocholoride on the label next to Lavender extract - old bottles do not.</li>
            <li> It is a little thinner than you may be used to and comes out of the bottle quickly, but it is terrific!</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, and over time has helped me regrow some of my very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this shampoo and now will not use any other.</li>
            <li> But as long as you get your hair thoroughly wet and then applying it should lather pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops of tea tree oil in the shampoo to help combat the dandruff this shampoo was causing, which did help, but it did not improve the greasy, over-conditioned feeling very much.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop and bought my former chemical-free shampoo: it took a week, but the amount of hair loss reduced (first 30, then 80, then 98 less).</li>
            <li> This conditioner has really cut down on this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did nothing to restore my hair -- made it look extremely dry and wild.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist said that it was pretty common for all natural shampoo and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a fact that after using the Oribe shampoo/cond, my fine, thin hair glistens &amp;#34;like a teenagers&amp;#34</li>
            <li> the Jason Pure is the dull, frizzy, completely uncontrollable effect it has on my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft and I have had issues with dry scalp for as long as I can remember but</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy and I did not feel like it did anything to actually clean.</li>
            <li> not purchase due to misleading use of the term Natural.</li>
            <li> Told by other people if your water is soft that will happen.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, very dry and brittle hair and this shampoo always makes it feel greasy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past year and it nourishing and gentle to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Long hair also has the tendency to look stringy, and this shampoo made my hair definitely look healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li> This doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them unsafe, but they are definitely not ‚Äúnatural.</li>
            <li> Generally not flowery</li>
            <li> Like any new product, I think you need to use it a few weeks to see how you react tout .</li>
            <li> I wish it left my hair feeling softer, but it doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair when dry either.</li>
            <li> (actually, it never did dry all the way).  </li>
            <li> You could tell it&#x27;s a natural, less abrasive product.  </li>
            <li> The bottle wasnt closed properly and damanged the entire package.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and do not use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting the conditioner completely rinsed out  --  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain my hair seemed less dry, or damaged after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is over halfway down my back and gets greasy on the scalp area but can be somewhat dry towards the ends, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this shampoo to any one who has lost hair and their hair is dull and falling out little by little.</li>
            <li> I cant see that it does any different than any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> yes, my friend had ordered the same one reading it&#x27;s review on other blogs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the other products from this company, so I decided to try out the shampoo.</li>
            <li> After finding my hair was thinning due to medical issues, my hair stylist recommended I start using Rogaine.</li>
            <li> the other hand, I had a better experience with the Jason \\&quot;Thin to Thick Extra Volumn Shampoo\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos, as well as done my own baking soda rinse; this, by far, is the worst of all I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My hair always had a tendency of being frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> It looks like I have a thyroid condition with dry, brittle and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I found that even the Jason Thin to Thick made it feel thicker but more like straw.  </li>
            <li> Its very thin not thick like a normal shampoo</li>
            <li> I did not even use the conditioner yet, and normally, I have to use a LOT of conditioner, to tame down my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> and i use a flat iron on it every other day.</li>
            <li> It is long, and I tend to be rough on</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this gentle shampoo and we all have different hair types, from thin to very thick.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t buy &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; beauty products, but the way this product makes my hair look and feel is enough to convince me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the slight waxy feeling the conditioner leaves.  </li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t say that it doesn&#x27;t fade my color, but it&#x27;s much less than regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> i have experimented with other scents and other brands but continue to come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long had to use hair loss shampoos due to some problems that began in college.</li>
            <li> This smells a little of baby powder and doesn&#x27;t lather as well as regular shampoo since it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfates.</li>
            <li> This (and other versions of Jason&#x27;s shampoo) reduced my oily scalp and dry hair--recommend it all the time.</li>
            <li> only thing about shopping online is that its hard to read the back of the bottle to see all of the ingrediants...</li>
            <li> (I use other shampoos as well) for well over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand it, I jumped back into the shower and washed it 3 times with my usual shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I did not relate one to the other</li>
            <li> And when I dry my hair, my hair feels like I&#x27;ve added product to it- not clean at all.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying out other variants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the product arrived, I read the ingredients and it DOES NOT contain methylparaben or any other type of parabens-</li>
            <li> like I do other shampoos - lather, rinse,</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling of chemical shampoos, which is what we have been accustomed to feeling and have bought into the idea that it is healthy, but at the same time, your hair shouldn&#x27;t feel like it is nasty and gross.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been struggling with thinning hair, breakage, and excessive shedding.  </li>
            <li> I would say that it did make hair a little dry after using but</li>
            <li> I believe the prolonged contact with my scalp is allowing the active ingredients to do their work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t give this a positive review because it should not be advertised as a shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot; or even lather.  </li>
            <li> If your hair tends to be a little dry from coloring, like mine was, you might need to use a little conditioner.</li>
            <li> (it looked/felt better when it WAS filthy).  </li>
            <li> I did notice it was strangely difficult to comb through my hair after getting out of the shower, and it took MUCH longer than usual to dry</li>
            <li> Not saying you get what you pay for, but for some reason, the ingredients in Jason simply turn my hair to a dull, grizzled, fly-away mess.</li>
            <li> This product weighs my hair down and it makes my hair greasy within an hour after using.</li>
            <li> but not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> Did not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I noticed that other biotin shampoos have instructions to leave the product in your hair for a while, so I started doing that with this one, just leaving it in for a few minutes like I would with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Those that complain that this shampoo leaves a slight residue that they feel they cant rinse out, are correct.</li>
            <li> but I do notice less hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, but the shipping was not very careful, and one of the bottle caps was broken, and half of the shampoo was spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick so a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> I think it helped my damaged hair a little, though.</li>
            <li> Ive been using nioxin for almost a year with little results and it dried out my hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been on CNN a few times and used it then.</li>
            <li> Went to the doc and got a cream and pills and my scalp acne was cleared up in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wasted $10 bucks on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy and smelly.</li>
            <li> But, her hair dried out with wavy and frizzy feel at the ends....</li>
            <li> When it dries, it feels like I&#x27;ve got gel in my hair because it dries crunchy and stiff, yet still oily and greasy</li>
            <li> Yes, the raw materials (fatty acids) come from coconut, but then they are processed in the laboratory to come up with the end chemical.</li>
            <li> This Jason purchase was my first shampoo after getting away from the mainstream brands full of BAD crap.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but with thin hair you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> The whole showering process already takes me a very long time, and normally, if I encounter a bad hair product, I just deal with it until the next washing, but THIS was disgusting!  </li>
            <li> My hair was limp and dull.  </li>
            <li> it still leaked with the clear tape a lil bit but nothing crazy</li>
            <li> and I usually use this when I do a stage show.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve been too lazy to mix em together and use em...</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve been too lazy to mix em together and use em...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked.  </li>
            <li> n brittle and left a weird oiliness to my hair.</li>
            <li> gave the product 3 stars because while I like the product, I am not satisfied with the miscommunication between the company and the distributor.</li>
            <li> not sure how it could be for anyone.  </li>
            <li> But it sure looks awful.</li>
            <li> and I was worried this might make it look greasy, but I did not notice any difference from my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> ( Not sure why you guys changed this</li>
            <li> Mind you, i have really thick and heavy hair and after shampooing with this, my hair is so voluminous.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strange almost nasty and the product left my hair feeling dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about the ingredients listed here for this product.</li>
            <li> plus never liked the smell of it..</li>
            <li> Since my hormones seem to be all over the charts lately, I had been having problems with hair thinning and changing texture.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product does that, at least not for my type of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner had leaked out (at least 1/2) from both containers.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my thick, coarse mediterranean hair crazy volume</li>
            <li> My hair is thick wavy/curly, coarse/fine</li>
            <li> so i dont have to deal with all the extra bad stuff these companies add...</li>
            <li> so i dont have to deal with all the extra bad stuff these companies add...</li>
            <li> I think the reason a lot of people complain about the itchy and flaky scalp is because this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the bad bacteria, yeast, and/or fungal infections that can appear on your scalp, especially those who are prone to it.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered and tried Nature&#x27;s Gate and also Jason Thin to Thick products</li>
            <li> why is it so hard for these companies to just put a handful of ingrediants and leave out all the extra crap that always ends up being the stuff</li>
            <li> why is it so hard for these companies to just put a handful of ingrediants and leave out all the extra crap that always ends up being the stuff</li>
            <li> I have ultra thin hair that is very hard to manage and this shampoo cured that.</li>
            <li> my hair has begun to thin.  </li>
            <li> Packaging needs to be rethought, bottle showed up with broken cap.</li>
            <li> (a strange combination of everything I hate my hair to feel like).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weirdly comforting fragrance but YMMV.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp feel dirty and itch</li>
            <li> It started itching really bad and flaking.</li>
            <li> It felt like I had really bad dandruff and lice at once.</li>
            <li> had to stop using it because the irritation was getting so bad.</li>
            <li> It looked and felt SO filthy</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I need a shampoo which will help restore some of the hair I have lost.</li>
            <li> Over all, I was VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible!  </li>
            <li> It is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave this three star only as the bottle came with leak.The bottle wasnt closed properly and damanged the entire package.</li>
            <li> Those that complain that this shampoo leaves a slight residue that they feel they cant rinse out, are correct. At first it put me off a bit too, but once my hair dried, I loved the look! THICKER, very shiny and healthy. Now I shampoo and leave it in while I wash the rest of me, so I get the full thickening effect. No problem becuz this shampoo is also very GENTLE. I wouldnt dare do that w/ a sulphate containing shampoo--it would kill my hair! I have long hair and do not use conditioner. But when I have (I occasionally use the leave in kind) the combination didnt appear greasy or anything. I REALLY like this shampoo and now will not use any other.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Noticed a difference the first time I used the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smell great :) excellent product.</li>
            <li> I would never have purchased this shampoo if I&#x27;d known it contained Butylpheny Methylpropional which is a cancer causing agent. This ingredient was not listed when I was looking at this product..I cannot stand deception when it says &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34;..not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> Product is as described.</li>
            <li> I do not use it often so I cant see results yet, but I like the smell and how well it lathers</li>
            <li> I was not a fan. It is very thick and creamy and I did not feel like it did anything to actually clean. This would likely be a GREAT product for very dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product a lot!! makes my hair feel really clean and healthy!!</li>
            <li> The JASON Restorative Biotin - Pure &amp; Natural Shampoo does not contains any parabens, phthalates, or sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate (SLS), but does contain sodium laurel sulfoacetate. Cleans well, but for those with allergies, it contains both lavender and fragrance (parfum), so you&#x27;ll want to avoid this and instead get the JASON - Fragrance Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I started using Jason&#x27;s shampoo years ago when my hair started thinning. After a month I could tell a real difference in the health of my scalp. I now have very healthy shiny hair and no more split ends!! This (and other versions of Jason&#x27;s shampoo) reduced my oily scalp and dry hair--recommend it all the time. I particulary like the Peach in the summertime and Jojoba in the winter.  The hand soap is also great for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried recently and, after using it for the past 2 months or so (2-3 times a week), I can definitely say it has made my hair stronger and overall healthier-looking. I typically don&#x27;t buy &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; beauty products, but the way this product makes my hair look and feel is enough to convince me. My hair is over halfway down my back and gets greasy on the scalp area but can be somewhat dry towards the ends, especially in the winter. Long hair also has the tendency to look stringy, and this shampoo made my hair definitely look healthier and smoother. For me, it did a great job of cleaning and removing grease, but it did so without completely stripping it of some of the good oils that keep hair shiny/silky and healthy.  It also smells good, which is always a plus :) Overall, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with really long hair and wanting to make it soft, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, subtle fragrance that works for both genders. My whole family uses this gentle shampoo and we all have different hair types, from thin to very thick. Works great in all cases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find an organic shampoo/conditioner that does not contain mint (I despise the tingling feeling) and I think I found a winner!  I&#x27;ve used the product twice thus far, and I feel no irritation on my scalp, my hair looks fuller, and the scent is very light (smells a bit like roses). The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the slight waxy feeling the conditioner leaves.  However, it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily, neither does my hair look oily, so I&#x27;ll just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually bought this in stores for many years and I can&#x27;t praise it enough. I&#x27;ve long had to use hair loss shampoos due to some problems that began in college. The best ones halt hair loss. I bought this originally because of the biotin. I&#x27;m an entertainer and I usually use this when I do a stage show. I also do blogging and I&#x27;ve been on CNN a few times and used it then. I also use it before I put a bit of color in my hair and after. It is truly natural, leaves the hair fuller, and is very gentle on the scalp. I never use the conditioner. But I can say that I have used this now periodically (I use other shampoos as well) for well over 10 years. They recently improved it, as they put it..and they were correct: it is better than ever. Again, don&#x27;t expect it to grow hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle shampoo that makes the hair look nice and volumizes it, this is for you. I think it&#x27;s Jason&#x27;s best shampoo. I recently went on a 9 month road trip in my non blogging incarnation and drove all over the country. This was a shampoo that I not only brought but had overnighted to me when I ran out and was not anywhere near a health food store. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> BEST THING MONEY CAN BUY!! I WISH I HAD PICS TO POST THIS STUFF IS AMAZING AN GREAT FOR THE PRICE. ALTHOUGH I DID FIND IT CHEAPER AT KROGERY GROCERY STORE. I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> been using it for a short time only but I am quite satisfied with the results . It is important that if does not contain any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast as expected and have been loving this product. Will continue to use. highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair. If anyone is familiar with NaturallyCurly.com I&#x27;m between the 2B-2C range. I detangle my hair with my fingers while it&#x27;s wet, and this conditioner is fantastic at detangling! It makes my hair really smooth, and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers through easily. I scrunch some into my hair as a leave-in once I&#x27;m done showering. I feel like it makes my hair soft and defines the curls well. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I put off looking for a new natural shampoo for a while because its hard as hell to find shampoo with exactly what i want (3 or 4 main natural ingrediants that make my hair look really good) without the companies adding a crapload of other stuff i dont want in my hair... i finally started looking for some and this one is the 3rd one i bought... only thing about shopping online is that its hard to read the back of the bottle to see all of the ingrediants... like i always do when i shop offline... so i just pick whatever looks like might not piss me off when i finally get it and read the back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used this about 2 times before i finally really read the back only because when i used it i actually liked how it made my hair look (the best out of the 3)...  a lot like the shampoo i&#x27;d been using for 10 plus years until they decided to stop making it -creme of nature (the original older version) -  which i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d be able to match... but the combo of this plus jason&#x27;s aloe vera conditioner both have the same ingrediants as creme of nature (the main 3 or 4 i look for )...  so i didnt care what was in it just that my hair finally looked like it used to... not until after the 2nd day did i start to notice my hair was getting dryer... this happened to me before... used a hair product... looked great... then a couple days later went from great to dry to breaking off... turns out its the alcohol they put in it.. that plus the perfume.. which is alcohol on top of alcohol.. not good for your hair.. at all... i would never put any kind of alcohol in my hair unless i was trying to eff it up on purpose... dry it out and give myself dead ends...  plus never liked the smell of it.. its strong and stinky.. turns out because of the cheap smelling perfume they dumped in it... i dont know if it was this shampoo or jasons conditioner thats doing the drying out but I think its the conditioner because that has Stearyl Alcholol at the top of the ingrediants which means theres a lot of it in there... why is it so hard for these companies to just put a handful of ingrediants and leave out all the extra crap that always ends up being the stuff that does damage and should&#x27;nt be in it...  doesn&#x27;t get any dumber than putting alcohol in any beauty product.. the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone.... hydrolyzed milk protein and honey help too but i only look for the first 4... i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves so i dont have to deal with all the extra bad stuff these companies add... but i&#x27;ve been too lazy to mix em together and use em... i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  the dimethicone left it shiney&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i  wont use jason&#x27;s aloe vera conditioner again but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the dryinga lot of it in there... why is it so hard for these companies to just put a handful of ingrediants and leave out all the extra crap that always ends up being the stuff that does damage and should&#x27;nt be in it...  doesn&#x27;t get any dumber than putting alcohol in any beauty product.. the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anyhthing that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone.... hydrolyzed milk protein and honey help too but i only look for the first 4... i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves so i dont have to deal with all the extra bad stuff these companies add... but i&#x27;ve been too lazy to mix em together and use em... i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  the dimethicone left it shiney&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i  wont use jason&#x27;s aloe vera conditioner again but I might try this shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the drying</li>
            <li> thanks you very much...for all..!!!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t using enough, but once i figured out how to get a good lather, it really made my hair really shiny and healthy looking.  If your hair tends to be a little dry from coloring, like mine was, you might need to use a little conditioner.</li>
            <li> My family loves this shampoo. Been using it a few years,leaves hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take alot to get a lather. It has a different smell but its a good smell. I used this with the matching conditioner. My hair is so soft and shiny and smells so good. Got mine from tjmaxx and came here to see the reviews after I had used it and am suprised it&#x27;s not 5 stars . I&#x27;m guessing my hair needed something that was in this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is thick wavy/curly, coarse/fine and i use a flat iron on it every other day. I kinda had keratin overload my hair suddenly was getting dry and breaking after being super healthy so this stuff literally reversed my hair in 1 wash. Soft, shiny, bouncy, healthy and smells so good. Love it and am willing to pay more if I can&#x27;t find at tjmaxx</li>
            <li> Very pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason Pure Natural Shampoo for approximately one year and love the shampoo.  It is a great product!</li>
            <li> My hair always had a tendency of being frizzy and dry.  This shampoo did nothing to restore my hair -- made it look extremely dry and wild.  Very disappointed because I need a shampoo which will help restore some of the hair I have lost.</li>
            <li> I just started using this shampoo  -- I have dry hair and it works really well  -- It is also very good on my sons hair  -- He has bi racial hair and this works really well on it  -- I am looking for organic ingredients  this fits the bill perfectly  --  the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 is I have trouble getting the conditioner completely rinsed out  --  I just stand in shower and just let in run  --  for me it feels like a residue on my hair if not rinsed out completely -- I have never had this issue with shampoo before --</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s natural, the smell and it&#x27;s gentle. I wish it left my hair feeling softer, but it doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair when dry either. I guess I&#x27;m expecting too much out of a shampoo, as that is not it&#x27;s role, I&#x27;m going to buy the conditioner and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so wonderful it gives my limp lifeless thinning hair so much volume and shine! Ive been using nioxin for almost a year with little results and it dried out my hair and I swear made it thinner!!  I wish I would have found this product sooner!! The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great it smells like a cheap scented rose candle but I don&#x27;t even care!!! the way it makes my hair look and feel it could smell like rotten eggs &amp; I would still use it!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, l recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> The smell is so strange almost nasty and the product left my hair feeling dry and stringy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people who color their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now. It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t damage my extensions. I do not notice rapid hair growth but I do feel like my hair loss is reduced.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked.  I will probably not buy it again.  Used it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t see any results for scalp acne.  Went to the doc and got a cream and pills and my scalp acne was cleared up in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say passssssss on this product.</li>
            <li> Yuck!  I guess this is a hit or miss depending on hair type- but this may be the nastiest stuff I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair!  After a long day of house cleaning and yard work, my hair needed a good washing.  I had just bought this and decided to try it.  I did notice it was strangely difficult to comb through my hair after getting out of the shower, and it took MUCH longer than usual to dry (actually, it never did dry all the way).  It felt gross, like it had glue in it.  It looked and felt SO filthy (it looked/felt better when it WAS filthy).  I couldn&#x27;t stand it, I jumped back into the shower and washed it 3 times with my usual shampoo.  It feels so much better now.  My hair is naturally slightly curly, fine, and I have a lot of it.  The whole showering process already takes me a very long time, and normally, if I encounter a bad hair product, I just deal with it until the next washing, but THIS was disgusting!  Mines already in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li> I just found this shampoo on sale at Raisin Rack for under $6. It is natural and sulfate free which is good for my natural hair. I have only used it once on my hair and once on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It has a light natural smell which I love. I am hoping it works for me and if so I will be buying again. I don&#x27;t wash my hair often, I am more of a co-wash natural, but I like to have a good shampoo when I do. Hopefully this is it!!</li>
            <li> Arrived in gd time....packaging was a lil tricky do to manufacture of the bottle the top spins off to easy so they put tape around the top the clear type tape...can I recommend in the future use duct tape ...it still leaked with the clear tape a lil bit but nothing crazy</li>
            <li> very nice shampoo and conditioner, works well on my hair, leaves them smooth and silky after a wash&lt;br /&gt;Available almost at 50% less price in stores...</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews on this and thought id give it a try. Well i dislike it very much. It made my hair even more dry n brittle and left a weird oiliness to my hair. The smell is strong but not to strong.  And last it took forever to arrive in the mail. Definitely not purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very beneficial for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The product is great; however, was not that happy with the leaking of fluid from the bottle when I received it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mom. She said it was a very good deal from what she pays at the local health food store. She says it works really well and help stop ur hair from falling out so much.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t give this a positive review because it should not be advertised as a shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot; or even lather.  Lathering is not an issue, but cleaning is---a shampoo has to remove grease and clean.  The product I purchased is JASON Restorative Biotin Pure Natural Shampoo,&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B000FGC99Y&lt;br /&gt;UPC: 078522070054&lt;br /&gt;Item model number: 07005&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted $10 bucks on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I had a better experience with the Jason \\&quot;Thin to Thick Extra Volumn Shampoo\\&quot; that I purchased from the same seller (SB Naturals / Home Naturals Online, Inc.).  This one had just enough lather to effectively clean, but was gentle enough on my hair.  You could tell it&#x27;s a natural, less abrasive product.  It also gave my hair some elevation in the needed areas, so I would recommend that one.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so healthy</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo was just the change I needed.  I was getting acne or some irritation on the back of my head with my prior shampoo.  After using this, it started to clear up and is gone.  I have already bought two more bottles and do not plan to go without this great product.  One thing to note:  it is not a very thick shampoo.  It is a little thinner than you may be used to and comes out of the bottle quickly, but it is terrific!</li>
            <li> Works great...my hairdresser noted the difference!</li>
            <li> The condition of my hair has improved a lot since using this product.  I do have to wash my hair periodically with a clarifying shampoo as my hair gets too heavy, but the ingredients in the shampoo have been really good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have been using it for the past year and it nourishing and gentle to my hair.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the best I could find..</li>
            <li> Great product! Delivered before estimated time! I&#x27;m from Colombia and I only use this products because i found they are great with my hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> I brought the shampoo along with the conditioner. I love how this shampoos cleans and softens my hair. The fragrance is also great but not too overpowering. Like any new product, I think you need to use it a few weeks to see how you react tout . So far I have been very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/7/15 I have purchased another bottle of this shampoo. It&#x27;s really great! It leaves your hair soft and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have been using a chemical-free shampoo for three months. Then, I forgot to buy a new bottle and found Jason&#x27;s shampoo in the local grocery store. The first day I used it, I lost 100 hairs more than average. I did not relate one to the other but I noticed that my scalp was irritated. I used for the second time, again I lost more than regular. I decided to stop and bought my former chemical-free shampoo: it took a week, but the amount of hair loss reduced (first 30, then 80, then 98 less). I believe it must have been the alcohol that caused the reaction.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t lathers well and made my scalp oily with residue. It also contains dimethicone, which is not something harmful, but many self-claimed natural shampoo (not conditioner, though) will try to avoid adding it.</li>
            <li> I cant see that it does any different than any other shampoo.  Its very thin not thick like a normal shampoo so when you use it, it comes out very fast.  The smell is terrible!  But who walks up to you and says let me smell your hair?...Ive gone back to using my Suave, to me Id rather not gag when washing my hair.  Get Biotin and take it and save your money on this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have used this product for years and it helps and promotes healthy and improved hair growth for thinning hair and it&#x27;s great for younger folks hair as well, since my teenage daughter loves it as well.  We really notice a difference when we are traveling and use the cheap hotel shampoos.  You really get what you pay for regarding hair care.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling wonderfuI.  I will definitely order it again. I had used another one of their shampoos before, and was also very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, feels so much better, no build up</li>
            <li> it is very good for my hair.since I used it, the hair loss stopped.And i love the scent of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Having hair issues. Tried this. It&#x27;s too heavy and smelly. Made my scalp feel dirty and itch and I couldn&#x27;t stand the miasma in bed at night.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I love the smell and it is making my hair thicker.  As I grow older my hair has begun to thin.  Since I started using Jason with Biotin, I have noticed my hair getting thicker.  Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great shampoo.  I originally bought it for some problem scalp issues..which I think has helped a bit...but not much.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise my hair does feel thicker and healthier.  The shampoo is thick so a little goes a long way..so make sure you are careful when dispensing as it will come out of the bottle really quick and you will have way too much in your hands.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have used so far! It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the shampoo because the product I received leaked. The outer wrapping was damaged and the cap opened leaking most of the shampoo. The manufacturer needs to use an inner seal between the bottle and the cap so shipping loss does not occur and to make the product more tamper-proof. Without the inner seal, I would not trust this product.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the Jason biotin shampoo. I did not even use the conditioner yet, and normally, I have to use a LOT of conditioner, to tame down my unruly hair. At 61, my hair has had a lot of abuse, although I have never bleached it or colored it, but I live a busy life, and don&#x27;t take time to pamper my hair. It is long, and I tend to be rough on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo left my hair sparkling clean, shiny, and really manageable. Love it. Hope it continues to give me such great results!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair as soft and moisturized-feeling as I thought it might.  I think it helped my damaged hair a little, though.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, it&#x27;s silky and untangles easy with my fingers during wash. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner a couple of months ago.  Since my hormones seem to be all over the charts lately, I had been having problems with hair thinning and changing texture.  Since using Jason Natural Biotin products, my hair texture has improved significantly and it has LOTS of body again!  I have ordered and tried Nature&#x27;s Gate and also Jason Thin to Thick products but Jason Natural Biotin is definitely my favorite!  To me, it smells like baby powder (which is indeed pleasant to me!) and it is very gentle on my hair...I found that even the Jason Thin to Thick made it feel thicker but more like straw.  I will DEFINITELY continue to use!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy it because your wife will steal it.</li>
            <li> Here is info on  just one of the ingredients in this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Also called coco hydroxysulfaine, and CAHS, this ingredient is a surfactant or cleanser. If you have a label that says, ‚Äúderived from coconut,‚Äù don‚Äôt be fooled. Yes, the raw materials (fatty acids) come from coconut, but then they are processed in the laboratory to come up with the end chemical. In other words, the original source material may come from coconut, but then it‚Äôs chemically processed and converted into unnatural materials. Typically harsh chemicals like sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are added to the coconut oil molecule to make them effective as cleansers. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them unsafe, but they are definitely not ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase due to misleading use of the term Natural.</li>
            <li> Biotin was recommended to help strengthen fine hair. It&#x27;s all right, not worth the price. The smell is just OK.</li>
            <li> Works well and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Natural Biotin Shampoo. It made my hair manageable and shiny. It was what i&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I have oily fine hair that I have to wash everyday and I loved this- gentle enough but gets my hair clean. I discovered this when I started to dye my hair. Now I won&#x27;t say that it doesn&#x27;t fade my color, but it&#x27;s much less than regular shampoos. This smells a little of baby powder and doesn&#x27;t lather as well as regular shampoo since it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfates. But as long as you get your hair thoroughly wet and then applying it should lather pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s where I have issues. I ordered this recently as I was running out, and when I got it, the bottle is different from the image and it says it&#x27;s \\&quot;New &amp; Improved.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a new formula, but definitely not improved. I can&#x27;t rinse the new formula clean at all (after running water through my hair for about 5 minutes, which is way too long) - feels like it leaves a film on my hair. And when I dry my hair, my hair feels like I&#x27;ve added product to it- not clean at all. So whatever they did to the old formula, did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unless I can find the old formula, I&#x27;m going to have to find another shampoo...again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now. It&#x27;s a very gentle shampoo, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Finally found a natural shampoo that smells good and gets the job done.  Will definitely be reordering!</li>
            <li> Recommended to me. Now recommended by me.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, and over time has helped me regrow some of my very thin hair. Not a miracle, but when I ran out for a couple of months I really noticed the difference. I will not be with out it again. It is expensive, but with thin hair you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using JASON Shampoo for more than a year right now, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Basically, I stopped losing hair once I changed from old shampoo to JASON, and given that all men in my family are bald, stopping the hair lose was an issue for me.</li>
            <li> mY HAIR ISN&#x27;T Flling out as much</li>
            <li> Best type of natural and safe Shampoo found so far that leaves your hair soft and shiny. The fragrance is awesome.</li>
            <li> I recently started a medication that has caused some hair loss. This conditioner has really cut down on this. I get so many compliments on my hair.  It looks and feels so healthy.  Instead of feeling bad about my hair loss I feel good because my hair looks so good.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! I love the smell, the organic ingredients, and the thickness it&#x27;s given to my hair (probably because of the biotin) I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be committed to this product for a while.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this shampoo multiple times, and it works well.  It was double wrapped to prevent any leaking out.</li>
            <li> This Jason purchase was my first shampoo after getting away from the mainstream brands full of BAD crap.  The experience has been very pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;Good lather, nice middle-of-the-road scent and a good clean feeling after rinse all combine to make this a very fine and effective shampoo.  I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, isn&#x27;t tested on animals, doesn&#x27;t build up and has really, really stopped breakage.  It&#x27;s truly helped improve the quality of my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since about 2008 and I&#x27;m still buying it.</li>
            <li> I love these products. Leaves my hair soft and great smelling, and as someone who is conscious of ingredients now, I feel good about using this for my body. I look forward to trying out other variants.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo, I was losing my hair but after researching it, I knew how to fix the problem. I went to the health food store near my home and made my  first purchase, when that bottle was almost empty, I ordered this one from Amazon, since this is my favorite place to shop. My hair has grown back a lot in 2 years. When I went to my daughter&#x27;s for a visit, while I was there I used their shower as I am worried about falling in the bathtub to shower, and was I surprised to see that my son in law used it also. When I son was complaining about his hour, I mentioned Jason&#x27;s shampoo to him when he got his first bottle and had used it awhile, he called to say his hair looked so much better and he ordered quiet a supply. He  did not tell me how many bottles he order except he said it was a good supply. I have purchased several bottles and am ready for another one. It is wonderful shampoo and not expensive. I would strongly recommend this shampoo to any one who has lost hair and their hair is dull and falling out little by little.</li>
            <li> My husband and I decided to switch all of our hygiene and household cleaning products to paraben free, for obvious health reasons. I was researching \\&quot;Paraben Free\\&quot; when I found this shampoo. I ordered it, without reading the ingredients list in the description. Before it arrived, I looked over the description (yes, I should have done that first I&#x27;m aware) and in the ingredients list it says \\&quot;methylparaben\\&quot;. I requested a return. The company said they would refund the money for the product, and that I could keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the product arrived, I read the ingredients and it DOES NOT contain methylparaben or any other type of parabens- it clearly says on the bottle \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot;. Here&#x27;s where I am lost. Why did amazon list their ingredient list incorrectly? Also, why is the company not double-checking the ingredients list?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the shampoo and conditioner out and absolutely love the products. If you are looking for a paraben free, natural shampoo and conditioner then these two (the shampoo and conditioner) are great. They do contain alcohol and parfum, so they are not entirely chemical free, but they do the job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 3 stars because while I like the product, I am not satisfied with the miscommunication between the company and the distributor.</li>
            <li> i SUPOUSE WAS FREE FRAGANCIA i COULNT USE</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling like I&#x27;ve washed and conditioned it, but can&#x27;t rinse the conditioner out. I would expect this from an all-in-one shampoo, but it is not billed as such. Perhaps it&#x27;s just not formulated for fine hair.</li>
            <li> love the product, it works for my curly fine hair.  most products end up making my hair volumous, but dry, this does the volume while maintaining a healthy moisture.</li>
            <li> gets the job done at a very affordable price point.  all natural too, that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> When I went natural I found that retail stock shampoo either dried my hair or added too much oil. Jason Biotincleanses my hair gently and the conditioner adds bounce and shine while minimizing my frizz I do recommend by from the vitamin shoppe or whole foods that way you know what your getting I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Jason as far as not being able to rinse thoroughly or not lathering this safe to use on locs as well</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this Jason shampoo and conditioner for about a month and cannot say enough good things about the products.  Her hair was really ruined by sun, swimming, and the dry Denver air.  She loves the results.</li>
            <li> I order this shampoo online because no local store will carry it and I love it, leaves my hair soft and I have had issues with dry scalp for as long as I can remember but not anymore with this shampoo</li>
            <li> I bought this product as it seemed &#x27;organic&#x27; and had good ingredients. But it&#x27;s the first time, I had split ends in ages after just my first wash. I took only 2 to 3 drops for the wash!!!! My hair appeared drier, frizzier the entire day and am unsure to use it again....&lt;br /&gt;And yes, my friend had ordered the same one reading it&#x27;s review on other blogs. But, her hair dried out with wavy and frizzy feel at the ends....</li>
            <li> For anyone who was wondering, this is actually the New and Improved formulation of Jason&#x27;s Biotin shampoo. The bottle looks different from the one pictured here (and did not leak in transit, so points for that). I don&#x27;t have experience with the previous formulation, but I can tell this one lathers up just fine on the first try and doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to contribute to fallout. Time will tell whether or not it leads to new growth, but the biotin is low enough on the new ingredients list to make me concerned about that. I will follow up with the new ingredients list, as the one in the product description does not apply to this formulation. First a note on the scent: it is kind of like if original Herbal Essences and Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Shampoo were mixed together, it would result in this scent. It&#x27;s a weirdly comforting fragrance but YMMV. Secondly, the shampoo leaves my hair in fine condition for house-puttering and errand-running, but for a night out I am still going to reach for a high performance shampoo like L&#x27;Oreal. Anyhoo, here are the ingredients, many of which are just science-ese for coconut based products, sugar based products and Vitamin E:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract*, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract*, Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Amine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Sodium Phytate, Sodium Sulfate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Alcohol*, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Coumarin, Fragrance (Parfum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit 6/24/13) I am adding an addendum to this review to state that I am noticing new hair growth since I changed the way I use this shampoo. I started off using it like I do other shampoos - lather, rinse, no repeat. I noticed that other biotin shampoos have instructions to leave the product in your hair for a while, so I started doing that with this one, just leaving it in for a few minutes like I would with a conditioner. I believe the prolonged contact with my scalp is allowing the active ingredients to do their work.</li>
            <li> At first I loved it, but after a week or so my scalp started becoming really irritated. It started itching really bad and flaking. It felt like I had really bad dandruff and lice at once. My hair stylist said that it was pretty common for all natural shampoo and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using it because the irritation was getting so bad. If you already have a sensitive scalp, I would suggest just using Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version of this shampoo and I do not like it.  I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos, as well as done my own baking soda rinse; this, by far, is the worst of all I&#x27;ve tried.  I have thin, fine, very dry and brittle hair and this shampoo always makes it feel greasy and sticky.  When it dries, it feels like I&#x27;ve got gel in my hair because it dries crunchy and stiff, yet still oily and greasy (a strange combination of everything I hate my hair to feel like).  I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean.  It&#x27;s like washing your hair with conditioner and never being able to fully wash the conditioner out.  If you only use it once a week or so, this might work well on your hair as an occasional substitute, but not an every day shampoo. It feels like I have a lot of build up in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use all-natural products, I&#x27;m pretty use to the fact that natural shampoos feel different on hair.  I don&#x27;t believe in the \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feeling of chemical shampoos, which is what we have been accustomed to feeling and have bought into the idea that it is healthy, but at the same time, your hair shouldn&#x27;t feel like it is nasty and gross.  I think the reason a lot of people complain about the itchy and flaky scalp is because this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the bad bacteria, yeast, and/or fungal infections that can appear on your scalp, especially those who are prone to it.  Natural shampoo needs to clean the scalp without stripping the natural oils, but I think this product would benefit from additional herbal agents (mint/rosemary) that attack bad bacteria and fungus more aggressively.  I don&#x27;t believe this product does that, at least not for my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops of tea tree oil in the shampoo to help combat the dandruff this shampoo was causing, which did help, but it did not improve the greasy, over-conditioned feeling very much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Biotin shampoo for only 1week and I can tell that it is really making a difference in my hair, it feels much healthier, stronger and fuller. I was losing tons of hair after having a baby and using this shampoo has helped a lot. I am so happy that after doing tons of research I found this shampoo, I am never using anything else on my hair. Thanks Jason !</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, this is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve recently been struggling with thinning hair, breakage, and excessive shedding.  I had tried several shampoos and was ready to give up when I stumbled upon this product.  After one wash, I noticed an enormous difference.  My hair felt healthy and beautiful for the first time in weeks, restoring my self-confidence and hopes that my hair will heal.  It&#x27;s more shiny and voluminous than ever also (forget &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoos!!) for an added bonus.  I wish I could thank someone personally for the fact that I can legitimately love my hair again!! And not to mention that I have finally found a shampoo for life!!  Thanks JƒÅs&amp;ouml;n!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Like it because of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great!  It&#x27;s light and leaves the hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.  I am a fan of Jason products and will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Packaging needs to be rethought, bottle showed up with broken cap.</li>
            <li> Only have used it once so far, but will update review after about a month to see how i really like it</li>
            <li> not for me.  not sure how it could be for anyone.  can&#x27;t find a natural shampoo that cleans well.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Biotin conditioner. I have fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy. I wanted a product that was SLS free and could potentially help my hair look thicker. This product weighs my hair down and it makes my hair greasy within an hour after using. Yikes. Might not be the right formula for my fine hair. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> Jason shampoos are great ~ love this one and aloe</li>
            <li> I got both the Jason Pure Natural Shampoo and Conditioner, hoping to use these two every other day (the other days using Oribe for Beautiful Color or the Moroccan Oil shampoo/cond set you can buy virtually anywhere). I have to say of the 3 shampoo/conditioner sets I use, this is the least favorite. It&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;restorative&amp;#34;, and with the biotin component, I thought I&#x27;d be feeding my hair even. But the end result is what matters. Period. And it&#x27;s a fact that after using the Oribe shampoo/cond, my fine, thin hair glistens &amp;#34;like a teenagers&amp;#34; (is what my husband says). Oribe is by far and away the ONLY shampoo/cond set I&#x27;ve tried that has resulted in silken, shiny hair. Volume you WON&#x27;T get. But what I don&#x27;t like about the Jason Pure is the dull, frizzy, completely uncontrollable effect it has on my thin, fine hair. I&#x27;m bummed, cuz this shampoo/cond is about 1/3 the cost of Oribe. Not saying you get what you pay for, but for some reason, the ingredients in Jason simply turn my hair to a dull, grizzled, fly-away mess. I will definitely NOT be buying this again. Yeah, maybe my hair is healthier? But it sure looks awful.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and thicker feeling. Plus, it smells great.  However, If I buy it again, it won&#x27;t be from Amazon.  I have found it on many other websites for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for years.  I love it.  But your hair feels kind of knotty until you use the conditioner.  I&#x27;m fairly certain my hair seemed less dry, or damaged after a few months of use.  I think the paragons were drying my hair out. I&#x27;ve been using Jason products for some time now.  I try to shop around and see where they are cheapest.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo because it was made by Jason but it does not do a good job cleaning the hair.  I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural shampoo I have tried.  And I have tried a lot of them. My hair was wonderfully soft after the very first use (with matching conditioner). Weeks later I am still loving it.  My hair is clean and fresh. Its soft- but not weighted down.  Switching to no sulfates has virtually eliminated my itchy, oily, flakey scalp issues. . I was even able to switch to 3 days per week washings.  But with this shampoo I need to wash daily or my itch comes back. Thats why I gave it a 4, instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly African American hair and my hair absolutely love it, I wash my hair once a week with it and it cleans my hair so good and leaves it soft, manageable, and smelling good. My hair has grown so fast with this shampoo too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about the ingredients listed here for this product. My bottle shows that SLS is an ingredient, therefore I will no longer be using this product after today. Your ingredient listing does not.  Hhhhmmmmm.</li>
            <li> Great product that makes your hair silky and clean.  Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> ok..it didn&#x27;t work as I thought.</li>
            <li> I like that there are no phosphate in this and that it is affordable. It is not my favorite but I like it.</li>
            <li> I first bought this shampoo and conditioner at Whole Foods when seeking a natural alternative to the garbage I have been using my whole life. I have ultra thin hair that is very hard to manage and this shampoo cured that. It also lasts so much longer than cheaper shampoos for some reason. I am making my future purchases on Amazon, saving a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> I like a shampoo to lather up and this one just doesn&#x27;t do that. It is probably normal but to me it makes me think my hair isn&#x27;t clean and I end up following it with a different shampoo, which likely defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Love love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> This was a great shampoo that left my hair full and straight. i used it with the conditioner and it left my hair soft and straight. Did not weigh it down. definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural! I go for hair products with out sulfate. I tried this brand and I actually started to see good changes in my hair. It seemed to start retaining length. I would say that it did make hair a little dry after using but I applied Shea butter and castor oil and everything worked out fine. I&#x27;d purchase thus again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo! i&#x27;ve been using this jason brand biotin shampoo and conditioner for years now. i have experimented with other scents and other brands but continue to come back to this one. it smells fresh, leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every hair thickener/volumizer out there, including pricier biotin shampoos.  My hair started thinning when I started going through menopause.  This is the first shampoo that actually does seem to be making a difference.</li>
            <li> love the shine and specially the scent it leaves my hair. plus the the softness is a huge plus! love</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USNG THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG-TIME, PROBABLY ABOUT 2 OR MORE YEARS, AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO KEEP IN THE HOUSE,  NOT ONLY IT&#x27;S BIOTIN, MY DAUGHTER AND SON USE IT EVERYTIME THEY BATH OR SHOWER, AND TWO BOTTLES HAVE TO BE PURCHASE NEXT TIME!  WHAT ABOUT MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> Not happy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was already open and spilled most of it in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to open the package because of all the spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star because of the spill not for the product itself.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and enjoys it as a organic alternative for shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t work for me. It left my fine hair very limp.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, but the shipping was not very careful, and one of the bottle caps was broken, and half of the shampoo was spilled in the box. Need to wrap more better.</li>
            <li> I usually only shampoo my hair every 5 days, but with this shampoo it was greasy after 24 hours.  My hair was limp and dull.  I love that it&#x27;s natural and free of many harmful chemicals, but if it doesn&#x27;t get the job done, I&#x27;d be better off using nothing.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the other products from this company, so I decided to try out the shampoo. It is awful. My hair seems to get more and more greasy every time I wash it with this shampoo. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair any silkier than it would be had I not used it. Over all, I was VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a good product not sure if i notice hair lose but I do notice less hair breakage. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> After finding my hair was thinning due to medical issues, my hair stylist recommended I start using Rogaine. Instead of adding yet another pharmaceutical product to my routine, I decided to start taking daily Biotin supplements and using JASON Biotin shampoo. From day one I could feel a difference in my hair. I did NOT stop losing hair immediately, as Biotin can take weeks/months to be effective. However, JASON shampoo makes your hair feel and look thicker from the first time you use it. It lathers very well and rinses easily. My hair tends to be on the oily side and I was worried this might make it look greasy, but I did not notice any difference from my usual shampoo. I would definitely recommend JASON shampoo if you have hair thinning issues.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner had leaked out (at least 1/2) from both containers.  Only the conditioner was sealed in a plastic bag &amp; I was able to return the portion leaked to the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Just used it today and I actually love it but don&#x27;t think I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo! I have curly, frizzy hair, and this stuff has tamed it and makes it so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> It feels really clean and you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to make a good lather. It smells great. I think it&#x27;s the ginseng. Generally not flowery and it doesn&#x27;t smell like ax body spray for teenagers nor is it fruity.</li>
            <li> Love all their products!</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well, my hair feels clean</li>
            <li> This NEW formula added Amine Hydrochloride and it drastically changed this shampoo. I managed to find an old bottle to compare to see what they did. I SWORE by this shampoo until they changed it. Also it states it is SLS free however many of the ingredients are in the SLS family:( Not sure why you guys changed this but I bought the last three bottles of old off the shelf and will not touch the new formula again. It destroyed my hair after the old fixed it;( Please stop messing with products that are already good because you made this worse. The new formula rarely washes out of your hair and it makes it feel crunchy;(  Please don&#x27;t going messing with your toothpaste too. Leave well enough alone please. You had it right! CUSTOMERS if you have an old bottle of this it is 5 stars! I have fine thin hair and this washed clean, gave bounce and color and made my hair actually grow. The NEW formula is breaking my hear off. It looks like I have a thyroid condition with dry, brittle and damaged hair. Don&#x27;t buy the new bottles. It will have Amine Hydrocholoride on the label next to Lavender extract - old bottles do not.</li>
            <li> i like a item.&lt;br /&gt;good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my thick, coarse mediterranean hair crazy volume so it deserves 5 stars for me. Mind you, i have really thick and heavy hair and after shampooing with this, my hair is so voluminous. I cant get enough of it. (I use it alone without the conditioner although i have it too)</li>
            <li> Unaware that my hair would have no body. Told by other people if your water is soft that will happen. Hair does not feel as clean with this product, but again it may be due to my soft water.</li>
            <li> hair looks feels great.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly and very pleased with the seller.  I will continue to buy this product.  It made my hair soft and shiny.  I love it!  I would recommend this product to friends and relatives.</li>
