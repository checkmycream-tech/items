            <li>For months now I&#x27;ve been using this product in combination with an all over blow out spray when drying my hair and it looks great!</li>
            <li>One of the best root boosters I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>this is the best root booster!</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>GREAT product by Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li>Great for volume and styling fine/thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>so it looks nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone think that that kind of packaging would ensure the merchandise would not get damaged... as a matter of fact they should have anticipated this result.</li>
            <li>I was able to find my own spray bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and will continue using it daily.</li>
            <li>PM Extra-Body Booster is excellent for my short thinning hair!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s it not filled with chemicals and has a pleasant odor, on top of it working beautifully to give my hair</li>
            <li>Mousse was okay, but after i used this i noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>style my hair in a beehive updo and this helps the best compared to other brands</li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>As a result, my scalp easily shows through my hair</li>
            <li>If you want a really strong noticeable root boost  - this</li>
            <li>Finely something that helps fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product but smaller than I was expecting</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair, and this product allows me to appear to have thicker hair than I do.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and hair spray is not enough to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>Then apply cool setting to set it before removing brush</li>
            <li>First time I tried it and I am a fan - will give lift to your roots - its not greasy -- easy to use</li>
            <li>Good quality, low price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>even more if you apply a section at a time and direct the blower at the root at hot setting.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it always falls flat without any product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Corresponding shampoo/conditioner good for thin hair too.</li>
            <li>The body lasts all day because you only spray it on your roots which leaves the rest of your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely reccomend this for people looking for more volume in their hair, especially for thin or fine hair types.</li>
            <li>It adds volume while still keeping my hair soft and flowy.  </li>
            <li>Since I have blonde, pretty fine hair, I needed something that would give me body, but wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my long hair.  </li>
            <li>The little bit of extra body and &amp;#34;cooperation&amp;#34; my hair gets from this is well worth it.</li>

            <li> makes my hair feel coarse and dry</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it always falls flat without any product. For months now I&#x27;ve been using this product in combination with an all over blow out spray when drying my hair and it looks great! Finally, at age 31, I feel like I&#x27;ve learned how to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair so it looks nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> One of the best root boosters I&#x27;ve tried.  (and i&#x27;ve tried them all).</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle was completely broken off.  It looked like it was shipped that way.  I was able to find my own spray bottle so I could use the product.  Very unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> Great product but smaller than I was expecting</li>
            <li> Since I have blonde, pretty fine hair, I needed something that would give me body, but wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my long hair.  Mousse was okay, but after i used this i noticed a huge difference.  The body lasts all day because you only spray it on your roots which leaves the rest of your hair super soft. I&#x27;d definitely reccomend this for people looking for more volume in their hair, especially for thin or fine hair types.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have thin and wavy hair, which is new for me (I lost a lot of my hair after surgery).  As a result, my scalp easily shows through my hair and I&#x27;ve had to re-think how I do things.  I bought this product based on other people&#x27;s reviews on Amazon and I have to add my voice to the &amp;#34;it&#x27;s great!&amp;#34; chorus.  I like that&#x27;s it not filled with chemicals and has a pleasant odor, on top of it working beautifully to give my hair the look I want.  I&#x27;m very happy and will continue using it daily.</li>
            <li> this is the best root booster!</li>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair with zero volume.  This product is helpful in adding volume to my hair.  It adds volume while still keeping my hair soft and flowy.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Finely something that helps fine hair.  Just a little extra boost at the roots so it doesn&#x27;t look completely limp.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> If you want a really strong noticeable root boost  - this works.&lt;br /&gt;I style my hair in a beehive updo and this helps the best compared to other brands&lt;br /&gt;It will leave your hair feeling stiff and that takes a while to get used to - but I suppose that why it works so well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily, or flaky.&lt;br /&gt;Helps even more if you apply a section at a time and direct the blower at the root at hot setting. Then apply cool setting to set it before removing brush&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought my second bottle already</li>
            <li> I have very thin and baby fine hair and add this to my crown just at the roots and I get texture, lift, and body. It also helps me go an extra day without shampooing too.</li>
            <li> Tried this at a friend&#x27;s house, and decided to get it. My hair is fine, and hair spray is not enough to keep it looking good. The little bit of extra body and &amp;#34;cooperation&amp;#34; my hair gets from this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Helps make my thin hair look thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair, and this product allows me to appear to have thicker hair than I do. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality, low price, fast delivery, what can I say. I&#x27;d buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> PM Extra-Body Booster is excellent for my short thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Gives a lot of body to your hair.</li>
            <li> Adds volume and works well. Corresponding shampoo/conditioner good for thin hair too.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it and I am a fan - will give lift to your roots - its not greasy -- easy to use</li>
            <li> GREAT product by Paul Mitchell.  Spray onto damp roots and blow dry.  Great for volume and styling fine/thin hair.  I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the product, however, the seller and their packaging for shipment protocols are sloppy, lazy and designed to save them money not to get the product to the buyer undamaged.  A pump spray bottle of a liquid product with a piece of tape across the nozzle was placed in a paper envelope and then into a plastic envelope.  When I opened the sealed plastic envelope the liquid poured out and I was left with 1/2 of a bottle of product. Why would anyone think that that kind of packaging would ensure the merchandise would not get damaged... as a matter of fact they should have anticipated this result. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
