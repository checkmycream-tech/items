            <li>This is the perfect sunblock for my face.</li>

            <li>This is a great moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
            <li>and I got it in the mail within the scheduled time in a great packaging</li>
            <li>All organic and great for your skin.</li>
            <li>While this is not my SPF lotion of choice for winter, it&#x27;s the perfect weight for summer if I am also using a serum of some kind.  </li>

            <li>: my skin has a better appearance (not as splotchy), smells wonderful, spreads well, I have been using for three weeks and have not had a breakout episode from the product, and you do not need to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It smells great, and it feels very light when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Love it, great for my skin type, not greasy but improves texture and discolorations.</li>
            <li>Spend more money &amp; go with the guarantee elsewhere!</li>
            <li>They do not fill the container all the way to account for changes in temperature during shipping (kind of like potato chips).</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this product from bluemercury  and thought I liked it.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t sweat too much, this should be perfect for you.</li>

            <li>i really do love this product, been using it for years</li>

            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>This day day cream is light, non-greasy and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for couple of month now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It has been more than two years that I use this.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Eminence is my favorite face products.</li>
            <li>Were I younger, it would be absolutely perfect without anything more.  </li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>I think it works okay as an SPF.</li>
            <li>However, for the price, (I bought it at a spa in Kauai), I expect to see more anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for others.</li>
            <li>This is why I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma and the texture.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin (often dry, yet I still break out mildly), and this is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I also do not notice any plumping, lifting or decreasing of any fine lines after using.</li>
            <li>my skin gets oily esp during the summertime, but this item is light and it comes out matted looking.  </li>
            <li>Eminence products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>This creme may fit the bill if you are looking for an SPF that will not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>This combination has worked out good for me thus far.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, makes the skin soft while leaving my face shine free.</li>
            <li>As for the moisturizer, just be sure not to over do it on the amount because it you use too much of it, it may start peeling.</li>
            <li>I love this day cream, it&#x27;s not oily and is essential to be safe when you&#x27;ll be in the sun.</li>
            <li>I think it may have helped decrease the mild redness I tend to have.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft, hydrated, clean, fresh, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>BUT for those who are all about getting the items right the first time, then i would probably find another seller.  </li>
            <li>not much else to say for this but that it feels and smells amazing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Eminence - the product would be much better in a pump style container - similar to the</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering it</li>
            <li>It works very well and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li>This cream goes on nice and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have a combination skin tone and large pores in Tzone.</li>
            <li>it was no biggy for me since i really don&#x27;t care about it that much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This surprises me since the texture feels very creamy.  </li>
            <li>The smell is lovely, and not strong, and no issue at all put it right on my eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two other &#x27;flavors&#x27; of their SPF cream before this, I love the tomato one</li>
            <li>My main skin concerns are brown spots (melasma), loss of firmness, and tendency to break out on a monthly basis.</li>
            <li>The eminence website provides product recommendations by allowing you to enter your main skin concerns.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any product by Eminence.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They are highly concentrated, which is why they seem pricey.  </li>
            <li>the top part of the moisturizer was delivered a little brown.  </li>
            <li>It is light like everyone says, but on a hot day I feel it start to sweat off a little and the spf wears off.</li>
            <li>- the top was dried out and it is not the quality</li>
            <li>Normally sunblocks make me break out, but the Eminence Persimmon &amp; Cantaloupe Day Cream SPF 32 has left my skin calm and clear.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination, and tends to be very dry right after washing and then very oily by evening.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have had two of the containers and they were both exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it on top of the guava bamboo moisturizer which seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>It was first recommended by my facial lady</li>
            <li>My face has gotten a little tanner with regular use of this, so I&#x27;ve had to add a powder with spf on top.</li>
            <li>Wild Plum Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and have tried several Eminence Products such as the Bright Skin, Eight Greens, Red Currant, and the Firm Skin Acai moisturizers .</li>
            <li>that they all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>and it was old</li>
            <li>This product was pasty and old</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this spf miosturizer.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Eminence--the fact that their products are 100% organic has done wonders for my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel quite moisturizing enough right away, but it does just enough to prevent my face from being oily later.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that if you put too much on your face and rub it into your face, it creates this white blotchy thing that you need to brush off.</li>
            <li>However, this has not been a major problem</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or major blemishes since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin, and on the plus side it did not upset the sensitive aspect of my skin, but rather made the oily part of my skin a little more oilier than usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, not shiny, and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not terribly, just a few little ones here and there.</li>
            <li>Use something stronger if you plan on being out in the direct sunlight for a long period of time.</li>

            <li> Use something stronger if you plan on being out in the direct sunlight for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real EMINENCE, think its a knock-off.  </li>
            <li> My face feels dry later in the day after applying.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;ve received the product with the seal broken, discolored cream on the surface and cream dried up on top of the seal.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the texture isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Before this I was using the clear skin moisturizer and thought I was going to miss it, but after seeing the results Im not sure I&#x27;ll go back.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for any other benefits, I would look for a different creme.</li>
            <li> i like this product, but i think the item is a little older or the seal was not on tight?  </li>
            <li> My skin felt so dry after using this.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly as regular lotion (I read this is due to the SPF), so I recommend emulsifying it with a few drops of water.  </li>
            <li> and they would give me just half of my money back!!</li>
            <li> As I said, my skin still feels very dry after applying.</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a gritty texture, though.</li>
            <li> Had I known that this was added to their product I would not have spent my money on the garbage.</li>
            <li> All broken, i&#x27;m talking about the whole seal detached from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive to use that way though</li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or shiny like other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> make it less moisturizing than the other lotions I&#x27;ve gotten from Eminence.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and dry within a few minutes of applying it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product seems to dry out quicker, is thick, and has crystallized  &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; in the cream.</li>
            <li> The texture was tacky and did not easily smooth onto my face.  </li>
            <li> I hate using very heavy products that feel caked on my face, but wanted a strong SPF.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t seen any less wrinkles but at least the ones that I have aren&#x27;t worsening.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause my extremely temperamental skin to break out!!!</li>

            <li> Also, I am not sure it hydrates all that well.</li>
            <li> So at least there&#x27;s that...</li>

            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that it was unpleasant.  </li>

            <li> I did not see any bad side effects with this creme.</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed that this \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; does not seem to moisturize at all.  </li>

            <li> Because I was mislead into believing this was an all natural/organic company. Upon receiving my purchase I began to look over the ingredients and was sad to discover chemical sunscreen. Had I known that this was added to their product I would not have spent my money on the garbage. The smell is nice and the texture isn&#x27;t bad but I prefers using organic products in my body. I was mislead by their advertisement.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sunblock for my face. It is light, non greasy, absorbs well, leaves my skin feeling soft, and, it smells wonderful! But, the best part... It doesn&#x27;t cause my extremely temperamental skin to break out!!! Thank you eminence!!!</li>
            <li> The product gets an &amp;#34;I Like&amp;#34; and the packing gets and &amp;#34;I Don&#x27;t Like It&amp;#34;. The packaging choice by Eminence is poorly designed. They do not use anything to truly seal the product, so the containers appears to be have been opened. Also, the product seems to dry out quicker, is thick, and has crystallized  &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; in the cream. I have had two of the containers and they were both exactly the same. They do not fill the container all the way to account for changes in temperature during shipping (kind of like potato chips). Also, I do not care for the paddle to apply the cream. Regardless, contamination is bound to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eminence - the product would be much better in a pump style container - similar to the Wild Plum Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the cream for the following reasons: my skin has a better appearance (not as splotchy), smells wonderful, spreads well, I have been using for three weeks and have not had a breakout episode from the product, and you do not need to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to BodyShopLA for customer service too!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have tried several Eminence Products such as the Bright Skin, Eight Greens, Red Currant, and the Firm Skin Acai moisturizers . My main skin concerns are brown spots (melasma), loss of firmness, and tendency to break out on a monthly basis. Of all the Eminence products, this moisturizer has worked out the best for me, plus I like that it has high SPF protection included. The eminence website provides product recommendations by allowing you to enter your main skin concerns. I have been using the Persimmon Cantaloupe moisturizer during the day and the Eight Greens Youth serum by itself at night. This combination has worked out good for me thus far. As for the moisturizer, just be sure not to over do it on the amount because it you use too much of it, it may start peeling. However, this has not been a major problem and I believe the amount I use is enough to moisturize and provide SPF protection.</li>
            <li> I love this day cream, it&#x27;s not oily and is essential to be safe when you&#x27;ll be in the sun.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on nice and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like other moisturizers. I love that its organic so I&#x27;m not putting chemicals onto my skin.</li>
            <li> Upon applying cream makes skin peel off repeatedly throughout the day does have a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> i like this product, but i think the item is a little older or the seal was not on tight?  the rim the product and the top part of the moisturizer was delivered a little brown.  it was no biggy for me since i really don&#x27;t care about it that much, i just swept of the top portion of the brown part and used what looked ok to use on my skin.  BUT for those who are all about getting the items right the first time, then i would probably find another seller.  i really do love this product, been using it for years eversince my salon introduced it to me.  it has spf.  my skin gets oily esp during the summertime, but this item is light and it comes out matted looking.  i can go all day without my skin looking oily.</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed that this \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; does not seem to moisturize at all.  I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because of the sunscreen products it contains.  My skin feels tight and dry within a few minutes of applying it.  Then I have to add a coating of regular moisturizer over it to rehydrate my face.  Rather disappointing for the price.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it otherwise, no breakouts or sun damage.  So at least there&#x27;s that...</li>
            <li> I got allergies from it contact the place where I got it from and they would give me just half of my money back!! It&#x27;s a joke! Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> Eminence products are fantastic. And what makes them even better is that they all natural and organic.  Simply the best.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This is a great moisturizer and sunblock. Makes my skin soft and does not irritate my skin. Normally sunblocks make me break out, but the Eminence Persimmon &amp; Cantaloupe Day Cream SPF 32 has left my skin calm and clear. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had the chance the try it!  Twice now I&#x27;ve received the product with the seal broken, discolored cream on the surface and cream dried up on top of the seal.  Unacceptable for a product at this price!  There is a a warning on the jar stating that you should not use if seal is broken.</li>
            <li> My facialist recommended Eminence and I have been using it ever since. This day day cream is light, non-greasy and smells amazing. I highly recommend any product by Eminence.</li>
            <li> Others have suggested it is drying.  I usually apply it on top of the guava bamboo moisturizer which seems to work well.  Pretty expensive to use that way though</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cream. I like it that it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or shiny like other sunscreen. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that if you put too much on your face and rub it into your face, it creates this white blotchy thing that you need to brush off.</li>
            <li> I give it a one star because of how i received the product. I can&#x27;t necessarily rate the product it because i didn&#x27;t try it. This was my first time ordering it and I got it in the mail within the scheduled time in a great packaging but when I opened the box the printed seal under the cap was broken. All broken, i&#x27;m talking about the whole seal detached from the bottle. It actually looked used. So disappointing and frustrating.</li>
            <li> I got a very good price for this. It works very well and my skin loves it! It does have a little bit of a gritty texture, though. Use something stronger if you plan on being out in the direct sunlight for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for couple of month now and absolutely love it. It smells nice, makes the skin soft while leaving my face shine free.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used! It has been more than two years that I use this. It was first recommended by my facial lady but then I found it cheaper on Amazon. I have a combination skin tone and large pores in Tzone. It helps a lot to control the oil and gives me a matte finish look (no Lancome or anything has done that for me). I simply do not need any powder or anything after wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I think the tea tree oil ingredient helps a lot with oil. Hope Eminence can keep this great quality!</li>
            <li> I love this brand. Eminence is my favorite face products. All organic and great for your skin. I haven&#x27;t had any break outs for the entire time I&#x27;ve used Eminence. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am acne prone but am in my 30s.  While this is not my SPF lotion of choice for winter, it&#x27;s the perfect weight for summer if I am also using a serum of some kind.  Were I younger, it would be absolutely perfect without anything more.  The scent is also divine.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (often dry, yet I still break out mildly), and this is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Expensive but will last me several months, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.  My face feels soft, hydrated, clean, fresh, and smooth.  I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s an exfoliating agent in here but it feels like there is.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hate using very heavy products that feel caked on my face, but wanted a strong SPF. This one is perfect! It smells great, and it feels very light when I put it on.</li>
            <li> not much else to say for this but that it feels and smells amazing on my skin.  I love love love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other &#x27;flavors&#x27; of their SPF cream before this, I love the tomato one but it makes my eyes water (I still used it up, just kept it away from my eyes).  The smell is lovely, and not strong, and no issue at all put it right on my eye area.</li>
            <li> I did not see any bad side effects with this creme. It did not irritate my skin. I think it may have helped decrease the mild redness I tend to have. I think it works okay as an SPF. However, for the price, (I bought it at a spa in Kauai), I expect to see more anti-aging ingredients. Also, I am not sure it hydrates all that well. My face feels dry later in the day after applying. This surprises me since the texture feels very creamy.  I also do not notice any plumping, lifting or decreasing of any fine lines after using. As I said, my skin still feels very dry after applying. This creme may fit the bill if you are looking for an SPF that will not irritate your skin. If you are looking for any other benefits, I would look for a different creme.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products.  The key to these products is to mix them with water--even the moisturizers with sunscreen.  They are highly concentrated, which is why they seem pricey.  My skin has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Eminence--the fact that their products are 100% organic has done wonders for my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year.  I like this lotion--it&#x27;s helped control my oily skin which I tend to get in the summer.  Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly as regular lotion (I read this is due to the SPF), so I recommend emulsifying it with a few drops of water.  It&#x27;ll go on evenly once you do so.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from bluemercury  and thought I liked it.  I didn&#x27;t. I was wrong.  The aroma is cloying and has an off-scent that&#x27;s impossible to describe.  Let&#x27;s just say that it was unpleasant.  The texture was tacky and did not easily smooth onto my face.  It was expensive and since I didn&#x27;t want to toss it, I used it as a moisturizer for my feet (yup) and even they complained.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I received this and it was old - the top was dried out and it is not the quality it should be - incredibly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am happy with my skin after using this product.  I purchased Eminence Persimmon &amp; Cantaloupe Day Cream one year ago after having a spa facial.  It soothes my skin and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or major blemishes since I started using it.  I would give it 5 stars except for the price.  You can make it last by using on a damp face and only using a pea-sized drop.  The consistency is thick and creamy. It smells very nice and dries with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> I received a sample sized portion of this product from a spa I&#x27;ve recently visited, and the product was \\&quot;alright\\&quot;. It did its&#x27; job which was to moisturize but it broke me out! Not terribly, just a few little ones here and there. I have sensitive combination skin, and on the plus side it did not upset the sensitive aspect of my skin, but rather made the oily part of my skin a little more oilier than usual. This product is pretty expensive and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the investment. Maybe it works better for others.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so dry after using this.  It has consistency of a store brand body sunblock rather than a face cream.</li>
            <li> This product was pasty and old</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and is a very light moisturizer. I like having SPF but the ingredients for it make it less moisturizing than the other lotions I&#x27;ve gotten from Eminence. My skin is combination, and tends to be very dry right after washing and then very oily by evening. It doesn&#x27;t feel quite moisturizing enough right away, but it does just enough to prevent my face from being oily later. If you have oily skin, it is great.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this spf miosturizer. It is light like everyone says, but on a hot day I feel it start to sweat off a little and the spf wears off. My face has gotten a little tanner with regular use of this, so I&#x27;ve had to add a powder with spf on top. If you don&#x27;t sweat too much, this should be perfect for you. The reason why I gave it 5 stars is because of how my skin looks and feels immediately after application. It&#x27;s so soft, not shiny, and deeply moisturized. This is why I love it. Before this I was using the clear skin moisturizer and thought I was going to miss it, but after seeing the results Im not sure I&#x27;ll go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real EMINENCE, think its a knock-off.  Spend more money &amp; go with the guarantee elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I love the aroma and the texture.  Feels great on my face. Keeps my skin hydrated and soft. Still haven&#x27;t seen any less wrinkles but at least the ones that I have aren&#x27;t worsening.</li>
            <li> Love it, great for my skin type, not greasy but improves texture and discolorations.</li>
