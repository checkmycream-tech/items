            <li>(see \\&quot;Flawless face case\\&quot; under \\&quot;health and personal care\\&quot; here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>I tend to go through the mineral veil the quickest so this big container is a great value!</li>
            <li>It is on top of pictures in my bathroom, it got in the vents and had to be cleaned out, it gets on the basebaords.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 2 years.   </li>
            <li>What I most like about it is it controls oil on my skin as well as moisturizing it.   </li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>Provides a nice light finish over powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>invisible and light!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it and am so grateful we now have choices when it comes to skin care.</li>
            <li>I always made sure to wait hours before applying the powder foundation after my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works better</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love mineral veil.</li>
            <li>I have used many products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mineral veil for many years</li>
            <li>and I normally love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have been using it for acouple of years now and to get this size so cheap is amazing and the shipping was superfast</li>
            <li>It not only resolves those issues, but it makes my skin appear flawless..</li>
            <li>Very excited to start using these products.</li>
            <li>It is so delightfully light in texture, yet great coverage for imperfections, goes on like silk, wonderful lasting finish with face ready for blushes and bronzes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>I can see a great difference between this and my old makeup!</li>
            <li>i had already fallen in love with bare minerals, but the product was exactly as reported and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good size.</li>
            <li>This is SUCH a good product!</li>
            <li>It is easy once you practice.  </li>
            <li>Also, the ingredients are all natural and good for healthy skin.   </li>
            <li>I have used this powder before, and I was delighted to get my new in the mail.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I always go through this fast, so I was happy to see the price much lower than department stores charge!</li>
            <li>It is light weight, and covers easily.  </li>
            <li>she now wants me to buy her more!</li>
            <li>so this is a huge issue for me.  </li>
            <li>but now it is just light and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT GIVES YOU AN ALL OVER SMOOTH FINISH THAT LASTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.</li>
            <li>I have been using this light weight product to use over my foundation &amp; blush.  </li>
            <li>Thank&#x27;s so much for providing this amazing product..</li>
            <li>the product is light and holds the shine for me until the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and the price was great as its much bigger than I get when i buy it from the website</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>I paid about $100 and got the whole starter kit plus some Buxom lip gloss (which is awesome) and some Eye Rev-ver Upper.</li>
            <li>This was my 1st Bare Mineral purchase &amp; I love, love LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Light or full.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to use the Mineral Veil over the Bare Minerals Foundation.  </li>
            <li>Not a single qualm about the product, but if some of these deals on Amazon seem too good to be true, there&#x27;s reason to practice caution.</li>
            <li>Best think bare minerals makes next to their foundation.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the better my skin is in general.</li>
            <li>No mention was made about the size, but since it was \\&quot;reduced\\&quot; from $18 retail (full size price), I ordered it.</li>
            <li>For just a couple dollars more, you can get the real product...</li>
            <li>Get a good brush, and before applying, tap the extra powder off and buff it on.</li>
            <li>I throw on a good primer lotion, dust this on my face, and watch my skin instantly glow.</li>
            <li>I have mild Rosecea.  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal Amazon customer</li>
            <li>A nice finishing touch after you use Bare Minerals foundation.  </li>
            <li>The minerals were very clumpy and would not spread evenly or easily on my face.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I got the mineral veil and bleah!  </li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>They carry so many products that bring out various features on the face that it&#x27;s better to deal with the basics first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, but it really evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy, it lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked this brand for several years now.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who rarely wears any makeup</li>
            <li>It also helps when I need extra coverage, to cover a sunburn or any kind of redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes practice, but it is totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It was chalky and did not get absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I know, kind of gross, but we all have oily skin sometimes.</li>
            <li>Super satisfied with the Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li>now i only buy online due to the great price!</li>
            <li>I love bare minerals!</li>
            <li>IT IS A VERY LARGE CONTAINER.  </li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite Bare Minerals product.  </li>
            <li>I love all my Bare Minerals, but there is nothing like mineral veil.  </li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals and how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and was in the 8oz.</li>
            <li>I was a little bit worried since the price was so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time</li>
            <li>BareMinerals user and I just received my shipment..so fast!</li>
            <li>and you can trust better what might actually be in the product that your skin will be absorbing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it is really made by bare minerals.</li>
            <li>but my face looks so much better if I take the 30 seconds to do this final step.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with Bare Esentuals directly before and love the products, i thought i was getting a tremendous deal....</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast,&amp; the entire process was hassle free.</li>
            <li>Im a huge fan of bare minerals!</li>
            <li>but it is exactly as advertised and was delivered in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use very much of this but lightly brush on enough to set and blend your look.</li>
            <li>Bare minerals is still by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The container I have has a definite strong, mildewy odor to it, like a tent that has been put away damp.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals foundation for years, so I am familiar with it&#x27;s limitations regarding lotions and the like.  </li>
            <li>Love bare minerals and it has made my face better because it has no harsh chemicals in it like other make up does.</li>
            <li>This is very sheer, light and oil-absorbing.</li>
            <li>I really like that my skin has cleared up alot</li>
            <li>It use to look really cakey with liquid foundation</li>
            <li>The powder is also very clumpy, and now that I think about it</li>
            <li>WHO KNOWS what you are REALLY putting on your face with this product.</li>
            <li>Makes skin appear very chalky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to use this product properly.</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY oily.</li>
            <li>It works very well - blends in with my complexion color.</li>
            <li>This is important as Bare Escentuals adds various chemicals to their original product line whereas no chemicals are added to their Bare Minerals product line.  </li>
            <li>Bare minerals are okay, but not very natural looking...</li>
            <li>I will most definatly be back when I start to run low.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading the fine print carefully.</li>
            <li>The mineral veil topper powder really makes my skin look naturally even in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very freckly with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>At first I tried my Bare Minerals makeup just w/ the powder, it looked kinda cakey</li>
            <li>The product I received is either defective or expired because it was nothing like the normal Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>What I found helps is to use my hands to smooth it on the skin after I&#x27;ve brushed it on; then it leaves a somewhat air brushed look without looking like a powdered up face.</li>
            <li>I wish I still had a receipt, I would ask for a replacement jar and see if it was any better.  :\</li>
            <li>Looks very natural &amp; not heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li>WOW  </li>
            <li>It takes away all shine, makes my pores invisible, literally makes it look like my natural skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be 50 soon and most people think I am in my late 30&#x27;s because of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it three times so far and have had to wash my face and start over with my makeup each time because of this.</li>
            <li>or I got an old batch or what.</li>
            <li>The picture associated with this item clearly says \\&quot;Bare Minerals\\&quot; on the item</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I used Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>Again, this is because they sent me Bare Escentuals instead of Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>Mineral veil instantly gives my face a \\&quot;soft focus\\&quot; look...very flattering on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals products for over 8 years and would never consider using anything else.  </li>
            <li>Mineral veil is meant as a topper coat over the bare Escentuals foundation powder.  </li>
            <li>i had used bare escentuals mineral veil for years...and can&#x27;t imagine switching to something else since discovering it at the retail store.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s so finely milled</li>
            <li>The only thing is, if you are going to use bare minerals, get a swiffer duster because it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li>I got this jar of mineral veil from a hospital gift shop, the only place in town that sells Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>I went to Bare Escentuals store and bought the same type jar there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare esentuals, and I finally decided to do it.  </li>

            <li> I love this product I have been using it for acouple of years now and to get this size so cheap is amazing and the shipping was superfast</li>
            <li> It not only resolves those issues, but it makes my skin appear flawless..</li>
            <li> Very excited to start using these products.</li>
            <li> It is so delightfully light in texture, yet great coverage for imperfections, goes on like silk, wonderful lasting finish with face ready for blushes and bronzes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> I can see a great difference between this and my old makeup!</li>
            <li> i had already fallen in love with bare minerals, but the product was exactly as reported and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good size.</li>
            <li> This is SUCH a good product!</li>
            <li> It is easy once you practice.  </li>
            <li> Also, the ingredients are all natural and good for healthy skin.   </li>
            <li> I have used this powder before, and I was delighted to get my new in the mail.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I always go through this fast, so I was happy to see the price much lower than department stores charge!</li>
            <li> It is light weight, and covers easily.  </li>
            <li> she now wants me to buy her more!</li>
            <li> so this is a huge issue for me.  </li>
            <li> but now it is just light and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT GIVES YOU AN ALL OVER SMOOTH FINISH THAT LASTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.</li>
            <li> I have been using this light weight product to use over my foundation &amp; blush.  </li>
            <li> Thank&#x27;s so much for providing this amazing product..</li>
            <li> the product is light and holds the shine for me until the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and the price was great as its much bigger than I get when i buy it from the website</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> I paid about $100 and got the whole starter kit plus some Buxom lip gloss (which is awesome) and some Eye Rev-ver Upper.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st Bare Mineral purchase &amp; I love, love LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Light or full.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to use the Mineral Veil over the Bare Minerals Foundation.  </li>
            <li> Not a single qualm about the product, but if some of these deals on Amazon seem too good to be true, there&#x27;s reason to practice caution.</li>
            <li> Best think bare minerals makes next to their foundation.</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the better my skin is in general.</li>
            <li> No mention was made about the size, but since it was \\&quot;reduced\\&quot; from $18 retail (full size price), I ordered it.</li>
            <li> For just a couple dollars more, you can get the real product...</li>
            <li> Get a good brush, and before applying, tap the extra powder off and buff it on.</li>
            <li> I throw on a good primer lotion, dust this on my face, and watch my skin instantly glow.</li>
            <li> I have mild Rosecea.  </li>
            <li> I am a loyal Amazon customer</li>
            <li> A nice finishing touch after you use Bare Minerals foundation.  </li>
            <li> The minerals were very clumpy and would not spread evenly or easily on my face.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I got the mineral veil and bleah!  </li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> They carry so many products that bring out various features on the face that it&#x27;s better to deal with the basics first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, but it really evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy, it lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this brand for several years now.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who rarely wears any makeup</li>
            <li> It also helps when I need extra coverage, to cover a sunburn or any kind of redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes practice, but it is totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It was chalky and did not get absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I know, kind of gross, but we all have oily skin sometimes.</li>
            <li> Super satisfied with the Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li> now i only buy online due to the great price!</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals!</li>
            <li> IT IS A VERY LARGE CONTAINER.  </li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite Bare Minerals product.  </li>
            <li> I love all my Bare Minerals, but there is nothing like mineral veil.  </li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals and how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> It came very fast and was in the 8oz.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried since the price was so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time</li>
            <li> BareMinerals user and I just received my shipment..so fast!</li>
            <li> and you can trust better what might actually be in the product that your skin will be absorbing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure it is really made by bare minerals.</li>
            <li> but my face looks so much better if I take the 30 seconds to do this final step.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with Bare Esentuals directly before and love the products, i thought i was getting a tremendous deal....</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast,&amp; the entire process was hassle free.</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of bare minerals!</li>
            <li> but it is exactly as advertised and was delivered in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use very much of this but lightly brush on enough to set and blend your look.</li>
            <li> Bare minerals is still by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The container I have has a definite strong, mildewy odor to it, like a tent that has been put away damp.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals foundation for years, so I am familiar with it&#x27;s limitations regarding lotions and the like.  </li>
            <li> Love bare minerals and it has made my face better because it has no harsh chemicals in it like other make up does.</li>
            <li> This is very sheer, light and oil-absorbing.</li>
            <li> I really like that my skin has cleared up alot</li>
            <li> It use to look really cakey with liquid foundation</li>
            <li> The powder is also very clumpy, and now that I think about it</li>
            <li> WHO KNOWS what you are REALLY putting on your face with this product.</li>
            <li> Makes skin appear very chalky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to use this product properly.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY oily.</li>
            <li> It works very well - blends in with my complexion color.</li>
            <li> This is important as Bare Escentuals adds various chemicals to their original product line whereas no chemicals are added to their Bare Minerals product line.  </li>
            <li> Bare minerals are okay, but not very natural looking...</li>
            <li> I will most definatly be back when I start to run low.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the fine print carefully.</li>
            <li> The mineral veil topper powder really makes my skin look naturally even in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very freckly with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At first I tried my Bare Minerals makeup just w/ the powder, it looked kinda cakey</li>
            <li> The product I received is either defective or expired because it was nothing like the normal Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> What I found helps is to use my hands to smooth it on the skin after I&#x27;ve brushed it on; then it leaves a somewhat air brushed look without looking like a powdered up face.</li>
            <li> I wish I still had a receipt, I would ask for a replacement jar and see if it was any better.  :\</li>
            <li> Looks very natural &amp; not heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li> WOW  </li>
            <li> It takes away all shine, makes my pores invisible, literally makes it look like my natural skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 50 soon and most people think I am in my late 30&#x27;s because of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it three times so far and have had to wash my face and start over with my makeup each time because of this.</li>
            <li> or I got an old batch or what.</li>
            <li> The picture associated with this item clearly says \\&quot;Bare Minerals\\&quot; on the item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I used Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> Again, this is because they sent me Bare Escentuals instead of Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> Mineral veil instantly gives my face a \\&quot;soft focus\\&quot; look...very flattering on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals products for over 8 years and would never consider using anything else.  </li>
            <li> Mineral veil is meant as a topper coat over the bare Escentuals foundation powder.  </li>
            <li> i had used bare escentuals mineral veil for years...and can&#x27;t imagine switching to something else since discovering it at the retail store.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s so finely milled</li>
            <li> The only thing is, if you are going to use bare minerals, get a swiffer duster because it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> I got this jar of mineral veil from a hospital gift shop, the only place in town that sells Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li> I went to Bare Escentuals store and bought the same type jar there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare esentuals, and I finally decided to do it.  </li>
            <li> ; They have selected certain letters and words that look alike in such small print.</li>
            <li> It covers without looking heavy or making one look older.  </li>
            <li> 5.99 - i thought shipping of 7.99 was ridiculous and in the future will deal directly with bare escentuals!</li>
            <li> I resumed my usual skin care regimen and went back to my old make-up.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Bare Minerals Mineral Veil and I received two small sample size containers of Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t bother with the other choices.</li>
            <li> I decided to try bare minerals a few months ago, and bought the beginner set since it came with the brushes.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Bare Escentuals products for a few years.  </li>
            <li> After less than a week of use, my skin was covered with tiny pimples (some of which turned cystic.)</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This item is NOT real.</li>
            <li> I use their bisque concealer OVER my bare minerals foundation then the mineral veil and a little of the warmth poweder for a little natural-looking color.</li>
            <li> It came 2 weeks later in a small envelope.  </li>
            <li> This helps my other makeup stay in place as well as control shine.</li>
            <li> It lasts me all day with no touch-ups which I&#x27;ve never found with other products.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much of it and don&#x27;t buff it, it can look weird.</li>
            <li> The foundation and veil are enough, at least for me.</li>
            <li> compacts and other powders made it worse and got gross after being used even once!).</li>
            <li> so you cannot apply in the car without a little mess.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong though it could just be very old.</li>
            <li> I am a little freaked out about having used it on my face.  </li>
            <li> Less breakouts, less makeup needed, happier girl!</li>
            <li> Combine it with a little bit of their blush, add some mascara</li>
            <li> Before I found this product, I had to dab my face a few times a day (</li>
            <li> About me: Pale, just turned 21 couple weeks ago, acne-prone skin, pores, green undertone.</li>
            <li> I came to read the reviews to see if anyone else had a complaint about the smell, but I don&#x27;t see any other mentions of it.  </li>
            <li> It gets on your clothes pretty bad</li>
            <li> I hate to waste $35 worth of powders</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> so I usually know what to expect from a product.</li>
            <li> But this past time I ordered it, it was not the usual quality I am used to.</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;greasy\\</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;faded\\&quot; make up.</li>
            <li> So, this particular one is bad.</li>
            <li> , you can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> Alas, what arrived was .14 oz small travel size Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> It provides a base for mascara as well as a base for eye shadow or on its own it finishes any veins or flaws on the eye lid.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty disgusting.</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow and expensive for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but learned my lesson: be very careful with some of these prices and sellers.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with the box to indicate it had been exposed to moisture, and the adhesive seal was intact on the sifter when I opened it up at home.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if my batch has gone bad perhaps.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a bad knock off.  </li>
            <li> (this product was CRAP...</li>
            <li> and my skin is still horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this brand for several years now. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s so finely milled it goes all over, even though I use it sparingly. What I found helps is to use my hands to smooth it on the skin after I&#x27;ve brushed it on; then it leaves a somewhat air brushed look without looking like a powdered up face.</li>
            <li> This is very sheer, light and oil-absorbing. I have oily skin and I carry this with me in the BE compact (see \\&quot;Flawless face case\\&quot; under \\&quot;health and personal care\\&quot; here on Amazon). It works immediately and practically invisibly to get shine under control and I&#x27;ve never had the experience of it getting cakey or looking like I&#x27;ve got layers on or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;BE has a hydrating min veil for dryer skin types. They also have tinted min veil and illuminating min veil - haven&#x27;t tried these yet. ( :</li>
            <li> Super satisfied with the Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  Fast shipping, great product!  Will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> LIKE I SAID I NEVER RECIED THIS PRODUCT SO I CANT WRITE A REVEIW ON SOMETHING I NEVER  GOT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY ORDER</li>
            <li> I paid about $100 and got the whole starter kit plus some Buxom lip gloss (which is awesome) and some Eye Rev-ver Upper. This make-up is garbage (the gloss being the exception.) After less than a week of use, my skin was covered with tiny pimples (some of which turned cystic.) I resumed my usual skin care regimen and went back to my old make-up. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I used Bare Minerals and my skin is still horrible. I have pimples in places I have never had pimples in my life (and I used to have acne.) I have tiny pimples under my eyes and all over my upper lip and jaw line. Unbelievable. Total waste of money. I&#x27;m actually going to have to purchase products to counteract the effects this has had on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the mineral veil, its the finishing touch for an awesome product.  I tend to go through the mineral veil the quickest so this big container is a great value!</li>
            <li> Keeps my oily skin at bay without looking like a have a ton of makeup on.</li>
            <li> This make-up is wonderful! I really like that my skin has cleared up alot, my skin looks flawless and has a glow to it now. It use to look really cakey with liquid foundation but now it is just light and doesn&#x27;t smudge. The only thing is, if you are going to use bare minerals, get a swiffer duster because it gets everywhere. It is on top of pictures in my bathroom, it got in the vents and had to be cleaned out, it gets on the basebaords. It just carries in the air and settles all over the place. It gets on your clothes pretty bad so you cannot apply in the car without a little mess. But the switch off is worth it for great looking skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good size.</li>
            <li> Product was what I wanted and ordered.. I always wear this Make-up.. It is cheaper on Amazon then in the store, so I will buy again... Make sure you have a good brush for the foundation and the veil.. I love this make-up!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I was glad to get it at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love this product. After using the foundation it sets your makeup in place. Looks very natural &amp; not heavy. It is great on an oily complexion. Doesn&#x27;t cause break outs either.</li>
            <li> I wonder if my batch has gone bad perhaps.  I came to read the reviews to see if anyone else had a complaint about the smell, but I don&#x27;t see any other mentions of it.  The container I have has a definite strong, mildewy odor to it, like a tent that has been put away damp.  The powder is also very clumpy, and now that I think about it I am a little freaked out about having used it on my face.  What if there were critters growing in it?  I got this jar of mineral veil from a hospital gift shop, the only place in town that sells Bare Escentuals.  I have been getting foundation and eyeshadows from them for years but this is the first time I got the mineral veil and bleah!  There was nothing wrong with the box to indicate it had been exposed to moisture, and the adhesive seal was intact on the sifter when I opened it up at home.  Leaky roof at the factory maybe?  Actually, I think I will just throw this out.  I hate to waste $35 worth of powders but I am concerned that I might be putting contaminated stuff on my face.  I wish I still had a receipt, I would ask for a replacement jar and see if it was any better.  :\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 2 years.   What I most like about it is it controls oil on my skin as well as moisturizing it.   Also, the ingredients are all natural and good for healthy skin.   I make toner, lotion, and cream for myself at home, and what I purchase for my skin is only this.   Try it!!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. Provides a nice light finish over powder foundation.  It is essential part of my makeup routine each day.  Great Quality Makeup.</li>
            <li> Not a single qualm about the product, but if some of these deals on Amazon seem too good to be true, there&#x27;s reason to practice caution. I purchased this after reading the fine print carefully. No mention was made about the size, but since it was \\&quot;reduced\\&quot; from $18 retail (full size price), I ordered it. Alas, what arrived was .14 oz small travel size Mineral Veil. I was disappointed, but learned my lesson: be very careful with some of these prices and sellers. Won&#x27;t be fooled again.</li>
            <li> The item I received is not the product I ordered.  I ordered Bare Minerals Mineral Veil and I received two small sample size containers of Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil.  The picture associated with this item clearly says \\&quot;Bare Minerals\\&quot; on the item yet that&#x27;s not what it is.  This is important as Bare Escentuals adds various chemicals to their original product line whereas no chemicals are added to their Bare Minerals product line.  I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to chemicals so this is a huge issue for me.  Also, the ingredients this seller lists for the product are different than the ingredients listed on the product I received (the one I received having chemicals included in the product list).  Again, this is because they sent me Bare Escentuals instead of Bare Minerals.  Very frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product I use mainly for shine control! The best out there! invisible and light!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use a concealer as foundation and then polish off the face with the Mineral Veil.  It covers without looking heavy or making one look older.  I love it and am so grateful we now have choices when it comes to skin care.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect finish.  It provides an air brushed look.  I like to brush it over my lashes and eyelids.  It provides a base for mascara as well as a base for eye shadow or on its own it finishes any veins or flaws on the eye lid.  I have a friend who rarely wears any makeup and she uses mineral veil as foundation when she uses anything.  Don&#x27;t use very much of this but lightly brush on enough to set and blend your look.</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for 2 years.  It is easy once you practice.  Great coverage and makes my blotchy complection look smooth and lovely. Prices on the net are cheaper than the stores.The coverage is up to you. Light or full.  Lots of color choices.  The best I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time BareMinerals user and I just received my shipment..so fast! Very excited to start using these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals foundation for years, so I am familiar with it&#x27;s limitations regarding lotions and the like.  I always made sure to wait hours before applying the powder foundation after my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Mineral Veil.  It absorbs any excess oil, so I can apply my foundation immediately!  It also helps when I need extra coverage, to cover a sunburn or any kind of redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you follow the SWIRL, TAP and BUFF instructions closely, or you will not be happy with your results.  It takes practice, but it is totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Best think bare minerals makes next to their foundation. It just smoothes out the whole appearance of your face and gives you a flawless look to your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Takes away all the shine, and even outs the makeup finish.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil was perfect, price was fantastic and the speedy delivery was amazing.  I would shop with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This item is NOT real. There are NUMEROUS typos on the ingredients label (photo attached). It actually indicates ingredients to be &amp;#34;CORM STARCN&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;GORN STARCH.&amp;#34; INGREDIENTS is spelled &amp;#34;INGREOIENTS&amp;#34; and MODIFIERS is spelled &amp;#34;MOODIFIERS.&amp;#34; Escentuals is even misspelled to &amp;#34;Escentuels.&amp;#34; They have selected certain letters and words that look alike in such small print. WHO KNOWS what you are REALLY putting on your face with this product. They are trying to DECEIVE and trick customers. For just a couple dollars more, you can get the real product...it works better (this product was CRAP...like putting baking flour on your face) and you can trust better what might actually be in the product that your skin will be absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE FROM BEAUTY_SHOP!!!</li>
            <li> Not what was pictured.  I&#x27;m not even sure it is really made by bare minerals. Makes skin appear very chalky.  Seems like a bad knock off.  I could be wrong though it could just be very old.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for years and I like it.  I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> I decided to try bare minerals a few months ago, and bought the beginner set since it came with the brushes.     Bare minerals are okay, but not very natural looking...you end up looking orange at the end of the day.     But anywho, for this mineral veil thing, I put it on, but nothing happens...It does nothing.     About me: Pale, just turned 21 couple weeks ago, acne-prone skin, pores, green undertone.</li>
            <li> At first I tried my Bare Minerals makeup just w/ the powder, it looked kinda cakey and I couldn&#x27;t understand what all the fuss was about, then I added this to my regimen.  WOW  It takes away all shine, makes my pores invisible, literally makes it look like my natural skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love mineral veil. I use their bisque concealer OVER my bare minerals foundation then the mineral veil and a little of the warmth poweder for a little natural-looking color. Im a huge fan of bare minerals! Mineral veil instantly gives my face a \\&quot;soft focus\\&quot; look...very flattering on the skin.</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow and expensive for my taste.  It came 2 weeks later in a small envelope.  I&#x27;ll probably go with another vendor next time.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT DEAL ON THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS A VERY LARGE CONTAINER.  THE PRODUCT GIVES YOU AN ALL OVER SMOOTH FINISH THAT LASTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.</li>
            <li> i had already fallen in love with bare minerals, but the product was exactly as reported and in perfect condition.  shipping was great! thanks!!</li>
            <li> I have mild Rosecea.  I love bareMinerals makeup!  It is sufficient to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She requested it as a gift because she uses it...she now wants me to buy her more! It must be good.</li>
            <li> it took me a week to get use to the powder(i&#x27;v always used liquid)but when i did it&#x27;s faster and easier than liquid. i have relativly good skin so i get great coverage. but it would supprise me if this stuff could cover acne... deffinatly corth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals products for over 8 years and would never consider using anything else.  I&#x27;ll be 50 soon and most people think I am in my late 30&#x27;s because of my skin. All their products rock!</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful fast service.  Amazon is the best place to buy everything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It is cheaper to buy it here even with the shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to use this product properly. Get a good brush, and before applying, tap the extra powder off and buff it on. If you apply too much of it and don&#x27;t buff it, it can look weird. Mineral veil is meant as a topper coat over the bare Escentuals foundation powder.  The mineral veil topper powder really makes my skin look naturally even in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do sometimes wear the foundation powder without mineral veil but my face looks so much better if I take the 30 seconds to do this final step.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY oily. Before I found this product, I had to dab my face a few times a day (compacts and other powders made it worse and got gross after being used even once!). This helps my other makeup stay in place as well as control shine. The more I use it, the better my skin is in general. Less breakouts, less makeup needed, happier girl!</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals! It does not come off when you sweat &amp; is not cakey. The mineral veil is awesome, after a days work, if I am going somewhere I just add some mineral veil &amp; my make up looks as thought I just put it on!</li>
            <li> A nice finishing touch after you use Bare Minerals foundation.  Keeps everything in place and is great to travel with, too, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or spilling.</li>
            <li> I always do a lot of research before I make a purchase so I usually know what to expect from a product. However, with that being said, Amazon has always met or exceeded my expectations on competitive pricing and prompt delivery. I am a loyal Amazon customer</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> Happy to have been able to purchase it on-line. Great product. Great Service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used many products. Bare minerals is still by far my favorite. It has great coverage yet light and the color works great with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with Bare Esentuals directly before and love the products, i thought i was getting a tremendous deal....5.99 - i thought shipping of 7.99 was ridiculous and in the future will deal directly with bare escentuals!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mineral veil for many years and I normally love it. But this past time I ordered it, it was not the usual quality I am used to. The minerals were very clumpy and would not spread evenly or easily on my face. I basically look like a ghost when I put it on, which has never happened before. I have used it three times so far and have had to wash my face and start over with my makeup each time because of this. Normally this product goes on very easily and gives me a great finish on my face and helps control oil. I don&#x27;t know if they changed their formula or I got an old batch or what. Beware before buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this light weight product to use over my foundation &amp; blush.  It works very well - blends in with my complexion color.</li>
            <li> I  have been using Mineral Veil for years. The product I received is either defective or expired because it was nothing like the normal Mineral Veil. It was chalky and did not get absorbed into the skin. It was pretty disgusting. Had to wash face off. I went to Bare Escentuals store and bought the same type jar there and it was fine. So, this particular one is bad. I just looked at reviews and noticed it has happened to someone else so I dont know what is going on with this vendor.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and as promised.  Only have to use a very tiny amount for coverage so it lasts a really long time.  Nice!</li>
            <li> Same as sephora. Great price. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I love it and very satisfied, i will be buying more!</li>
            <li> This product came just as described. I always go through this fast, so I was happy to see the price much lower than department stores charge! The mineral veil gives great coverage even on its own and it gives a great finish over the BareMinerals Foundation for going out. It lasts me all day with no touch-ups which I&#x27;ve never found with other products. It came very fast and was in the 8oz. size. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product I have been using it for acouple of years now and to get this size so cheap is amazing and the shipping was superfast</li>
            <li> This was my 1st Bare Mineral purchase &amp; I love, love LOVE it. It&#x27;s amazing!! I use it to set my makeup once I have finished it, and that&#x27;s it. No more \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; noon face. No more \\&quot;faded\\&quot; make up. It not only resolves those issues, but it makes my skin appear flawless..(even when it&#x27;s not) I had questions that were answered quickly,&amp; kindly from this seller. I will most definatly be back when I start to run low. Delivery was super fast,&amp; the entire process was hassle free. Thank&#x27;s so much for providing this amazing product..</li>
            <li> Gotta have my Mineral Veil!  I use it to set all of my foundation makeup. It is light weight, and covers easily.  I would recommend it to everyone who uses foundation makeup.</li>
            <li> i had used bare escentuals mineral veil for years...and can&#x27;t imagine switching to something else since discovering it at the retail store.  the product is light and holds the shine for me until the end of the day.  now i only buy online due to the great price!</li>
            <li> This is SUCH a good product! I am very freckly with extremely sensitive skin. I throw on a good primer lotion, dust this on my face, and watch my skin instantly glow. It&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, but it really evens out my skin tone. Combine it with a little bit of their blush, add some mascara and I&#x27;m out the door. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This product refracts light on my age spots!!!  It helps the rest of the coverup process be at a minimum.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite Bare Minerals product.  I love all my Bare Minerals, but there is nothing like mineral veil.  It feels great on and helps soften the look of my skin.  Great price and service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love bare minerals and it has made my face better because it has no harsh chemicals in it like other make up does.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals and how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I know, kind of gross, but we all have oily skin sometimes. and this will mask that. It&#x27;s great whether you are wearing make-up or not. I use to all the time, but now I don&#x27;t and it works just the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Bare Escentuals products for a few years.  Couldn&#x27;t do without Mineral Veil for a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the price was great as its much bigger than I get when i buy it from the website so I&#x27;m happy, it lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li> my daughter just loves this make up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare esentuals, and I finally decided to do it.  It goes on so smooth, you can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  I can see a great difference between this and my old makeup!</li>
            <li> I have used this powder before, and I was delighted to get my new in the mail.  It is so delightfully light in texture, yet great coverage for imperfections, goes on like silk, wonderful lasting finish with face ready for blushes and bronzes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I  prefer this to any powder out there on the market now.</li>
            <li> It works for me except on the Miami daylight humid days. My face gets oily with any makeup.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy with this product.  I was a little bit worried since the price was so good but it is exactly as advertised and was delivered in a very timely manner.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to use the Mineral Veil over the Bare Minerals Foundation.  They carry so many products that bring out various features on the face that it&#x27;s better to deal with the basics first.  Personally, I don&#x27;t bother with the other choices. The foundation and veil are enough, at least for me.</li>
