    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for at home use!</li>
            <li>it is very good for elderly people that can&#x27;t make it to the beauty shop</li>
            <li>It works great drains</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable feels like your at the salon for a great price</li>
            <li>Good item it serves it´s purpose wel.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes apart very easily to store in the linen closet.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to assemble and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>The neck rest on the bowl still isn&#x27;t the most comfortable, but for the price it is a really good deal.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very cheap plastic</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo bowl</li>
            <li>but I put a extension on it and it works better</li>
            <li>and so I have to use a bucket but its ok to use</li>
            <li>Better than leaning over the sink to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>However I have found it was a bit challenging.</li>
            <li>I would recommend make sure you have a bucket to dispose of the water.</li>
            <li>light weight great for travel or in small spaces i use mine in my rv a mobile salon perfect to store out of the way when not in use.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an easy way of shampooing and perming my invalid patient , this has worked well.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, and easy to move around.</li>
            <li>I purchased in hopes it would be easy to use during my house call visits.</li>
            <li>Does not adjust easily.</li>
            <li>and when i called the company i was told i had to use a mallet and get someone strong.</li>
            <li>Feels cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>is the hose is too short it won&#x27;t stay in the sink good without someone holding it</li>
            <li>it will be good if the assembly was easier and include a manual, some people actually use them.</li>
            <li>Luckily I use the bathtub to drain in.</li>
            <li>The hose is pretty light as well</li>
            <li>For best results keep hose flat so water will drain properly.</li>
            <li>but worth the price</li>
            <li>cause now I can put it right up to the edge of the bathtub and drain it in the tub</li>
            <li>It shipped right on time and came to the door, the biggest convenience for me.</li>
            <li>It ends up being a rather fun experience all the way around, and certainly makes this part of care-giving a heck of a lot easier and safer, as I do this while he is seated in his wheelchair...</li>
            <li>I provide 24/7 care for a home-bound, elderly relative of mine who is suffering from many illnesses.  </li>
            <li>Now I am hot glueing it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to think the sink method was working much more efficiently</li>
            <li>Insert the drain plug, have your subject tilt the head back, and you&#x27;re good to go!  </li>
            <li>Remember that the simple mechanism is a spring, so steady the top bowl with one hand while adjusting the height.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to use a large container to hold the draining water.</li>
            <li>However, one great thing this one has over my old one is that the drain hose fits VERY tightly and does not leak or come off, no matter how high the water pressure.</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose very well.</li>
            <li>and this is very helpful and convenient.  </li>
            <li>the leg snapping actully worked  very well</li>
            <li>I tried this with my client at home and placed the hose into the sink and it just packed up into the bowl, I had to then drain the water from the hose into a bucket and then into the sink, repeatedly while rising my clients very highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>I think its ok, the only problem is the drain tube, it&#x27;s to short to hang in the sink</li>
            <li>The hose is super short.</li>
            <li>If you can avoid a portable set up buy a normal bowl.  </li>
            <li>life would have been better if they made the stand to slide in easy, i almost cut myself trying to fit the base in</li>
            <li>More than what I expected, the bowel is deep enough so water doesn&#x27;t over flow or splash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Professional hairdresser who works in the salon and house calls.</li>
            <li>The thought of it was a great idea, but when I received it the stoppers were broken on the stand and the drain holes isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li>I I provided and filled two small sand bags to place at bottom.</li>
            <li>Horrible paid $70 for a used, flimsy, cheap cheap!!!</li>
            <li>This one just isn&#x27;t deep enough and if you lean your head into it you will nearly knock it over.  </li>

            <li> (I also drape towels over the shoulder and around the back of the neck, to prevent water from going down the back, just like they do in the beauty parlors).  </li>
            <li> You turn the black collar on the lower tube to raise and lower the Shamp-ease to the proper height.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that i wish the bowl were a little deeper.</li>
            <li> Made cheap, inconvenient having to dump water.</li>
            <li> This was an open box item with missing parts.  </li>
            <li> Stand Not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth what they are asking, this probably costs about 10 dollars to manufacture if that.</li>
            <li> so you may need something to hold it down into the sink.</li>
            <li> The hose isn&#x27;t durable, I suggest to purchase a heavy duty hose.</li>

            <li> The base completely snapped and cut my thumb when I was trying to fit the two base pieces together.</li>
            <li> Tough to assemble and missing pieces.</li>
            <li> Not ideal to say the least.</li>
            <li> There are six parts:  the base, two tubes (the lower one has a spring in it) that go together then fit into the base, the bowl, the drain hose, and the drain plug.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who always does my hair at his house, and makes me bend over the tub - so uncomfortable!  </li>
            <li> You place a bucket close by and put the hose in it, adjust the height to the base of the neck</li>
            <li> , I also bought a sprayer with it which was horrible and used had a stain on it .</li>

            <li> Horrible paid $70 for a used, flimsy, cheap cheap!!! And I can not print the label to ship it back, I also bought a sprayer with it which was horrible and used had a stain on it .</li>
            <li> Tough to assemble and missing pieces.</li>
            <li> I provide 24/7 care for a home-bound, elderly relative of mine who is suffering from many illnesses.  Taking him out to a barber shop is out of the question, so before I got him back home from hospital &amp; rehab, I had to make provisions here at home to facilitate comfort and hygiene.  The \\&quot;Shamp-ease\\&quot; has been, in short, a life saver.  It arrived well-packed; instructions were sparse, but it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out how this goes together.  There are six parts:  the base, two tubes (the lower one has a spring in it) that go together then fit into the base, the bowl, the drain hose, and the drain plug.  You place a bucket close by and put the hose in it, adjust the height to the base of the neck (I also drape towels over the shoulder and around the back of the neck, to prevent water from going down the back, just like they do in the beauty parlors).  You turn the black collar on the lower tube to raise and lower the Shamp-ease to the proper height.  Remember that the simple mechanism is a spring, so steady the top bowl with one hand while adjusting the height.  Insert the drain plug, have your subject tilt the head back, and you&#x27;re good to go!  Rinse, pull the drain plug and it drains into your bucket.  It ends up being a rather fun experience all the way around, and certainly makes this part of care-giving a heck of a lot easier and safer, as I do this while he is seated in his wheelchair... no more risky trips to the transfer bench to the bathtub.  If you find yourself in a similar position as I, consider this product.  It is a time saver and it is convenient.</li>
            <li> I got this for home use. It serves the purpose very well. I just back it up to the bathtub for drainage, and i use the hand-held shower head. The only con is that i wish the bowl were a little deeper. I had one of these before with a deeper bowl. However, one great thing this one has over my old one is that the drain hose fits VERY tightly and does not leak or come off, no matter how high the water pressure. Plus it comes apart very easily to store in the linen closet.</li>
            <li> If you can avoid a portable set up buy a normal bowl.  This one just isn&#x27;t deep enough and if you lean your head into it you will nearly knock it over.  Water splashes everywhere and comes out of the bowl sometimes.  Feels cheaply made.  Not worth what they are asking, this probably costs about 10 dollars to manufacture if that.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo bowl it is very good for elderly people that can&#x27;t make it to the beauty shop I use it to make house visits the only problem I have with it is the hose is too short it won&#x27;t stay in the sink good without someone holding it but I put a extension on it and it works better</li>
            <li> life would have been better if they made the stand to slide in easy, i almost cut myself trying to fit the base in and when i called the company i was told i had to use a mallet and get someone strong. i almost sent it back. it will be good if the assembly was easier and include a manual, some people actually use them.</li>
            <li> My mother is in a wheelchair and cannot take showers.  She loves to have her washed and this is very helpful and convenient.  It is very easy to assemble and lightweight.  The hose is pretty light as well so you may need something to hold it down into the sink.</li>
            <li> I think its ok, the only problem is the drain tube, it&#x27;s to short to hang in the sink and so I have to use a bucket but its ok to use</li>
            <li> light weight great for travel or in small spaces i use mine in my rv a mobile salon perfect to store out of the way when not in use.</li>
            <li> More than what I expected, the bowel is deep enough so water doesn&#x27;t over flow or splash. Easy to assemble. The hose isn&#x27;t durable, I suggest to purchase a heavy duty hose. For best results keep hose flat so water will drain properly. Perfect for at home use! Better than leaning over the sink to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> It works great drains well just one thing the bottom leg snapped off as soon as we got it outta the box so it&#x27;s very cheap plastic but worth the price forsure and the leg snapping actully worked  very well cause now I can put it right up to the edge of the bathtub and drain it in the tub</li>
            <li> My shampoo sink came about a week after purchase. I am a in home stylist and worked my per sink to the ground. This one seemed to look sturdier than the one I had. The hose is super short. Luckily I use the bathtub to drain in. The base completely snapped and cut my thumb when I was trying to fit the two base pieces together. Now I am hot glueing it...well see how that works otherwise I a returning it</li>
            <li> I was looking for an easy way of shampooing and perming my invalid patient , this has worked well.  It shipped right on time and came to the door, the biggest convenience for me.</li>
            <li> Good item it serves it´s purpose wel.</li>
            <li> Not what was advertised.  This was an open box item with missing parts.  I had to modify the assembly for the stand to work.  Otherwise, the product is compact, efficient and has a sturdy basin unit.  I would not trust this vendor to order from again.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES IT. SHE GETS HER DOUGH WITH THIS.</li>
            <li> I tried this with my client at home and placed the hose into the sink and it just packed up into the bowl, I had to then drain the water from the hose into a bucket and then into the sink, repeatedly while rising my clients very highlighted hair. Not ideal to say the least. So sad it did not work properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who always does my hair at his house, and makes me bend over the tub - so uncomfortable!  The neck rest on the bowl still isn&#x27;t the most comfortable, but for the price it is a really good deal.  Lightweight, and easy to move around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Professional hairdresser who works in the salon and house calls. I purchased in hopes it would be easy to use during my house call visits. However I have found it was a bit challenging. Stand Not very sturdy. I I provided and filled two small sand bags to place at bottom. You&#x27;ll need to use a large container to hold the draining water. I tried it with a 5 gallon bucket and it worked well. I&#x27;m starting to think the sink method was working much more efficiently lol</li>
            <li> I would recommend make sure you have a bucket to dispose of the water. It&#x27;s affordable feels like your at the salon for a great price</li>
            <li> The thought of it was a great idea, but when I received it the stoppers were broken on the stand and the drain holes isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Made cheap, inconvenient having to dump water. Will not order another. Does not adjust easily. I do not like it.</li>
