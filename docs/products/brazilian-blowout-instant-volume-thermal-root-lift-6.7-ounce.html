            <li>I was sure I could find it on line, and Amazon had the best price (around $24-$25).  </li>
            <li>, honestly didn&#x27;t get great results.</li>

            <li>It will be full of volume and sassiness!!!  </li>
            <li>If you want an awesome product then go true design lines like CatWalk products.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The hold on the hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smells really nice as well.  </li>
            <li>Smells incredible, really lifts, and holds.</li>
            <li>I should have realized that the $17 cost was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Works well if used very lightly, all the Brazilian products work well and do not damage your hair.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the scent, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>and I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Brazilian Products</li>
            <li>I purchased from Better Health &amp; Beauty, a seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used as directed and it made my hair appear more voluminous.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my bangs and it thickens them up and makes them more managable.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to finally be able to get it through Amazon now.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product is good to use right after getting a Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product gives me the boost I need for better volume &amp; holding power.</li>
            <li>And if it rains or you workout (sweat) the sticks strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry hair, incredible volume and no alcohol.</li>
            <li>My stylist introduced this, to me, originally.</li>
            <li>I have fine to medium fine hair and really didn&#x27;t notice much lift at the root.</li>
            <li>I do not use the shampoo or conditioner any more because I like other products much better</li>
            <li>I had much better luck with a teasing powder recommended by my hairdresser, and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair full of product, it actually absorbs oil when you brush it out.</li>
            <li>I was just set on having all of their products after having my first Brazilian Blowout, so I had to have this</li>
            <li>- sure enough - this is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair!</li>
            <li>It gets sprayed right on the roots and get ready</li>
            <li>When it first arrived it hadn&#x27;t been packaged very well and had leaked, so I sent it back and very quickly received a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Also is a great product to fix those little problem areas if your hair doesn&#x27;t turn out right after a blow dry.</li>
            <li>This product really works well especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>but I really like the product.</li>
            <li>product works very well once</li>
            <li>My stylist used this on my hair the past two hair cuts and I cannot tell you how pleased I was to find it on amazon!  </li>
            <li>Decent product to give body but use very sparingly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray in front or top of hair as it weighs down</li>
            <li>However, I do love the other Brazilian Blowout products!</li>
            <li>The hair set stays full and never goes flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m been trying all kinds of products because after chemo I lost the body and my natural wave and curl and this stuff really gives it body</li>
            <li>The purchased product didn&#x27;t have the same pleasant scent that the salon product had, in fact it was actually hard to breathe after using the BH&amp;B product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase a new bottle</li>
            <li>Still stays soft.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much or not enough of the product.</li>
            <li>Seemed almost toxic, like to old style aerosol hair spray.</li>
            <li>I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out.</li>
            <li>just save your money and use super stiff hairspray on your roots instead while you&#x27;re blowdrying</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to really add any oomph or volume to my roots like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I recently found out from y hairdresser that this product is used to help straighten hair, it did not really increase volume.</li>
            <li> Use when your hair is mostly dry to finish styling.</li>
            <li> Extra hold hair spray cost less so</li>
            <li> Title says it all, this was not worth the extra  money spent on it.</li>
            <li> I spray it on the roots of my hair while my hair is still wet and then blow dry</li>
            <li> After the Brazilian blowout, my hair was also greasy for a few days, so I thought some root boost was necessary.</li>
            <li> Not much volume lift after application.</li>
            <li> Its just like any other brand at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Kept frizz down but was drying to the hair and sticky when put on hair</li>
            <li> My hair looks thicker and stays for a few days without restyling.</li>
            <li> blow dried.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to leave my hair a little stiff with no more volume.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all with my purchase due to it leaked</li>
            <li> Works well and it does not leave your hair hard and crusty.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair body without leaving it dull or too &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> and it just takes a little bad, don&#x27;t have to goo down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is thin</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the result.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I would never buy it from the source that I did because their shipping was terrible</li>

            <li> Too expensive for the result. I was just set on having all of their products after having my first Brazilian Blowout, so I had to have this, honestly didn&#x27;t get great results. I had much better luck with a teasing powder recommended by my hairdresser, and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair full of product, it actually absorbs oil when you brush it out.</li>
            <li> Works.  My hair looks thicker and stays for a few days without restyling.</li>
            <li> It smells soooo good!  I wish it was a body spray instead.  It didn&#x27;t seem to really add any oomph or volume to my roots like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Again, I love the scent, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Works great to get some height and body</li>
            <li> This product really works well especially if you have fine hair. It will leave your hair with volume and shine.  Patricia</li>
            <li> Love this product and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product is good to use right after getting a Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Great for root pump. Don&#x27;t spray in front or top of hair as it weighs down but if used properly it&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ve loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! It gives wonderful body and shine to my hair without looking brittle or greasy.</li>
            <li> Adds volume but it also has a sticky feel to.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry hair, incredible volume and no alcohol. My stylist introduced this, to me, originally. Smells incredible, really lifts, and holds. Still stays soft. Love!!!</li>
            <li> I feel Brazilian Blowout Instant Volume Thermal Root Lift Spray worked well with my hair type for the last 6 months. I wanted to purchase a new bottle and I was able to find it on Amazon. I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Leaves a great shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if this helps plump my roots, but for someone who only washes their hair twice a week the smell stays in and oh my gosh, it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but it is thin and this gives me great volume. The hair set stays full and never goes flat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and love it.  I cant imagine not having to use.  I love all of the Brazilian Products</li>
            <li> Works the same as extra hold hair spray, even smells the same. Extra hold hair spray cost less so will get hair spray in the future.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product gives me the boost I need for better volume &amp; holding power. I do not use the shampoo or conditioner any more because I like other products much better but I love the Root Lift!</li>
            <li> Not a big fan. Removed shine from hair and seemed a bit &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;. After the Brazilian blowout, my hair was also greasy for a few days, so I thought some root boost was necessary. Once I washed my hair with their brand of shampoo and conditioner, though, the greasiness was gone and there was no need for this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for volume on my crown after the Brazilian Blowout treatment. This didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick yet. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much or not enough of the product. It seemed to leave my hair a little stiff with no more volume. However, I do love the other Brazilian Blowout products!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this product on my hair with great results. I purchased from Better Health &amp; Beauty, a seller on Amazon. The purchased product didn&#x27;t have the same pleasant scent that the salon product had, in fact it was actually hard to breathe after using the BH&amp;B product. Seemed almost toxic, like to old style aerosol hair spray. And - the styling result wasn&#x27;t at all the same. I took the BH&amp;B product into the salon and compared it - sure enough - this is a counterfeit product. Similar packaging, same brand name, same product name, but telltale differences upon close inspection. I should have realized that the $17 cost was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I have loved all the products from Acai Brazilian Blowout.  I used as directed and it made my hair appear more voluminous.</li>
            <li> Works well and it does not leave your hair hard and crusty.  Smells really nice as well.  I would never buy it from the source that I did because their shipping was terrible but I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Works well if used very lightly, all the Brazilian products work well and do not damage your hair. Use when your hair is mostly dry to finish styling. Also is a great product to fix those little problem areas if your hair doesn&#x27;t turn out right after a blow dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well but the smell. And if it rains or you workout (sweat) the sticks strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been trying all kinds of products because after chemo I lost the body and my natural wave and curl and this stuff really gives it body and you don&#x27;t feel goo on your scalp or hair and it just takes a little bad, don&#x27;t have to goo down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Product provides volume and style assistance. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Decent product to give body but use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Kept frizz down but was drying to the hair and sticky when put on hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never sued a root lift till this product and I think it works grate!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair more volume.  My hair dresser used it on my hair once.  They didn&#x27;t have any to buy at the salon so I check out Amazon an they had it.</li>
            <li> Title says it all, this was not worth the extra  money spent on it. What a waist. Its just like any other brand at Walmart. If you want an awesome product then go true design lines like CatWalk products.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair the past two hair cuts and I cannot tell you how pleased I was to find it on amazon!  It gets sprayed right on the roots and get ready b/c you&#x27;re hair will never be the same!  It will be full of volume and sassiness!!!  And it smells amazing!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  The hold on the hair is amazing.  If you love the Brazilian product line you need this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works amazing! I spray it on the roots of my hair while my hair is still wet and then blow dry and I always get the extra volume that I need.</li>
            <li> Discovered this stuff at my hair salon, where they wanted $30-some dollars for it.  I was sure I could find it on line, and Amazon had the best price (around $24-$25).  When it first arrived it hadn&#x27;t been packaged very well and had leaked, so I sent it back and very quickly received a replacement.  Had to pay return postage, but oh well.  It&#x27;s still an excellent product, makes hair-styling easy, and smells wonderful.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> product works very well once blow dried.  I have just starting using it but think it will work well continuously on my very flat hair.</li>
            <li> I recently found out from y hairdresser that this product is used to help straighten hair, it did not really increase volume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I use it in my bangs and it thickens them up and makes them more managable.  I am so glad to finally be able to get it through Amazon now.  Shipping was zippy, product arrived well packaged and in perfect shape</li>
            <li> just save your money and use super stiff hairspray on your roots instead while you&#x27;re blowdrying</li>
            <li> Thank you so much I love it!</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked inside the package. Product a bit sticky after applying it to hair. Not much volume lift after application. I have fine to medium fine hair and really didn&#x27;t notice much lift at the root.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair body without leaving it dull or too &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all with my purchase due to it leaked and I didn&#x27;t get all that I paid for. I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it. Finally frizz free shiney and silky hair! I have not ever had that before unless I had it professionally blown out. Gives it some fullness too!</li>
