            <li>It smells great and works to keep my acne in check.  </li>

            <li>It is very nice.</li>
            <li>This is a amazing product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly also the type that never leaves reviews, so the fact that I did means a lot!</li>
            <li>&lt;3 LOVE</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s just good to know that this stuff works.</li>
            <li>Smells like tea tree don&#x27;t expect it to be good.</li>
            <li>I always have good results when using it.</li>
            <li>and nothing work as good as this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and so far,so good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good choose.</li>
            <li>This is good as a spot treatment for blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good product, which I always seem to reach for after cleansing my skin.</li>
            <li>A good anti-bacterial to keep handy.</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil, but don&#x27;t get it from the body shop!</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil!</li>
            <li>and after it ran out I made my own 15% Tea Tree Oil/</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would wait around for a coupon or sale at the Body Shop and buy this for  the bottle.      </li>
            <li>I liked it as a spot treatment</li>
            <li>So i will keep the nice size bottle so it can go with me</li>
            <li>I own tea tree soap and</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tea tree oil!</li>
            <li>This is diluted but still very strong in potency, I honestly don&#x27;t think I could use a full strength formula</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure you can find it for cheaper</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Now my skin has a much better texture: it is smoother and clearer.    </li>
            <li>I love this product because of the packaging and the percentage of Tea Tree.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product 5 years plus and Love it.  </li>
            <li>I dont have a lot of breakouts just mostly acne scars</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT &lt;</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to work better than it does</li>
            <li>Now I actually love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; feeling it leaves on my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li>Is it better than Dermalear TX?  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better on my cystic acne than Dermaclear TX.</li>
            <li>It is very useful for me!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is the packaging: the .33 fl oz bottle is made of glass with a plastic top, it is a great size for carrying in your purse and it has a great little gadget to let you get the product out drop by drop.      </li>
            <li>It seems to work best for me when I pop them first and then put the tea tree oil on directly after.</li>
            <li>Like the Suki serum, I find it really does a good job preventing acne, which is what I purchased it for.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I got past the smell because it works amazing!</li>
            <li>I use it more as a spot treatment, which is much more economical.  </li>
            <li>I use it more as a spot treatment, which is much more economical.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong tea tree smell to it</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t leave it off because product does have strong tea tree oil smell (which it is supposed to).</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong at first, but I think this product works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for years now and it is effective.</li>
            <li>This tea tree oil is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I think the price is quite steep considering it&#x27;s not 100% tea tree oil, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It clears my blemishes more quickly than anything I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li>The tea tree lotion will be tested against Dermaquest&#x27;s Dermaclear TX ($65), which is another product I really love (HG worthy).  </li>
            <li>my face feel very clearly and feel good.</li>
            <li>and i noticed a HUGE and</li>
            <li>But after a couple weeks I had a huge pimple</li>
            <li>I bought this product from The Body Shop primarily because I just wanted an oil that already came diluted in the bottle.</li>
            <li>it is my most favorite product of The Body Shop,not merely for its price but most importantly for its awesome effects.</li>
            <li>The oil inside has a great tea tree oil smell (I find this scent very calming) and it was very soothing on my scalp eczema.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh to me!</li>
            <li>In general a good product.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Using the entire three step line was much more effective.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pacifica Sea Foam Complete Face Wash to wash my face, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel as a toner, and this as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>In fact, my foundation covers it nicely (i&#x27;ve used liquid, mineral and cream foundations with it), so I like the fact I can wear it under makeup with no trouble.  </li>
            <li>The body shop oil is  not bad.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I had always wanted to try Tea Tree Oil on my scalp and for my mild acne.  </li>
            <li>a qualidade do conteúdo é surreal e ele é bem barato!    </li>
            <li>so we are running low and are going to order a couple more bottles!</li>
            <li>This product is 15% Tea Tree and is a nice combination of oils to keep your skin moisturized with enough tea tree to work well on acne.      </li>
            <li>I feel that this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try .</li>
            <li>you can apply it directly :)</li>
            <li>Since I have liked TBS&#x27;s tea tree line, I recently ordered their Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner, Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion, and their Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion.  </li>
            <li>And deliverer is very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank u very much.</li>
            <li>I have already used two bottles since  receiving the first sample in a gift kit.  </li>
            <li>This is the first tea tree oil product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I Can find other items which work better and cheaper than this one!</li>
            <li>But I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Am I really seeing results already?!</li>
            <li>I put in on pimples at night and it really helps shrink and get rid of them faster!</li>
            <li>I really recommend!</li>
            <li>Recently, I received a 40% off coupon from TBS, so I purchased more to take advantage of the coupon, bringing the cost to $5.70.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use lots of things on my acne like neutrogina, proactive, clean and clear, etc.</li>
            <li>Good for drying small pimple ́s</li>
            <li>What I appreciate the most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin and it helps heal the blemish without leaving a mark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that if you buy pure tea tree oil, however, you must dilute it before you put it on your face.  </li>
            <li>Love this, really helps to dry my pimper!</li>
            <li>but this really did help.  </li>
            <li>But this really did help.  </li>
            <li>Very watery/oily.</li>
            <li>It was also very non-greasy and cleared up my oily T-zone while not drying out the rest of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It also worked very well on mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li>It dries up my zit fast and removes it in no time.</li>
            <li>Essence\\&quot; Tea Tree oil from Whole Foods...</li>
            <li>, I think it would cause too much drying/flaking.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>Heals/ripens my zits fast.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very like</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce them.</li>
            <li>and I really like it for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t find I reach for it very often when using TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>For larger zits I have to use it for more than one night, but smaller ones are pretty much gone by morning.  </li>
            <li>It is true, I had a similar result with Suki&#x27;s serum, but the difference is that Suki&#x27;s serum could be a bit too drying for</li>
            <li>it is a little bit pricey because you can by 100% tea tree oil like a huge bottle for 11 dollars!</li>
            <li>I took 1 star off because it makes it bit harder to smooth out my makeup after I apply the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>But yeah definitely ordering another one when this one runs out, it&#x27;s really worth the price.</li>
            <li>yet i find it effective, Its magic doesnt work over night but you can see the result little by little with proper use,</li>
            <li>At the time, I was trying out a new serum from Suki, so didn&#x27;t want to introduce an even newer product, so I waited.</li>
            <li>The company i ordered from was great, this product just seemed to make my skin slightly worse and did not clear up the acne.</li>
            <li>In terms of value, I think purchasing with a coupon is the way to go of course, but in comparision to the cost of other beauty products, I think it is not a bad price at all for me.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews said you can purchase 100% pure tea tree oil for much less, however, I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil, so I would rather purchase from TBS until I can learn more about formulations and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for covering large areas, just dab it on individual zits.  </li>
            <li>Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>Works very well for acne related skin problems by making them heal faster.</li>
            <li>It will be a staple because it helps and doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mean HUGE difference in my acne!</li>
            <li>i bought this product due to all nice reviews but still not sure how I feel about</li>
            <li>The toner I will test against Suki&#x27;s concentrated balancing toner ($30), which will be tough because I really love Suki&#x27;s toner.  </li>
            <li>I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy.</li>
            <li>It does burn a little bit but not too much!</li>
            <li>but it really helps decrease redness and shrink any spot without being drying like typical spot creams.</li>
            <li>Whenever I get a couple of breakouts I use this as a spot treatment and then half way through the day they&#x27;re almost completely gone or have diminished in size a considerable amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a few products that have worked for me, but the cost was very high, so I was on the search for a product that worked just as well,</li>

            <li> so we are running low and are going to order a couple more bottles!</li>
            <li> This product is 15% Tea Tree and is a nice combination of oils to keep your skin moisturized with enough tea tree to work well on acne.      </li>
            <li> I feel that this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try .</li>
            <li> you can apply it directly :)</li>
            <li> Since I have liked TBS&#x27;s tea tree line, I recently ordered their Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner, Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion, and their Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion.  </li>
            <li> And deliverer is very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank u very much.</li>
            <li> I have already used two bottles since  receiving the first sample in a gift kit.  </li>
            <li> This is the first tea tree oil product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I Can find other items which work better and cheaper than this one!</li>
            <li> But I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Am I really seeing results already?!</li>
            <li> I put in on pimples at night and it really helps shrink and get rid of them faster!</li>
            <li> I really recommend!</li>
            <li> Recently, I received a 40% off coupon from TBS, so I purchased more to take advantage of the coupon, bringing the cost to $5.70.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use lots of things on my acne like neutrogina, proactive, clean and clear, etc.</li>
            <li> Good for drying small pimple ́s</li>
            <li> What I appreciate the most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin and it helps heal the blemish without leaving a mark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that if you buy pure tea tree oil, however, you must dilute it before you put it on your face.  </li>
            <li> Love this, really helps to dry my pimper!</li>
            <li> but this really did help.  </li>
            <li> But this really did help.  </li>
            <li> Very watery/oily.</li>
            <li> It was also very non-greasy and cleared up my oily T-zone while not drying out the rest of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also worked very well on mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> It dries up my zit fast and removes it in no time.</li>
            <li> Essence\\&quot; Tea Tree oil from Whole Foods...</li>
            <li> , I think it would cause too much drying/flaking.  </li>
            <li> Fast ship.  </li>
            <li> Heals/ripens my zits fast.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very like</li>
            <li> It really helps reduce them.</li>
            <li> and I really like it for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t find I reach for it very often when using TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> For larger zits I have to use it for more than one night, but smaller ones are pretty much gone by morning.  </li>
            <li> It is true, I had a similar result with Suki&#x27;s serum, but the difference is that Suki&#x27;s serum could be a bit too drying for</li>
            <li> it is a little bit pricey because you can by 100% tea tree oil like a huge bottle for 11 dollars!</li>
            <li> I took 1 star off because it makes it bit harder to smooth out my makeup after I apply the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> But yeah definitely ordering another one when this one runs out, it&#x27;s really worth the price.</li>
            <li> yet i find it effective, Its magic doesnt work over night but you can see the result little by little with proper use,</li>
            <li> At the time, I was trying out a new serum from Suki, so didn&#x27;t want to introduce an even newer product, so I waited.</li>
            <li> The company i ordered from was great, this product just seemed to make my skin slightly worse and did not clear up the acne.</li>
            <li> In terms of value, I think purchasing with a coupon is the way to go of course, but in comparision to the cost of other beauty products, I think it is not a bad price at all for me.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews said you can purchase 100% pure tea tree oil for much less, however, I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil, so I would rather purchase from TBS until I can learn more about formulations and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for covering large areas, just dab it on individual zits.  </li>
            <li> Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Works very well for acne related skin problems by making them heal faster.</li>
            <li> It will be a staple because it helps and doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I mean HUGE difference in my acne!</li>
            <li> i bought this product due to all nice reviews but still not sure how I feel about</li>
            <li> The toner I will test against Suki&#x27;s concentrated balancing toner ($30), which will be tough because I really love Suki&#x27;s toner.  </li>
            <li> I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little bit but not too much!</li>
            <li> but it really helps decrease redness and shrink any spot without being drying like typical spot creams.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a couple of breakouts I use this as a spot treatment and then half way through the day they&#x27;re almost completely gone or have diminished in size a considerable amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a few products that have worked for me, but the cost was very high, so I was on the search for a product that worked just as well,</li>
            <li> so it is diluted, but that is how you are supposed to use tea tree on your face anyways - 100% tea tree oil will dry your face like no other.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial wash, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> As far as its usage is concerned, I use it every night on my active acne by dabbing some on them and the redness and the size of them by a lot the very next day!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination, sensitive and acne prone, in other words, a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> If I am too late to get it, I use this and it disappears very fast.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get nearly as much cystic acne I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Smell doesnt last too long</li>
            <li> plus it didn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> I dab it on a zit with a q-tip at bedtime and allow it to dry and the zit honestly is amazingly smaller by morning.  </li>
            <li> To start, it absorbs into my skin quickly and does not leave any sort of residue behind.</li>
            <li> I always have to buy stuff from the body shop overseas when we go to foreign ports and This line is supposed to be good for skin clearing, so I tried this the toner, and the moisturiser and was WOW-ed, because there isn&#x27;t much I can find to help my skin, seeing as I go on long deployments, excess stress, and alot of times very bad skin habits</li>
            <li> The only downside to it is the side of the bottle; it is tiny and since I use it every single night it doesn&#x27;t last me long enough (a bottle usually lasts me for about a month).</li>
            <li> and i used this as an alternative for benzoyl peroxide, it calms the pimple,makes it smaller, less red til its gone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overuse it throughout the day because it will dry up the area a lot and make another problem, but use it correctly and be amazed.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly on the body shop store, 4 stars coz its pricey for that small bottle</li>
            <li> My intent with these products is hopefully be able to use these in place of some very expensive products I have been using from Suki and Dermaquest.  </li>
            <li> For me it does make the pimple and skin around very dry.</li>
            <li> This little bottle also lasts a while since you only need a 1-2 drops per application.</li>
            <li> Are there other tea trea oil products that will provide a similar result for even less money?  </li>
            <li> I have always known about The Body Shop (TBS), but was always a Bath and Body Works (B&amp;BW) girl, so never really got into TBS.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have said not to buy it from the body shop because it&#x27;s diluted to 15% tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> I think  it clears up small blemishes within 2 days and larger blemishes within a 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands of tea tree oil, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works other times it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I liked Suki&#x27;s serum, but it was rather expensive ($80.00), so I began to search for something cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It could be difficult because I would either get one drop or a whole ton</li>
            <li> I will say when I first bought it I hated the smell so much</li>
            <li> When hormonal acne forms, this seems to keep inflamation down</li>
            <li> but now Im down to half of the bottle</li>
            <li> You can buy a 1oz bottle of 100% Tea Tree for less than the cost of this product.  </li>
            <li> so they are less noticeable too.  </li>
            <li> My acne is typically cystic, which also a challenge to deal with.  </li>
            <li> but for less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and still struggle with zits a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It does work a little bit.</li>
            <li> However, I had watched a couple of YouTube video reviews a few months ago where reviewes seem to rave about the TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> 10/11/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil everyday through the Summer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from terrible acne, just enough around my chin to be embarassing and make my habits worse by covering up with more makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tea tree oil for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> Mix a drop with a few drops of Almond oil and voila!</li>
            <li> No more razor irritations.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out on my chin and my forehead was covered in small pimples/acne.  </li>
            <li> faster then usual.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne but the texture of my skin was very bumpy because of blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree is irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started having really random breakouts on my face and was frustrated that my usual face washing routine wasn&#x27;t keeping my blemishes away.  </li>
            <li> and I was desperate.</li>
            <li> so the cap is very difficult to get off</li>
            <li> and some people hate it because it can be overpowering</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bought the oil before and I think buy it online is cheaper than buy it in the retail store, yet actually in the store it&#x27;s only $9.5.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly on the body shop store, 4 stars coz its pricey for that small bottle yet i find it effective, Its magic doesnt work over night but you can see the result little by little with proper use,coz im having pimples here and there and i used this as an alternative for benzoyl peroxide, it calms the pimple,makes it smaller, less red til its gone. I apply moisturizer 10mins after this product. Patience &amp; consistency is all you need to make it work</li>
            <li> I started having really random breakouts on my face and was frustrated that my usual face washing routine wasn&#x27;t keeping my blemishes away.  I bought this stuff and started spot-treating each blemish in the morning after my shower and at night before bed.  It clears my blemishes more quickly than anything I&#x27;ve ever used...all without drying out my skin!  Other reviews have said not to buy it from the body shop because it&#x27;s diluted to 15% tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ve read that if you buy pure tea tree oil, however, you must dilute it before you put it on your face.  I find this simpler to use because it&#x27;s ready-made to go on your face and it works!</li>
            <li> This product  works wonderful! If you are accustomed to getting skin irritation after shaving, you may want to take a look at Tea Tree oil. Mix a drop with a few drops of Almond oil and voila! No more razor irritations. :)</li>
            <li> it is my most favorite product of The Body Shop,not merely for its price but most importantly for its awesome effects.</li>
            <li> I always have to buy stuff from the body shop overseas when we go to foreign ports and This line is supposed to be good for skin clearing, so I tried this the toner, and the moisturiser and was WOW-ed, because there isn&#x27;t much I can find to help my skin, seeing as I go on long deployments, excess stress, and alot of times very bad skin habits but this really did help.  I don&#x27;t suffer from terrible acne, just enough around my chin to be embarassing and make my habits worse by covering up with more makeup.  But this really did help.  And I&#x27;m sure you can find it for cheaper but It&#x27;s just good to know that this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle for the price. Ran out in two weeks! Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have already used two bottles since  receiving the first sample in a gift kit.  Leaves your skin so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I used for acne and redness overnight. Very watery/oily. Smells like tea tree don&#x27;t expect it to be good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tea tree oil! It has a strong tea tree smell to it and some people hate it because it can be overpowering (but you definitely get used to it) but I love it! It smells fresh to me! As far as its usage is concerned, I use it every night on my active acne by dabbing some on them and the redness and the size of them by a lot the very next day! This has 15% tea tree so it is diluted, but that is how you are supposed to use tea tree on your face anyways - 100% tea tree oil will dry your face like no other. The only downside to it is the side of the bottle; it is tiny and since I use it every single night it doesn&#x27;t last me long enough (a bottle usually lasts me for about a month).</li>
            <li> I got this at the Body Shop while they were having a Buy Two Get One for $.76.  I happened to be buying a gift for an acquaintance and I had always wanted to try Tea Tree Oil on my scalp and for my mild acne.  I got it for $.76 and it has changed my skin.      The oil inside has a great tea tree oil smell (I find this scent very calming) and it was very soothing on my scalp eczema.  It was also very non-greasy and cleared up my oily T-zone while not drying out the rest of my skin.  It also worked very well on mosquito bites.  This product has convinced me that tea tree oil is the answer to my acne problems.  I don&#x27;t have terrible acne but the texture of my skin was very bumpy because of blackheads and whiteheads.  I tend to break out on my chin and my forehead was covered in small pimples/acne.  Now my skin has a much better texture: it is smoother and clearer.    I used this product as a moisturizer after I cleansed my skin and it worked wonders at clearing up my blackheads and combination skin.  This product is 15% Tea Tree and is a nice combination of oils to keep your skin moisturized with enough tea tree to work well on acne.      But this product is way overpriced.  You can buy a 1oz bottle of 100% Tea Tree for less than the cost of this product.  My favorite thing about this product is the packaging: the .33 fl oz bottle is made of glass with a plastic top, it is a great size for carrying in your purse and it has a great little gadget to let you get the product out drop by drop.      It lasted about six weeks and after it ran out I made my own 15% Tea Tree Oil/ 85% Jojoba Oil mixture that I keep in this wonderful bottle from The Body Shop.  Honestly, I would wait around for a coupon or sale at the Body Shop and buy this for  the bottle.      I love this product because of the packaging and the percentage of Tea Tree.  But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless I lose or break my bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! Whenever I get a couple of breakouts I use this as a spot treatment and then half way through the day they&#x27;re almost completely gone or have diminished in size a considerable amount. It seems to work best for me when I pop them first and then put the tea tree oil on directly after. But yeah definitely ordering another one when this one runs out, it&#x27;s really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for beauty products but I get a zit every once in a while and this is the only product that works for me. It dries up my zit fast and removes it in no time. Just 3 to 4 days is all.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pacifica Sea Foam Complete Face Wash to wash my face, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel as a toner, and this as a spot treatment. I just put a litte on a cotton swab and rub on any blemishes and let it sink in before I moisturize with grape seed oil. The smell is kind of strong at first, but I think this product works well. Smell doesnt last too long and I don&#x27;t find this overpowering.</li>
            <li> Esse produto é simplesmente mágico.  Vou comprar mais dois ainda essa semana.    A unica falha é o aplicador, podia ser algo mais pratico.  Mas a qualidade do conteúdo é surreal e ele é bem barato!    Amei!</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for years now and it is effective.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I always have good results when using it. I feel that this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE tea tree oil for those random pimples that pop up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy your tea tree oil from the body shop. I bought \\&quot;Desert Essence\\&quot; Tea Tree oil from Whole Foods...a 2 oz. bottle for 11$. The tea tree oil from the Body Shop is only .33 oz!!! In addition, the Desert Essence is 100% Tea Tree Oil, where the Body Shop&#x27;s is only 15%. I love tea tree oil, but don&#x27;t get it from the body shop!</li>
            <li> This is the facial blemish repair miracle solution you need in your bathroom and travel kit at all times.  I use it with a q-tip and when I see or sense something emerging under my skin I dab it, sleep, wake-up and it&#x27;s gone.  If I am too late to get it, I use this and it disappears very fast.  Don&#x27;t overuse it throughout the day because it will dry up the area a lot and make another problem, but use it correctly and be amazed.</li>
            <li> This is the first tea tree oil product I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m 39 and still struggle with zits a little bit.  This is diluted but still very strong in potency, I honestly don&#x27;t think I could use a full strength formula, I think it would cause too much drying/flaking.  I dab it on a zit with a q-tip at bedtime and allow it to dry and the zit honestly is amazingly smaller by morning.  For larger zits I have to use it for more than one night, but smaller ones are pretty much gone by morning.  It reduces the redness as well so they are less noticeable too.  I would not recommend this for covering large areas, just dab it on individual zits.  I&#x27;m honestly also the type that never leaves reviews, so the fact that I did means a lot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 5 years plus and Love it.  It clears insect bites and stops the itching in record time.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and order.</li>
            <li> Love this, really helps to dry my pimper!</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  A good anti-bacterial to keep handy.</li>
            <li> I liked it as a spot treatment but it didn&#x27;t make acne go away faster then usual. plus it didn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> The company i ordered from was great, this product just seemed to make my skin slightly worse and did not clear up the acne. I have heard it working for others, but I think for my skin it just was not enough. I like the smell though!</li>
            <li> works wonders. it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it really helps decrease redness and shrink any spot without being drying like typical spot creams.</li>
            <li> In general a good product. I am still trying it. It does work a little bit. I like the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Heals/ripens my zits fast.</li>
            <li> No complaints, standard tea tree oil.  I have arthritis so the cap is very difficult to get off and you can&#x27;t leave it off because product does have strong tea tree oil smell (which it is supposed to).</li>
            <li> Love the smell! It makes me feel clean and fresh. I&#x27;ve use lots of things on my acne like neutrogina, proactive, clean and clear, etc. and nothing work as good as this product. I dont have a lot of breakouts just mostly acne scars and they have been clearing up with this product. I use it at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> I Can find other items which work better and cheaper than this one!</li>
            <li> I have an oily t-zone,and occasionally get blemishes on my chin. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and so far,so good. The smell reminds me of a combination of eucalyptus and patchouli. If you like these scents, you&#x27;ll like the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works, I wasn&#x27;t expecting that</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a retail location in my local mall. I LOVE it! I use it as a spot treatment wherever I am. I dab it on throughout the day as soon as I feel a blemish coming on. I think  it clears up small blemishes within 2 days and larger blemishes within a 1-2 weeks. What I appreciate the most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin and it helps heal the blemish without leaving a mark. This little bottle also lasts a while since you only need a 1-2 drops per application. I took 1 star off because it makes it bit harder to smooth out my makeup after I apply the tea tree oil. But I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Its Tea tree. Ofcourse its awesome. I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy. My parents bought me it</li>
            <li> Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop. It worked wonderfully for my oily, acne prone skin without irritation or over drying. I do recommend that people get a sample from their local shop, if possible, before ordering this. Tea tree is irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this oil, I used it multiple times as a spot treatment, but it didn&#x27;t do anything. Using the entire three step line was much more effective.</li>
            <li> Am I really seeing results already?! Only been 3 nights</li>
            <li> my acne appear and inflame. But using this can help you get a diminish inflammation， and the acne can stop growing.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is pretty nice. It doesn&#x27;t try out my face and it seems to decrease redness. I haven&#x27;t tried other brands of tea tree oil, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. Overall, I would suggest this though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very like this product.when I used it ,my face feel very clearly and feel good. it&#x27;s a good choose.</li>
            <li> It is very useful for me!</li>
            <li> i bought this product due to all nice reviews but still not sure how I feel about it.&lt;br /&gt;When I begin to use this product it seamed, to work but now Im down to half of the bottle and it is not working sometimes and makes my skin red in places when applied to the pimple. So i will keep the nice size bottle so it can go with me when i travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I own tea tree soap and im happy with it 100% so I guess it is not for averyone,</li>
            <li> The body shop oil is  not bad. And deliverer is very fast. Thank u very much. It is very nice.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally on my occasional break outs. It really helps reduce them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well for acne related skin problems by making them heal faster. It&#x27;s worth a try .</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product! i put it on overnight and i noticed a HUGE and I mean HUGE difference in my acne! It&#x27;s the best product for my acne ever used in my life. It does burn a little bit but not too much! like not unbearable! I love it! i wash my face with the body shop tea tree oil facewash and then use the oil! it did wonders for my skin! &lt;3 LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;But it is a little bit pricey because you can by 100% tea tree oil like a huge bottle for 11 dollars! But you somehow have to dilute the 100% one. And this isn&#x27;t 100% which is a good thing! you can apply it directly :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my pimples</li>
            <li> This is good as a spot treatment for blemishes. I was expecting this to work better than it does but it definitely speeds up the process. I think the price is quite steep considering it&#x27;s not 100% tea tree oil, but it&#x27;s fine. It will be a staple because it helps and doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil! It smells great and works to keep my acne in check.  I bought this product from The Body Shop primarily because I just wanted an oil that already came diluted in the bottle. The smell is heavenly and this dilution seems great for my skin (still works for acne yet not too drying). It lasts a lot longer than I thought too (bought the 1st of this month and still looks like I haven&#x27;t used any ..even though I use nightly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  It could be difficult because I would either get one drop or a whole ton would come pouring out into my hand.  I would prefer either a dropper or a bottle that I could pour myself that didn&#x27;t have a controlling spout-type hole.</li>
            <li> I purchased the tea tree oil a couple months ago after hearing about it online. This stuff is amazing! I have dry/combination skin. I put in on pimples at night and it really helps shrink and get rid of them faster! For me it does make the pimple and skin around very dry. But the doesn&#x27;t bother me. I will say when I first bought it I hated the smell so much that after trying it once I decided I couldn&#x27;t use it again. But after a couple weeks I had a huge pimple and I was desperate. I am so happy that I got past the smell because it works amazing! Now I actually love the smell of this stuff. I also got my brother hooked on it! He is always using mine so we are running low and are going to order a couple more bottles! I really recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination, sensitive and acne prone, in other words, a nightmare.  My acne is typically cystic, which also a challenge to deal with.  I&#x27;ve found a few products that have worked for me, but the cost was very high, so I was on the search for a product that worked just as well, but for less.  I have always known about The Body Shop (TBS), but was always a Bath and Body Works (B&amp;BW) girl, so never really got into TBS.  However, I had watched a couple of YouTube video reviews a few months ago where reviewes seem to rave about the TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil.  At the time, I was trying out a new serum from Suki, so didn&#x27;t want to introduce an even newer product, so I waited. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I liked Suki&#x27;s serum, but it was rather expensive ($80.00), so I began to search for something cheaper.  Then one day I saw a coupon for TBS so I tried it given the coupon plus the cost being so low ($7.12) in comparison to what I had been spending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this tea tree oil for the past few weeks and I really like it for a number of reasons. To start, it absorbs into my skin quickly and does not leave any sort of residue behind. In fact, my foundation covers it nicely (i&#x27;ve used liquid, mineral and cream foundations with it), so I like the fact I can wear it under makeup with no trouble.  Like the Suki serum, I find it really does a good job preventing acne, which is what I purchased it for.  When hormonal acne forms, this seems to keep inflamation down and I don&#x27;t get nearly as much cystic acne I had in the past.  It is true, I had a similar result with Suki&#x27;s serum, but the difference is that Suki&#x27;s serum could be a bit too drying for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this tea tree oil for a couple of weeks and it appears I have used about 1/4 (25%) of the bottle. At this rate it should last me for about 2 total months. Recently, I received a 40% off coupon from TBS, so I purchased more to take advantage of the coupon, bringing the cost to $5.70.  In terms of value, I think purchasing with a coupon is the way to go of course, but in comparision to the cost of other beauty products, I think it is not a bad price at all for me.  Are there other tea trea oil products that will provide a similar result for even less money?  I&#x27;m not sure, as this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried.  Other reviews said you can purchase 100% pure tea tree oil for much less, however, I&#x27;m new to tea tree oil, so I would rather purchase from TBS until I can learn more about formulations and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this product, I purchased TBS&#x27;s Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, which I have been using along with the tea tree oil.  I really like the facial wash, a little goes a long way and I love the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; feeling it leaves on my skin after using it.  Since I have liked TBS&#x27;s tea tree line, I recently ordered their Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner, Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion, and their Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion.  My intent with these products is hopefully be able to use these in place of some very expensive products I have been using from Suki and Dermaquest.  The toner I will test against Suki&#x27;s concentrated balancing toner ($30), which will be tough because I really love Suki&#x27;s toner.  The tea tree lotion will be tested against Dermaquest&#x27;s Dermaclear TX ($65), which is another product I really love (HG worthy).  So, we&#x27;ll see how that goes once they arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/11/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil everyday through the Summer.  It&#x27;s been a good product, which I always seem to reach for after cleansing my skin. My breakouts are smaller using this product.  I suffer from cystic acne and I find that using this product proactively keeps emerging acne from going cystic.  Is it better than Dermalear TX?  No. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better on my cystic acne than Dermaclear TX. However, I don&#x27;t find I reach for it very often when using TBS&#x27;s tea tree oil.  When I do develop cystic acne, I use the Dermaclear, but I don&#x27;t need to slather it all over my face like before.  I use it more as a spot treatment, which is much more economical.  So yes, I&#x27;ll contine to purchase this product.e Dermaclear, but I don&#x27;t need to slather it all over my face like before.  I use it more as a spot treatment, which is much more economical.  So yes, I&#x27;ll contine to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great. Good for drying small pimple ́s</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works other times it doesn&#x27;t. But it feels antiseptic without being medicinal and it doesn&#x27;t hurt on contact unlike salicylic based tinctures.</li>
