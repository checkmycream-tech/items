            <li>Nice fragrance</li>
            <li>(a great work office fragrance - smells great without offending those with sensitive noses..</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light with a uniqueness that is quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something very smooth on top that&#x27;s almost like a high-end whiff of awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for some magnificent blue bottle</li>
            <li>I end up spraying a lot more on in an effort to keep the scent.</li>
            <li>Strong smell, most women that have encountered it are pleased by it.  </li>
            <li>The smell did not change that much for me, its sort-of a fruity YET fresh and minty cologne, I am happy I bought it but will try a different one next time until I find my perfect cologne ;D. Good luck with your findings !!!</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and slightly different than what I am used to.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells fantastic--</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to everyone that is looking for a healthy lifestyle and to better take of themselves to the fullest</li>
            <li>It is a long way to the top if you want to Rock-n-Roll...!!</li>
            <li>which was TOO STRONG in my opinion)but not GREAT, otherwise there would be a PERFECT COLOGNE, while some not-so-long-lasting ones (like this one)smell really good, but for a short time.</li>
            <li>CLEAN, FRESH COLOGNE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is sporty and fresh.</li>
            <li>While there are plenty of \\&quot;nay-sayers\\&quot; that criticize the longevity, projection, and sillage - it is a light fragrance that still lingers many hours later.  </li>
            <li>As of now, you will still pay a premium for this juice - hey, it is worth it..</li>
            <li>I have been buying this cologne since the year it was released and it isboth one of my personal favorites and most importantly, along with that of girlfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Blue Sport offers a successful blend of citrus, fruit, musk, and woodsy notes with a splash of mint...</li>
            <li>Blue Sport offers great flexibility due to the many notes in the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I received the correct item and size exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;jury is still out\\&quot; on the bottle - I want to like it, but haven&#x27;t quite got there yet - my favorite color is blue</li>
            <li>I have moved it into my Top Ten.  </li>
            <li>(I went to Macy&#x27;s today and tested like the top 15 perfumes, I sprayed my favorite 6 in parts of my body and came back 20 minutes later to see how the sillage kicked in!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I wear T by Tommy, Chrome, Cool Water, Lucky You, and some similar scents.</li>
            <li>It smells great but its pretty weak, you have to spray a lot on because it fade very rapid.</li>
            <li>Does not have a strong smell and does not last.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne</li>
            <li>This cologne has a particular sophistication that the others lack.</li>
            <li>Will have to order a new one.</li>
            <li>Is fresh but classy, so you can actually use it at any ocassion.</li>
            <li>I think that the long lasting fragrances smell ok (i tried Allure Sport, L eau d&#x27; Issey,Acqua Di Gio, le Male and even A*MEN</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and my 19 yr old grandson has hijacked it.  </li>
            <li>I get green apples, mint, and a light musk, you may smell something else.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too heavy, not too light, and makes me smell (and feel) like a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sport has plenty of \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Everyone I talk to says after 2 hours it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>it is a little bit more masculine and solid than Blue Pony 1 in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I would rexommend this cologne to any young adult to mid age as it is a very diverse scent that is worthy of any late night or day-to-day activites</li>
            <li>packaging is first class - would you expect less from Ralph Lauren..??  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend trying/buying the relative new fragrance by Ralph Lauren, Polo Blue Sport...</li>

            <li> I received the correct item and size exactly as described.  I really like this cologne, it is sporty and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but it loses scent within hours. Similar scent retention to Ralph Laurens Red, White and Blue. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and my 19 yr old grandson has hijacked it.  Will have to order a new one.</li>
            <li> I get green apples, mint, and a light musk, you may smell something else. Longevity is average to below average. Great summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like it. Subtle fragrance yet very noticeable. Great product for the price and slightly different than what I am used to.</li>
            <li> smell don&#x27;t last like polo but it smells good</li>
            <li> one of best fragance that i ever used...</li>
            <li> Smells good, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Received timely and as stated</li>
            <li> I wear T by Tommy, Chrome, Cool Water, Lucky You, and some similar scents. This cologne has a particular sophistication that the others lack. There&#x27;s something very smooth on top that&#x27;s almost like a high-end whiff of awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A female coworker walked in my office and said, wow -- you smell like an expensive business man who trades stock and has an extremely diversified portfolio. I couldn&#x27;t agree more. This cologne smells fantastic-- it&#x27;s not too heavy, not too light, and makes me smell (and feel) like a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall and 100 lbs soaking wet. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong smell and does not last. I would not buy it again nor could I recommend it in good conscience.</li>
            <li> Strong smell, most women that have encountered it are pleased by it.  Not your fathers cologne.  Def will buy again.</li>
            <li> CLEAN, FRESH COLOGNE.&lt;br /&gt;MOST PEOPLE SAY POLO COLOGNE DOES NOT LAST LONG, BUT ALL POLO COLOGNE LAST LONG ON MY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I USE IT FOR WORK ONLY.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend trying/buying the relative new fragrance by Ralph Lauren, Polo Blue Sport... Blue Sport offers a successful blend of citrus, fruit, musk, and woodsy notes with a splash of mint... Very pleasant without being overbearing/overwhelming.  The fragrance is light with a uniqueness that is quite pleasant.  There are subtle similarities to Versace&#x27;s Pour Homme...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Sport has plenty of \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot; potential - Sweetie have a two thumbs up endorsement some eight hours after the initial application.  While there are plenty of \\&quot;nay-sayers\\&quot; that criticize the longevity, projection, and sillage - it is a light fragrance that still lingers many hours later.  Blue Sport offers great flexibility due to the many notes in the fragrance.  Any time of year and any event should work well.  (a great work office fragrance - smells great without offending those with sensitive noses..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is first class - would you expect less from Ralph Lauren..??  The \\&quot;jury is still out\\&quot; on the bottle - I want to like it, but haven&#x27;t quite got there yet - my favorite color is blue and I was hoping for some magnificent blue bottle - I am, however, warming up to the white bottle with striping.  As of now, you will still pay a premium for this juice - hey, it is worth it..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Blue Sport is 4.5 stars out of 5.  I have moved it into my Top Ten.  Ralph Lauren designs great scents and you feel great wearing them.  Go for it - a definitely recommend here.  It is a long way to the top if you want to Rock-n-Roll...!!</li>
            <li> My son loves this fragrance</li>
            <li> It´s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
            <li> Goes without saying. PRL makes good stuff. wearing anything of theirs you will feel like a million bucks without breaking the bank. This cologne will make you feel that way especially when complemented by their clothing. Thats for you guy that understand what I am saying.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with POLO brand. From their clothes to their fragances. I have had several colognes from them and this one just entered to my list. Is fresh but classy, so you can actually use it at any ocassion.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this cologne since the year it was released and it isboth one of my personal favorites and most importantly, along with that of girlfriend&#x27;s. I would rexommend this cologne to any young adult to mid age as it is a very diverse scent that is worthy of any late night or day-to-day activites</li>
            <li> The fragrance is one of the best Ive smelled (I went to Macy&#x27;s today and tested like the top 15 perfumes, I sprayed my favorite 6 in parts of my body and came back 20 minutes later to see how the sillage kicked in!) it is a little bit more masculine and solid than Blue Pony 1 in my opinion. Unfortunetely after 1-2 hours the smell stopped projecting as it used to, and by the 3rd hour the smell was gone for me. I think that the long lasting fragrances smell ok (i tried Allure Sport, L eau d&#x27; Issey,Acqua Di Gio, le Male and even A*MEN which was TOO STRONG in my opinion)but not GREAT, otherwise there would be a PERFECT COLOGNE, while some not-so-long-lasting ones (like this one)smell really good, but for a short time. Its relative, you should try this on a store and decide for yourself. The smell did not change that much for me, its sort-of a fruity YET fresh and minty cologne, I am happy I bought it but will try a different one next time until I find my perfect cologne ;D. Good luck with your findings !!!</li>
            <li> It smells great but its pretty weak, you have to spray a lot on because it fade very rapid. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent and I get a lot of compliments on it! Problem is it wears off after less than 2 hours. I end up spraying a lot more on in an effort to keep the scent. Everyone I talk to says after 2 hours it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
