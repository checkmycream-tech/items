            <li>It does a great job of blending.</li>
            <li>Great product buy picture is deceiving.  </li>
            <li>Not as great as it&#x27;s made out to be</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Easy application, great price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Also handy</li>
            <li>just the beautyblender purchased on itS own.</li>
            <li>I get really nice coverage with an even finish (I&#x27;m using Neutrogena skin clearing liquid foundation).  </li>
            <li>The soap does a great job of cleaning any makeup off the sponge, so it looks clean and unstained for a good amount of time :)</li>
            <li>Nothing else gets my BB as clean as this cleanser!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to blend with this.</li>
            <li>I love the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>blender expands when you dampen it (which you do before using), and when you&#x27;re done, you set it on top of the cylinder.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applies liquid foundation  much better than any brush or your fingers.</li>
            <li>I love my BB for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>This is authentic.</li>
            <li>and I love that sponge.</li>
            <li>Love the beautyblender.</li>
            <li>It works better then</li>
            <li>You guys need to do better.</li>
            <li>I love the way my makeup looks when I use my beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I am not always able to get all of the foundation off the sponge, but I figure if I get most of it, I&#x27;m doing all right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do have to use somewhat more foundation with this</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>NOTHIN COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY BLENDER.NOTHING!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure there are tutorials available elsewhere)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Beauty Blender but the picture was VERY misleading!!!</li>
            <li>gives you amazing foundation coverage, better than my Real Techniques</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is also easy.  </li>
            <li>However, after reading so many great reviews on the product, I gave in, and I will NEVER go back to cheap sponges or to applying makeup with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I kind of had to experiment to figure out exactly how to use it</li>
            <li>it is softer and is seems like it will tear more quickly.</li>
            <li>A beauty blender plus a bar of sponge cleanser, all in an awesome little container.</li>
            <li>its almost like I got duped and sent some cheap knock off sponge in a beautyblender package.</li>
            <li>Great product don&#x27;t look further for a makeup blender.</li>
            <li>I figured since it was free with a subscription, there was basically no risk involved.  </li>
            <li>So glad I got the real BB sponge, don&#x27;t bother with the knock-off brands, I&#x27;ve tried many</li>
            <li>However, the solid cleanser is AMAZING at cleaning the beauty blender!</li>
            <li>I first purchased a BB from birchbox after discovering it there, but then discovered that Amazon had much better deals on them.</li>
            <li>Just making sure everyone knows not to panic the first time they see this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used the Original Beauty Blender before and this one is not like it.</li>
            <li>My first one was purchased at Sephora and I love it.</li>
            <li>Name of the package specifies that there are 3 items: soap, original bb, mini bb.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but I have to work to clean it after each use, and there is still some staining.</li>
            <li>but it grows to full size.</li>
            <li>Love it and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I thought it was a full size and a mini.</li>
            <li>it works great, have not tried the soap on my other brushes yet.</li>
            <li>The product is great but the picture and description are extremely misleading.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to the knock-off brands, and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>but it was super</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am thrilled with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>Works best when used as directed (wet sponge, squeeze out, get off excess moisture with a clean towel, smear foundation on face, then tap with sponge like you are frantically tapping left on tinder to blend product.)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>grew mold real fast, I followed directions and still mold</li>
            <li>one more note: when you dampen and squeeze the blender to use it, the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This BB is exactly like the first one I purchased on birchbox, so no doubt about the authenticity of it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried using this with both my BB cream and my regular foundation, and I LOVE it for both.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more like a sample size to try out their solid cleanser.</li>
            <li>Got it fast!</li>
            <li>The first beauty blender I got from this was amaaaaaaazing.</li>
            <li>It is not the full size solid cleanser that you would receive if you purchase the solid cleanser on its own.</li>
            <li>is it the real stuff?</li>
            <li>It seems really counterintuitive to me to add water to a sponge,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you have to limit yourself to the solid cleanser that comes with this package; pretty much any bar of mild soap would do (I&#x27;m a fan of using Dove).  </li>
            <li>But when cleaning it didn&#x27;t run pink like other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the original size blender, mini + solid!</li>
            <li>But I received only soap and original bb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even a decent KNOCKOFF.</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with questioning the authenticity of this product; it is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>Although there are good knock-offs, none, including the Real Techniques sponges, will be as small when dry and still expand to full size wet.</li>
            <li>Was in need of a new Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>But my foundation is inexpensive and frequently goes on sale, so I&#x27;m OK with that -- especially because I get such a nice finish, even though it hardly takes any extra time at all.  </li>
            <li>Although this is a bright pink color, and some pink shows up on your soap or cleanser solid, this does *not</li>
            <li>You get one tiny solid to clean the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much bigger than the real one.</li>
            <li>So, I reordered another a few months later, thinking I would be just as pleased.</li>
            <li>the only thing you have ever bought are the knock off brands, or the dupes like Real Techniques (which I like BTW), this would seem a mini because it is significantly smaller when new than the others</li>
            <li>worth splurging on the real deal, I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li>I love how this applies evenly and blends out to as sheer or thick as I need it.</li>
            <li>The description clearly lists it as a mini solid.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t beat the discounted price and it arrived much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>the people saying it is a mini - all BB original minis are GREEN only - no other colors, only knock-offs offer other colors.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>but finally I broke down and got the real deal.</li>

            <li> but finally I broke down and got the real deal.</li>
            <li> It does get a little annoying to have to clean the beauty blender after each application, but that&#x27;s the only way to ensure that you are getting it properly clean and ready for your next makeup application.  </li>
            <li> As it dries, it slowly shrinks until it magically get small enough to fall back inside.</li>
            <li> I was such a skeptic of this product for SO long.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaints are 1) it does stain.</li>
            <li> The cheap ones that are this small stay this small, they do not grow.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not a happy person right now...</li>
            <li> I have actually used it on my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Everything stays together, no searching when it&#x27;s time to use or wash or dry the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when cleaning if you have long nails.</li>
            <li> it would only be the mini beautyblender+soap, there is no original sized beautyblender like I thought.</li>
            <li> But for some reason, when you use the cleanser, it gives off intensely pink bubbles.</li>
            <li> It bleeds a pink color every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> The problem is when you wash the sponge it bleeds pink.</li>
            <li> ALOT of pink.</li>
            <li> the pink dye sometimes comes off on my towels when I squeeze to remove the water.</li>
            <li> * turn your face pink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sponges...</li>
            <li> The price is competitive with other merchants for those items.)</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the chance.</li>
            <li> : I put the little bar of sponge cleanser inside the lid, and affix the lid to the underside of the container.</li>
            <li> what you get are the contents of the little cylinder, which are shown twice.  </li>
            <li> Also the mini BB comes in a 2 pack and is green, which isn&#x27;t pictured at all in the photo.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve order the 2 black BB&#x27;s in the past that was a set and never had a problem with the &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li> And when you get it wet, it forms to some weird shape and feels like wet tissue</li>
            <li> i usually read the reviews on Amazon</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was in need of a new Beauty Blender.  I couldn&#x27;t beat the discounted price and it arrived much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> You must have this for your foundation application!</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with the beauty blender! First of all, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with questioning the authenticity of this product; it is definitely the real deal. I first purchased a BB from birchbox after discovering it there, but then discovered that Amazon had much better deals on them. This BB is exactly like the first one I purchased on birchbox, so no doubt about the authenticity of it.  Second, my makeup goes on like a dream! I have tried using this with both my BB cream and my regular foundation, and I LOVE it for both. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve had my makeup airbrushed on. I also have that beautiful, dewy look that comes with airbrush makeup.  I was such a skeptic of this product for SO long. I was the girl saying I would NEVER pay this amount of money for a SPONGE. A sponge? Not happening. However, after reading so many great reviews on the product, I gave in, and I will NEVER go back to cheap sponges or to applying makeup with my fingers.  It does get a little annoying to have to clean the beauty blender after each application, but that&#x27;s the only way to ensure that you are getting it properly clean and ready for your next makeup application.  Ohhh, and for all of the dissapointed people regarding the soap. The description clearly lists it as a mini solid. It is definitely more like a sample size to try out their solid cleanser. It is not the full size solid cleanser that you would receive if you purchase the solid cleanser on its own. However, the solid cleanser is AMAZING at cleaning the beauty blender! Nothing else gets my BB as clean as this cleanser!! This is a great way to try out the soap along with your beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that to all the people who say this product is misleading, please read again. It says beauty blender + SOLID MINI... The solid soap is much bigger when you buy it on it&#x27;s own that&#x27;s why it is labled as &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;. Also the mini BB comes in a 2 pack and is green, which isn&#x27;t pictured at all in the photo.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender. It is far superior to the knock-off brands, and lasts much longer. The soap does a great job of cleaning any makeup off the sponge, so it looks clean and unstained for a good amount of time :)</li>
            <li> great for for setting under eye makeup. works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome. A beauty blender plus a bar of sponge cleanser, all in an awesome little container. And the blender is GREATNESS, everyone knows this. The hype is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blender expands when you dampen it (which you do before using), and when you&#x27;re done, you set it on top of the cylinder. As it dries, it slowly shrinks until it magically get small enough to fall back inside. Very handy. Also handy: I put the little bar of sponge cleanser inside the lid, and affix the lid to the underside of the container. Everything stays together, no searching when it&#x27;s time to use or wash or dry the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more note: when you dampen and squeeze the blender to use it, the water runs clear. But for some reason, when you use the cleanser, it gives off intensely pink bubbles. It&#x27;s crazy, and it looks like it would make your face look the same color - but somehow that doesn&#x27;t happen. Just making sure everyone knows not to panic the first time they see this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary: blends like nothing else, and gives off crazy but harmless pink bubbles.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Applies liquid foundation  much better than any brush or your fingers. Definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s pricey, but I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the results</li>
            <li> It does a great job of blending. It expands to double the size. Very easy to blend with this. I&#x27;ve bought knockoff brands and they take longer to blend</li>
            <li> is it the real stuff? I dont believe so</li>
            <li> Best make up tool out there! I love my BB for liquid foundation. Do not buy the cheaper ones, they do not work. It w&lt;br /&gt;Is worth splurging on the real deal, I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Best beauty sponge / blender ever! Buy it you&#x27;ll LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Love my Beauty blender!</li>
            <li> Great product buy picture is deceiving.  You get one tiny solid to clean the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Dont see what all yhe hipe was about</li>
            <li> This is authentic. It sits a tad different in the package than the BB alone because this has the mini Solid Cleaner in the package.&lt;br /&gt;For the people saying it is a mini - all BB original minis are GREEN only - no other colors, only knock-offs offer other colors.&lt;br /&gt;If the only thing you have ever bought are the knock off brands, or the dupes like Real Techniques (which I like BTW), this would seem a mini because it is significantly smaller when new than the others but it grows to full size. Although there are good knock-offs, none, including the Real Techniques sponges, will be as small when dry and still expand to full size wet. The cheap ones that are this small stay this small, they do not grow.&lt;br /&gt;This gives you amazing foundation coverage, better than my Real Techniques and I love that sponge. Be careful when cleaning if you have long nails.</li>
            <li> Not as great as it&#x27;s made out to be</li>
            <li> Got it fast! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> So glad I got the real BB sponge, don&#x27;t bother with the knock-off brands, I&#x27;ve tried many but finally I broke down and got the real deal. Works best when used as directed (wet sponge, squeeze out, get off excess moisture with a clean towel, smear foundation on face, then tap with sponge like you are frantically tapping left on tinder to blend product.) Soap that came with it works great, have not tried the soap on my other brushes yet.</li>
            <li> Love the beautyblender. Easy application, great price.</li>
            <li> I love the soap!!!! It works better then any I have ever tried,that is why I gave this 3 stars only because of the soap alone it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge however is not good. It bleeds a pink color every time I wash it. I have never had any sponge do that before.  It also is not the same texture and stiffness as it should be. I have used the Original Beauty Blender before and this one is not like it. it is softer and is seems like it will tear more quickly. this is from the Beautyblender but I don&#x27;t know why this one seems to be lessor in quality then just the beautyblender purchased on itS own. its almost like I got duped and sent some cheap knock off sponge in a beautyblender package.</li>
            <li> I needed a second BB. My first one was purchased at Sephora and I love it. What I received from my order is not a BB. It is a knock off. Everything about it is so different. The color bleeds, it feels like the density of a racket ball, it holds on to the water when it is dampened, the packaging and logos are different. Whatever this product is, it is not BeautyBlender.</li>
            <li> grew mold real fast, I followed directions and still mold</li>
            <li> This item came highly recommended and I have to admit I was disappointed. It does blend your foundation. The cleaner does remove make up. I have actually used it on my other brushes. The problem is when you wash the sponge it bleeds pink. ALOT of pink. Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sponges...NOTHIN COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY BLENDER.NOTHING!</li>
            <li> The first beauty blender I got from this was amaaaaaaazing. Perfect in every way. So, I reordered another a few months later, thinking I would be just as pleased. That would&#x27;ve been the case, had I not been sent a KNOCKOFF beauty blender. I knew something was wrong just by the color. It&#x27;s not even a decent KNOCKOFF. It&#x27;s so much bigger than the real one. And when you get it wet, it forms to some weird shape and feels like wet tissue paper.&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews, but I felt obligated to try and help anyone who is considering buying from this. It&#x27;s not worth the chance.</li>
            <li> Mislead by the description on item. I should of read reviews to know it would only be the mini beautyblender+soap, there is no original sized beautyblender like I thought.</li>
            <li> Love it and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Beauty Blender but the picture was VERY misleading!!! I thought I was getting the original size blender, mini + solid! Not a happy person right now...i usually read the reviews on Amazon but I&#x27;ve order the 2 black BB&#x27;s in the past that was a set and never had a problem with the &amp;#34;what you see is what you get&amp;#34; package. You guys need to do better. Smh.</li>
            <li> I love the way my makeup looks when I use my beauty blender. My only minor complaints are 1) it does stain. not sure if it&#x27;s my foundation or all foundations, but I have to work to clean it after each use, and there is still some staining. 2) the pink dye sometimes comes off on my towels when I squeeze to remove the water. Other than that, I am thrilled with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with a beauty blender! The product came timeiously and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love how this applies evenly and blends out to as sheer or thick as I need it.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the Mini blender just the bigger sponge</li>
            <li> The product is great but the picture and description are extremely misleading. I thought it was a full size and a mini. If I knew it was just the mini I would&#x27;ve bought the 2 pack for a cheaper price. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great product don&#x27;t look further for a makeup blender. This is perfect, the micro-mini ones are a must as well specially to blend around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this in a promotion from Birchbox.  I figured since it was free with a subscription, there was basically no risk involved.  Turns out, I actually like the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of getting used to.  It seems really counterintuitive to me to add water to a sponge, *then* put on my foundation.  But it works.  I get really nice coverage with an even finish (I&#x27;m using Neutrogena skin clearing liquid foundation).  I kind of had to experiment to figure out exactly how to use it (I&#x27;m sure there are tutorials available elsewhere) but it was super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is also easy.  I don&#x27;t think you have to limit yourself to the solid cleanser that comes with this package; pretty much any bar of mild soap would do (I&#x27;m a fan of using Dove).  Just scrub around for a bit, until the foundation comes off, then rinse.  Although this is a bright pink color, and some pink shows up on your soap or cleanser solid, this does *not* turn your face pink.  I am not always able to get all of the foundation off the sponge, but I figure if I get most of it, I&#x27;m doing all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use somewhat more foundation with this than I would if I was just applying it with my finger.  But my foundation is inexpensive and frequently goes on sale, so I&#x27;m OK with that -- especially because I get such a nice finish, even though it hardly takes any extra time at all.  (Please note that the title and photo are a bit misleading here -- what you get are the contents of the little cylinder, which are shown twice.  That is, you receive one beautybleander and one cleanser solid.  The price is competitive with other merchants for those items.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put on makeup without one! It makes my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li> Name of the package specifies that there are 3 items: soap, original bb, mini bb. But I received only soap and original bb. Should either change the name of a package or change picture. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a YouTube channel Makeupbysheaa and I can&#x27;t get enough of this I love it</li>
            <li> Love it! Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because I would like to stock up my kit with like 7 of these bad boys!</li>
            <li> Great tool! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Beauty blender arrived defective it had indents and didn&#x27;t expand the way it&#x27;s suppose to. But when cleaning it didn&#x27;t run pink like other reviewers experienced.</li>
