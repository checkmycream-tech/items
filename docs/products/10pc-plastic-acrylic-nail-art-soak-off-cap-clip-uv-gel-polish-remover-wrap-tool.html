            <li>The nail polish remover comes right out of these clips.</li>
            <li>I clip them right over my foil wrapped fingers.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much these have made The Nail Life easier!</li>

            <li>I have small hands so the clips are not snug, wish they were just a tad tighter, but overall they are great!</li>
            <li>They help keep the foil in place and the slight pressure they apply helps to soak off the gel polish very quickly and easily.  </li>

            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive they are especially being shipped directly from China.  </li>
            <li>These work very well for soaking off gel polish or heavy glitter polish with pure acetone if you have regular or bigger fingers.</li>

            <li> Especially with the thinner, flat cotton towelettes.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for soaking off gels, I hate clumsy foils that always fall off.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 5 minutes, no mess, no hassle,</li>
            <li> But that is to be expected since they are all the same size and finger</li>
            <li> A little difficult to do more than one hand alone unless you have someone helping you put them on.  </li>
            <li> I only use 5 at a time because there is no way I can put the other 5 on my hand while these are on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Plus these eliminate all that extra waste from using the foils.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because it isn&#x27;t for long nails and thick acrylic removal.</li>
            <li> So I read a review on here that said that these were really tight, the ones I got were not at ALL tight and actually kept falling off.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten to where I hate ANY scrubbing or rubbing to get polish off my nails, which is why I also use them for regular polish removal (I use a thick coat of top coat and it takes time to &#x27;crack&#x27; its&#x27; seal.).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even give it a thought anymore when I take down a glitter polish to use (off the wall rack</li>
            <li> I soak a half of a cotton ball in acetone polish remover and sit.</li>
            <li> Just put a little remover on a piece of cotton and put it down in the clip then put the clip onto your nail.</li>
            <li> Just dip a cotton ball in some polish remover (don&#x27;t soak it, the finger thingies are tight) and place it on your nail, then clamp the finger thingy on it.</li>
            <li> If a client has very long or thick nails</li>
            <li> They arrived as pictured,  spring could be a little stronger but work well.</li>
            <li> I do have a type of glitter that will leave a few pieces -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> I like glitter and sometimes have not used it in the past just thinking about the scrubbing required to remove it.</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be some are tighter on my fingers than others.  </li>
            <li> It has saved me at least 5 minutes off my time when performing a soak off gel polish service.  </li>
            <li> No more tinfoil for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired using foil to wrap my nails for gel removal was too time consuming and they would often fall off.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> They eliminate the use of awkward foil wraps to remove polish.</li>

            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> I was on a spending spree when I purchased these.  I could not imagine how they would be useful.  I was wrong.  They help keep the foil in place and the slight pressure they apply helps to soak off the gel polish very quickly and easily.  I have to say that I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had these clips now for 3 months. I use them to not only remove glitter polish but regular polish. I have gotten to where I hate ANY scrubbing or rubbing to get polish off my nails, which is why I also use them for regular polish removal (I use a thick coat of top coat and it takes time to &#x27;crack&#x27; its&#x27; seal.). I cannot tell you how much these have made The Nail Life easier! I like glitter and sometimes have not used it in the past just thinking about the scrubbing required to remove it. No Longer! I don&#x27;t even give it a thought anymore when I take down a glitter polish to use (off the wall rack I store them in). I do one hand at a time. Cut up my cotton balls, put on acetone, put on nail, put on clip and wait 6 minutes. Remove the clip, slide off the cotton. Glitter will slide off also. I do have a type of glitter that will leave a few pieces - I just use an orange stick to unstick them. Or put the cotton swab back on for another minute. Like I say, I love these. I change my polish anywhere from daily to sometimes three days (if I have a polish/mani design on that I especially love). These clips have held up very well to that much use. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Fast easy and tons better to work with than foil. I recommend any nail addict to add these to your nail items!</li>
            <li> Ideal is good but, clips are flimsy.  Broke on first use.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING! I would recommend these for anyone. It takes less than 5 minutes, no mess, no hassle, no work to get my nail polish off. Just dip a cotton ball in some polish remover (don&#x27;t soak it, the finger thingies are tight) and place it on your nail, then clamp the finger thingy on it. I leave them on for about 2-3 minutes, and the polish lifts off with the cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, buy these! They&#x27;re a great price and I had free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used them on my toes! (except my big toe)</li>
            <li> These are great.  A little difficult to do more than one hand alone unless you have someone helping you put them on.  They work well with just lint free wipes or wipes and foil.  I have done one hand and a foot at the same time.  My one complaint would be some are tighter on my fingers than others.  But that is to be expected since they are all the same size and finger aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nice item, easy to use!</li>
            <li> These work very well with gentle warmth applied (by wrapping the hand in a towel).  Leave on 15 minutes with cotton balls soaked in nail polish remover.  Gel polish pushes off well with a wooden orange stick.  These took over a month to arrive, so order early.  They are well made.</li>
            <li> they work great! just have to be sure to get them on all the way so that  it  soaks the gel polish off evenly</li>
            <li> Easy to hold pads on to soak polish off. Love the price too!</li>
            <li> Received item very quickly and used it in my salon. It is great for removal of gel polish but found it to be time consuming for the removal of acrylics. If a client has very long or thick nails this would not be a great product to use but other than that it saves money because it eliminates the need to purchase foil. All you need is a very small piece of cotton soaked in acetone, place the cotton on the top of the nail and clamp down. Its easy and more comfortable for my clients. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because it isn&#x27;t for long nails and thick acrylic removal. soak off time is about 7-10mins spending on the thickness.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. The nail polish remover comes right out of these clips. The have no purpose, busides to ruin your clother from the nail polish remover. Very disapointed. I &#x27;m returning this garbage.</li>
            <li> Love these for removing polish, no longer wrap fingers in foil.  Just place alittle bit of cotton soaked in acetone on nail and clip, and that is all there is too it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for soaking off gels, I hate clumsy foils that always fall off. Plus these eliminate all that extra waste from using the foils. Love these.</li>
            <li> These work well to take off nail polish or gel polish.  Just put a little remover on a piece of cotton and put it down in the clip then put the clip onto your nail.</li>
            <li> Wonderful not to have to worry about foil wraps falling off. I clip them right over my foil wrapped fingers. That way acetone will not touch clips thereby protecting them so they don&#x27;t deterorate.</li>
            <li> What a brilliant idea! Easily holds cotton balls soaked in acetone to remove gel nails and nail wraps without having to use foil wraps!</li>
            <li> These work great, and stay on well!! No more tinfoil for me! Wish I had purchased them sooner.</li>
            <li> Really much easier than foil...have to put more remover on because dries out quicker.  Comfortable on and stay on ....you can almost use your hand.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product</li>
            <li> These work very well for soaking off gel polish or heavy glitter polish with pure acetone if you have regular or bigger fingers. I&#x27;ve found that they slip off of my clients with tiny fingers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money these are worthless</li>
            <li> These are the best things!  SO much easier than foil.  Just get a cotton ball (I use cotton rounds cut into 1/4), put remover on it, place it on the fingernail, then add the clip.  Super easy.  Best part?  They&#x27;re reusable!  Springs are nice and strong.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> These do what they are supposed to and I don&#x27;t have to use my tin foil. I only use 5 at a time because there is no way I can put the other 5 on my hand while these are on my fingers. One always ends up falling off so I just do 5 at a time. This works for me, just takes longer than it would if I could do all 10 at the same time.</li>
            <li> These work great.  Especially with the thinner, flat cotton towelettes.  And much easier and cleaner than the tin foil route.</li>
            <li> They arrived as pictured,  spring could be a little stronger but work well.</li>
            <li> does not help remove the gel. leaks and moves around on your fingers and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my soak off caps.  I still can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive they are especially being shipped directly from China.  It has saved me at least 5 minutes off my time when performing a soak off gel polish service.  I would highly recommend them.  Nail Tech and salon owner.</li>
            <li> I really like them makes it so much easier to remove liquor polish</li>
            <li> Not to tight, good fit!</li>
            <li> Should fit fingers better, foil works better.</li>
            <li> If you do your own gel nails at home, these are a must have. They eliminate the use of awkward foil wraps to remove polish. I soak a half of a cotton ball in acetone polish remover and sit. Once the polish is flaking off you just have to peel it off with a cuticle stick.</li>
            <li> So I read a review on here that said that these were really tight, the ones I got were not at ALL tight and actually kept falling off.  Gave it 3 stars as it&#x27;s still easier than tinfoil.</li>
            <li> Work good...fast...I liked</li>
            <li> very good stuff and cheap too</li>
            <li> Excellent for removing color gel polish without making a mess!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired using foil to wrap my nails for gel removal was too time consuming and they would often fall off.  This product is very simple to use and it allows for me to quickly check the soaking progress of my remover.  I have small hands so the clips are not snug, wish they were just a tad tighter, but overall they are great!</li>
            <li> These make removal so much easier than using foil.  Unbelievable price, made well, seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are great, get all the polish off without doing them one at a time!</li>
            <li> not real tight but holds the soaked pads in place just fine .(Foil wraps can come off, too.)  I reinforce the wraps with the clips.</li>
