            <li>This clay isn&#x27;t as fine as I&#x27;d like it to be, since I&#x27;m using it as a powdered foundation primer, but it still works out okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to work with</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t turned me white lol.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was great and it came double bagged.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend using it for pregnant woman and people with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t advertised as being fine enough for that, anyway, and it&#x27;s good otherwise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s finely milled, mixes smoothly, and enables me to add exactly the ingredients my clients need.  </li>

            <li>I add some argon oil to make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin too much, even though I honestly don&#x27;t think it would be too much of a problem.</li>
            <li>Since my first trimester of pregnancy I had gums infections.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend other estheticians do the same - saves money, makes the clients happy, and allows for special treatment masques which otherwise may not be doable.</li>

            <li> I use for making  natural powder toothpaste with Calcium/Magnesium Natural Minerals and other ingredients.</li>
            <li> As long as you have something to store it in (bag isn&#x27;t resealable), this should be everything you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> My daughter went from having a rash regularly (when I used Desitin) not very, very RARELY getting a rash (only when she has an upset tummy).</li>
            <li> Not sure if i should, but don&#x27;t let the white color scare you.  </li>
            <li> Would like to try this clay on other projects.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended to buy kaolin clay and drink it ( 1 half teaspoon of kaolin clay dissolve in one cup of water) hour after food.</li>
            <li> I then had to transfer the clay to a resealable Ziploc bag, which was a bit messy.</li>
            <li> So no way to reseal, and opening was a delicate mission to not create a mess.</li>
            <li> I mix 1/4 cup into a pint sprayer and it does three trees that are small.  </li>
            <li> I could not eat hard food and my gums were bleeding.</li>
            <li> You have to respray after hard rain but it helps.  </li>
            <li> However it was sent in a bag that was twisted and knotted shut.</li>

            <li> The product arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good clay, smooth powder</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade diaper rash mixture and it works WONDERS! My daughter went from having a rash regularly (when I used Desitin) not very, very RARELY getting a rash (only when she has an upset tummy). Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This clay isn&#x27;t as fine as I&#x27;d like it to be, since I&#x27;m using it as a powdered foundation primer, but it still works out okay.  This wasn&#x27;t advertised as being fine enough for that, anyway, and it&#x27;s good otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use this clay to make bath bombs because it helps them to stay together and retain its shape.  I will be making facial masks with my daughter as she is all about facial masks.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality clay and it worked really well in my facial cleansers. However it was sent in a bag that was twisted and knotted shut. So no way to reseal, and opening was a delicate mission to not create a mess. I then had to transfer the clay to a resealable Ziploc bag, which was a bit messy. So 5 stars for the product. 1 star for the packaging.</li>
            <li> Using it as a face mask and it does a swell job! My face feels deep-cleaned and soft. I add some argon oil to make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin too much, even though I honestly don&#x27;t think it would be too much of a problem. It&#x27;s supposedly multifunctional so I can&#x27;t wait to try it on something else!</li>
            <li> Super gentle to use as a mask!!</li>
            <li> quick delivery- package was as advertised</li>
            <li> I use this to mix as a garden spray to deter stink bugs from my tomatoes and it works great.  It forms a shield that they don&#x27;t like to pierce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the quality of this clay!  It is easy to work with and does exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I utilize this in my hobby of cosmetic making and this is a really great product. It&#x27;s easy to work with and I&#x27;ve had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> i use this for ant control. Put it in a shaker bottle of somekind and sprinkle it anywhere there are ants - at the entry point and along the trail. no harm to you or your pets and kids. easy to vacuum up.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the company that sells it.</li>
            <li> Product as good as promised</li>
            <li> This clay is high-quality and works in every recipe I&#x27;ve tried so far. As long as you have something to store it in (bag isn&#x27;t resealable), this should be everything you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> I bought this to formulate masques for my esthetician practice.  It&#x27;s finely milled, mixes smoothly, and enables me to add exactly the ingredients my clients need.  I highly recommend other estheticians do the same - saves money, makes the clients happy, and allows for special treatment masques which otherwise may not be doable.</li>
            <li> Very soft, no scent. I used this to make a natural foot powder along with baking soda, arrowroot powder, and tea tree oil. Will buy it again when we run out.</li>
            <li> I am pleased  with product</li>
            <li> Since my first trimester of pregnancy I had gums infections. I could not eat hard food and my gums were bleeding. My friend recommended to buy kaolin clay and drink it ( 1 half teaspoon of kaolin clay dissolve in one cup of water) hour after food. Such a miracle! After two weeks of drinking kaolin clay my gums stopped bleeding! I strongly recommend using it for pregnant woman and people with bleeding gums. No side effects!</li>
            <li> I bought this to repel Japanese Beetles from my young apple trees.  You have to respray after hard rain but it helps.  I mix 1/4 cup into a pint sprayer and it does three trees that are small.  No beetles are harmed as this just gets them to move on and eat my pole beans!</li>
            <li> I like the Kaolin. I keep it in the bag it came in and keep that bag in a coffee can. Gave my daughter some to add to her homemade soap. One of the recipes she makes with coconut oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, and kaolin is wonderful. Makes your skin feel so clean yet so soft.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this clay!!  I use it as a setting powder.  Not sure if i should, but don&#x27;t let the white color scare you.  It hasn&#x27;t turned me white lol.  I also used some of it as a mask...LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> It was pure and perfect.  I drink it as a colon cleanser.  It works well and satisfies my iron deficiency.  I will order this again.  Shipping was great and it came double bagged. Thank you!</li>
            <li> very fine and velvety, I love it, and its amazing in my products. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again soon :)</li>
            <li> Kept the apple worms from infecting the apples</li>
            <li> Impressed with the quality and price. Definitely plan on purchasing this again. Would like to try this clay on other projects.</li>
            <li> I like how it arrived quickly, it has a low cost &amp; its a very good product for your face as a mask it works very good&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You</li>
            <li> Use a mixture of the power and some oil to put on fingernails prior to buffing. Happy with the shine and healthy looking nails after buffing my nails.</li>
            <li> I use for making  natural powder toothpaste with Calcium/Magnesium Natural Minerals and other ingredients. And it&#x27;s works perfect for me. Thank you !</li>
