            <li>By far my favorite scrub!!!!</li>
            <li>The tub of oil and salts separates after manufacture (like organic peanut butter does) and the oil rises to a top layer.</li>
            <li>but fyi its like 4-5 dollars at the store :) I thought it was a bulk buy..</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure there was a relationship, but regardless I prefer not to take chances.  </li>

            <li>This product is great ,leave my skin soft and shining, I love it ,I use it at night before bed and leave it on my skin so the nexth morning my skin look espectacular.</li>
            <li>This is a nice body scrub with a pleasant lavender fragrance, but note that the seller is not the manufacturer and that you&#x27;re dealing with a third party.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered a sample program from a very reputable all organic company, and 4 of the 7 samples contained lavender oil.  </li>
            <li>Think I will make my own next time too pricey for just salt.</li>
            <li>It seems lavender oil is quickly becoming a go to for organic and natural cosmetic companies.  </li>
            <li>nice i swin every day, and i had dry my skin</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous and leaves my skin soft and silky. ...</li>
            <li>I really like the salt scrub from Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am so glad that Amazon has sellers who carry this scrub because we live a long way from Trader Joe&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>May have been carriers fault but could have packed more tightly</li>
            <li>Nothing makes my skin feel so soft as Trader Joe&#x27;s salt scrubs, and my skin feels brand new!!  </li>
            <li>After using the product while in my shower, my skin began to burn--and I don&#x27;t mean lightly.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it&#x27;s less than $7.00 if you buy this at trader joes.  </li>
            <li>I did not hear back from this seller, so I emailed Trader Joe&#x27;s directly and they said it is NOT intended to be a facial scrub.</li>

            <li> This is a nice body scrub with a pleasant lavender fragrance, but note that the seller is not the manufacturer and that you&#x27;re dealing with a third party. The tub of oil and salts separates after manufacture (like organic peanut butter does) and the oil rises to a top layer. In fact, it will continue to separate and need to be stirred up on an ongoing basis. I did not hear back from this seller, so I emailed Trader Joe&#x27;s directly and they said it is NOT intended to be a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it&#x27;s less than $7.00 if you buy this at trader joes.  It&#x27;s a nice product...the less than five stars is the for the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best! Seriously!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! no need for lotion ever again! but fyi its like 4-5 dollars at the store :) I thought it was a bulk buy.. so ill go to the store to get it. But def a must have for every bathroom!</li>
            <li> nice i swin every day, and i had dry my skin, this product is good iI used every day after my swinn pool i recomender</li>
            <li> I really like the salt scrub from Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>

            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> After using the product while in my shower, my skin began to burn--and I don&#x27;t mean lightly. I had to immediately wash off the scrub but it continued to burn for a short time. Thinking I might have done something wrong, I tried it again and again felt the burn. I threw the product away.</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love it!!!!!!!!  Have used for several tears.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month along with a few other products containing lavender oil.  My hormones went crazy and I got a nasty yeast infection.  I can&#x27;t be sure there was a relationship, but regardless I prefer not to take chances.  It seems lavender oil is quickly becoming a go to for organic and natural cosmetic companies.  It&#x27;s in laundry detergent, dish soaps, perfumes, body waxes, hand sanitizer, shampoo, body lotion, deodorant, air freshener, and even in some food products.  I recently ordered a sample program from a very reputable all organic company, and 4 of the 7 samples contained lavender oil.  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t use this product. Just get the facts and make an informed decision especially if your children will be using it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! Smells fabulous and leaves my skin soft and silky. ...</li>
            <li> Great scrub, but sells for $5.99 at Trader Jo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this salt scrub i did not buy it here but at trader joes it works so well i usually dont care for salt scrubs but i tried this and was amazed!the granuals actually scrub instead of just washing away or melting! it is really moisturizing a great buy i will keep buying this product until they discontinue it because my skin feels amazing after this ! So relaxing it fills the room with lavender and is great to use before bed for a restful sleep</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing. My Nana let me try hers and I immediately fell in love! It&#x27;s not supposed to be a salt scrub, it doesn&#x27;t specify that on the label. It is so fragrant and so moisturizing that I find that I do not even need to use lotion afterwards. I used it 3-5 times a week. My only con is that the jar isn&#x27;t bigger, I tend to run out in a month, but that could just be because I use it so often. You will definitely not regret this scrub!</li>
            <li> ....she loves it.....so I love it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite scrub!!!!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in this scrub. It is all salt and NO FRAGRANCE at all. I had to buy lavender essential oil to put in it. Then it will be what I want. Think I will make my own next time too pricey for just salt.</li>
            <li> This product is great ,leave my skin soft and shining, I love it ,I use it at night before bed and leave it on my skin so the nexth morning my skin look espectacular.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, this is a rub that&#x27;s great. Only precaution you need to take is have a towel under you to catch falling salt grains.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub!!!  Nothing makes my skin feel so soft as Trader Joe&#x27;s salt scrubs, and my skin feels brand new!!  I use it about once every two weeks.  I am so glad that Amazon has sellers who carry this scrub because we live a long way from Trader Joe&#x27;s.  Wonderful, just wonderful and economical product!!!</li>
