            <li>This is one of the best chapsticks I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome.</li>
            <li>All of Aquaphor&#x27;s products are great!</li>
            <li>best.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor Lip Repair is that good!</li>
            <li>After 3 days using this, however, my lips are as good as I can ever remember!</li>
            <li>The 2 pack is a great price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Has a nice slanted applicator(an</li>
            <li>After just one use my lips feel nice and moist.  </li>
            <li>At first I was really impressed with this lip balm, it went on so smooth</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been loyal to Carmex for a good eight years.</li>
            <li>I carry it around in my pocket every winter, apply a couple times a day, and my lips stay healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I made sure I had one tube everywhere (car, purse, bathroom, anywhere I could think of) and it was a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Just like the Aquaphor for skin that I love.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more as chapped lips</li>
            <li>but after a 4or 5 days I noticed it wasn&#x27;t healing my lips and began to revert to being more chapped than before.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars because there is nothing more I expect from a lip healing product.</li>
            <li>Why I love it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works well to keep them feeling great year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>So far, the best I&#x27;ve found is Lypsyl Intense Protection.</li>
            <li>which is huge.  </li>
            <li>Not chapped/dry, but comfortable.  </li>
            <li>why don&#x27;t we get the first fact out of the way: no matter how you slice it aquaphor is simply the best product for chapped lips and pretty much any kind of dryness.</li>
            <li>This lip balm lasts pretty long between applications and has a pleasant taste; moisturizers my lips better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>I tried so many chapsticks, lip balms, Vaseline, etc and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>I have very dry lips, this is by far the best product I have found to keep them moist and crack-free.  </li>
            <li>Buy and enjoy ;-)</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything more special than petroleum jelly (one of its main ingredients), but it certainly does the job for me.  </li>
            <li>Used it last night and amazingly</li>
            <li>and it leaves my lips feeling very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a better job and lasts longer (I don&#x27;t have to apply it as frequently).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this lip treatment for a couple of days but so far it works great.</li>
            <li>Perfectly good product, but if you&#x27;re looking for Aquaphor Healing Ointment in packaging suitable for use as a lip balm (i.e., with an angled tip for application, and small enough to fit in a pocket), this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review.</li>
            <li>No taste or funny smell</li>
            <li>My next favorite is Neutragena.</li>
            <li>in prime condition, easily portable, and if you dont use it often enough that it liquefies, then you still win as you&#x27;re spared any hard feelings tossing this in the circular file.</li>
            <li>Even exfoliating them in the shower with a washcloth wasn&#x27;t enough to smooth them out anymore.</li>
            <li>It really is--</li>
            <li>This lip balm really works.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient</li>
            <li>My lips was chapped and cracked for almost a week straight.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of different products, and this was the only one to give me any kind of relief.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my lips feel - and I only have to put it one once or twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Within the next few days, my lips were as good as new!!!</li>
            <li>I tried many other lip balms.</li>
            <li>I prefer this product to most other lip care solutions.</li>
            <li>I still think the regular Aquaphor is the overall better (and cheaper) choice though.</li>
            <li>And this particular version of it DOES HEAL.  </li>
            <li>Just protects from further drying, though it wore off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Great if you have a dry mouth medical condition and your lips are very dry as a result.</li>
            <li>normal this am.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works fine, but it is not really worth the additional costs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands only to end up with dryer lips.  </li>
            <li>This is incredible considering that every single other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried only coats lips with a moisture barrier for a short amount of time and does nothing to actually improve them.</li>
            <li>The only con is it is somewhat greasy and makes your lips really shiny.</li>
            <li>Within minutes the area felt soft and moisturized again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;having said that, nobody wants to carry around that bulky tub of aquaphor during the day and we all know that the big tube liquefies after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My upper lip cracked right in the middle</li>
            <li>I highly recommend as it protects your lips and repairs @ the same time!</li>
            <li>I bought this to help with my dry lips from taking Accutane and it really works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aquaphor really does provide immediate relief to extremely dry and chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>maybe you wish it didn&#x27;t make your lips glossy or that it came in cherry flavor with sparkles, but when its winter, the air is dry, your lips are straight up cracking, aquaphor is your first-line</li>
            <li>This got thrown in my nightstand with all the other products I&#x27;ve purchased that don&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY chapstick type product I use anymore - highly recommend for dry chapped lips.  </li>

            <li> The only downside to the non-lip repair version is the tubes don&#x27;t come in the convenient \\&quot;lip style\\&quot; tube, so it is harder to get a small amount (the opening is bigger and the product is thicker).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but comparing from other chapsticks, I would definately put this as my number one choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intense enough to provide relief for the worst cases, yet still gentle enough to use for everyday moisture.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it arrived after the estimated ship date.</li>

            <li> , I was blowing my nose so much from a cold that my under my nose was getting chapped, I put some of the product onto my finger and worked into the irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it keeps my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> Anything that contains petroleum only makes my lips worse.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone frustrated with dry, cracking lips.</li>
            <li> For all intents and purposes, you&#x27;ll do just as well with the moisturizing Chapstick or with plain Vaseline on your lips.</li>
            <li> I went on the hunt for an intense product to heal my severely chapped and painful lips from being on Accutane.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop cold turkey and, boy, were my lips so red and chapped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Is not too thick feeling on your lips</li>
            <li> (One .35fl Oz tube lasted me about a month of continuous use -- by continuous, I mean every hour or 2).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone like me who suffers from awful chapped lips all year around.</li>
            <li> Try it--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you have terrible cracking, peeling, and bleeding lips, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I have the WORST chapped lips ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been loyal to Carmex for a good eight years. Recently, I had forgotten my Carmex twice or thrice that my lips became severely chapped. Even exfoliating them in the shower with a washcloth wasn&#x27;t enough to smooth them out anymore. I decided to stop cold turkey and, boy, were my lips so red and chapped. I had vitamin E oil and used that for a couple of days, and I saw no improvement. My upper lip cracked right in the middle, all the way up passed my lip, and it hurt so badly.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try either the Neosporin or Aquaphor lip balm, and opted for the latter. The very next day, my lips were healing, that I could gently rub off the dead skin cells off my lips. Within the next few days, my lips were as good as new!!! I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to keep putting lip balm on my lips every so often.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my dry lips from taking Accutane and it really works well. Although the corners of my mouth cracked and it couldn&#x27;t heal that. But I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to. I think I&#x27;ll use this for the rest of my life it works so well. The only con is it is somewhat greasy and makes your lips really shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both regular Aquaphor and Aquaphor Lip Repair as a lip treatment. I prefer the regular Aquaphor. It seems to do a better job and lasts longer (I don&#x27;t have to apply it as frequently).  You can buy the regular Aquaphor in the same sized (.35 oz) tubes, and it is quite a bit cheaper than the \\&quot;Lip Repair\\&quot; version.  Amazon is currently selling a 6-pack of the .35 oz (Regular) tubes for $12-13, so close to $2 per tube.  The only downside to the non-lip repair version is the tubes don&#x27;t come in the convenient \\&quot;lip style\\&quot; tube, so it is harder to get a small amount (the opening is bigger and the product is thicker).  I still think the regular Aquaphor is the overall better (and cheaper) choice though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend as it protects your lips and repairs @ the same time!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY chapstick type product I use anymore - highly recommend for dry chapped lips.  The 2 pack is a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. I use it everyday and it keeps my lips moisturized. It leaves a satin finish, not matte, so if you&#x27;re a guy who does not want to look like you have lip gloss on, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside of this for me is the lack of SPF. Will try Aquaphor&#x27;s SPF lip repair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best chapsticks I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s for extremely dry lips especially for the winter when the creases of your lips are dry/cracked.. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but comparing from other chapsticks, I would definately put this as my number one choice.</li>
            <li> Perfectly good product, but if you&#x27;re looking for Aquaphor Healing Ointment in packaging suitable for use as a lip balm (i.e., with an angled tip for application, and small enough to fit in a pocket), this isn&#x27;t it. It is similar to the Healing Ointment in texture, color, etc. but the ingredients are totally different.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was advised on the Acne.org forums that this is a MUST during an Accutane treatment.  It really is-- I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor really does provide immediate relief to extremely dry and chapped lips.  And this particular version of it DOES HEAL.  I forgot to take this with me to a hangout once, and it was a living nightmare.  By the end of the night my lips were so dry they were cracking and bleeding all over.  I applied Aquaphor when I got home, and the cuts were gone the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything more special than petroleum jelly (one of its main ingredients), but it certainly does the job for me.  I&#x27;m about to purchase another pack!  (One .35fl Oz tube lasted me about a month of continuous use -- by continuous, I mean every hour or 2).</li>
            <li> I suffered from dry, cracked, bleeding and peeling lips every winter for years. When the air starts to get dry, my lips immediately peel, and I used to wake up with my lips covered in scabs and blood. I tried so many chapsticks, lip balms, Vaseline, etc and nothing really worked. I tried out Aquaphor lip repair one day, and now I never need to worry about dry, bleeding lips again. I carry it around in my pocket every winter, apply a couple times a day, and my lips stay healthy and moisturized. If you have terrible cracking, peeling, and bleeding lips, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I went on the hunt for an intense product to heal my severely chapped and painful lips from being on Accutane. I tried a bunch of different products, and this was the only one to give me any kind of relief. I made sure I had one tube everywhere (car, purse, bathroom, anywhere I could think of) and it was a miracle worker. I am no longer on Accutane and this is still the only product I will use. It&#x27;s intense enough to provide relief for the worst cases, yet still gentle enough to use for everyday moisture. I have even bought several tubes for family members and cousins. Try it--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Just like the Aquaphor for skin that I love. This lip balm lasts pretty long between applications and has a pleasant taste; moisturizers my lips better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Great if you have a dry mouth medical condition and your lips are very dry as a result. I will buy another 2 for purse and golf bag.</li>
            <li> my lips were so chapped constantly that I couldn&#x27;t get them healed up no matter what I tried. after the 2nd day on this lip repair, my lips are the softest they have been in years. I will be ordering more as chapped lips seems to run in or family. this is an excellent product.  update. At first I was really impressed with this lip balm, it went on so smooth but after a 4or 5 days I noticed it wasn&#x27;t healing my lips and began to revert to being more chapped than before. I will not order this again</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this stuff!  I have a problem with chapped lips and have tried almost everything recommeded on the market.  This stuff works!  I love how soft it makes my lips feel - and I only have to put it one once or twice a day.  Here&#x27;s a bonus - my fingers crack and split in the winter.  Once a day I put a little bit of this on the ends of my fingers and they have not cracked once this winter.  Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I give it 5 stars because there is nothing more I expect from a lip healing product. Why I love it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The low price&lt;br /&gt;- Began repairing withing 1-2 applications&lt;br /&gt;- Fully repaired my chapped lips within 2-3 days of use&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;- Has no taste&lt;br /&gt;- Is not too thick feeling on your lips but enough where you can tell it has moisture and is doing its job(similar to petroleum jelly)&lt;br /&gt;- Has a nice slanted applicator(an extra bonus!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was blowing my nose so much from a cold that my under my nose was getting chapped, I put some of the product onto my finger and worked into the irritated skin. Within minutes the area felt soft and moisturized again. Will purchase again once this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> This lip balm really works.  After just one use my lips feel nice and moist.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands only to end up with dryer lips.  All of Aquaphor&#x27;s products are great!</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review. Aquaphor Lip Repair is that good! I have chronicle chapped lips every fall. Nothing worked as well as Aquaphor. I tried many other lip balms. Anything that contains petroleum only makes my lips worse. After 3 days using this, however, my lips are as good as I can ever remember! Give this a shot.</li>
            <li> the only product that actually fixes my lips when they are chapped.&lt;br /&gt;also really works well to keep them feeling great year round.&lt;br /&gt;the best.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me when I was on Accutane and I still use it all the time. It will give you the softest lips ever!!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d yesterday.  Used it last night and amazingly (with no reapply) my lips are back to normal this am.  Not chapped/dry, but comfortable.  Also, not greasy - which is huge.  Buy and enjoy ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this lip treatment for a couple of days but so far it works great. Very convenient and it leaves my lips feeling very hydrated and smooth. I put it on alone or under my lipstick. I would highly recommend this to anyone like me who suffers from awful chapped lips all year around. My only complaint is that it arrived after the estimated ship date. Tisk tisk.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips, this is by far the best product I have found to keep them moist and crack-free.  I highly recommend to anyone frustrated with dry, cracking lips.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I am never without it.  No taste or funny smell, my husband even likes it and he never likes any lip product.  I have been wondering if they make it in a stick for him to carry in his pocket?</li>
            <li> My lips was chapped and cracked for almost a week straight. I tried blistex, burt bees ultra conditioning, they just didn&#x27;t worked well.&lt;br /&gt;Then my friend told me to buy Aquaphor and I give it a try..Boom..my lips were healed overnight no kidding!! The crack on my lip  was sealed and healed like miracle in just one night. I would really recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works very well for me. It hydrates and doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue on my lips after it&#x27;s been on for a while. I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it!</li>
            <li> This Aquaphor Lip Repair actually improves the quality of the texture of your lips, prevents cracking and instantly soothes. This is incredible considering that every single other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried only coats lips with a moisture barrier for a short amount of time and does nothing to actually improve them. Unlike other intensive lip treatments Aquaphor LR doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast to your lips. I absolutely love this stuff. As long as Aquaphor keeps making it, I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I prefer this product to most other lip care solutions. It is moisturizing and easy to dispense. Not waxy. My next favorite is Neutragena.</li>
            <li> This product works fine, but it is not really worth the additional costs. For all intents and purposes, you&#x27;ll do just as well with the moisturizing Chapstick or with plain Vaseline on your lips.</li>
            <li> I have the WORST chapped lips ever. Have had them for over 2 years. Nothing seems to work. This got thrown in my nightstand with all the other products I&#x27;ve purchased that don&#x27;t really help. It didn&#x27;t seem to have any moisturizing (penetrating) effect. Just protects from further drying, though it wore off fairly quickly. So far, the best I&#x27;ve found is Lypsyl Intense Protection. It&#x27;s the only one that stays on (for me anyway) all night.</li>
            <li> why don&#x27;t we get the first fact out of the way: no matter how you slice it aquaphor is simply the best product for chapped lips and pretty much any kind of dryness. maybe you wish it didn&#x27;t make your lips glossy or that it came in cherry flavor with sparkles, but when its winter, the air is dry, your lips are straight up cracking, aquaphor is your first-line option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;having said that, nobody wants to carry around that bulky tub of aquaphor during the day and we all know that the big tube liquefies after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;solution? boom: the travel pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;always in prime condition, easily portable, and if you dont use it often enough that it liquefies, then you still win as you&#x27;re spared any hard feelings tossing this in the circular file. next.</li>
