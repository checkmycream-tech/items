            <li>/&gt;this is the exfoliation, which is a good thing, not bad, and I have a gentle&lt;br /&gt;exfoliating sponge which I use in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

            <li>I really love the way that the cream feels on my face.</li>

            <li>I. Feel as though this product has made my face look more youthful.</li>
            <li>Love this resurface night cream.</li>
            <li>While I have never been able to find</li>
            <li>This is an ok night cream.</li>
            <li>It seems that my foundation applies more smoothly as well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this provides much except for a good nighttime</li>
            <li>The good news is that since I have been using this, I haven&#x27;t had to that very often either.</li>
            <li>My wife and I used their eye product and we liked it very much</li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in my pore size as well as a decrease in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face neck and decolette area.  </li>
            <li>have no wrinkles and my fine lines</li>
            <li>are so fine that I do not notice them.....</li>
            <li>And their customer support is super!</li>
            <li>Customer service for this new company is particularly exceptional.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this cream!</li>
            <li>No Animal Testing Cruelty Free and Made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and I and very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li>was emailed a coupon code to get the product for free.</li>
            <li>Every morning my face looks and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>In exchange for trying the product for free I was invited to provide a review.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and moisturizing, but with the breakouts this week, I can not continue using this product.</li>
            <li>They are responsive and helpful and are clearly trying to generate support or good conservative feedback and they deserve it.  </li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on my skin and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li>I just have to start by saying that I am madly in love love love with this product.he second</li>
            <li>and I am excited I did.  </li>
            <li>Bought this cream &amp; liked it enough to want more.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for anyone looking to have better looking</li>
            <li>Was not expected but was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>My skin is in pretty good condition from all I have used on it over the last 10 years</li>
            <li>As I age, my skin has become drier and as a result I am constantly on the lookout for effective moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>FAR BETTER than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I can smell a light hint of it as I drift off to sleep and that may be my second favorite part of</li>
            <li>I put it in the refrigerator during the day so that night is would be nice and cool on such a hot day.</li>
            <li>This cream is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed the dark circles under my eyes beginning to fade more and more over time, as well.  </li>
            <li>and I wake up with my face being amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>sure enough, my face was no longer sticky.  </li>
            <li>Well, maybe it&#x27;s me, but after I apply it my face is sticky and applying makeup is difficult at best.</li>
            <li>Cream has great ingredients just a bit too thick for my liking.  </li>
            <li>So when I started using this I could tell in the first night that it was helping.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines and wrinkles are becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>For me, using a skin cream is about more than the actual cream; it&#x27;s the whole experience.  </li>
            <li>It is so good to firm up your skin and prevent future fine lines and</li>
            <li>It feels so nice that I am tempted to use more, but the instructions say that only a little bit is needed.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought oh I&#x27;m using too much.</li>
            <li>The only way I could get it to not leave a residue was to use a day lotion first then use this extremely lightly.</li>
            <li>but I am still concerned with future fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love when products deliver instant results with absolutely no irritation or strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This cream feels very moisturizing</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see anything else going on.</li>
            <li>With this cream, I feel very pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if my skin was very damaged I would see some result..who knows ?</li>
            <li>I started out not liking this cream because it felt very sticky.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Too much make you sticky.</li>
            <li>The cream itself does not have much of a smell</li>
            <li>Throughout my four days I really have not noticed anything much when it comes to changes.</li>
            <li>I even use it lightly under my eyes if they are extra puffy in the morning.</li>
            <li>using just a short time Iâ€™m quite pleased with the results -- have noticed a marked improvement in my skin tone and</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I did not find it too thick either, got absorbed very easily.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty jar that came in a cute little bag.</li>
            <li>The cute little pouch it comes in.  </li>
            <li>so much I will happily reorder when this jar is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; stands behind their product with a 365 Day Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not that thrilled about is the slight smell.  </li>
            <li>it does leave the skin smooth but so do other creams too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Purchased same product again, a bit more expensive now, yes, but okay.</li>
            <li>(First order was 2oz, 2nd was 1oz)</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have used these past couple days, so for me this was kind of downer.</li>
            <li>Protege Night Moisturizer makes my face feel tight, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time staying on a routine at night, I would probably have better results if I could apply this every evening</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.  </li>
            <li>but once it does you will not believe how soft your skin will be.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to see</li>
            <li>I do not have very dry skin, but I think this provides the right amount of moisture for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It spreads easy, a small amount is all you need.  </li>
            <li>NO SIZE/OZ mentioned anywhere in description/product details.., which I didn&#x27;t think to even pay attention to, since I had clicked on the item from my previous orders--same thing right?</li>
            <li>I recently lost 125 pounds so I am left with a few fine lines and tightening needed on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The company advises that you use a very light layer, and I found that a few drops of water on my fingers helps thin it out just right.</li>
            <li>I apply this product last in my evening regimen and I have been waking up with clear, glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is also more clear and a few dark spots on my chin are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>I feel like I just spent lots of money at a high end department store.  </li>
            <li>This is extremely unfortunate as I did like the cream AND have paid far more for facial products in my life.</li>
            <li>combine this with Argon oil; first apply the oil, wait a few minutes, then&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li>The night cream was nice and thick and has very little smell but</li>
    </ol>

            <li> sure enough, my face was no longer sticky.  </li>
            <li> Well, maybe it&#x27;s me, but after I apply it my face is sticky and applying makeup is difficult at best.</li>
            <li> Cream has great ingredients just a bit too thick for my liking.  </li>
            <li> So when I started using this I could tell in the first night that it was helping.  </li>
            <li> my fine lines and wrinkles are becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> For me, using a skin cream is about more than the actual cream; it&#x27;s the whole experience.  </li>
            <li> It is so good to firm up your skin and prevent future fine lines and</li>
            <li> It feels so nice that I am tempted to use more, but the instructions say that only a little bit is needed.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought oh I&#x27;m using too much.</li>
            <li> The only way I could get it to not leave a residue was to use a day lotion first then use this extremely lightly.</li>
            <li> but I am still concerned with future fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love when products deliver instant results with absolutely no irritation or strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This cream feels very moisturizing</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see anything else going on.</li>
            <li> With this cream, I feel very pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if my skin was very damaged I would see some result..who knows ?</li>
            <li> I started out not liking this cream because it felt very sticky.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Too much make you sticky.</li>
            <li> The cream itself does not have much of a smell</li>
            <li> Throughout my four days I really have not noticed anything much when it comes to changes.</li>
            <li> I even use it lightly under my eyes if they are extra puffy in the morning.</li>
            <li> using just a short time Iâ€™m quite pleased with the results -- have noticed a marked improvement in my skin tone and</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did not find it too thick either, got absorbed very easily.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty jar that came in a cute little bag.</li>
            <li> The cute little pouch it comes in.  </li>
            <li> so much I will happily reorder when this jar is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; stands behind their product with a 365 Day Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not that thrilled about is the slight smell.  </li>
            <li> it does leave the skin smooth but so do other creams too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Purchased same product again, a bit more expensive now, yes, but okay.</li>
            <li> (First order was 2oz, 2nd was 1oz)</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have used these past couple days, so for me this was kind of downer.</li>
            <li> Protege Night Moisturizer makes my face feel tight, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time staying on a routine at night, I would probably have better results if I could apply this every evening</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.  </li>
            <li> but once it does you will not believe how soft your skin will be.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to see</li>
            <li> I do not have very dry skin, but I think this provides the right amount of moisture for all skin types.</li>
            <li> It spreads easy, a small amount is all you need.  </li>
            <li> NO SIZE/OZ mentioned anywhere in description/product details.., which I didn&#x27;t think to even pay attention to, since I had clicked on the item from my previous orders--same thing right?</li>
            <li> I recently lost 125 pounds so I am left with a few fine lines and tightening needed on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The company advises that you use a very light layer, and I found that a few drops of water on my fingers helps thin it out just right.</li>
            <li> I apply this product last in my evening regimen and I have been waking up with clear, glowing skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also more clear and a few dark spots on my chin are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just spent lots of money at a high end department store.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely unfortunate as I did like the cream AND have paid far more for facial products in my life.</li>
            <li> combine this with Argon oil; first apply the oil, wait a few minutes, then&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> The night cream was nice and thick and has very little smell but</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned, mainly for the grease/oil factor.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with soft skin that is not greasy (a common effect of many other night moisturizers that I have used in the past).  </li>
            <li> and though the company is very helpful in trying to offer advice, I am not pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, so a little goes a long way (which I love, because it will last forever!)  </li>
            <li> recently received ResurFACE Premium Moisturizing Anti Wrinkle Night Cream for Dry Skin for a product review.</li>
            <li> After a few days I could tell that it was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> and my face wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> In late 40&#x27;s so starting to pay attention to signs of old age ...&lt;</li>
            <li> my face looked clear and firm!  </li>
            <li> It comes in a small 1 oz jar that should last about 2 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I feel my facial skin is tighter and less wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;evident,</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small jar so it is not going to last long.</li>
            <li> It was one of those mornings I expected to look in the mirror and&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much so a little bit goes long way.</li>
            <li> But other then that it works.</li>
            <li> would suggest to give it a try based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> using several days is a little flakiness and a little stinging.  </li>
            <li> In two days, the dry patches I have on my face (around/under my jaw) were gone, and when I forgot it for a few days</li>
            <li> wife is difficult to please when it comes to these kind of products as they are often too expensive or oily or leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really strong, but it&#x27;s certainly not that pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the MEZMEREYS product and utilized the half price offer for the RESURFACE product.  </li>
            <li> also less baggy under eyes</li>
            <li> So many creams are ruined for me because they have such a heavy, unpleasant artificial smell.  </li>
            <li> The product came in a very tiny bottle for the price, I was not happy.</li>
            <li> When the product dried it would flake off.</li>
            <li> Yet, it&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I have already noticed some tightening to my skin and</li>
            <li> so I like that there is not any heavy fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> maybe my skin does like heavy creams ?</li>
            <li> I started using this on my face a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> the lines around my eyes and the skin on my neck seemed less defined!</li>
            <li> I was anxiously waiting for this to come.  </li>
            <li> At least for</li>
            <li> I had been using another very expensive night cream for years and this one actually gave me results quicker!</li>
            <li> not good has a smell also.</li>
            <li> Winters are brutal where I live so</li>
            <li> Much to my disappointment I received a cream that was HALF the size.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick lotion so it takes awhile to soak in</li>
            <li> , I was tired and irritable and the weather is damp</li>
            <li> a face that looked as tired as I felt,</li>
            <li> muggy.  </li>
            <li> Bad sales tacticts.</li>
            <li> thing I HATE?</li>
            <li> and im still dealing with this horrible acne all cause of this cream..</li>
            <li> That said I ALWAYS had a nasty residue.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love the mosisturizer!! Good customer service!</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream.  It is very thick, so a little goes a long way (which I love, because it will last forever!)  The results are amazing.  I wake up in the morning with soft skin that is not greasy (a common effect of many other night moisturizers that I have used in the past).  I have noticed the dark circles under my eyes beginning to fade more and more over time, as well.  What a bonus!  I would highly recommend this product to others!  Thank you for making the best night cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The product came in a very tiny bottle for the price, I was not happy. When the product dried it would flake off. not good has a smell also.But other then that it works.</li>
            <li> I love when products deliver instant results with absolutely no irritation or strong fragrance.  I received wonderful help from Protege about the order and manner in which to apply their products.  I am now using Protege products exclusively and my skin could not be happier.  I apply this product last in my evening regimen and I have been waking up with clear, glowing skin.  It seems that my foundation applies more smoothly as well.</li>
            <li> Gave me severe acne its two months later and im still dealing with this horrible acne all cause of this cream..it smelled expired.</li>
            <li> I received this cream to try and I am totally amazed at the results! It feels wonderful on my skin and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy! I have used it for only a week or so and see a difference already with the evenness and smoothness of my skin! I had been using another very expensive night cream for years and this one actually gave me results quicker! All I can say is my skin feels like silk! I wish they had a body cream like it in a larger jar! I highly recommend this product! And their customer support is super!</li>
            <li> Protege Night Moisturizer makes my face feel tight, smooth and soft.  Itâ€™s a lightly scented cream that smells good but is not too perfumey.  It spreads easy, a small amount is all you need.  A dime-sized dab is enough to cover my entire face and neck. It comes in a small 1 oz jar that should last about 2 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using just a short time Iâ€™m quite pleased with the results -- have noticed a marked improvement in my skin tone and my fine lines and wrinkles are becoming less noticeable.  I like it so much I will happily reorder when this jar is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; stands behind their product with a 365 Day Money Back Guarantee. No Animal Testing Cruelty Free and Made in the USA.  I appreciate that I was able to purchase this item at a reduced price in return for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I ordered the MEZMEREYS product and utilized the half price offer for the RESURFACE product.  I am so glad I tried RESURFACE!  I have noticed a reduction in my pore size as well as a decrease in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face neck and decolette area.  I will continue to use both of these products.</li>
            <li> This cream feels very moisturizing but I really don&#x27;t see anything else going on. My skin is in pretty good condition from all I have used on it over the last 10 years but I don&#x27;t think this provides much except for a good nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others may have a different experience especially if they haven&#x27;t been taking care of their skin.</li>
            <li> As I age, my skin has become drier and as a result I am constantly on the lookout for effective moisturizers.  I don&#x27;t like to pay the exorbitant prices for department store creams, yet the drugstore creams leave a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful!  I am so happy that I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  I love how my skin feels smoother and moisturized.  Yet, it&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The nice texture.  It feels so nice that I am tempted to use more, but the instructions say that only a little bit is needed.  They are right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No smell.  So many creams are ruined for me because they have such a heavy, unpleasant artificial smell.  This cream has no smell so it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The cute little pouch it comes in.  I feel like I just spent lots of money at a high end department store.  For me, using a skin cream is about more than the actual cream; it&#x27;s the whole experience.  With this cream, I feel very pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to have better looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product, in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and I and very impressed with the quality. I do not have very dry skin, but I think this provides the right amount of moisture for all skin types. My skin is also more clear and a few dark spots on my chin are starting to fade. I look forward to more great results to be provided by this cream and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Yep, five stars. You saw correctly. I just have to start by saying that I am madly in love love love with this product.he second I put in on, it felt amazing. FAR BETTER than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. When I read that it was an overnight cream-- I was a little concerned, mainly for the grease/oil factor. I&#x27;ve tried overnight creams that just make my face feel like I dipped it in butter. This one did not. In two days, the dry patches I have on my face (around/under my jaw) were gone, and when I forgot it for a few days (potty-training a toddler--oy) my face went back to the dry-mess it was before.  Plus, it smells amazing.. almost soothing. Really. I can smell a light hint of it as I drift off to sleep and that may be my second favorite part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I HATE? It&#x27;s not bigger.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this cream! I am only 32 but I am still concerned with future fine lines and wrinkles. I have been looking for a  moisturizing nice cream for awhile. I recently lost 125 pounds so I am left with a few fine lines and tightening needed on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was emailed a coupon code to get the product for free. I received it a couple of days later. It was a pretty jar that came in a cute little bag. The night cream was nice and thick and has very little smell but the scent that is there is nice. I put it in the refrigerator during the day so that night is would be nice and cool on such a hot day. When I put it on before bed the coolness felt great on my face. You don&#x27;t need very much so a little bit goes long way. It went on very smoothly and was very refreshing. I covered my face and neck and went to bed. The next day I woke up to the softest skin on my face! It felt deeply moisturized! After a few days of use I have already noticed some tightening to my skin and the lines around my eyes and the skin on my neck seemed less defined! I am so impressed so far! I can&#x27;s wait to continue to use this product for added benefit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product! It is so good to firm up your skin and prevent future fine lines and wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received ResurFACE Premium Moisturizing Anti Wrinkle Night Cream for Dry Skin for a product review.</li>
            <li> this works amazingly! Every morning my face looks and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I give three stars because although this cream did not work for me at all, I do believe it will for others and the customer service was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to give it a try based on other reviews. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Good cream. Bad sales tacticts. Bought this cream &amp; liked it enough to want more. Purchased same product again, a bit more expensive now, yes, but okay. NO SIZE/OZ mentioned anywhere in description/product details.., which I didn&#x27;t think to even pay attention to, since I had clicked on the item from my previous orders--same thing right? NO! Much to my disappointment I received a cream that was HALF the size. (First order was 2oz, 2nd was 1oz) This is extremely unfortunate as I did like the cream AND have paid far more for facial products in my life. It&#x27;s not the cost for the size, it&#x27;s the dishonest/tricky manner in which it was done that makes me no longer want to support this business. Returned Item. No thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great night time moisturizing cream. It works great to smooth out those fine lines and wrinkles. I have very sensitive skin so I like that there is not any heavy fragrance to it. It is a thicker cream but does not leave the skin feeling greasy at all. I have been using this in combination with the exfoliating mask &amp; my skin is looking and feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time staying on a routine at night, I would probably have better results if I could apply this every evening</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Does not have any odour ( problem with my nose ? ). I did not find it too thick either, got absorbed very easily. Winters are brutal where I live so maybe my skin does like heavy creams ?&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does leave the skin smooth but so do other creams too.&lt;br /&gt;I have no wrinkles and my fine lines are so fine that I do not notice them.....so maybe not a product for me.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small jar so it is not going to last long. At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if my skin was very damaged I would see some result..who knows ? If some people rave about it .well who am I to say ?</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream. I have been using it for a bit now and I wake up with my face being amazingly soft and smooth. It is easy to apply and a lot goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy residue after you apply it and it absorbs nicely. I really like the list of ingredients in this because most of them I use separate already so its great I can use them in one application. I received this to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the follow-up after ordering the product.  Was not expected but was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I started out not liking this cream because it felt very sticky.  The customer service rep suggested I decrease the amount I use, and sure enough, my face was no longer sticky.  In fact, this cream has provided the moisture that my skin was lacking.  My face has a glow after a couple of hours, and I can feel the softness and smoothness in the morning.  The only thing I&#x27;m not that thrilled about is the slight smell.  It&#x27;s not really strong, but it&#x27;s certainly not that pleasing.  Despite that, I would buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> In exchange for trying the product for free I was invited to provide a review.  My wife and I used their eye product and we liked it very much so that&#x27;s how we came upon this product and offer to provide a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is difficult to please when it comes to these kind of products as they are often too expensive or oily or leave a residue.  Anyway, she really likes it.  So do I.  It feels good on the skin and moisturizers well.  In late 40&#x27;s so starting to pay attention to signs of old age ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Customer service for this new company is particularly exceptional.  They are responsive and helpful and are clearly trying to generate support or good conservative feedback and they deserve it.  I wish this company and particularly good product success since my wife and I will be ordering it again when we run out.</li>
            <li> Too much make you sticky.</li>
            <li> ICK! I was anxiously waiting for this to come.  Well, maybe it&#x27;s me, but after I apply it my face is sticky and applying makeup is difficult at best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and it has helped tighten my skin especially around my eyes. It has a very light scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I took the advice from the review below and put this in the fridge before use so it is nice and cooling on my skin each night.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for four days now. It has a very nice consistency to the cream and soaks into the face nicely with no residue. The cream itself does not have much of a smell but I can smell the Shea Butter. I have been using this product for four days now. Throughout my four days I really have not noticed anything much when it comes to changes. One thing that I did notice was the my face actually broke out a bit. This is the only product that I have used these past couple days, so for me this was kind of downer. I really love the way that the cream feels on my face. It is so smooth and moisturizing, but with the breakouts this week, I can not continue using this product. I do have extremely sensitive skin, so when using products as this one, I have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Cream has great ingredients just a bit too thick for my liking.  Great customer service though.  I like the eye cream better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only one week but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.  It feels good going on and is creamy and smooth with no smell.</li>
            <li> I got this to try.  I started using this on my face a few weeks ago and I am excited I did.  This is a very thick lotion so it takes awhile to soak in but once it does you will not believe how soft your skin will be.  It did not leave me greasy at all.  I have one spot on my face when I went out in the sun it was like a perfect circle that turned a darker color and started to scab up.  YUCK.  So when I started using this I could tell in the first night that it was helping.  After a few days I could tell that it was almost completely gone.  My skin was softer and more even. I truly loved this Resurface.</li>
            <li> Works well. I. Feel as though this product has made my face look more youthful. It keeps my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> This night cream doesn&#x27;t absorb in the skin too well. I don&#x27;t see good results with this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this resurface night cream. Skin drinks this up!  Leaves your skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> This cream is worth a try.  The refund policy is so good, you&#x27;re not losing anything if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.  I wrote to the company with this review, so I will copy it here:&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is a good product.  While I have never been able to find&lt;br /&gt;anything that replaces Olay 14 day Intervention Phase 2 cream (now&lt;br /&gt;discontinued), I think this is coming closer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried,&lt;br /&gt;including Olay products!  I feel my facial skin is tighter and less wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;evident, also less baggy under eyes (I&#x27;m 56).  The only thing I have noticed&lt;br /&gt;after using several days is a little flakiness and a little stinging.  I figure&lt;br /&gt;this is the exfoliation, which is a good thing, not bad, and I have a gentle&lt;br /&gt;exfoliating sponge which I use in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up this morning, I was tired and irritable and the weather is damp&lt;br /&gt;and muggy.  It was one of those mornings I expected to look in the mirror and&lt;br /&gt;see a face that looked as tired as I felt, but I was pleasantly surprised to see&lt;br /&gt;that my face looked clear and firm!  It&#x27;s got to be the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with Argon oil; first apply the oil, wait a few minutes, then&lt;br /&gt;apply this cream.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results and will continue using&lt;br /&gt;this; if it continues to have good effects over time, will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to have a way of caking up and though the company is very helpful in trying to offer advice, I am not pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> For the price, haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I even use it lightly under my eyes if they are extra puffy in the morning. The good news is that since I have been using this, I haven&#x27;t had to that very often either. The company advises that you use a very light layer, and I found that a few drops of water on my fingers helps thin it out just right.</li>
            <li> This is an ok night cream. It did even my skin tone a bit and my face wasn&#x27;t dry. That said I ALWAYS had a nasty residue. At first I thought oh I&#x27;m using too much. No that wasn&#x27;t the problem. The only way I could get it to not leave a residue was to use a day lotion first then use this extremely lightly. It was a pain. Not a bad product but I wont purchase again. Way too many better things out there like retinol creams lol.</li>
