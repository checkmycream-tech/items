            <li>very nice, it looks amazing on!</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say how amazing this powder is!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It brightens my fave and sets my makeup so nice!</li>
            <li>Great buy, lasts for a good while</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice to set concealer under your eyes!</li>
            <li>Love the silky feel to this lightweight powder, Ben Nye products are the best!</li>
            <li>I am a chocolate toned sista and this world perfectly :).</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>I absolutly love this product, it gives me a flawless finish when doing my make up..</li>
            <li>It is extremely finely milled and wonderfully sets face makeup as well as under eye concealer without caking up..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best setting powder I&#x27;ve used ( I&#x27;m a makeup artist ) and it sets my concealer perfectly.</li>
            <li>The creamy bright tinted transparent tone I thought this would offer is not even close to the reality.</li>
            <li>I am light tan and the color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>This is a good concealer but not miracle concealer that I read about in all the magazines.</li>
            <li>Good setting powder.</li>
            <li>This powder came in good conditions.</li>
            <li>, my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li>It seems to be my biggest makeup challenge to find a really good concealer that wont settle into the creases of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Just be weary of using a good concealer under cause it doesn&#x27;t sit well with all , some may crack once this is applied as a highlight .</li>
            <li>If you want the best setting powder out there with a silky feel and smooth face</li>
            <li>Great leaves a nice glow</li>
            <li>Good for ALMOST any skin tone/shade.</li>
            <li>IM FAIR TO MED SKINNED TONE AND</li>
            <li>Good products may not match the demand in terms of color, but</li>
            <li>Giving it a good rating for my lack of consciousness.</li>
            <li>those are really good</li>
            <li>but I loved it...</li>
            <li>but it still good product.</li>
            <li>it may just not be the best fit for my complexion</li>
            <li>A cannot do without product for a make-up novice or the most talented of make-up artists!</li>
            <li>like it seems most people use this color for, but it looks good and blends evenly!</li>
            <li>quick shipping....sets my highlight perfectly</li>
            <li>I do have brown skin and this shows up very light and this also doubles as great powder if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Were more than happy ladies.</li>
            <li>For me It was good but nothing amazing.</li>

            <li>This product also helps to give your face a nice matte finish .</li>
            <li>This powder is nice.</li>
            <li>My skin looked nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money for this again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very luxurious and makes me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li>I did find that both powders put a nice finish on the eye area if you&#x27;re about 3 feet from my face.  </li>
            <li>Although I do suggest to exfoliate and mouisurize to ensure it looks nice and even on your skin</li>
            <li>It is so nice on the face.  </li>
            <li>For people that have raccoon eyes and want something that will correct them without looking caked on, Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is nice both the price I deceptive</li>
            <li>Nice powder.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice finished look.</li>
            <li>So it was kind of a impulse buy</li>
            <li>yello but nice texture</li>
            <li>Nice matte powder,</li>
            <li>nothing spectacular about this product</li>
            <li>i really like how it leaves my skin with saw a flawless look !</li>
            <li>Its a nice powder, but doesnt do the job 100% for me.</li>
            <li>Really nice powder that would be nice on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a super excellent product specially if you want to have a Kim Kardashian look.</li>
            <li>It feels like silk as I apply it and it blends very easily .</li>
            <li>but it was a very easy process.</li>
            <li>This is a very good makeup powder to set your face up for the whole day</li>
            <li>great product definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I used to use it all the time when contour and highlighting because it does give my face a nice highlight, but realized it would make me look a bit orangey when applied on top of my makeup.</li>
            <li>then I strongly recommend this powder!</li>
            <li>I got it just in time to use it as I was getting ready for work and my makeup lasted all night, and I looked bright and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes in a &amp;#34;triangle&amp;#34; for highlighting and I get the most natural but flawless &amp;#34;Kim kardashian&amp;#34; highlighted glow!</li>
            <li>It works pretty great.  </li>
            <li>The powder controls the shine and is very light.</li>
            <li>This is always out at makeup stores so luckily I found it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li>I loved how quick I received my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it exceeded my expectations</li>

            <li>This product is amazing......works better than rice powder......</li>
            <li>Love this powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a salt and pepper shaker at the top</li>
            <li>This Ben Nye Banana powder is raved about on most makeup tutorials and magazines.  </li>
            <li>As someone who loves makeup and has used many brands...</li>
            <li>I do love it though.</li>
            <li>Received and realized it may not be the appropriate powder.</li>
            <li>It is more of a mustard color.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I guess its ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>, I read more about it</li>
            <li>and it said the banana powder is more for olive skin tone so decided to try this one as well since I&#x27;m more olive tone.</li>
            <li>This product is great, but this is way too much money.</li>
            <li>I particularly love it to set my under eye concealer, primarily when I am going for that Kim K. look!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love make up,  so when I heard about this banana power I had to have it.</li>
            <li>Works amazing for me (being a kind of caramel color) however choose the color that is right for your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for my complexion as a highlighter</li>
            <li>gives you you that perfect finish look we all look for and feels extra smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>And the best part you can actually use it to set your foundation as well, of course if you&#x27;re light skinned toned.</li>
            <li>The best way is to use a make up sponge and dab on the areas that you need highlighted I&#x27;ve found that using a make up brush I loose a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its my new favorite! !</li>
            <li>I love how finely milled this powder is.  </li>
            <li>I got this excited to use it because I&#x27;m trying to get into make up and use it more and get better.</li>
            <li>Love it, accurate with description and expectation.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW SMOOTH IT IS</li>
            <li>This is a awesome product just as i expected.</li>
            <li>I feel like it gives me a flawless finish, but idk it&#x27;s not what I expected to be.</li>
            <li>Best if you use a wet beauty blender to apply....</li>
            <li>Finish is so smooth, love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does exactly what I need it to do!!</li>
            <li>It does smell very nice the powder is soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand the hype at first, but I love it now!</li>
            <li>I just add a little color correcting powder on top for whitening and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Love it , it definitely gives a great finish .</li>
            <li>Just be carful when opening container, powder spills out easily at the beginning.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage for my dark brown skin.</li>
            <li>Airspun in the color honey beige, and one part baby powder to create the perfect highlight setting powder that will knock those dark circles out</li>
            <li>It claims to matte the area of your face with a fine milled powder.</li>
            <li>the powder is sooo fine and goes on well.</li>
            <li>I have crepiness and fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t see the bags and fine lines</li>
            <li>perfectly fine milled.</li>
            <li>I have a pinkish olive skin tone and this color blends in just fine.</li>
            <li>the Finish is smooth, silky and helps control shine.</li>
            <li>buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cakey and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all.</li>
            <li>I use this for the sections where light shades need to be in.</li>
            <li>and i am loving it soo very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was scared to use it because it is so light in color and cakey.  </li>
            <li>Great as described, I just wish for the price it was a bigger container.</li>
            <li>This powder is great for highlighting and giving an overall glow to my face.</li>
            <li>So smooth and silky, It leaves your face looking like a Glamorous Star..</li>
            <li>This powder is fantastic..</li>
            <li>it really works good.it gives u a nice finish over your foundation.it brings out the beauty</li>
            <li>It works with every skin tone and it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky look.</li>
            <li>but my skin tone is too light for this product.</li>
            <li>This color was too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li>(Shiseido Hydro Liquid compact is a great product but was making my face too shiny by mid day).  </li>
            <li>Watch the tutorials on YouTube and see if it&#x27;s a fit for you.</li>
            <li>it really worked and was amazing.</li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure if the formula is genuine.</li>
            <li>When I set my concealer with this powder, nothing budges all day and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>Im giving this a 4 becuz, although its a great powder, doesnt set my concealor under my eyes (only reason I bought the banana powder).</li>
            <li>(Try cameo if you&#x27;re light.)</li>
            <li>I am a professional Makeup artist and I use this on my clients regardless of their skin color (I have use it in fair, tan and olive skin)</li>
            <li>Plus, the expiry date really does matter with this as over time it seems to oxidize to a more orangey shade within the jar over time, even if it goes unused, so make sure when you buy it</li>
            <li>I feel like this product is good for going out but not everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, just not what I was excited about.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very dry and it doesn&#x27;t have a good coverage,,waste of money!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!!</li>
            <li>This shipped out very fast and the size will deff last me a while its great for setting the under eye area so glad i purchased this for my kit</li>
            <li>Power is very light in color and in texture but blends very well on my caramel skin!</li>
            <li>I love love love this powder, everyone made such a huge deal out of it</li>
            <li>However, my original plan was to use it for highlighting but that has resolved into just using as an all-over powder to balance skin tone and also get rid of shine.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in cameo</li>
            <li>Shipping was not as fast as I would have liked but it was worth the wait .</li>
            <li>but it arrived safe and sound with no broken lid.</li>
            <li>then a put a more natural tone over top.</li>
            <li>This product gives off such a clean perfect face and my skin feels so soft with this on as well.</li>
            <li>I switched to it from a heavier, more opaque powder and it certainly took some getting used to...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really impressed, it didn&#x27;t hardly make any difference unless you put a load of it on</li>
            <li>but under bright theatrical lights.</li>
            <li>The young girls posting their tutorials are amazing with their before and after&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I know lots of people really like this product but for me it was just ok.</li>
            <li>so the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li>Fast and speedy delivery, plus one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>The seller is great, fast shipping and hassle free transaction, I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>It does a good job in lasting all day, doesn&#x27;t get into my creases.</li>
            <li>I would like it more, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>But I still give it full ratings and will recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s thinking of purchasing it.</li>
            <li>But I did contact them and they did get back to me which was good</li>
            <li>Love the product so much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll last for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>super this Banana Powder</li>
            <li>Love this product, will purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>They did get 2 stars because the ire was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The powder works great for dark eye circles, if used in moderation.</li>
            <li>but non the less the product is great</li>
            <li>VERY AFFORDABLE!!</li>
            <li>this is not the real deal!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite highlighter thus far!</li>
            <li>i really like this powder because it is so fine and sets everything in place.</li>
            <li>It works great, but I wish it was a little lighter to use for highlighting while contouring.</li>
            <li>but i feel like it doesnt really show on my light skin.</li>
            <li>Per spouse, powder gives great matte finish but can be messy so try not to get on clothes.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was hype, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>As a powder it doesn&#x27;t cover much, it maybe makes complexion a bit more even or so but doesn&#x27;t really hide redness or undereye circles.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I could be more clear....</li>
            <li>In order to use this product and pull it off nicely, you do need tan skin with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be buying more very soon 😄😄😄</li>
            <li>I did or the cream highter from A site called Fun Shop or Fun Shop which is the Ben Nye online seller and one of the things I ordered was the cream hilghter.</li>
            <li>A make up artist would blend this with a lighter product for a more natural effect.</li>
            <li>This product is all I had heard about and it was well worth trying @BenNye</li>
            <li>It is good for red skin but not so much for under the eye like experts say.</li>
            <li>but I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>They make a pink ben nye powder that is for fair to light skined people this is an amazing product and so is the pink one</li>
            <li>The banana looks light (has more of a yellow tone) for darker women of color</li>
            <li>And it pretty much woks well with all skin shades...very easy to blend</li>
            <li>It pops brightness right into my face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cake over foundation or concealer if used in the right amount ..</li>
            <li>you use it rightly it will work on your skin .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a beauty blender to apply and manage putting on just the right amount.</li>
            <li>The reviews were right .</li>
            <li>i received it right on time.will</li>
            <li>or maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t even get the package right.</li>
            <li>I have a dark, middle eastern complexion and this color is perfect.</li>
            <li>I really expected some kind of miracle thing that kim kardashian uses and that I was lucky to come upon</li>
            <li>It came in a very timely manner and was true to how pictured.</li>
            <li>the coverage is really good for people that has dark circles.</li>
            <li>This powder works good for brighten dark circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, but for the hype and cost, I would only purchase this if you are like me and can never seem to find a product that works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>...works beautifully and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>but it did arrive super fast..</li>
            <li>And, yes, I used a Beauty Blender sponge and patted the powder very gently around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I arrived w very fast  </li>
            <li>Other than that this stuff is amazing and worth the price.</li>
            <li>This fine powder really naturally highlights anything you want highlighted and set.</li>
            <li>When this fad passes, you&#x27;ll find yourself entrusting in your older, tried &amp; true powders.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li>When applied over cream concealer, I was ready for the circus!  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this product</li>
            <li>I only apply it under my eyes on top of my concealer.</li>
            <li>I tried it today for the first time</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT A DOUBT!!</li>
            <li>Really helped keep a matte complexion all day, will order again!</li>
            <li>The powder is great although Im not loving the container-</li>
            <li>The cream hilghter had A comment from someone where they gave it A very positve review!</li>
            <li>They carry all of the Ben Nye products and they are all very arrordable!</li>
            <li>If there is an excess amount on the brush, I simply tap it off, then proceed to lightly dab the powder over my concealer and BOOM!</li>
            <li>I will most likely be ordering another one</li>
            <li>I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...</li>
            <li>really looking forward to this product will never listen to tutorials again!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>i am not obsessed with the product</li>
            <li>At first I thought they didn&#x27;t send it at all it.</li>
            <li>This powder has numerous uses, but I love the finished look that it gives my makeup.</li>
            <li>Much better than the white finishing powder by MAC or Makeup 4 Forever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dark-skinned female and I must say I wasn&#x27;t really sure how this powder would show on me.</li>
            <li>Use this product daily with a mix of my Mac Mineral powder and love the finish look.</li>
            <li>I am aware this has some color in it but was hoping that color would not be the color that would appear on my face...and it was.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase an even smaller size at $12 a jar which still ended up being a lot of product and a large size</li>
            <li>Quality is v soft and rich ..</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this so much that I recently purchased a translucent powder by Laura Mercier for my foundation.</li>
            <li>I have a very cool undertone but this is still too yellow.</li>
            <li>I have used it for the first time and really like how it blends and enhances my skin.</li>
            <li>Brightens my dark under eye circles really nicely.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t look right because my skin tone is fair, not dark</li>
            <li>The only downfall is it is not that easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I am trying this prodcut for the first time so a lot of my trouble is my own lack of experience.</li>
            <li>Maybe this would work on someone very young without any laugh lines or someone with tons of botox like a kardashian.</li>
            <li>people told me on certain sites I could find it</li>
            <li>A product I can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesnt feel like you&#x27;re wearing a mask, and isn&#x27;t yellow.  </li>
            <li>Use to highlight, on your whole face, or alone.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder even thou at the beginning when you apply it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use too much when I use it.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>and it worked very well ....</li>
            <li>its really cakey</li>
            <li>The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li>Bought for someone they seem to really like it</li>
            <li>You can Ben nye powder powder for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m no makeup pro, but when I apply it I really can&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li>and you dont even need to use that much</li>
            <li>so if you are medium to light skinned I definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>Plastic container so shouldn&#x27;t be this much money</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really highlight much for me.</li>
            <li>Look at the front design of the real thing.  </li>
            <li>The real powder says Ben Nye Banana Luxury Powder.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like the real thing either.  </li>
            <li>This contours you face very well</li>
            <li>also I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like my ben nye banana power</li>
            <li>One of the products that really caught my eye was the BEN NYE LUXURY POWDER in Banana.  </li>
            <li>At the end of my work day I tried patting the Cameo powder on my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice as much highlighting as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>THE REAL THING FOR A CHEAPER PRICE</li>
            <li>I heard so much about this product I wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>I went to camera ready cosmetics</li>
            <li>I felt like the reviews really hipped up the product for me</li>
            <li>i really recommend it</li>
            <li>Still when i put them under my eyes to cover the consealor they give very neutral look</li>
            <li>Really shows all of my imperfections</li>
            <li>It just seems like I have to put a lot on to really make an impact.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that this really works for Caucasian skin tones.</li>
            <li>My duaghter tried it and she is very saticfied with the item</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product but to my surprise it was junk.</li>
            <li>I have never purchased any makeup where the label was not applied straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying to try this product and am very please.</li>
            <li>It works really well setting your under eye highlight</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t know what to do with it</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is not as transparent as I thought it would be, it&#x27;s opaque and looks very beige on.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, it really sets your makeup, and you don&#x27;t look ghostly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Looks absolutely fab on olive colored or Indian skin.</li>
            <li>This banana powder takes on the shade of the person wearing it and really does highlight well.</li>
            <li>or I put to much on</li>
            <li>Blends really well.</li>
            <li>I have a fair to medium complexion with minimal facial skin flaws.  </li>
            <li>it gets kind of messy to work with it...</li>
            <li>I actually purchased it from a website called Creative Makeup for professional make up artists before I realized it was sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, wear white collard top and you&#x27;d be surprised that your make-up won&#x27;t drip and smudge on it</li>
            <li>My container is basically still full and I will continue using bare minerals instead.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;ve found an amazing loose powder that looks great and does some serious oil sheen coverage.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way too which is great.</li>
            <li>I think I may try the other color too :)</li>
            <li>And for the amount of powder you get, where a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>I think Bare Minerals is probably better and is what I&#x27;ll stick with in the future.</li>
            <li>the hole in jar is small,won&#x27;t fit a brush,the lid is too small to pore powder in, won&#x27;t fit a brush....</li>
            <li>im a very light skinned black woman</li>
            <li>is merely to set your foundation/concealer, NOT to provide a lot of additional coverage, which this powder does beautifully.</li>
            <li>Its not bad dont actually use it alot.</li>
            <li>better than expected!!</li>
            <li>So after purchasing all my new makeup products and putting them on I then applied the Banana Powder and YUCK!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used chanel powder for years and years and most recently Bobbi Brian&#x27;s yellow shadow under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Definitely will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>apply Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder with Sephora&#x27;s Classic Multitasker Powder Brush.</li>
            <li>Many claim this is not authentic but I also purchased one from a different company that sells authentic products and it was exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when I bought this powder..</li>
            <li>then I applied the Ben Nye powder under my eyes and on the high part or my cheek bones.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>This is priced way to high</li>
            <li>A little goes a loooong way :)</li>
            <li>I thought I would use it a little more.</li>
            <li>You could say that I dont put on enough powder, but after putting it on heavier, It was so bright under my eyes, I looked pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural looking glow, very noticeable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with make up and thought this would be the holy grail of highlighting lol</li>
            <li>I put on my makeup as normal</li>
            <li>maybe cause ever body rave about it and when i used it it so normal</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, this must be for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li>the bottle is really tiny, I ordered another ogle from the Fun shop and a bottle</li>
            <li>i use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>A normal loose powder nothis special.</li>
            <li>It is very yellow though but looks fine if you have yellow undertones like I do.</li>
            <li>I just received this nifty little package today and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I can live without this Banana powder.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean so this powder isn&#x27;t sold anywhere in my country.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this powder before and no EXACTLy how to apply and blend and this isn&#x27;t the real item!!!</li>
            <li>I love this powder - It sets my concealer so it doesn&#x27;t crease and adds a little bit of brightness to my undereye area!</li>
            <li>my makeup looks very professional</li>
            <li>Very natural looking powder.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian on a lighter shade skin (&amp;#34;maputi&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I am dark skinned and thought this product would be too light on my face-</li>
            <li>any other powder except that is it obviously more yellow.</li>
            <li>I looked like an old lady!</li>
            <li>kimkreations p)FOUNDATION ROUTINE VIDEO TO SEE IT IN ACTION !</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sure or this is your first time, get the 1.5 and if u love it then purchase the larger size after you&#x27;ve ran out.</li>
            <li>I go for the light or ivory toned powders and this one is just too dark.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying again, but would like to see a mire user friendly container such as the larger size Ben nye powders.</li>
            <li>black girls feel free to buy</li>
            <li>This powder Rocks, long lasting, goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a pure Ben Nye stage-makeup that looks relatively garish anywhere else</li>
            <li>A tad too light, may make you look a little ashy depending on your skin tone or under tone.  </li>
            <li>not  as great as all the hype goes on a little thick.</li>
            <li>try the Ben nye white powder or the light pink one</li>
            <li>and when I get home from a busy night everything is still in place</li>
            <li>Its not heavy and its just luxurious.</li>
            <li>It is soft.</li>
            <li>I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST</li>
            <li>Definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li>She really loves it because it was an essential item for makeup.</li>
            <li>Too powdery of a consistency - much like talcum powder/baby powder except in a banana-ish yellow.</li>
            <li>By far now one of my beauty staples.</li>
            <li>They use a picture of the real banana powder, but sent something different.  </li>
            <li>old hooked.</li>
            <li>Maybe it didn&#x27;t do that much for me because I have a yellow undertone..</li>
            <li>The color seems very faded compared to what I have seen in multiple videos.  </li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all on my skin.</li>
            <li>It would be better if there was a seperated compartment to put the powder in like my other loose powder container.</li>
            <li>BEST EVER highlighter- a little goes a long way, wear it everyday and have a TON left, probably last me 6 months</li>
            <li>It is the best thing I have found for my face seriously!!!!</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s dirt cheap for a reason, but sellers are constantly raising the price (in greed) due to demand.  </li>
            <li>but non the less it works well with foundation and gives full coverage</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, fav for sure</li>
            <li>Its small but more than enough.</li>
            <li>I admire Mario, who uses this a lot on his clients and believes in it, but this particular recommendation of his is a TOTAL BOMB.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure its fake......</li>
            <li>I have gone a full 8hr work shift with little to no creasing</li>
            <li>A Very good product you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the genuine product or not.  </li>
            <li>very chalky, even in summer it feels dry on my skin. ,</li>
            <li>Very cakey and similar to putting yellow flour on your face.</li>
            <li>, folks raved, apparently stars loves this stuff, and makeup artist rave about it.  </li>
            <li>like if I was 60 years old and I&#x27;m only 35.</li>
            <li>I put this on after bare minerals.</li>
            <li>but I bought the exact same product in a bigger bottle at different place for the same price.</li>
            <li>I would rather have just purchased a normal setting powder that was double the size for the same price.</li>
            <li>You can find the large bottle for $18 from other sellers..</li>
            <li>the little you might waste is ok</li>
            <li>It also tends to leave my face powdery looking which I usually look pretty natural</li>
            <li>I have green lines in my skin so the yellow just made face look the right color.  </li>
            <li>and I had to use so much to cover it up that it&#x27;s honestly not worth the mount I paid.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, I only use Bare Minerals powder as foundation.</li>
            <li>It is a little dusty if too much is put on, so make sure you use just enough after you apply liquid/creme foundation.</li>
            <li>I just look old and makes my under eyes look very very dry and cakey</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do anything so crazy amazing.</li>
            <li>Good product bad price this seller</li>
    </ol>

            <li> very nice, it looks amazing on!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say how amazing this powder is!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It brightens my fave and sets my makeup so nice!</li>
            <li> Great buy, lasts for a good while</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice to set concealer under your eyes!</li>
            <li> Love the silky feel to this lightweight powder, Ben Nye products are the best!</li>
            <li> I am a chocolate toned sista and this world perfectly :).</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product, it gives me a flawless finish when doing my make up..</li>
            <li> It is extremely finely milled and wonderfully sets face makeup as well as under eye concealer without caking up..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best setting powder I&#x27;ve used ( I&#x27;m a makeup artist ) and it sets my concealer perfectly.</li>
            <li> The creamy bright tinted transparent tone I thought this would offer is not even close to the reality.</li>
            <li> I am light tan and the color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good concealer but not miracle concealer that I read about in all the magazines.</li>
            <li> Good setting powder.</li>
            <li> This powder came in good conditions.</li>
            <li> , my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li> It seems to be my biggest makeup challenge to find a really good concealer that wont settle into the creases of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Just be weary of using a good concealer under cause it doesn&#x27;t sit well with all , some may crack once this is applied as a highlight .</li>
            <li> If you want the best setting powder out there with a silky feel and smooth face</li>
            <li> Great leaves a nice glow</li>
            <li> Good for ALMOST any skin tone/shade.</li>
            <li> IM FAIR TO MED SKINNED TONE AND</li>
            <li> Good products may not match the demand in terms of color, but</li>
            <li> Giving it a good rating for my lack of consciousness.</li>
            <li> those are really good</li>
            <li> but I loved it...</li>
            <li> but it still good product.</li>
            <li> it may just not be the best fit for my complexion</li>
            <li> A cannot do without product for a make-up novice or the most talented of make-up artists!</li>
            <li> like it seems most people use this color for, but it looks good and blends evenly!</li>
            <li> quick shipping....sets my highlight perfectly</li>
            <li> I do have brown skin and this shows up very light and this also doubles as great powder if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Were more than happy ladies.</li>
            <li> For me It was good but nothing amazing.</li>

            <li> Works fairly nice.</li>
            <li> This product also helps to give your face a nice matte finish .</li>
            <li> This powder is nice.</li>
            <li> My skin looked nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money for this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very luxurious and makes me feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> I did find that both powders put a nice finish on the eye area if you&#x27;re about 3 feet from my face.  </li>
            <li> Although I do suggest to exfoliate and mouisurize to ensure it looks nice and even on your skin</li>
            <li> It is so nice on the face.  </li>
            <li> For people that have raccoon eyes and want something that will correct them without looking caked on, Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is nice both the price I deceptive</li>
            <li> Nice powder.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice finished look.</li>
            <li> So it was kind of a impulse buy</li>
            <li> yello but nice texture</li>
            <li> Nice matte powder,</li>
            <li> nothing spectacular about this product</li>
            <li> i really like how it leaves my skin with saw a flawless look !</li>
            <li> Its a nice powder, but doesnt do the job 100% for me.</li>
            <li> Really nice powder that would be nice on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a super excellent product specially if you want to have a Kim Kardashian look.</li>
            <li> It feels like silk as I apply it and it blends very easily .</li>
            <li> but it was a very easy process.</li>
            <li> This is a very good makeup powder to set your face up for the whole day</li>
            <li> great product definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I used to use it all the time when contour and highlighting because it does give my face a nice highlight, but realized it would make me look a bit orangey when applied on top of my makeup.</li>
            <li> then I strongly recommend this powder!</li>
            <li> I got it just in time to use it as I was getting ready for work and my makeup lasted all night, and I looked bright and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes in a &amp;#34;triangle&amp;#34; for highlighting and I get the most natural but flawless &amp;#34;Kim kardashian&amp;#34; highlighted glow!</li>
            <li> It works pretty great.  </li>
            <li> The powder controls the shine and is very light.</li>
            <li> This is always out at makeup stores so luckily I found it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> I loved how quick I received my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it exceeded my expectations</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s like a salt and pepper shaker at the top</li>
            <li> This Ben Nye Banana powder is raved about on most makeup tutorials and magazines.  </li>
            <li> As someone who loves makeup and has used many brands...</li>
            <li> I do love it though.</li>
            <li> Received and realized it may not be the appropriate powder.</li>
            <li> It is more of a mustard color.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I guess its ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this powder.</li>
            <li> , I read more about it</li>
            <li> and it said the banana powder is more for olive skin tone so decided to try this one as well since I&#x27;m more olive tone.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but this is way too much money.</li>
            <li> I particularly love it to set my under eye concealer, primarily when I am going for that Kim K. look!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love make up,  so when I heard about this banana power I had to have it.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for me (being a kind of caramel color) however choose the color that is right for your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for my complexion as a highlighter</li>
            <li> gives you you that perfect finish look we all look for and feels extra smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> And the best part you can actually use it to set your foundation as well, of course if you&#x27;re light skinned toned.</li>
            <li> The best way is to use a make up sponge and dab on the areas that you need highlighted I&#x27;ve found that using a make up brush I loose a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, its my new favorite! !</li>
            <li> I love how finely milled this powder is.  </li>
            <li> I got this excited to use it because I&#x27;m trying to get into make up and use it more and get better.</li>
            <li> Love it, accurate with description and expectation.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW SMOOTH IT IS</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product just as i expected.</li>
            <li> I feel like it gives me a flawless finish, but idk it&#x27;s not what I expected to be.</li>
            <li> Best if you use a wet beauty blender to apply....</li>
            <li> Finish is so smooth, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does exactly what I need it to do!!</li>
            <li> It does smell very nice the powder is soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand the hype at first, but I love it now!</li>
            <li> I just add a little color correcting powder on top for whitening and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it , it definitely gives a great finish .</li>
            <li> Just be carful when opening container, powder spills out easily at the beginning.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage for my dark brown skin.</li>
            <li> Airspun in the color honey beige, and one part baby powder to create the perfect highlight setting powder that will knock those dark circles out</li>
            <li> It claims to matte the area of your face with a fine milled powder.</li>
            <li> the powder is sooo fine and goes on well.</li>
            <li> I have crepiness and fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t see the bags and fine lines</li>
            <li> perfectly fine milled.</li>
            <li> I have a pinkish olive skin tone and this color blends in just fine.</li>
            <li> the Finish is smooth, silky and helps control shine.</li>
            <li> buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cakey and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all.</li>
            <li> I use this for the sections where light shades need to be in.</li>
            <li> and i am loving it soo very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was scared to use it because it is so light in color and cakey.  </li>
            <li> Great as described, I just wish for the price it was a bigger container.</li>
            <li> This powder is great for highlighting and giving an overall glow to my face.</li>
            <li> So smooth and silky, It leaves your face looking like a Glamorous Star..</li>
            <li> This powder is fantastic..</li>
            <li> it really works good.it gives u a nice finish over your foundation.it brings out the beauty</li>
            <li> It works with every skin tone and it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky look.</li>
            <li> but my skin tone is too light for this product.</li>
            <li> This color was too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> (Shiseido Hydro Liquid compact is a great product but was making my face too shiny by mid day).  </li>
            <li> Watch the tutorials on YouTube and see if it&#x27;s a fit for you.</li>
            <li> it really worked and was amazing.</li>
            <li> Smooth.  </li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if the formula is genuine.</li>
            <li> When I set my concealer with this powder, nothing budges all day and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> Im giving this a 4 becuz, although its a great powder, doesnt set my concealor under my eyes (only reason I bought the banana powder).</li>
            <li> (Try cameo if you&#x27;re light.)</li>
            <li> I am a professional Makeup artist and I use this on my clients regardless of their skin color (I have use it in fair, tan and olive skin)</li>
            <li> Plus, the expiry date really does matter with this as over time it seems to oxidize to a more orangey shade within the jar over time, even if it goes unused, so make sure when you buy it</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is good for going out but not everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, just not what I was excited about.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very dry and it doesn&#x27;t have a good coverage,,waste of money!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!!!</li>
            <li> This shipped out very fast and the size will deff last me a while its great for setting the under eye area so glad i purchased this for my kit</li>
            <li> Power is very light in color and in texture but blends very well on my caramel skin!</li>
            <li> I love love love this powder, everyone made such a huge deal out of it</li>
            <li> However, my original plan was to use it for highlighting but that has resolved into just using as an all-over powder to balance skin tone and also get rid of shine.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in cameo</li>
            <li> Shipping was not as fast as I would have liked but it was worth the wait .</li>
            <li> but it arrived safe and sound with no broken lid.</li>
            <li> then a put a more natural tone over top.</li>
            <li> This product gives off such a clean perfect face and my skin feels so soft with this on as well.</li>
            <li> I switched to it from a heavier, more opaque powder and it certainly took some getting used to...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed, it didn&#x27;t hardly make any difference unless you put a load of it on</li>
            <li> but under bright theatrical lights.</li>
            <li> The young girls posting their tutorials are amazing with their before and after&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I know lots of people really like this product but for me it was just ok.</li>
            <li> so the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li> Fast and speedy delivery, plus one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The seller is great, fast shipping and hassle free transaction, I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It does a good job in lasting all day, doesn&#x27;t get into my creases.</li>
            <li> I would like it more, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> But I still give it full ratings and will recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s thinking of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> But I did contact them and they did get back to me which was good</li>
            <li> Love the product so much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll last for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> super this Banana Powder</li>
            <li> Love this product, will purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> They did get 2 stars because the ire was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The powder works great for dark eye circles, if used in moderation.</li>
            <li> but non the less the product is great</li>
            <li> VERY AFFORDABLE!!</li>
            <li> this is not the real deal!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite highlighter thus far!</li>
            <li> i really like this powder because it is so fine and sets everything in place.</li>
            <li> It works great, but I wish it was a little lighter to use for highlighting while contouring.</li>
            <li> but i feel like it doesnt really show on my light skin.</li>
            <li> Per spouse, powder gives great matte finish but can be messy so try not to get on clothes.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was hype, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> As a powder it doesn&#x27;t cover much, it maybe makes complexion a bit more even or so but doesn&#x27;t really hide redness or undereye circles.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I could be more clear....</li>
            <li> In order to use this product and pull it off nicely, you do need tan skin with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be buying more very soon 😄😄😄</li>
            <li> I did or the cream highter from A site called Fun Shop or Fun Shop which is the Ben Nye online seller and one of the things I ordered was the cream hilghter.</li>
            <li> A make up artist would blend this with a lighter product for a more natural effect.</li>
            <li> This product is all I had heard about and it was well worth trying @BenNye</li>
            <li> It is good for red skin but not so much for under the eye like experts say.</li>
            <li> but I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> They make a pink ben nye powder that is for fair to light skined people this is an amazing product and so is the pink one</li>
            <li> The banana looks light (has more of a yellow tone) for darker women of color</li>
            <li> And it pretty much woks well with all skin shades...very easy to blend</li>
            <li> It pops brightness right into my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake over foundation or concealer if used in the right amount ..</li>
            <li> you use it rightly it will work on your skin .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a beauty blender to apply and manage putting on just the right amount.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right .</li>
            <li> i received it right on time.will</li>
            <li> or maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t even get the package right.</li>
            <li> I have a dark, middle eastern complexion and this color is perfect.</li>
            <li> I really expected some kind of miracle thing that kim kardashian uses and that I was lucky to come upon</li>
            <li> It came in a very timely manner and was true to how pictured.</li>
            <li> the coverage is really good for people that has dark circles.</li>
            <li> This powder works good for brighten dark circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, but for the hype and cost, I would only purchase this if you are like me and can never seem to find a product that works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ...works beautifully and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but it did arrive super fast..</li>
            <li> And, yes, I used a Beauty Blender sponge and patted the powder very gently around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I arrived w very fast  </li>
            <li> Other than that this stuff is amazing and worth the price.</li>
            <li> This fine powder really naturally highlights anything you want highlighted and set.</li>
            <li> When this fad passes, you&#x27;ll find yourself entrusting in your older, tried &amp; true powders.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> When applied over cream concealer, I was ready for the circus!  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product</li>
            <li> I only apply it under my eyes on top of my concealer.</li>
            <li> I tried it today for the first time</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT A DOUBT!!</li>
            <li> Really helped keep a matte complexion all day, will order again!</li>
            <li> The powder is great although Im not loving the container-</li>
            <li> The cream hilghter had A comment from someone where they gave it A very positve review!</li>
            <li> They carry all of the Ben Nye products and they are all very arrordable!</li>
            <li> If there is an excess amount on the brush, I simply tap it off, then proceed to lightly dab the powder over my concealer and BOOM!</li>
            <li> I will most likely be ordering another one</li>
            <li> I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...</li>
            <li> really looking forward to this product will never listen to tutorials again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> i am not obsessed with the product</li>
            <li> At first I thought they didn&#x27;t send it at all it.</li>
            <li> This powder has numerous uses, but I love the finished look that it gives my makeup.</li>
            <li> Much better than the white finishing powder by MAC or Makeup 4 Forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark-skinned female and I must say I wasn&#x27;t really sure how this powder would show on me.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily with a mix of my Mac Mineral powder and love the finish look.</li>
            <li> I am aware this has some color in it but was hoping that color would not be the color that would appear on my face...and it was.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase an even smaller size at $12 a jar which still ended up being a lot of product and a large size</li>
            <li> Quality is v soft and rich ..</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this so much that I recently purchased a translucent powder by Laura Mercier for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have a very cool undertone but this is still too yellow.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the first time and really like how it blends and enhances my skin.</li>
            <li> Brightens my dark under eye circles really nicely.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t look right because my skin tone is fair, not dark</li>
            <li> The only downfall is it is not that easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I am trying this prodcut for the first time so a lot of my trouble is my own lack of experience.</li>
            <li> Maybe this would work on someone very young without any laugh lines or someone with tons of botox like a kardashian.</li>
            <li> people told me on certain sites I could find it</li>
            <li> A product I can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesnt feel like you&#x27;re wearing a mask, and isn&#x27;t yellow.  </li>
            <li> Use to highlight, on your whole face, or alone.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder even thou at the beginning when you apply it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use too much when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> and it worked very well ....</li>
            <li> its really cakey</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought for someone they seem to really like it</li>
            <li> You can Ben nye powder powder for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m no makeup pro, but when I apply it I really can&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> and you dont even need to use that much</li>
            <li> so if you are medium to light skinned I definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> Plastic container so shouldn&#x27;t be this much money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really highlight much for me.</li>
            <li> Look at the front design of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The real powder says Ben Nye Banana Luxury Powder.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like the real thing either.  </li>
            <li> This contours you face very well</li>
            <li> also I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like my ben nye banana power</li>
            <li> One of the products that really caught my eye was the BEN NYE LUXURY POWDER in Banana.  </li>
            <li> At the end of my work day I tried patting the Cameo powder on my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice as much highlighting as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> THE REAL THING FOR A CHEAPER PRICE</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product I wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> I went to camera ready cosmetics</li>
            <li> I felt like the reviews really hipped up the product for me</li>
            <li> i really recommend it</li>
            <li> Still when i put them under my eyes to cover the consealor they give very neutral look</li>
            <li> Really shows all of my imperfections</li>
            <li> It just seems like I have to put a lot on to really make an impact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this really works for Caucasian skin tones.</li>
            <li> My duaghter tried it and she is very saticfied with the item</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but to my surprise it was junk.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased any makeup where the label was not applied straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try this product and am very please.</li>
            <li> It works really well setting your under eye highlight</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t know what to do with it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is not as transparent as I thought it would be, it&#x27;s opaque and looks very beige on.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, it really sets your makeup, and you don&#x27;t look ghostly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Looks absolutely fab on olive colored or Indian skin.</li>
            <li> This banana powder takes on the shade of the person wearing it and really does highlight well.</li>
            <li> or I put to much on</li>
            <li> Blends really well.</li>
            <li> I have a fair to medium complexion with minimal facial skin flaws.  </li>
            <li> it gets kind of messy to work with it...</li>
            <li> I actually purchased it from a website called Creative Makeup for professional make up artists before I realized it was sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, wear white collard top and you&#x27;d be surprised that your make-up won&#x27;t drip and smudge on it</li>
            <li> My container is basically still full and I will continue using bare minerals instead.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found an amazing loose powder that looks great and does some serious oil sheen coverage.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too which is great.</li>
            <li> I think I may try the other color too :)</li>
            <li> And for the amount of powder you get, where a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> I think Bare Minerals is probably better and is what I&#x27;ll stick with in the future.</li>
            <li> the hole in jar is small,won&#x27;t fit a brush,the lid is too small to pore powder in, won&#x27;t fit a brush....</li>
            <li> im a very light skinned black woman</li>
            <li> is merely to set your foundation/concealer, NOT to provide a lot of additional coverage, which this powder does beautifully.</li>
            <li> Its not bad dont actually use it alot.</li>
            <li> better than expected!!</li>
            <li> So after purchasing all my new makeup products and putting them on I then applied the Banana Powder and YUCK!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used chanel powder for years and years and most recently Bobbi Brian&#x27;s yellow shadow under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> apply Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder with Sephora&#x27;s Classic Multitasker Powder Brush.</li>
            <li> Many claim this is not authentic but I also purchased one from a different company that sells authentic products and it was exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I bought this powder..</li>
            <li> then I applied the Ben Nye powder under my eyes and on the high part or my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> This is priced way to high</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way :)</li>
            <li> I thought I would use it a little more.</li>
            <li> You could say that I dont put on enough powder, but after putting it on heavier, It was so bright under my eyes, I looked pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural looking glow, very noticeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with make up and thought this would be the holy grail of highlighting lol</li>
            <li> I put on my makeup as normal</li>
            <li> maybe cause ever body rave about it and when i used it it so normal</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, this must be for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> the bottle is really tiny, I ordered another ogle from the Fun shop and a bottle</li>
            <li> i use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> A normal loose powder nothis special.</li>
            <li> It is very yellow though but looks fine if you have yellow undertones like I do.</li>
            <li> I just received this nifty little package today and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I can live without this Banana powder.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean so this powder isn&#x27;t sold anywhere in my country.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this powder before and no EXACTLy how to apply and blend and this isn&#x27;t the real item!!!</li>
            <li> I love this powder - It sets my concealer so it doesn&#x27;t crease and adds a little bit of brightness to my undereye area!</li>
            <li> my makeup looks very professional</li>
            <li> Very natural looking powder.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian on a lighter shade skin (&amp;#34;maputi&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned and thought this product would be too light on my face-</li>
            <li> any other powder except that is it obviously more yellow.</li>
            <li> I looked like an old lady!</li>
            <li> kimkreations p)FOUNDATION ROUTINE VIDEO TO SEE IT IN ACTION !</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure or this is your first time, get the 1.5 and if u love it then purchase the larger size after you&#x27;ve ran out.</li>
            <li> I go for the light or ivory toned powders and this one is just too dark.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying again, but would like to see a mire user friendly container such as the larger size Ben nye powders.</li>
            <li> black girls feel free to buy</li>
            <li> This powder Rocks, long lasting, goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a pure Ben Nye stage-makeup that looks relatively garish anywhere else</li>
            <li> A tad too light, may make you look a little ashy depending on your skin tone or under tone.  </li>
            <li> not  as great as all the hype goes on a little thick.</li>
            <li> try the Ben nye white powder or the light pink one</li>
            <li> and when I get home from a busy night everything is still in place</li>
            <li> Its not heavy and its just luxurious.</li>
            <li> It is soft.</li>
            <li> I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li> She really loves it because it was an essential item for makeup.</li>
            <li> Too powdery of a consistency - much like talcum powder/baby powder except in a banana-ish yellow.</li>
            <li> By far now one of my beauty staples.</li>
            <li> They use a picture of the real banana powder, but sent something different.  </li>

            <li> Maybe it didn&#x27;t do that much for me because I have a yellow undertone..</li>
            <li> The color seems very faded compared to what I have seen in multiple videos.  </li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> It would be better if there was a seperated compartment to put the powder in like my other loose powder container.</li>
            <li> BEST EVER highlighter- a little goes a long way, wear it everyday and have a TON left, probably last me 6 months</li>
            <li> It is the best thing I have found for my face seriously!!!!</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s dirt cheap for a reason, but sellers are constantly raising the price (in greed) due to demand.  </li>
            <li> but non the less it works well with foundation and gives full coverage</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, fav for sure</li>
            <li> Its small but more than enough.</li>
            <li> I admire Mario, who uses this a lot on his clients and believes in it, but this particular recommendation of his is a TOTAL BOMB.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure its fake......</li>
            <li> I have gone a full 8hr work shift with little to no creasing</li>
            <li> A Very good product you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the genuine product or not.  </li>
            <li> very chalky, even in summer it feels dry on my skin. ,</li>
            <li> Very cakey and similar to putting yellow flour on your face.</li>
            <li> , folks raved, apparently stars loves this stuff, and makeup artist rave about it.  </li>
            <li> like if I was 60 years old and I&#x27;m only 35.</li>
            <li> I put this on after bare minerals.</li>
            <li> but I bought the exact same product in a bigger bottle at different place for the same price.</li>
            <li> I would rather have just purchased a normal setting powder that was double the size for the same price.</li>
            <li> You can find the large bottle for $18 from other sellers..</li>
            <li> the little you might waste is ok</li>
            <li> It also tends to leave my face powdery looking which I usually look pretty natural</li>
            <li> I have green lines in my skin so the yellow just made face look the right color.  </li>
            <li> and I had to use so much to cover it up that it&#x27;s honestly not worth the mount I paid.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, I only use Bare Minerals powder as foundation.</li>
            <li> It is a little dusty if too much is put on, so make sure you use just enough after you apply liquid/creme foundation.</li>
            <li> I just look old and makes my under eyes look very very dry and cakey</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do anything so crazy amazing.</li>
            <li> Good product bad price this seller</li>
            <li> I put concealer under my eyes because I have really dark circles and most of the time you can still see a little bit of the dark circles but with this powder it seems to disappear!</li>
            <li> It is clearly appropriate for theatre, drag shows, or anything requiring a dramatic highlighting effect, but NOT for daylight, and certainly not if you&#x27;re into a natural look.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would say not suitable for ruddy undertones in the lightest shades.... be very mindful of application if you or client are going to photoshoot, as the camera picks everything up, even if you can&#x27;t see it!</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> this small was 6.00 a large once was 11.00&lt;</li>
            <li> I used a sponge wedge to apply the first layer of BN powder, then I used a large fluffy facial powder brush to apply a thin second layer of BN powder.</li>
            <li> when applying so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Its strange that its yellow</li>
            <li> normally I have trouble with creasing of my concealer under my eyes, with this I don&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> I tried wetting my beauty blender I tried using it dry, tried only using it as a setting powder and tried building it up</li>
            <li> This VERY yellow, thick powder, was applied properly, with high expectations.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face, especially under my eyes feel very dry and it doesn&#x27;t highlight the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this stuff a long time ago</li>
            <li> My search for an HG light-yellow finishing powder to replace the now DC’d old version of Everyday Minerals ”SUNLIGHT FINISHING POWDER”</li>
            <li> It stays well for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed race and use this to set my concealer when I wear minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a lighter yellow.  </li>
            <li> i only have to check it like once daily and no worries compared to every 2 hours or less.  </li>
            <li> I am half Salvadorian, so I am tan, but since I&#x27;m mixed with white</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t real, product is not authentic !</li>
            <li> This makes my pores look non-existant, is not heavy or cakey and is minimal mess.</li>
            <li> and I cant wait to purchase other Ben Nye Powders for my make up kit for my clients that have multiple skin color tones.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s no different than any other finishing powder out there.</li>
            <li> As someone with remarkably sensitive skin, it&#x27;s hard to find a product such as this that won&#x27;t make me burst out into a rash.</li>
            <li> looks a little bit yellowish and weird after a few minutes it blends in with the skin I love it!</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the powder dispenses in large quantities and can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a product that tends to make my make look mate and dry.</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Dry skin does not need help looking matte.</li>
            <li> makes my skin dry also</li>
            <li> Its eh for dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it does not leave me looking cakey in areas or too dry in others.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I have some red based foundations that will not go to waste, I can now use them with this powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: for me using a yellow based foundation and this powder does not work</li>
            <li> I bought this powder because Kim Kardashian has the same skin tone as me: olive skin tone with dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> Banana powder works well, especially for those with a dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> At first i was just using it as a setting powder for my foundation but after being in a wedding, and watching as the makeup artist use it as a concealer/landing strip under my eyes, I have stepped up my game.</li>
            <li> This powder gives a very yellow cast and extremely mattifies your makeup, like extremely matte even with the lightest touch.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wash me out like typical white finishing powders!</li>
            <li> this powder will last for years as a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I tried it both wet and dry</li>
            <li> I like the product overall, kinda gets a little too dry under the eye after having  it on all day.</li>
            <li> I now will never live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Its Very dry and u Can not wear it alone.</li>
            <li> but I only use a little.</li>
            <li> A little too yellow on my medium skin plus my concealer (IT Cosmetics)</li>
            <li> It brought my face back to life by taking away a little bit of sheen in my face.  </li>
            <li> It looked a little yellow on me</li>
            <li> (only needs a little).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get that crazy halo look in photos like when the concealer is too light for the skin tone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this because it&#x27;s way lighter than I expected, I plan on giving it as a gift to someone else.</li>
            <li> This powder isn&#x27;t all I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Not at tall what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try this product because of how much fame it got after Kim K revealed her contour and highlighting secret......</li>
            <li> Not as fancy as I expected</li>
            <li> Not at all as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> So just be careful to blend well as with anything.</li>
            <li> It does the job but not much highlighting to it.</li>
            <li> Arrive way before it was expected to.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> keep secret glad the secret is out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self is fine but too expensive!</li>
            <li> the only down side is that it is too dark for my under eye area, but i use it on other clients and it works.</li>
            <li> &amp; I only use a little and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.......</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way; my bottle looks like the one in the picture still, and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had is that it&#x27;s too small of a bottle.</li>
            <li> my other brand name powder just dont compare</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Thinking about trying the other products from Ben</li>
            <li> and i usually have to watch for the oils peaking thru my make on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It arrived before it was due to come so that was a plus</li>
            <li> so I can apply easier but other than that, the shade is perfection.</li>
            <li> It looks like any other mat powder on the skin..</li>
            <li> i will like to try other shades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this powder in other shades</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting both and seeing how you like one over the other.</li>
            <li> I personally like to dip the brush into a lid before applying and the lid is too small for that.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t have a heavy hand</li>
            <li> 1.5 may seem small especially for the price</li>
            <li> Will be ordering other products from them.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> too pricey for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!!</li>
            <li> good ill keep it nothing to go crazy about</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied at all the applicator was very tiny for $35 it was not worth it</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> this was not right.</li>
            <li> If you are into makeup as much as I am you would know what I mean about this product being everything!!</li>
            <li> I am African-American with a dark brown complexion and use this product after I add my contour and concealer.</li>
            <li> I just dont see much of a difference for the absurd price.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product for dark undereye circles works wonderss</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have kinda dark skin and darkness around my eye.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully camouflage my dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is meant to use on medium to dark or dark skin people</li>
            <li> I think it is too dark for setting my under eye which is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t see my dark under eye area anymore</li>
            <li> I have a hate love relationship with it though.</li>
            <li> hands down</li>
            <li> then let me down.</li>
            <li> I wish they could lower the price down again</li>
            <li> LOOK AT OTHER SITES !</li>
            <li> If you are pale or light skin this would definitely not work for highlighting your under eye area , actually it would look make yor under eye bags look even worst</li>
            <li> It is a really small container but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (I have not use it in black skin)</li>
            <li> this powder is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;i was torn in betwen when i tried to make d purchase decision because i&#x27;m a black african(Nigerian.)</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bigger powder but it is a small one, really small...</li>
            <li> but I think after using it that it is typical.</li>
            <li> less cakey that way.</li>
            <li> It made me appear sick with jaundice - it did not blend well using both light or heavy hands.  </li>
            <li> Getting it open was not easy, maybe I&#x27;m just slow</li>
            <li> Makes a mess, think powder on your clothes and on your vanity, if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Used it to set undereye concealer and it just turned into a cakey mess.</li>
            <li> and then it looked like a powdery mess all over my face.</li>
            <li> makes a mess.</li>
            <li> This is a mess, gets all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I am used to using bare minerals, where there is a container that you can use for dipping your face brush in, so this is frustrating to use since its basically just a pour out container.</li>
            <li> keep lid tightly secured though, it will spill out.</li>
            <li> Only gripe is that it&#x27;s expensive for the size, BUT a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little ashy for NW40 skin.</li>
            <li> I just use a little</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> In order to use my brush, I have to pour out a little bit on a tissue and dab from there.</li>
            <li> I use this for dark circles and all I can say when I got this product was why didn&#x27;t I get this before!</li>
            <li> A little worried being it is stage</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not, just use a little.  </li>
            <li> It was a little messy getting out of the container.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> If you contour and highlight EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> &amp; now all I can do is throw it away and my money had been WASTED</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> but I use it every time I apply heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is fake do not waste your money</li>
            <li> extremely messy and looked</li>
            <li> This product is NOT cheap...</li>
            <li> It made me look dead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 5 months.</li>
            <li> Products comes our alot when using which is a waste</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s overpriced and messy.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day my face looked so dried</li>
            <li> I wish it was easier to apply though - the lid wastes powder if you try and use it as a place to dip your brush into.</li>
            <li> But not for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll write a review after I&#x27;ve stopped crying over the death of my wallet &amp; use the powder.</li>
            <li> Other than that I hardly use it and when I do I don&#x27;t use a lot</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> I just wish this little bottle were a little cheaper !</li>
            <li> I put it in the lid to avoid mess but the lid is too small for my sponge</li>
            <li> the only thing is that is very difficult to apply, I think it needs a different container or something!</li>
            <li> Was so disappointed it completely turned the area under my eyes into an a yellow orange&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really easy to use maybe I will use it one day.</li>
            <li> Super annoying.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit under my eyes with a damp beauty blender and it covered my under eyes so well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m applying very little.  </li>
            <li> my concealer creses way too much with this powder bad product</li>
            <li> i was really shocked when i found it to be so much on here.</li>
            <li> This powder is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It to small</li>
            <li> its definitely not authentic.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that the shipping took awhile (because i am impatient!)</li>
            <li> I had a small amount of creasing under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Cap is too small to use with the brush.</li>
            <li> It brightens and keeps my makeup on longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I definitely was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Annoyed I spent the money on this.</li>
            <li> and then I end up wasting powder because it is difficult to put it back in the container.</li>
            <li> On top of this, this powder is horribly wasteful.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about the product.</li>
            <li> The bottle does look small but it has plenty of powder in there</li>
            <li> So expensive for a tiny 1.5oz bottle!</li>
            <li> but it can be very messy.</li>
            <li> If I may make a suggestion, if you find banana is too light/makes your skin seem dull or ashy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a sucker for every gimmick (like me), throw your money in my direction &amp; skip on buying this product.  </li>
            <li> I think this suits well for darker complexion, at least what I&#x27;ve seen on youtube and myself.</li>
            <li> The label was applied wonky.</li>
            <li> I am a darker skinned black woman and this powder doesnt make my face look &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; I suggest watching a you tube video on the proper way to use and apply this product to avoid looking like a crazy person!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY dry, matte and sinks into every minuscule crease :(</li>
            <li> The banana power bottle was so small!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a really small size!</li>
            <li> --you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Paying $35 for banana powder is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get powder back into it.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to open container</li>
            <li> Is very small and way too expensive to be so messily packaged.  </li>
            <li> and what I saw when I took pictures was not good.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ITS FAKE.</li>
            <li> Banana powder has been going crazy over past few months, wanted to try this one out.</li>
            <li> I keep trying to use it every once in a while and each time I&#x27;m just as disappointed as the last.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product I was really looking forward to using it</li>
            <li> Please, don&#x27;t waste $30 on this!!!</li>
            <li> This powder changed the makeup game for me.</li>
            <li> but sadly it&#x27;s not as great as they say.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind a brightening effect on NC40 - NC42 skin tone..</li>
            <li> The product is poor quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> FALSE</li>
            <li> Not really my ideal highlighting powder for nights</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a FAKE and a SCAM.</li>
            <li> I think it might be fake.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love it exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works perfect for any skin tone and makes skin look flawless</li>
            <li> As someone with remarkably sensitive skin, it&#x27;s hard to find a product such as this that won&#x27;t make me burst out into a rash. So, this stuff is great. However, my original plan was to use it for highlighting but that has resolved into just using as an all-over powder to balance skin tone and also get rid of shine.  It&#x27;s light and doesnt feel like you&#x27;re wearing a mask, and isn&#x27;t yellow.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, but for the hype and cost, I would only purchase this if you are like me and can never seem to find a product that works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product at a concealer/highlighter.  It works pretty great.  I just need to find the perfect brush/sponge to apply it.</li>
            <li> I had seen loads of YouTube videos and read about this powder. I honestly thought it was hype, especially at this price point. I&#x27;ve used chanel powder for years and years and most recently Bobbi Brian&#x27;s yellow shadow under my eyes. This powder is unbelievable. Use to highlight, on your whole face, or alone. It&#x27;s spun gold and entirely magical. I have a dark, middle eastern complexion and this color is perfect. I can&#x27;t imagine it working on lighter skin, but people swear by it. If you have deep skin tones (I&#x27;m neutral undertone) then I strongly recommend this powder!</li>
            <li> I really like this powder even thou at the beginning when you apply it looks a little bit yellowish and weird after a few minutes it blends in with the skin I love it! the coverage is really good for people that has dark circles. I am a professional Makeup artist and I use this on my clients regardless of their skin color (I have use it in fair, tan and olive skin) (I have not use it in black skin)</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW SMOOTH IT IS AND THE COVER IT DOES I USE IT TO BRIGHTEN MY EYES AND CHEEK BONE AND LOVE IT AND THE PRICE IS SO GREAT</li>
            <li> Great product, cant wait to use!</li>
            <li> Will never be without it! I am African-American with a dark brown complexion and use this product after I add my contour and concealer. It can also be worn over foundation as a finishing powder. the Finish is smooth, silky and helps control shine.</li>
            <li> I am happy that Kim K gave this product notariety!!!  I loved it!!!  Sisters, don&#x27;t let the yellow color fool ya, it works well also on African American skin color as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Kim K.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a FAKE and a SCAM. Do not buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cakey and cheaply made. I want&lt;br /&gt;my money back. So disappointed I fell&lt;br /&gt;for this fraud.</li>
            <li> I use this powder to set my concealer under my eyes. It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all. I am light tan and the color is perfect for me. I just wish this little bottle were a little cheaper !</li>
            <li> Makes a mess, think powder on your clothes and on your vanity, if you are in a hurry. I use it on my under eye area after I apply a cream concealer. Works fairly nice.</li>
            <li> I do not like it one bit. The packaging was horrible, held in place by a tape, the powder was like baking flour</li>
            <li> I wil buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Makeup Artist.. Lets just say I absolutely Love it.. A Very good product you will not be disappointed.. I wished I could have posted a picture to show the results..</li>
            <li> Benefit: for me using a red based foundation and this powder works well i.e. NW45 it gives a neutral finish.  Thankfully I have some red based foundations that will not go to waste, I can now use them with this powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: for me using a yellow based foundation and this powder does not work, I look ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Paul Hammond</li>
            <li> This product is just ok ... I like that it will give you a highlight look but it&#x27;s a product that tends to make my make look mate and dry. I&#x27;m a dewy make up person bit overall it l&#x27;s a okay product just not my every day look</li>
            <li> Nothing against the seller but the product... I just dont see much of a difference for the absurd price. If you are doing basic highlighting already with concealer, this banana powder does nothing to enhance it. I would rather have just purchased a normal setting powder that was double the size for the same price.</li>
            <li> I bought this powder to set my concealer and use it mostly under my eyes and sometimes over my highlight. It works great and seems to be perfect for my cream-light tan skin tone. In my opinion it works beautifully over cream and liquid products. It has made such a difference when wearing my makeup over time (I am a nurse and work 12hrs+) and when I get home from a busy night everything is still in place and I have no under-eye creases. I have enjoyed this so much that I recently purchased a translucent powder by Laura Mercier for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as it seemed. I really expected some kind of miracle thing that kim kardashian uses and that I was lucky to come upon but it doesn&#x27;t do anything so crazy amazing. It works well but I think I might not even be using it 100% correctly. As a powder it doesn&#x27;t cover much, it maybe makes complexion a bit more even or so but doesn&#x27;t really hide redness or undereye circles. Not that great. It&#x27;s fine, just not what I was excited about. It also tends to leave my face powdery looking which I usually look pretty natural so I don&#x27;t like that. I think Bare Minerals is probably better and is what I&#x27;ll stick with in the future.</li>
            <li> In love with this product. It brightens my fave and sets my makeup so nice!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> A normal loose powder nothis special. I used it under my eyes and for contouring and i didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Love it, accurate with description and expectation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian on a lighter shade skin (&amp;#34;maputi&amp;#34;). This banana shade perfectly matches my skin tone. I use it as a highlight when I try to use contour techniques on my face. I use this for the sections where light shades need to be in. Also, I use it as a finishing powder sometimes to keep concealer and liquid make-up in place longer. Don&#x27;t need to use too much when I use it. Love it!</li>
            <li> It works great, but I wish it was a little lighter to use for highlighting while contouring.</li>
            <li> This is a good concealer but not miracle concealer that I read about in all the magazines.</li>
            <li> I know lots of people really like this product but for me it was just ok. Used it to set undereye concealer and it just turned into a cakey mess. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again and probably won&#x27;t use the product I have left.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! love it love it</li>
            <li> It to small i thout it big</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this because it&#x27;s way lighter than I expected, I plan on giving it as a gift to someone else.</li>
            <li> A little ashy for NW40 skin. I use this under my eyes only, sometimes in between my eyes and on my nose.</li>
            <li> I love the product! It came in a very timely manner and was true to how pictured. I have used it on several of my clients since received and i love the matte finish it gives and highlight! Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am a darker skinned black woman and this powder doesnt make my face look &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; I suggest watching a you tube video on the proper way to use and apply this product to avoid looking like a crazy person! lol</li>
            <li> Great buy, lasts for a good while</li>
            <li> The best highlight powder ever! Its small but more than enough. It pops brightness right into my face. Its not heavy and its just luxurious. Definitely will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I get better results from using my Benefit highlighter. This powder isn&#x27;t all I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Great product! Awesome transaction with the seller! Product lives up to its&#x27; great reviews! One of the best items to use for highlighting out there!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and it worked very well ....</li>
            <li> This product takes your look to another level ! It feels like silk as I apply it and it blends very easily . I use it to set my under eye concealer and I use it for highlighting and contouring my face . This product also helps to give your face a nice matte finish . Inexpensive product that helps you look like a MILLION BUCKS !!! Shipping was not as fast as I would have liked but it was worth the wait .</li>
            <li> I think it might be fake.</li>
            <li> I luved this product .. Color is perfect to brighten the under eyes .. Quality is v soft and rich .. It doesn&#x27;t cake over foundation or concealer if used in the right amount .. I am a makeup artist and I use it all the time :)</li>
            <li> Great product i must say. GreaT for oily skin</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. It took a while to receive but was happy when I received this. This is always out at makeup stores so luckily I found it on Amazon at a good price. It&#x27;s a great product for oily skin and easy to blend. Sometimes I only use this on my face without foundation.</li>
            <li> this is my absolutely favorite product! It does everything and more! Remember if you havent used and plan on&lt;br /&gt;using it, that you will need some contouring or some blush because it can make you look yellow! but i am in love&lt;br /&gt;with this!! It is a setting powder and since I use the banana color, I just use it where I highlite!</li>
            <li> i recommend this to everyone. gives you you that perfect finish look we all look for and feels extra smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> I freakn love this stuff ! I love putting it on after all my makeup is on. It blends it perfectly and gives you a good matte never dull finish . I just wish I would&#x27;ve got the bigger side . I&#x27;m a medium skin tone  Chanel ; B30 Dior air flash 201  combination skin</li>
            <li> This powder changed the makeup game for me. I just use a little and I end up with a beautiful glow, and I receive alot of compliments</li>
            <li> A cannot do without product for a make-up novice or the most talented of make-up artists! a Plus One addition to your kit!!</li>
            <li> The product looks fishy. It is rougher and darker than the one I am used to</li>
            <li> This a staple in any makeup collection.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> its definitely not authentic. its really cakey</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a sucker for every gimmick (like me), throw your money in my direction &amp; skip on buying this product.  I agree with the reveiwer who stated it&#x27;s like baking powder.  This VERY yellow, thick powder, was applied properly, with high expectations.  The packaging is a nightmare, so I changed containers immediately to prevent spillage or over use.  When applied over cream concealer, I was ready for the circus!  It showed every line, including those I didn&#x27;t know I had.  It made me appear sick with jaundice - it did not blend well using both light or heavy hands.  I admire Mario, who uses this a lot on his clients and believes in it, but this particular recommendation of his is a TOTAL BOMB.  I have a fair to medium complexion with minimal facial skin flaws.  I have a lot of experience with powders and make-up application.  Trust me, it&#x27;s dirt cheap for a reason, but sellers are constantly raising the price (in greed) due to demand.  When this fad passes, you&#x27;ll find yourself entrusting in your older, tried &amp; true powders.  ~Stay beautiful!</li>
            <li> it was nice to have , since everyone else seems to be going crazy about this..i figured i should have one too....for the price you cant go wrong for what it can do....the only thing i dont like was the packaging...it gets kind of messy to work with it...</li>
            <li> 1st I applied foundation, contour, concealer. Put banana power all the highlighted areas with powder puff. With damp sponge or power brush dab all the highlighted area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a super excellent product specially if you want to have a Kim Kardashian look.</li>
            <li> Sets concealer PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> works good ill keep it nothing to go crazy about wanted to try it now I have it. ill work whit it..</li>
            <li> love it!!! better than expected!!</li>
            <li> great product definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Love it ! Good setting powder.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product and I love it!! I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Bought for someone they seem to really like it</li>
            <li> Love this powder... an excellent product. I have used it for the first time and really like how it blends and enhances my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!! You can Ben nye powder powder for much cheaper. Paying $35 for banana powder is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> amazing to set your concealer i would use a sponge using a brush dosent give you the same aplication i would repurchase</li>
            <li> i really like this powder because it is so fine and sets everything in place. the only down side is that it is too dark for my under eye area, but i use it on other clients and it works.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks like corn starch.. I think it might be. Tried once and never touched again. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!!</li>
            <li> A tad too light, may make you look a little ashy depending on your skin tone or under tone.  However, it is a quality product to highlight your face with.  If I may make a suggestion, if you find banana is too light/makes your skin seem dull or ashy try their translucent face powder in topaz.  Now that works wonders, I love it! DestinyGodley has a great foundation routine video on YouTube where she uses topaz to highlight, check it out.  Best of luck</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference!</li>
            <li> Love the Ben Bye Luxury  powders.</li>
            <li> super this Banana Powder</li>
            <li> This shipped out very fast and the size will deff last me a while its great for setting the under eye area so glad i purchased this for my kit</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and all she said was EXCELLENT !!!! Highly recommend !!!!</li>
            <li> Great powder than evens out your skin tone.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> product came as described. great for setting highlight on nw 35 and darker skin tones. A staple in my artist kit.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Translucent powder does the job better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this powder!!! I use it as a highlighter when I contour and I sometime use it as a setting powder but I only use a little. My skin tone is caramel. The only problem I had is that it&#x27;s too small of a bottle. Other than that I hardly use it and when I do I don&#x27;t use a lot so the bottle is still full. I recommend this product for those who WON&#x27;T be using it often like me. If you contour and highlight EVERYDAY then I recommend you get a BIGGER size!!</li>
            <li> this powder is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;i was torn in betwen when i tried to make d purchase decision because i&#x27;m a black african(Nigerian.) but i gave it a trial and i am loving it soo very much.&lt;br /&gt;if you use it rightly it will work on your skin .&lt;br /&gt;soo black girls feel free to buy</li>
            <li> Please save your money bc this isn&#x27;t real, product is not authentic ! I am very disappointed in this product I was really looking forward to using it &amp; now all I can do is throw it away and my money had been WASTED</li>
            <li> I guess its ok.  I was scared to use it because it is so light in color and cakey.  I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;m Gabriel unions complexion and it highlights and sets my makeup amazingly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real product. It doesn&#x27;t sit well on skin especially under my eyes, it starts showing my lines and it ends up looking Cakey.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Banana powder has been going crazy over past few months, wanted to try this one out. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s like applying flour to your face. Please, don&#x27;t waste $30 on this!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed, it didn&#x27;t hardly make any difference unless you put a load of it on and then it looked like a powdery mess all over my face. Was not as described.</li>
            <li> Great as described, I just wish for the price it was a bigger container. It is a really small container but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned and thought this product would be too light on my face- however it is a great highlighting product that matches well with all shades and tones. It is long lasting and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I use this powder to set my under eye concealer and it does a great job of keeping it in place without looking cakey. It also works to help highlight that area. Great powder!</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied at all the applicator was very tiny for $35 it was not worth it so I sent it back and got a respond</li>
            <li> After watching several YouTube videos about this product I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Oh how I wish that I started using this earlier. At first i was just using it as a setting powder for my foundation but after being in a wedding, and watching as the makeup artist use it as a concealer/landing strip under my eyes, I have stepped up my game. A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I love the way it brightens my eyes.</li>
            <li> This powder is great for highlighting and giving an overall glow to my face. I have a medium skin tone and this color works well for me.</li>
            <li> Beat makeup ever... So smooth and silky, It leaves your face looking like a Glamorous Star.. I love it :)</li>
            <li> The product is awesome. Took a while for me to get it but it was a very easy process. Thanks</li>
            <li> The powder controls the shine and is very light. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face cakey. Love this product, will purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product. i would definitely recommend it to the beauty product lover! awesome for highlighting and halo looks.and the product lasts. had this for almost a year and havent run out yet. keep lid tightly secured though, it will spill out.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny my other brand name powder just dont compare</li>
            <li> I love this powder! great for highlighting and it doesnt make my concealer crease. Great for women of color. I do have to say that the shipping took awhile (because i am impatient!) but it arrived safe and sound with no broken lid. I would definitely buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and I have heard great reviews on this but sadly it&#x27;s not as great as they say. I&#x27;m medium complexion and I had to use so much to cover it up that it&#x27;s honestly not worth the mount I paid. I&#x27;ll keep to my liquid concealers they&#x27;ve seem to be doing a better job</li>
            <li> Ive heard raves about this banana powder and thought I&#x27;d try it out. Now I&#x27;m no makeup pro, but when I apply it I really can&#x27;t notice it. But in pics w/ a flash I&#x27;m a ghost! lol. I only apply it under my eyes on top of my concealer. Maybe I need to work on blending. But this is still an awesome product. A little goes a loooong way :)</li>
            <li> This powder came in good conditions. I was expecting a bigger powder but it is a small one, really small... Overall I do not see any difference but I use it every time I apply heavy makeup. It is soft. It is a yellow powder but it doesn&#x27;t give that color to your face.</li>
            <li> BEST setting powder ever!!! I love how it sets my under eye concealer!!! And the best part you can actually use it to set your foundation as well, of course if you&#x27;re light skinned toned.</li>
            <li> I wished it worked for me like everyone else. It does smell very nice the powder is soft. It did not go well with the foundation that works for my skin so it was a justa product mismatch for me I guess, it happens.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the bad guy because this powder is so heavily raved about but it just does not do it for me. I am in shade NC45 of MAC foundations and I have dry skin. This powder gives a very yellow cast and extremely mattifies your makeup, like extremely matte even with the lightest touch. Dry skin does not need help looking matte. I have a very cool undertone but this is still too yellow.</li>
            <li> Why did I not buy this sooner! Its a little pricey but it does a great job. Definitely would recommend. worth every penny and you dont even need to use that much when applying so the bottle will last a long time.I just dab it on a triangular make up sponge to set my under eye concealer and its good to go! Flawless.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for my complexion as a highlighter im a very light skinned black woman so if you are medium to light skinned I definitely recommend.  Gives your skin a nice healthy glow!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product with in two days,just in time for a wedding.  I had many compliment s on my skin. I give it a 5</li>
            <li> I like the product overall, kinda gets a little too dry under the eye after having  it on all day.</li>
            <li> I LOOVE this product!! Highlights perfectly!! Doesn&#x27;t look yellow on my skin at all!! This is probably one of my favorite go to makeup items!!</li>
            <li> This powder is fantastic.. It is extremely finely milled and wonderfully sets face makeup as well as under eye concealer without caking up.. Leaves behind a brightening effect on NC40 - NC42 skin tone..</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I use it to set concealer under my eyes I wish I would have found this stuff a long time ago and I will buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product for dark undereye circles works wonderss</li>
            <li> This product is fake do not waste your money I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST THIS PRODUCT IS COUNTERFEIT</li>
            <li> I ordered my Ben Nye Banana powder on August 19th and received it on the 22nd! I got it just in time to use it as I was getting ready for work and my makeup lasted all night, and I looked bright and refreshed! LOVE  this product and I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real thing. Very cakey and similar to putting yellow flour on your face. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Save your money.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all!</li>
            <li> horrible product,,, don&#x27;t know what the rave is this is lousy</li>
            <li> Plastic container so shouldn&#x27;t be this much money</li>
            <li> This powder is nice. I don&#x27;t quite know what the rage is all about with this powder. My skin looked nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money for this again.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have moderately oily skin and I wish that it had more staying power, but it is wonderful, overall!</li>
            <li> Fast and speedy delivery, plus one of my favorite products. Great for setting makeup for an all day wear. Two thumbs up from this chic!</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage for my dark brown skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Ben nye banana powder. This is a awesome product just as i expected. Got here in great timing  love it!!</li>
            <li> I like this product.. it really works good.it gives u a nice finish over your foundation.it brings out the beauty.. flawless look..</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! It&#x27;s very luxurious and makes me feel beautiful! It brightens and highlights perfectly! Thank you Amazon and Ben Nye- You are amazing! :)</li>
            <li> very nice, it looks amazing on! the only thing is that is very difficult to apply, I think it needs a different container or something!</li>
            <li> I brought this item for my granddaughter who is a beginning makeup artist.  She really loves it because it was an essential item for makeup.</li>
            <li> Too powdery of a consistency - much like talcum powder/baby powder except in a banana-ish yellow. This is definitely a pure Ben Nye stage-makeup that looks relatively garish anywhere else but under bright theatrical lights. Plus, the expiry date really does matter with this as over time it seems to oxidize to a more orangey shade within the jar over time, even if it goes unused, so make sure when you buy it it’s not been sitting in some warehouse (or someones house) for months and months..&lt;br /&gt; My search for an HG light-yellow finishing powder to replace the now DC’d old version of Everyday Minerals ”SUNLIGHT FINISHING POWDER” circa 2007 continues. Moving on…unfortunately.</li>
            <li> No caking. It stays well for a long time. I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It was a little messy getting out of the container. I had a small amount of creasing under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is great! By far now one of my beauty staples. I am of mixed race and use this to set my concealer when I wear minimal makeup. This makes my pores look non-existant, is not heavy or cakey and is minimal mess. When going out it is great for highlighting and oil control.  I will be buying this as long as they make it. The seller is great, fast shipping and hassle free transaction, I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Worked as it said it would for my wife that is..LOL</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand the hype at first, but I love it now! Doesn&#x27;t wash me out like typical white finishing powders!</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMAZING!! best translucent powder on the market. it gives your skin a doll like matte finish that is just perfection. this belongs in everyones makeup bag for sure!!</li>
            <li> I love this product to highlight my face! It works with every skin tone and it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky look.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up on lighter skin shades so don&#x27;t purchase it if thats what you were born with.  I might need to get a tan just to see what this powder is all about.</li>
            <li> It ain&#x27;t all that. The way people on YouTube try to make it seem like. I do like&lt;br /&gt;It though</li>
            <li> Love my Ben nye  powder</li>
            <li> i use it mostly as a finishing powder. its smaller than i thought. Doesn&#x27;t really highlight much for me. So i just put it on top of my contouring. It does a good job in lasting all day, doesn&#x27;t get into my creases. Now, i do have oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t help with that. But over all okay</li>
            <li> To all makeup artist and/or anyone who loves make up, THIS PRODUCT IS NEEDED in all make up kits. It&#x27;s a GREAT highlighter and I cant wait to purchase other Ben Nye Powders for my make up kit for my clients that have multiple skin color tones.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I could be more clear....the hole in jar is small,won&#x27;t fit a brush,the lid is too small to pore powder in, won&#x27;t fit a brush....extremely messy and looked cake-y under the eye....especially if you have wrinkles, it just sits there.</li>
            <li> Look at the front design of the real thing.  They use a picture of the real banana powder, but sent something different.  The real powder says Ben Nye Banana Luxury Powder.  The one they sent says Ben Nye Luxury Powder Banana.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like the real thing either.  Feels like flour.</li>
            <li> Love it. It blends in perfectly with my concealer and the rest of my makeup. Thinking about trying the other products from Ben</li>
            <li> this is a great product.love this !!</li>
            <li> This contours you face very well I love it with a beauty blender. A product I can&#x27;t live without!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to love it or hate it. But I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;It sets concealer well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with expectations but I&#x27;m not too crazy about it. It makes my face, especially under my eyes feel very dry and it doesn&#x27;t highlight the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Not as impressed at I thought I would be but I still use it. I just use it as a base powder then a put a more natural tone over top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time odering and I even got my 16yr. old hooked. Were more than happy ladies.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I bought this powder..but I think after using it that it is typical. I purchased it after several you tube reviews but I didn&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about. I don&#x27;t think its much different that any other powder except that is it obviously more yellow. Maybe it didn&#x27;t do that much for me because I have a yellow undertone..also I have very oily skin and it didn&#x27;t do anything to prevent me from getting oily..For me It was good but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this banana powder but i feel like it doesnt really show on my light skin.</li>
            <li> 5 stars it did what I like, my skin looked so good. I have green lines in my skin so the yellow just made face look the right color.  Unsure if any of my friends would by this.  But if someone should ask I could say this works</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this product. i used it under my eyes to set my highlight, but it is entirely too matte and sits into every under eye crevice i didn&#x27;t know i had. i used it twice and probably will never use it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT GIVES MY UNDER EYE CONCEALER THAT XTRA UUMMMPH! AND IT HELPS MY CONCEALER TO NEVER CREASE. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I got this powder off of recommendations from several YouTube beauty gurus. It is the best setting powder for under the eyes. Keeps your concealer in tact &amp; doesn&#x27;t crease. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me. I applied the smallest amount and it took all the life out of my skin and I have oily combination skin. No matter how I tried it the product does not go on well. Save your money it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this powder, everyone made such a huge deal out of it and I understand why now! It doesn&#x27;t make concealer or foundation look cakey and it helps concealer stay put</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and I love it. I wanted to see the best way to put it on, so I watched some videos on YouTube and they were very helpful. Just type in Ben Nye in the search field. I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, I only use Bare Minerals powder as foundation. I put on my makeup as normal then I applied the Ben Nye powder under my eyes and on the high part or my cheek bones. I used a sponge wedge to apply the first layer of BN powder, then I used a large fluffy facial powder brush to apply a thin second layer of BN powder. It gives your skin an amazing glow, your skin will look perfect.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I tried it today for the first time and I can honestly say its like magic! I put concealer under my eyes because I have really dark circles and most of the time you can still see a little bit of the dark circles but with this powder it seems to disappear! I put a little bit under my eyes with a damp beauty blender and it covered my under eyes so well! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> The powder is great but my skin tone is too light for this product. So I went and bought a lighter color</li>
            <li> I just received this nifty little package today and so far I love it. My only problem is this is a shaker so you have to figure out a way to save product without wasting it. The best way is to use a make up sponge and dab on the areas that you need highlighted I&#x27;ve found that using a make up brush I loose a lot of product. I do have brown skin and this shows up very light and this also doubles as great powder if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on You Tube and I am glad I bought it. A little goes a long way. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> i like this for my face.  I have oily skin.  and i usually have to watch for the oils peaking thru my make on a regular basis.  now with this powder my face just glows.  not so oily now.  i only have to check it like once daily and no worries compared to every 2 hours or less.  will definatly be placing another order for some back up later on.</li>
            <li> Dint work for me it all very disappointed makes my skin dry also my concealer creses way too much with this powder bad product</li>
            <li> In order to use this product and pull it off nicely, you do need tan skin with a yellow undertone. I am half Salvadorian, so I am tan, but since I&#x27;m mixed with white I&#x27;m on the lighter side. I used to use it all the time when contour and highlighting because it does give my face a nice highlight, but realized it would make me look a bit orangey when applied on top of my makeup. It also has a terrible glow when taking flash photography. I think if I was darker complected I would like it more, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me. Not really my ideal highlighting powder for nights I know flash photography will be used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this set my highs in place... hands down a must have... It goes with any skin type...</li>
            <li> Ok--nothing to rave about</li>
            <li> Amazing product, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Cap is too small to use with the brush.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> Not at tall what I expected.  The color seems very faded compared to what I have seen in multiple videos.  I am very disappointed in this product.  I will still use it I just thought it would be different.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT...IT CONTROLS YOUR SKIN FROM GETTING OILY...SHOW UP GREAT ON PHOTOS!! IT LASTS FOR WHILE B/C A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!! VERY AFFORDABLE!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT A DOUBT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going to buy anything else but this to brighten under my eye...works beautifully and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for oily skin and making your makeup stay</li>
            <li> I ordered this for $15!!!! I have always wanted to try this product because of how much fame it got after Kim K revealed her contour and highlighting secret......it was one of the best things I have purchased! This product is NOT cheap...in fact it is like magic! I have such oily nose and oily forehead that everytime i wear makeup, it starts going away after 5 hours of being out. This product sets my foundation and it stays on my face all day!!!! It is the best thing I have found for my face seriously!!!! anybody that is hesitating on getting it....you wont regret it!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best setting powders I have ever used. I learned about it in a Makeup Class and she used it. It&#x27;s been my secret ever since!</li>
            <li> they use this powder on the stars and is a well..............keep secret glad the secret is out and it&#x27;s priced so we all can afford it :)</li>
            <li> This product is everything!! If you are into makeup as much as I am you would know what I mean about this product being everything!!</li>
            <li> Love it.....a little goes a long way.......quick shipping....sets my highlight perfectly</li>
            <li> I really like my ben nye banana power</li>
            <li> This color was too light for my skin tone i plan to order the topaz color which i think will work for me.  However the quality of this product is very good.</li>
            <li> This powder Rocks, long lasting, goes on smooth and even. My skin glows, blends perfectly. Beautiful finish...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy :) Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and after using the same makeup products for about 5 years I felt it was time for a change.  My makeup routine (Shiseido Hydro Liquid compact is a great product but was making my face too shiny by mid day).  I went onto YouTube and searched and watched many tutorials on applying making and makeup products.  I must say times have changed.  The young girls posting their tutorials are amazing with their before and after&#x27;s.  One of the products that really caught my eye was the BEN NYE LUXURY POWDER in Banana.  It claims to matte the area of your face with a fine milled powder. I actually purchased it from a website called Creative Makeup for professional make up artists before I realized it was sold on Amazon.  I was able to purchase an even smaller size at $12 a jar which still ended up being a lot of product and a large size (the jar is about 2-1/2 inches in diameter).  Just to be safe I also order the CAMEO color to see which was better for my skin tone.  So after purchasing all my new makeup products and putting them on I then applied the Banana Powder and YUCK!  A little too yellow on my medium skin plus my concealer (IT Cosmetics) all of sudden became cakey.  I didn&#x27;t want to give up so the next day I tried the CAMEO color - much better and lighter.  But still seemed cakey.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong. I&#x27;m applying very little.  It seems to be my biggest makeup challenge to find a really good concealer that wont settle into the creases of my eyes.  I did find that both powders put a nice finish on the eye area if you&#x27;re about 3 feet from my face.  And, yes, I used a Beauty Blender sponge and patted the powder very gently around the eye area.  At the end of my work day I tried patting the Cameo powder on my whole face.  It brought my face back to life by taking away a little bit of sheen in my face.  So with that, I would give it a try.  Watch the tutorials on YouTube and see if it&#x27;s a fit for you.</li>
            <li> Came in great time wonderful product works amazing</li>
            <li> Product kept my makeup set all day! Although I do suggest to exfoliate and mouisurize to ensure it looks nice and even on your skin so you don&#x27;t look crepe faced. Really helped keep a matte complexion all day, will order again!</li>
            <li> It brightens and keeps my makeup on longer than usual. It arrived before it was due to come so that was a plus</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product. The packaging is a little &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. In order to use my brush, I have to pour out a little bit on a tissue and dab from there. I don&#x27;t notice as much highlighting as I had anticipated. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews stating that this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;. Perhaps it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Sets your concelear and does not crease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had banana powder before...this was not right. It made me look dead</li>
            <li> THE REAL THING FOR A CHEAPER PRICE</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product I wanted to try it out. I have a hate love relationship with it though. I feel like it gives me a flawless finish, but idk it&#x27;s not what I expected to be. I don&#x27;t like the packaging makes a mess. I still use it though! I&#x27;ll use it til I&#x27;m out of it probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not as fancy as I expected but it&#x27;s ok. Getting it open was not easy, maybe I&#x27;m just slow but there was a kid that wouldnot come off. If you travel with it and then open it beware it will be everywhere! But it&#x27;s nice to set concealer under your eyes!</li>
            <li> Great product and it came way before the arrival was &amp;#34;due&amp;#34; (if you will) HOWEVER. people told me on certain sites I could find it way cheaper...FALSE I went to camera ready cosmetics and it was still between 15 and 22 dollars there as well! The product itself works like a charm to set under eye concealer to avoid creasing and oiliness on the t-zone, plus it adds just the slightest lightening almost &amp;#34;a glow from within&amp;#34; look...LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I felt like the reviews really hipped up the product for me then let me down. I got acne from this product so had to give it away. While I was using it I noticed it made me look cakey towards the end of the day (I have oily skin and needed to apply multiple times) I feel like this product is good for going out but not everyday wear.</li>
            <li> The powder is great although Im not loving the container- I will have to get a big sifter so I can apply easier but other than that, the shade is perfection.</li>
            <li> The product is poor quality. Its Very dry and u Can not wear it alone. I definitely was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does exactly what I need it to do!! It&#x27;s perfect for highlighting your face this product is highly recondmended for any pro makeup artist!!</li>
            <li> Used as a highlighter to give glow to face and under eyes to catch excess powder eye shadow. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best product I have in my kit. I will most definitely be buying more very soon 😄😄😄</li>
            <li> Love. And a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 5 months.</li>
            <li> Looooooooooooove this product!</li>
            <li> Not at all as I expected. It looks like any other mat powder on the skin..no &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; whatsoever. Just blah</li>
            <li> Its eh for dry skin. Best if you use a wet beauty blender to apply.... less cakey that way.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure its fake......Annoyed I spent the money on this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what should i say i don&#x27;t like it and i don&#x27;t hate it maybe cause ever body rave about it and when i used it it so normal</li>
            <li> Best setting powder out there. I found it cheaper tho....this powder will last for years as a little goes a long way! Its strange that its yellow but doesnt show up on your skin as yellow. One application in morning and lasts all day with no touch ups!</li>
            <li> I believed that hype for this product but he makes my skin looks so Kiki and when I looked in the mirror outside  I just look old and makes my under eyes look very very dry and cakey I hated this product</li>
            <li> I love how finely milled this powder is.  It is so nice on the face.  Some people use it as a highlight but I use it as an all over powder.</li>
            <li> Its not bad dont actually use it alot.I thought I would use it a little more.But it makes my concealer(bobbi brown)  crease terribly.</li>
            <li> Perfect neutral setting powder.</li>
            <li> What a little-known makeup gem! For people that have raccoon eyes and want something that will correct them without looking caked on, Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder is the absolute best. I mixed in two parts Banana Powder, one part Airspun in the color honey beige, and one part baby powder to create the perfect highlight setting powder that will knock those dark circles out, no question. And a little goes a long way; my bottle looks like the one in the picture still, and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just not silky enough. It just feels overrated. I did or the cream highter from A site called Fun Shop or Fun Shop which is the Ben Nye online seller and one of the things I ordered was the cream hilghter. The cream hilghter had A comment from someone where they gave it A very positve review! They carry all of the Ben Nye products and they are all very arrordable!</li>
            <li> i think this makes my make up look great i really recommend it i will like to try other shades</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was life before Ben-Nye the Luxury Powder Guy blessed my face with bananas?! This product is perfect for olive/tan skin. The finish it leaves over your concealer and highlighted areas is flawless. Ladies with darker skin PLEASE STAY AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana Powder with Sephora&#x27;s Classic Multitasker Powder Brush. This brush picks up the perfect amount of banana powder. If there is an excess amount on the brush, I simply tap it off, then proceed to lightly dab the powder over my concealer and BOOM! The magic happens :)</li>
            <li> The best Makeup accessory you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect in every way!</li>
            <li> Love this powder looks amaxing i will be buying more</li>
            <li> The only downfall is it is not that easy to apply. It would be better if there was a seperated compartment to put the powder in like my other loose powder container. I have to dab a bit in the top and use an angle sponge to get it and then I end up wasting powder because it is difficult to put it back in the container. However, it gets the job done with holding my under-eye concealer in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the genuine product or not.  The container is not efficient at all!  It is almost impossible to get powder back into it.  I like the powder, but I am looking for another container to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I love it use it when I am getting glannmmed up. Products comes our alot when using which is a waste</li>
            <li> This is a mess, gets all over the place.  Is very small and way too expensive to be so messily packaged.  I got because this was all over YouTube, folks raved, apparently stars loves this stuff, and makeup artist rave about it.  I think it&#x27;s overpriced and messy.  Made my underwater concealer crease.  I have normal skin, this must be for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before, this powder gives the best under eye highlight.. And it pretty much woks well with all skin shades...very easy to blend and it feels great on the skin..</li>
            <li> Love the silky feel to this lightweight powder, Ben Nye products are the best!</li>
            <li> I just got mine today...and i love it! Im an African american women...and it works wonders. A must have!  I brought this online it came in two weeks from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Brightens my dark under eye circles really nicely.</li>
            <li> Came on time. The powder works great for dark eye circles, if used in moderation.</li>
            <li> I have kinda dark skin and darkness around my eye. Still when i put them under my eyes to cover the consealor they give very neutral look</li>
            <li> This product helps keep my combination skin matte ALL day! The color is actually good for neutralizing redness and perfect for setting makeup/foundation. The only down side is that the powder dispenses in large quantities and can be a little messy. I use a beauty blender to apply and manage putting on just the right amount. Will definitely buy once I run out!</li>
            <li> ~ i love this luxury power  it works for me lady that why i give it 5 stars~</li>
            <li> This powder is everything that everyone said it was! I love it!</li>
            <li> very chalky, even in summer it feels dry on my skin. ,</li>
            <li> Love it! Need to buy more! Love the way it sets my foundation and how it feels on the skin. This is the one!</li>
            <li> Works amazing for me (being a kind of caramel color) however choose the color that is right for your skin tone.  This isn&#x27;t the only one!! Other than that this stuff is amazing and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I think I choose the wrong color.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural looking glow, very noticeable</li>
            <li> This product deserves the reviews. Very fine milled powder that is excellent for setting concealers or foundation. I am a MAC NC42 and its perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Really shows all of my imperfections</li>
            <li> What can i say. Banana Powder is the bomb!!!</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say how amazing this powder is! When I wear it over my liquid foundation it smooths out my skin making me look flawless! I will most likely be ordering another one</li>
            <li> The powder goes on very bright and cakey...It is clearly appropriate for theatre, drag shows, or anything requiring a dramatic highlighting effect, but NOT for daylight, and certainly not if you&#x27;re into a natural look. A make up artist would blend this with a lighter product for a more natural effect.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing machine. I bought this powder because Kim Kardashian has the same skin tone as me: olive skin tone with dark under eyes. So I thought, let me do what she&#x27;s supposedly doing. I followed all the techniques: bought the powder, bought the sponge, bought the fan brush. I was excited to try this out. When I applied the powder I allowed for it to set in for 5 minutes. I even put alot on, just like some tutorials show you to do. I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...yellow corrective creme + yellow corrective setting powder &#x3D; how could I go wrong? It doesn&#x27;t fully camouflage my dark under eyes. They can still be seen. On top of this, this powder is horribly wasteful. I have to tap out a pile of it on top of a tissue so then I can use my sponge on it to apply to my under eyes. I end up throwing away unused powder on that tissue. I feel duped because it doesn&#x27;t cover up my under eye circles well enough. The same job this powder gives me, is also given to me by using yellow corrective creme + regular face powder.... I end up putting regular face powder over this banana powder anyway. Thus, my under eyes eventually look cakey. I can live without this Banana powder. I feel as though I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing gimmick. She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is. I wonder if she got a cut of profit from the Ben Nye makeup people.</li>
            <li> This is a very good makeup powder to set your face up for the whole day</li>
            <li> excellent powder it gave me, a flawless finish my makeup looks very professional i love this powder.</li>
            <li> I watched so many youtube videos where artists used this product.  I have pale skin and this does not show up on my face at all.</li>
            <li> The banana power bottle was so small! the photo really bigger than what I got! The power it&#x27;s self is fine but too expensive!</li>
            <li> I am trying this prodcut for the first time so a lot of my trouble is my own lack of experience. I would like for the lid to be larger to aid in applying the product. I put it in the lid to avoid mess but the lid is too small for my sponge so I ended up using a concealer brush. The color is excellent for highlighting and it blends wonderfully. It sets my concealer well.</li>
            <li> Was so disappointed it completely turned the area under my eyes into an a yellow orange&lt;br /&gt;Was really looking forward to this product will never listen to tutorials again!</li>
            <li> Love it , it definitely gives a great finish . Just be weary of using a good concealer under cause it doesn&#x27;t sit well with all , some may crack once this is applied as a highlight .</li>
            <li> Good product bad price this seller</li>
            <li> Must buy! It brightens up the under eye amazingly</li>
            <li> Makes my makeup stay on all day without smudges :) &amp; I only use a little and it works wonders! Everyone who is into makeup should have this in there bag!...</li>
            <li> I think this suits well for darker complexion, at least what I&#x27;ve seen on youtube and myself. I use this for dark circles and all I can say when I got this product was why didn&#x27;t I get this before!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because so many people rave about this powder. Honestly it&#x27;s no different than any other finishing powder out there. It does however apply on great. I do love the hint of color I get.</li>
            <li> yuk! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but when I put this on over my concealer I looked like an old lady! SO BAD!</li>
            <li> I was soo hyped about this and i had to order..the powder is sooo fine and goes on well. I use it for highlight</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It works great on all skin types, even darker complexions like myself.  After applying,  it is flawless. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item when it was cheaper it really worked and was amazing. I wish they could lower the price down again</li>
            <li> Many claim this is not authentic but I also purchased one from a different company that sells authentic products and it was exactly the same thing. It didn&#x27;t work well and will never use it again. I tried wetting my beauty blender I tried using it dry, tried only using it as a setting powder and tried building it up but the results were alway the same, it dried up my face so much to the point that I had wrinkles I never knew I had. At the end of the day my face looked so dried like if I was 60 years old and I&#x27;m only 35. Maybe this would work on someone very young without any laugh lines or someone with tons of botox like a kardashian. If you want the best setting powder out there with a silky feel and smooth face I love the Nars setting powder.</li>
            <li> made all of my concealers appear yellow on the face</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean so this powder isn&#x27;t sold anywhere in my country. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people online raving about this product so I wanted to see what the big fuss was about. But let me tell you! It&#x27;s by far the best setting powder I&#x27;ve used ( I&#x27;m a makeup artist ) and it sets my concealer perfectly. I&#x27;ve order this powder in other shades and I can&#x27;t wait for them to arrive. The only problem I have with this product is the packaging. But I still give it full ratings and will recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s thinking of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Great leaves a nice glow</li>
            <li> Must have with beauty blender and urban decay up all nighter spray. A little goes a long way, fav for sure</li>
            <li> love this stuff!!! I don&#x27;t know how I could do without it!&lt;br /&gt;I will always repurchase! sets my highlight perfectly!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for spouse. Per spouse, powder gives great matte finish but can be messy so try not to get on clothes.</li>
            <li> Feels awesome and it fits all day</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s light weight and looks great. I wish it was easier to apply though - the lid wastes powder if you try and use it as a place to dip your brush into.</li>
            <li> I love the way the powder looks and feels on. It just seems like I have to put a lot on to really make an impact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this really works for Caucasian skin tones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Ordered this on a Friday afternoon and received this in hand the following Monday.</li>
            <li> Order was fast and product was great.</li>
            <li> I put this on after bare minerals. My face does not get as sweaty and oily throughout the day especially with the humidity this summer. Goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> This is priced way to high the bottle is really tiny, I ordered another ogle from the Fun shop and a bottle this small was 6.00 a large once was 11.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is nice both the price I deceptive</li>
            <li> This powder is just what I needed to brighten my face where I applied concealer it just gives you the perfect highlight to your face,  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else</li>
            <li> Good for ALMOST any skin tone/shade. I would say not suitable for ruddy undertones in the lightest shades.... be very mindful of application if you or client are going to photoshoot, as the camera picks everything up, even if you can&#x27;t see it! So just be careful to blend well as with anything. Otherwise, its my new favorite! !</li>
            <li> Im impressed with the satisfactory of this product i look forward to putting it on every day only wish the bottle was bigger so i didnt have to dred on buying another.</li>
            <li> It looked Ashley on my brown skin. I tried it both wet and dry still looked bad . Not happy</li>
            <li> I loved how quick I received my purchase.  This product is all I had heard about and it was well worth trying @BenNye</li>
            <li> not  as great as all the hype goes on a little thick. i am not obsessed with the product but i do like it.</li>
            <li> BEST EVER highlighter- a little goes a long way, wear it everyday and have a TON left, probably last me 6 months</li>
            <li> Perfect highlighting.  Smooth.  Light.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing that Kim Kardashian uses it as a highlighter. I have caramel skin and it works well when I apply it with a brush, despite the brand&#x27;s recommendation for a sponge. I would suggest getting both and seeing how you like one over the other. The Banana color is used on a lot of different skin tones and I feel like its the safest bet for a newbie. It is a little dusty if too much is put on, so make sure you use just enough after you apply liquid/creme foundation.</li>
            <li> What is all the fuss about! This is just an Ok powder! It is good for red skin but not so much for under the eye like experts say. I also do not understand the packaging. I personally like to dip the brush into a lid before applying and the lid is too small for that.</li>
            <li> This powder is so yellow and powdery it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> Was a but disappointed as I didn&#x27;t see what the hype and excitement was about. Has a starchy consistency that helps with my oily t-zone and that&#x27;s it. But for highlighting and contouring, I prefer my sleek face form palette.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right .</li>
            <li> The best finishing powder I have ever used</li>
            <li> IM FAIR TO MED SKINNED TONE AND THIS WORKS PREFECT TO SET MY UNDER EYE CONCEALER !! ITS A STAPLE IN MY DAILY FOUNDATION ROUTINE !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK THIS BAD BOY OUT ON MY YOUTUBE BEAUTY CHANNEL ( kimkreations p)FOUNDATION ROUTINE VIDEO TO SEE IT IN ACTION !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, GOOGLE BEN NYE BANANA POWDER AND LOOK AT OTHER SITES ! BECAUSE YOU CAN LITERALLY GET THIS FOR JUST $10 !!! AMAZONS IS OVERPRICED</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it until 2 or 3 weeks later. At first I thought they didn&#x27;t send it at all it. But I did contact them and they did get back to me which was good</li>
            <li> It was excellent. There&#x27;s nothing on the market like it.</li>
            <li> Good products may not match the demand in terms of color, but good&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the delay in shipment or not the order of the cargo well, leading to damage&lt;br /&gt;This thing and Ajthh more than once</li>
            <li> Great for contouring!</li>
            <li> its a excellent highlighter...love it</li>
            <li> My duaghter tried it and she is very saticfied with the item</li>
            <li> The label is different and also compared to my sisters which she did not get from Amazon hers is richer in texture. Please be ware this is not the real deal!!</li>
            <li> Hated it. Seems fake.</li>
            <li> if it doesnt work just move on gosh not everything works for everyone use wisdom just use something else no one never put any gun to your head to use it .</li>
            <li> Just amazing sets my eye make up and concealer perfectly</li>
            <li> Item came on time, i only used it once but I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> This fine powder really naturally highlights anything you want highlighted and set. I use it under my eyes in a &amp;#34;triangle&amp;#34; for highlighting and I get the most natural but flawless &amp;#34;Kim kardashian&amp;#34; highlighted glow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if the formula is genuine. Not seeing what everyone raves about when it comes to this powder. Giving it a good rating for my lack of consciousness.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t have a heavy hand and you know how to apply it on, it will come out absolutely amazing I love this product!</li>
            <li> I use this powder as a highlighter under my eyes and it works great.  It makes my make-up look put together.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but to my surprise it was junk. I a&lt;br /&gt;Have a caramel color condition and this product has done nothing for me. The application is horrible.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and ladies this works for all skin tones. Don&#x27;t let the color scare you, its all in how u apply it. 1.5 may seem small especially for the price but it has a lot of product. If you&#x27;re not sure or this is your first time, get the 1.5 and if u love it then purchase the larger size after you&#x27;ve ran out.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a miracle worker.  it was ok...cant complain.  It does the job but not much highlighting to it.</li>
            <li> I suspect this may be a knock off. The label was applied wonky. I have never purchased any makeup where the label was not applied straight.</li>
            <li> This setting powder is amazing. I have crepiness and fine lines under my eyes. When I set my concealer with this powder, nothing budges all day and it feels so smooth. It is very yellow though but looks fine if you have yellow undertones like I do. I just add a little color correcting powder on top for whitening and it&#x27;s perfect. A little goes a long way too which is great. I would definitely recommend trying this powder if you&#x27;re on the fence. you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> I doscovered this product while viewing a makeup blog, and I had to try it for myself. This powder has numerous uses, but I love the finished look that it gives my makeup. Much better than the white finishing powder by MAC or Makeup 4 Forever Hd powder. Also, a little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I love this Ben nye setting powder!!!!  I arrived w very fast  I was expecting it no to but it came and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !!! When I&#x27;m going out I use this. But not for an everyday look. I&#x27;m one of those people that don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> Perfect and exactly what I wanted. Great to set my highlights! Sometimes I use it without concealer and it still gets the job done. Great Product. Great shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try this product and am very please. It works really well setting your under eye highlight</li>
            <li> Excellent product for oil control.</li>
            <li> Nice powder.  I use it to blend my makeup.  Gives a nice finished look.</li>
            <li> Loveeee it . Adds finishing touches to my makeup !</li>
            <li> Its a great finishing powder but it can be very messy. I advise when putting on face don&#x27;t have on outerwear, have a robe on</li>
            <li> If you are pale or light skin this would definitely not work for highlighting your under eye area , actually it would look make yor under eye bags look even worst&lt;br /&gt;this is meant to use on medium to dark or dark skin people&lt;br /&gt;instead try the Ben nye white powder or the light pink one those are really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark-skinned female and I must say I wasn&#x27;t really sure how this powder would show on me. I was told that it would come out ashy like but I loved it...It made my pictures look freakin awesome!!!! I think I may try the other color too :)</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product.  Saw it on Pinterest and wanted to try it.  Brightens under the eyes and hides circles leaving you looking flawless.</li>
            <li> I got this excited to use it because I&#x27;m trying to get into make up and use it more and get better. But I really don&#x27;t know what to do with it doesn&#x27;t do much for me. So it was kind of a impulse buy and it&#x27;s not really easy to use maybe I will use it one day.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily with a mix of my Mac Mineral powder and love the finish look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat fair-skinned, and this is my FAVORITE translucent powder...it&#x27;s incredibly fine and goes on almost invisibly, but does a great job of setting my make-up. I switched to it from a heavier, more opaque powder and it certainly took some getting used to...I imagine this is why some reviewers didn&#x27;t like it, but if you&#x27;re buying a translucent powder, you have to understand it&#x27;s purpose is merely to set your foundation/concealer, NOT to provide a lot of additional coverage, which this powder does beautifully. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> yello but nice texture</li>
            <li> Impossible to open container and it&#x27;s a really small size!</li>
            <li> This is not as transparent as I thought it would be, it&#x27;s opaque and looks very beige on. I go for the light or ivory toned powders and this one is just too dark. The creamy bright tinted transparent tone I thought this would offer is not even close to the reality. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> hey guys i have a idea. They make a pink ben nye powder that is for fair to light skined people this is an amazing product and so is the pink one</li>
            <li> This product is amazing......works better than rice powder......but non the less it works well with foundation and gives full coverage</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while! You don&#x27;t need a lot, it really sets your makeup, and you don&#x27;t look ghostly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing. It sets your concealer to a flawless finish no matter what your complexion. I am a chocolate toned sista and this world perfectly :).</li>
            <li> Will help in highlighting different portions of the face. Power is very light in color and in texture but blends very well on my caramel skin! Nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife but this item was not that excellent quality but it still good product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic! Excellent product for highlighting. Looks absolutely fab on olive colored or Indian skin.</li>
            <li> Love this powder.  I purchased a powder by Makeup Forever and what I saw when I took pictures was not good.  This banana powder takes on the shade of the person wearing it and really does highlight well.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking powder. I have oily combo skin and it does not leave me looking cakey in areas or too dry in others. I use it to set my under eye concealer and for a non shimmery highlight in my brow and forehead.  It just adds a hint of glow which compliments a variety of complexions. I do have to say that the container is NOT the best. It&#x27;s like a salt and pepper shaker at the top and you have to either transfer the powder to another container or shake it into the cap. Super annoying. However it&#x27;s inexpensive so the little you might waste is ok I guess. Also, I have very sensitive skin and it does not cause any irritation. I would recommend buying again, but would like to see a mire user friendly container such as the larger size Ben nye powders.</li>
            <li> It did meet my expectation..i received it right on time.will definitely buy it again ANd RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> Nice matte powder, but I don&#x27;t see a difference between this product and others that I have used.</li>
            <li> This Ben Nye Banana powder is raved about on most makeup tutorials and magazines.  As someone who loves makeup and has used many brands...I am not impressed.  With the price and the description I was hoping for a sheer powder.  I am aware this has some color in it but was hoping that color would not be the color that would appear on my face...and it was.  This product may work for someone with an olive complexion but it did not work for me!</li>
            <li> I was not sure about the product. A little worried being it is stage make up. I do love it though. Fast shipping and a little bit goes a long way. Will be ordering other products from them.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item from Amazon because I buy EVERY thing from Amazon. Received and realized it may not be the appropriate powder. It&#x27;s TOO translucent. I&#x27;ve used this powder before and no EXACTLy how to apply and blend and this isn&#x27;t the real item!!! They did get 2 stars because the ire was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Bummer. I&#x27;m obsessed with make up and thought this would be the holy grail of highlighting lol I should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews. It&#x27;s VERY dry, matte and sinks into every minuscule crease :(</li>
            <li> Great product for highlighting</li>
            <li> nothing spectacular about this product</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a lighter yellow.  It is more of a mustard color.  I think it is too dark for setting my under eye which is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love the product so much but I bought the exact same product in a bigger bottle at different place for the same price.</li>
            <li> Great for contouring. Gives a kissed glow on a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Great product. I only have to use a small amount. This is my favorite highlighter thus far!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I use it to set my makeup. It&#x27;s lightweight and last all day. Prevents my makeup from creasing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t heard about this sooner. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> AMAZING...I ONLY USE THIS FOR HIGHLIGHTING</li>
            <li> normally I have trouble with creasing of my concealer under my eyes, with this I don&#x27;t have that issue. I have gone a full 8hr work shift with little to no creasing and I don&#x27;t get that crazy halo look in photos like when the concealer is too light for the skin tone. the only issue I have is the cost of the product for the amount that you get....but I guess when you think about it, loreal face powder is about $10 and you only get .33oz of a pressed powder....I guess its ok. it will definitely last a while since I only apply concealer and powder to my under eyes and no foundation or anything to my face</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ITS FAKE. The item I got doesnt even match what&#x27;s shown in the picture!! AND it doesn&#x27;t even have that yellow tint to it like shown in the picture. Wish I could give this 0 stars but it did arrive super fast..</li>
            <li> Looks like cake flour on my skin.</li>
            <li> When this came in the mail, I instantly used it over my under eye concealer. This powder instantly brightened my under eye area and evened out my skin color. You couldn&#x27;t see my dark under eye area anymore and I couldn&#x27;t see the bags and fine lines either.&lt;br /&gt;I recently used this as a setting powder for all over my face. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stunned how my make-up stays. Ladies, wear white collard top and you&#x27;d be surprised that your make-up won&#x27;t drip and smudge on it--you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very dry and it doesn&#x27;t have a good coverage,,waste of money!</li>
            <li> Love this powder. I originally bought this in cameo, I read more about it and it said the banana powder is more for olive skin tone so decided to try this one as well since I&#x27;m more olive tone. It looked a little yellow on me it may just not be the best fit for my complexion or I put to much on but I go back and forth with cameo and banana. This product gives off such a clean perfect face and my skin feels so soft with this on as well. The bottle does look small but it has plenty of powder in there and it&#x27;ll last for a good amount of time. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Ben Nye Banana Powder is Excellent...perfectly fine milled., a little goes a long way. Just be carful when opening container, powder spills out easily at the beginning.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found an amazing loose powder that looks great and does some serious oil sheen coverage. I will use this product for years to come. Don&#x27;t let the color fool you. I have a pinkish olive skin tone and this color blends in just fine.</li>
            <li> Love the powder!!! It&#x27;s a god send. Arrive way before it was expected to.  Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> My skin color is a pecan brown. I have this Banana powder, it&#x27;s great.  I use this product as highlighter underneath my eyes to brighten them. I also, use it as a eyeshadow base coat,face powder w/or out foundation (only needs a little). I&#x27;ve also purchased the Ben NYe Luxury powders in:Chestnut,Banana and Sienna all works great. The banana looks light (has more of a yellow tone) for darker women of color but it&#x27;s not, just use a little.  I bought my powders from another vendor but wanted to share my reviews here.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but this is way too much money. I can get the 3oz bottle for 13.99. i was really shocked when i found it to be so much on here. but non the less the product is great i really like how it leaves my skin with saw a flawless look !</li>
            <li> This product had lived up to its reputation. I particularly love it to set my under eye concealer, primarily when I am going for that Kim K. look!</li>
            <li> I love this powder - It sets my concealer so it doesn&#x27;t crease and adds a little bit of brightness to my undereye area! I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t look right because my skin tone is fair, not dark like it seems most people use this color for, but it looks good and blends evenly!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Best finishing powder I have tried...(Including Makeup Forever.) I would definitely recommend it, and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like it but probably won&#x27;t buy it again - not the miracle worker it was shown to be in youtube tutorials.. or maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right</li>
            <li> I am used to using bare minerals, where there is a container that you can use for dipping your face brush in, so this is frustrating to use since its basically just a pour out container. For all the great reviews, this covers nothing, I can&#x27;t even tell that I put anything on. I keep trying to use it every once in a while and each time I&#x27;m just as disappointed as the last. My container is basically still full and I will continue using bare minerals instead.</li>
            <li> give a great glow to skin.  use it under your higlighter</li>
            <li> Im giving this a 4 becuz, although its a great powder, doesnt set my concealor under my eyes (only reason I bought the banana powder). The concealor still creases into my wrinkles. You could say that I dont put on enough powder, but after putting it on heavier, It was so bright under my eyes, I looked pretty ridiculous. Its a nice powder, but doesnt do the job 100% for me. Any tips would be great!</li>
            <li> So expensive for a tiny 1.5oz bottle! I almost don&#x27;t want to use it because it was so expensive. You can find the large bottle for $18 from other sellers..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write a review after I&#x27;ve stopped crying over the death of my wallet &amp; use the powder.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was exactly as described. Love it</li>
            <li> too pricey for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> Finish is so smooth, love it.</li>
            <li> bought this product maybe a year along or longer and still have plenty left! i use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have told all of my friends about it. Blends really well.</li>
            <li> Really nice powder that would be nice on any skin tone. Only gripe is that it&#x27;s expensive for the size, BUT a little goes a long way. Great for setting or highlighting.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product, it gives me a flawless finish when doing my make up..</li>
            <li> I love make up,  so when I heard about this banana power I had to have it. When I received it, you could tell it was obviously A fake. They couldn&#x27;t even get the package right. Don&#x27;t buy this s***!!!!!</li>
            <li> Appears to be knock off, it does not brighten or shine!</li>
            <li> I now will never live without this stuff! Excellent highlighter!</li>
            <li> Beautiful finish on all types of skin!!!</li>
            <li> This powder works good for brighten dark circles under your eyes.  I am caramel in completion and the color is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Banana powder works well, especially for those with a dark skin tone. (Try cameo if you&#x27;re light.) And for the amount of powder you get, where a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
