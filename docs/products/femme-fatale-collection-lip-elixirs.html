            <li>it&#x27;s delicious.</li>
            <li>scent is delicious.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Terrible as a lip balm, wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li>This flavor is awesome this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is also a great lip balm.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be quite moisturizing, and feels great while it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all a great buy.</li>
            <li>I also love clove cigarettes, I thought this would be a perfect match for me.</li>
            <li>The flavor wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be, and there&#x27;s no sting of cloves on the mouth which I find pleasant.</li>
            <li>In the process, I&#x27;ve damaged/dinged/chipped the tin irreparably, so it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>The balm itself smells really good and spicy and leaves my lips feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of clove flavor, generous size tin, and just the right consistency/coverage.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Very pleasant scent to have right under your nose, while the scent lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) I loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, but the product is petrolatum-based, and had I known that, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.</li>
            <li>but I gave it away to a craft artist who liked the tin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice lip balm.</li>
            <li>The tin is a nice size (approx.</li>
            <li>lip balm that feels nice and works to moisturize.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really good balm, smooth and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>If you like clove, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>This provides most of the flavor without the lung damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lip gloss junkie, I love chapsticks, lip glosses, lip balms, anything.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, but once I put it on my lips</li>
            <li>My favorite of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you love or miss clove cigarettes and want to recapture a bit of that, this works.</li>
            <li>bought the item from a third-party seller on Amazon and they provided excellent customer service when I told them the product was essentially unusable.</li>
            <li>The absinthe scent is a bit more doable for me.  </li>
            <li>...thought it would be a bit smoker but seemed to be more like liquorice or something else</li>
            <li>texture is a bit sticky in the jar, but smooths out better once on my lips.</li>
            <li>enjoy tokyo milk!</li>
            <li>Great shipping that was fast and on time.</li>
            <li>I love the strong clove scent &amp; flavor (so does my husband), which leaves my lips feeling all tingly.</li>
            <li>The smells and packaging is unique and more towards our preferences.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong or sweet, like a kids flavored gloss would be, but rather very smooth and sensual.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>I have NO allergies at all, but the scents are so strong that I can&#x27;t have some of them on the lips.  </li>
            <li>The smell is awesome, dark and sultry.</li>
            <li>I wish these were solid perfumes instead of balms…they would be a much more successful product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I guess it is supposed to sound exotic &amp; sexy; it certainly tastes sensual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yummy Yummy smell and applies sooo smoothly...</li>
            <li>The primary ingredient is some sort of wax and it feels like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Dark Salted Caramel - Mildly sweet, a bit warm, pleasant, does smell caramel-y.</li>
            <li>I got this based on the positive reviews and the scent (I love clove cigarettes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clove cigarette scent is wonderful: complex, rich, and spicy.</li>
            <li>The tin is large and cute, and there is a lot of product in it.</li>
            <li>I loved clove cigarettes when I was younger.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and tasty and your friends will want to share...</li>
            <li>The product itself has a nice scent and makes your lips feel soft.</li>
            <li>I would say the Clove Cigarette smells true to name.</li>
            <li>The Cherry Bourbon smells like sickly sweet cherries (which I adore).</li>
            <li>Quick as a Flash</li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.  </li>
            <li>I hoped to love this product, but it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t sink in like most good lip balms do.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly like clove cigarettes</li>
            <li>a pretty tin,</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t get your nails under the top of the tin, you cannot open this product.  </li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this</li>
            <li>The packaging is really pretty, but impractical.</li>
            <li>Softens them right up and leaves a really long lasting nice smell!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does taste exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love Tokyo Milk&#x27;s perfume; I have a few different fragrances in the collection, and have been just thrilled with their quality.</li>
            <li>easy to use and open.</li>
            <li>Some of them are simply tooooo strongly scented to put on the lips.  </li>
            <li>The balm does moisturize nicely without leaving a greasy mess on the lips.  </li>
            <li>I am quite picky about lip balms; this product is expensive, but very good quality.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t smell anything, I didn&#x27;t really get the clove part of it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with this unless you really like a spicy clove scent.</li>
            <li>The clove cigarette in particular is too much for me.  </li>
            <li>Warm smell of spicy clove cigarettes, very little smoke scent.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite scent of all of the tokiomilk dark lip balms</li>
            <li>My sister and I love tokyomilk and tokyomilk dark.  </li>
            <li>would say the scent is like sweet vanilla blended with clove, and it actually comes out smelling like a spiced chai tea!</li>
            <li>like most other Tokyo Milk products so I was surprised at how much I didn&#x27;t care for this.</li>
            <li>My sister in particular is allergic to many things, and these balms have a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of hard to spread out on your lips.</li>
            <li>I went easy with the application, not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li>There are almost 20 grams which is quite large for a daily balm.</li>
            <li>I even left the tin open on a high shelf near my ceiling fan for a few days, hoping some of the odor would become milder and more bearable.</li>
            <li>but it does smell pretty much like clove gum, if a bit stronger and more artificial.</li>
            <li>I love the look of the packaging but the tin is SO HARD to get open.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t last long because the lip balm part dries up so fast.  </li>
            <li>in all, I like the product, and would be interested in trying other flavors!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a major issue: I can&#x27;t get the tin open.</li>
            <li>in all, I think in the future I&#x27;m abandoning the Dark Collection and sticking with Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Bon Bon line of lip balms, which have very different ingredient lists, texture, and smell ever so much nicer, even if the container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The line is made up of deep, musky scents, more complex than your average perfume.  </li>

            <li> The line is made up of deep, musky scents, more complex than your average perfume.  </li>
            <li> It feels exactly the same on the skin (which is to say, thick and rather greasy) and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I mixed a little with Lip Service by Lush, and I smelled like a Christmas pomander!</li>
            <li> The cherry bourbon is the least unusual, and therefore the easiest for me to wear.  </li>
            <li> for carrying in pocket or purse, &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you do care about the scent, well, I&#x27;ve found the Dark Collection to be a very mixed bag.</li>
            <li> the taste reminds me of Darjarum black cigarettes and mexican coffee with a hint of cinnamon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as I would have thought, stays on about as long as other petrolatum products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For those of you not familiar with the Tokyo Milk Dark Collection products, this is essentially a petroleum jelly-based with various other oils and extracts thrown into the mix.</li>
            <li> there is absolutely NO cigarette/cigar scent or flavor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend sticking with plain Vaseline or the generic equivalent.</li>
            <li> Other than that I can&#x27;t recommend it for anything you wouldn&#x27;t just use Vaseline to do.</li>
            <li> Dark Smoked Salt - This just smells VILE.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why it is called Dark Clove \\&quot;cigarette\\&quot;--</li>
            <li> It does moisturize ok, just hate the petroleum jelly texture.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t mess that up,</li>
            <li> But if you lick your lips a little you get a taste of it</li>
            <li> (Vitamin E) acetate, stevia rebaudiana (Stevia) leaf extract, organic camellia sinensis (Green Tea) leaf extract, carthamus tinctorius (safflower)</li>
            <li> It smells very faintly of tiger balm, tastes like pure petroleum jelly, and is greasy without moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I wish you could smell it more when it was on your lips or that the consistency wasn&#x27;t so awful.</li>
            <li> The tin is generously sized, although it can be difficult to open until you get the hang of it--pressure applied to the sides to pop the lid off</li>
            <li> this product was past shelf date</li>
            <li> tin from a small boutique.</li>
            <li> This tin specifically is almost impossible to get open half the time.</li>
            <li> The container is generous too, I have hardly made a dent in mine.</li>
            <li> Our only complaint is that we HATE balms in tins.</li>
            <li> The lip balm itself is worse than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> I hate the petroleum jelly texture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>

            <li> My husband used to smoke clove cigarettes and was heartbroken when they stopped being sold in the US. So of course when I seen this lip elixir from Tokyo Milk called Clove Cigarette, I just had to buy it! This stuff really does taste exactly as described. If you like clove, you&#x27;ll love this. We both use this stuff regularly. Our only complaint is that we HATE balms in tins. This tin specifically is almost impossible to get open half the time. Hopefully Tokyo Milk will start offering these elixirs in tubes as well!</li>
            <li> I loved clove cigarettes when I was younger. I quit smoking, but I missed the flavor. This provides most of the flavor without the lung damage. It is also a great lip balm. I only wish the flavor/ scent was stronger. I received it very quickly from the seller. I mixed a little with Lip Service by Lush, and I smelled like a Christmas pomander! :) I loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip gloss junkie, I love chapsticks, lip glosses, lip balms, anything. I also love clove cigarettes, I thought this would be a perfect match for me. I bought it off beautybar.com, the .70 oz tin was $7. I love the smell of it, but once I put it on my lips I didn&#x27;t smell anything, I didn&#x27;t really get the clove part of it. But if you lick your lips a little you get a taste of it and it&#x27;s exactly like clove cigarettes it&#x27;s delicious. I wish you could smell it more when it was on your lips or that the consistency wasn&#x27;t so awful. I hate the petroleum jelly texture, it&#x27;s kind of hard to spread out on your lips. It does moisturize ok, just hate the petroleum jelly texture. If Toyko milk could get this scent with CO Bigelow&#x27;s mentha lip shine format it&#x27;d be sheer heaven.</li>
            <li> For those of you not familiar with the Tokyo Milk Dark Collection products, this is essentially a petroleum jelly-based with various other oils and extracts thrown into the mix. The tin is generously sized, although it can be difficult to open until you get the hang of it--pressure applied to the sides to pop the lid off should do the trick. It does not screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about the scent, this will be overpriced for you and I&#x27;d recommend sticking with plain Vaseline or the generic equivalent. It feels exactly the same on the skin (which is to say, thick and rather greasy) and works just as well. If you do care about the scent, well, I&#x27;ve found the Dark Collection to be a very mixed bag. I&#x27;ve bought and tried three so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Salted Caramel - Mildly sweet, a bit warm, pleasant, does smell caramel-y. My favorite of the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;- Clove Cigarette - I&#x27;ve never had a clove cigarette but it does smell pretty much like clove gum, if a bit stronger and more artificial. Took some getting used to, but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed now and don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Smoked Salt - This just smells VILE. It&#x27;s awful. I even left the tin open on a high shelf near my ceiling fan for a few days, hoping some of the odor would become milder and more bearable. I still can&#x27;t stand it. This one&#x27;s going in the garbage. I can&#x27;t even stand to keep it around to use on my heels, it smells so repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think in the future I&#x27;m abandoning the Dark Collection and sticking with Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Bon Bon line of lip balms, which have very different ingredient lists, texture, and smell ever so much nicer, even if the container is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list: petrolatum, microcrystalline wax, flavor, canola oil and aloe barbadensis (Aloe vera) leaf extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), tocopheryl (Vitamin E) acetate, stevia rebaudiana (Stevia) leaf extract, organic camellia sinensis (Green Tea) leaf extract, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil and jasmine officinale (Jasmine) flower extract, monarda didyma (Bee Balm) leaf extract.</li>
            <li> all the candy-flavored lips of smoking a clove cigarette without the hacking cough! a pretty tin, but i wish it came in a stick or tube... i don&#x27;t always want to touch my finger to my lips.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but the product is petrolatum-based, and had I known that, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it. Basically, scented vaseline.</li>
            <li> I hoped to love this product, but it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. It smells very faintly of tiger balm, tastes like pure petroleum jelly, and is greasy without moisturizing. I&#x27;m using it on my elbows and heels, and my boyfriend puts it in his mustache. Other than that I can&#x27;t recommend it for anything you wouldn&#x27;t just use Vaseline to do.</li>
            <li> Quick as a Flash Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent communication from the Seller.&lt;br /&gt;Product just as described!&lt;br /&gt;Yummy Yummy smell and applies sooo smoothly...&lt;br /&gt;Love this-&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase from this Seller again!</li>
            <li> grab this when you&#x27;re craving a clove cigarette...it&#x27;s sweet and tasty and your friends will want to share...this is my favorite scent of all of the tokiomilk dark lip balms</li>
            <li> The flavor wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be, and there&#x27;s no sting of cloves on the mouth which I find pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product. The scent is underwhelming and the taste is non-existant and the product itself is sticky/tacky and actually left a film on my lips so it didn&#x27;t penetrate topically and moisturize. I went easy with the application, not too much and not too little. I don&#x27;t know if it is the climate in the northwest or this product was past shelf date but I gave it away to a craft artist who liked the tin.&lt;br /&gt;I like most other Tokyo Milk products so I was surprised at how much I didn&#x27;t care for this.</li>
            <li> If you love or miss clove cigarettes and want to recapture a bit of that, this works. It&#x27;s also really good balm, smooth and silky feeling. The container is generous too, I have hardly made a dent in mine. It does not smell quite the same, I guess because there is no tobacco. But it&#x27;s close!</li>
            <li> I love Tokyo Milk&#x27;s perfume; I have a few different fragrances in the collection, and have been just thrilled with their quality. When I saw TM made lip balms, too, I jumped at the chance to buy one. What a disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a major issue: I can&#x27;t get the tin open. I&#x27;ve tried prying (with a knife blade, screw driver, my fingernails, everything!) to separate the lid from the bottom. In the process, I&#x27;ve damaged/dinged/chipped the tin irreparably, so it&#x27;s a good thing it&#x27;s not a gift. Ten dollars is a lot of money for a tin of lip balm I can&#x27;t open to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clove cigarette scent is wonderful: complex, rich, and spicy. It&#x27;s a five-star scent.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the item from a third-party seller on Amazon and they provided excellent customer service when I told them the product was essentially unusable.</li>
            <li> My sister and I love tokyomilk and tokyomilk dark.  The smells and packaging is unique and more towards our preferences.  The line is made up of deep, musky scents, more complex than your average perfume.  We bought three of these lip balms in various scents.  Some of them are simply tooooo strongly scented to put on the lips.  My sister in particular is allergic to many things, and these balms have a heavy scent.  I have NO allergies at all, but the scents are so strong that I can&#x27;t have some of them on the lips.  The clove cigarette in particular is too much for me.  The scents are not a play on the idea of a clove cigarette, it IS the smell of a clove cigarette.  The absinthe scent is a bit more doable for me.  The cherry bourbon is the least unusual, and therefore the easiest for me to wear.  I love the look of the packaging but the tin is SO HARD to get open.  If you can&#x27;t get your nails under the top of the tin, you cannot open this product.  The balm does moisturize nicely without leaving a greasy mess on the lips.  I wish these were solid perfumes instead of balms…they would be a much more successful product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT LID DOES NOT STAY ON !!  LOOKS LIKE IT WAS USED !!!</li>
            <li> I put this on before I go to sleep and my lips feel like pillowy clouds of yumminess when I wake up. Also, the smell is so intoxicating... I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> Nice lip balm. I had higher hopes for this...thought it would be a bit smoker but seemed to be more like liquorice or something else</li>
            <li> Almost destroyed the tin trying to get it open. The packaging is really pretty, but impractical. The product itself has a nice scent and makes your lips feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am quite picky about lip balms; this product is expensive, but very good quality. I love the strong clove scent &amp; flavor (so does my husband), which leaves my lips feeling all tingly. The tin is a nice size (approx. 2\\&quot;+/-) for carrying in pocket or purse, &amp; lasts a long time. I have no idea why it is called Dark Clove \\&quot;cigarette\\&quot;-- No worries for tobacco haters... there is absolutely NO cigarette/cigar scent or flavor. I guess it is supposed to sound exotic &amp; sexy; it certainly tastes sensual.</li>
            <li> Like this alot. There&#x27;s no color to it, but it does soften the lips. The smell is awesome, dark and sultry. I like using it on my cuticles too. Softens them right up and leaves a really long lasting nice smell!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Perfect amount of clove flavor, generous size tin, and just the right consistency/coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the scent alone.  I figured the ingredients would be sufficient as a lip balm.  Can&#x27;t mess that up, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is delicious.  Warm smell of spicy clove cigarettes, very little smoke scent.  The lip balm itself is worse than Vaseline.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.  The primary ingredient is some sort of wax and it feels like it.  It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t sink in like most good lip balms do.  I&#x27;ve actually had it flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible as a lip balm, wonderful scent.  I wish this was a perfume instead of a lip balm - if the scent lasted longer, which it doesn&#x27;t.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t last long because the lip balm part dries up so fast.  Don&#x27;t bother with this unless you really like a spicy clove scent.</li>
            <li> easy to use and open. the taste reminds me of Darjarum black cigarettes and mexican coffee with a hint of cinnamon</li>
            <li> The tin is large and cute, and there is a lot of product in it. The balm itself smells really good and spicy and leaves my lips feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I got this based on the positive reviews and the scent (I love clove cigarettes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the scent is like sweet vanilla blended with clove, and it actually comes out smelling like a spiced chai tea! It&#x27;s not too strong or sweet, like a kids flavored gloss would be, but rather very smooth and sensual. Very pleasant scent to have right under your nose, while the scent lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a bit sticky in the jar, but smooths out better once on my lips. It&#x27;s not as long-lasting as I would have thought, stays on about as long as other petrolatum products I&#x27;ve tried. It does seem to be quite moisturizing, and feels great while it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the product, and would be interested in trying other flavors!</li>
            <li> This flavor is awesome this product is awesome. lip balm that feels nice and works to moisturize. enjoy tokyo milk!</li>
            <li> I purchased the &amp;#34;Clove Cigarette&amp;#34; tin from this seller and years ago purchased the &amp;#34;Cherry Bourbon&amp;#34; tin from a small boutique. I would say the Clove Cigarette smells true to name. The Cherry Bourbon smells like sickly sweet cherries (which I adore). Both have the petroleum jelly consistency. So it is as moisturizing as one would expect from such. There are almost 20 grams which is quite large for a daily balm. I would assume you could use such a size as this as a multipurpose salve of sorts. Great shipping that was fast and on time. All in all a great buy.</li>
