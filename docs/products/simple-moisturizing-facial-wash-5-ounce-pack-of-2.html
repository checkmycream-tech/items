    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best face wash I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Shop online to find the best prices.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the best way to start is with the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>o&#x27; delicious cream.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Is it the best thing ever?</li>
            <li>This product is impressive.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, thank you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price point too!</li>
            <li>Even the one cleanser I&#x27;ve found that is alright for my skin isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>The scrub works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I dare say that I experienced miraculous results using the Olay products.  </li>
            <li>My son says they work great</li>
            <li>and he uses them all the time, Every time he takes a shower he uses them and says they are great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to alter a cleansing regiment that had been proven successful.  </li>
            <li>He is a good cleanser</li>
            <li>It has a good feel when I used it to wash my face.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s the good part.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price is good.</li>
            <li>I was eager to try this product because I had heard/read good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s tourmeline charged cleanser and (rather sticky) moisturizer -- which has greatly improved my skin&#x27;s appearance, but I&#x27;m not so in love that I don&#x27;t continue to search for something easier on the wallet.  </li>
            <li>No, but I&#x27;m happy with it and probably most people would be too.</li>
            <li>It lathers nice and smells good.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me surprisingly was the smell.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this wash!</li>
            <li>You should barely be touching your face!)  </li>
            <li>I do like that the list is shorter than many others, and while I wish that I was able to use those plentiful \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; skincare washes and lotions, I am just happy to find another option that is fairly inexpensive and does what it says.</li>
            <li>Fortunately this great product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I liked this wash.</li>
            <li>I found it a nice change.</li>
            <li>He has his own skin care line now, which I&#x27;ve never tried.</li>
            <li>And I liked that about it.  </li>
            <li>I liked how it lathered with my clairisonic face brush and removed all traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes our bodies become immune to them and they no longer work as effectively.  </li>
            <li>Use this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and all but at the end of the day...</li>
            <li>I found this cleanser to be quite nice.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was something else, as I&#x27;ve never reacted like this to a face wash that didn&#x27;t have some kind of acne medication added to it.  </li>
            <li>and the wife liked it</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth, very, very, light pleasant fragrance (almost undetectable), not oily or greasy, not drying.  </li>
            <li>Light, feels good when washing and</li>
            <li>I definitely liked them better than the face wash.</li>
            <li>Honestly though, that is ok because I use a moisturizer anyway</li>
            <li>Take it easy!  </li>
            <li>That I can forgive however, if I get a good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>And this worked much better than what I was using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many over the counter products without improvement.</li>
            <li>I use Dan&#x27;s Regimen as a guide on how to treat my skin and use most of his recommendations.  </li>
            <li>I love this scrub and found in when I tried the Derma trial size skin care set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as you&#x27;ve guessed I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as you&#x27;ve guessed I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>We ordered more after this one ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My complexion is best described as oily, especially my forehead.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are too many to list here; however, many of them are also used in the Olay Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It does not have an overwhelming flowery fragrance that some people might find offensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li>My skin looks lovely.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a bit more moisturizing in my face wash, though.  </li>
            <li>The product worked OK.</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;Okay,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>So in the end, I would say this is OK</li>
            <li>but there are better products i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>so we got some more.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause pimples, but it sure as heck did nothing to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>I cannot even use this more than once a day</li>
            <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;Please check out the site and learn more about what we are putting on our bodies not just in them.</li>
            <li>Put seems to work well and leave a nice clean feeling without over drying</li>
            <li>Love this stuff light weight no smell and it does not make you break out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to do this and a nickel sized drop is plenty to work up a good amount for your face.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this particularly moisturizing nor pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 and all my life had oily skin which could break out and get clogged pores easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild, without that \\&quot;no</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it at first.</li>
            <li>It is good to try a new product.  </li>
            <li>Once a day works for me, but if need be, twice a day would be just as fine</li>
            <li>While washing my face it felt fine.</li>
            <li>However, Simple is great.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser does has a light scent; even though it says \\&quot;NO</li>
            <li>but I am happy with this product to supplement my use with my regular routine I have using an exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It felt light and smooth.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is definitely more economical.  </li>
            <li>I rarely wear moisturizer because I&#x27;ve never been able to find something calming, hypo-allergenic and non clogging to help me.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Well, so far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother, more vibrant and more toned.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; am always looking for a good face wash that will not strip my skin, break me out but will still make it feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me strongly of the luxury Exuvia cleansing cream, but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I gave it one more chance, just thinking maybe I might have had shampoo or something on my hands the first wash.</li>
            <li>It is ok for the price, but there are others in the price range for sensitive skin which have better results.</li>
            <li>It washes well and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, but it feels clean.</li>
            <li>recommend finding a face wash that is made with mostly oils and definitely AVOID sulfate of any kind.</li>
            <li>My skin has felt great all day, and there are no signs of dry, flaky patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just clean.  </li>
            <li>This face wash doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin and leaves it squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this wash can clean off cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Something with the word &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; has to be good for my sensitive face, right?</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice any other spectacular or amazing effects..</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is nothing special about it though.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this facial wash because of its moisturizing effect and it does a good job leaving the skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>After a few months of continual usage, my skin became remarkably healthier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>and I had a bright red rash all over my face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well so that I know it&#x27;s working because it&#x27;s more of a gel form than a liquid cleanser.</li>
            <li>Simple&#x27;s claims sounded good</li>
            <li>Then, in my early thirties &amp; 2 kids of my own, I was still breaking out</li>
            <li>/&gt;i hope this was a help full review</li>
            <li>So far, so good, am really liking how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to start looking for a better alternative in hopes of finally having happy skin.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I decided to try the Simple Wash.  If I experienced difficulties, I would gladly run back to the Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>But since my husband was also using it and had initially said he liked it</li>
            <li>I know things with sulfates are drying, so I only use 1/2 pea-sized amount and make sure I rub it into a light lather before washing just around the oiler T-zone...</li>
            <li>and I have not found anything better yet for cleansing my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But quickly after it was washed off my skin felt hot, my face flushed</li>
            <li>While the eyes are part of the face, it&#x27;s a special part that is super sensitive, which is why there are special products just for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will foam if you use the right amount of water (which is why it might make sense to use it in the shower).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much product to get a good lather, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I picked this up, since it was labeled MOISURIZING and it only contains &amp;#34;skin loving ingredients.&amp;#34; I LOVE this facial wash.</li>
            <li>Used with my Clarisonic, it provided a great clean without irritating my face at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But overall, I recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>For the scrub I use Walmart or Target versions which are similar to St. Ives apricot scrub, but, I think, more aggrerssive.  </li>
            <li>Afterward, my skin feels soft, smooth and well hydrated.  </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]) which taught me the importance of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely be looking for this product on the market.</li>
            <li>; Sure enough, I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t  used a lot of facial moisturizers, but enjoyed the after effects.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my face without feeling harsh or leaving my skin feeling slimy.</li>
            <li>This Facial Wash was fine, but since I don&#x27;t have a lot I could compare it to, I really didn&#x27;t see anything special about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 year old female with fair, pretty normal skin.</li>
            <li>and you wouldn&#x27;t even use THAT much more, since - again - little bit goes far! :)</li>
            <li>Start with a gentle oil free eye make up remover for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would be willing to use it again.  </li>
            <li>All in all its a great balance between clean and not overly dry and tight</li>
            <li>Compared to those, I found this Simple face wash better, softer, less detergent-y, and with a mild pleasant natural-y smell (that as far as I can tell does not stick with you after you complete the face washing).</li>
            <li>Overall the facial wash felt nice, and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Keeping my face free of acne was a daily struggle until I received the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I preface this review by pointing out that I am not an expert on advanced facial cleaning products and most of the time I use mass-market national brands (or store-brand clones) found at various drugstores (Clearasil, Nivea, Gillette, etc).</li>
            <li>Thanks, Simple, for lovely new skin!</li>
            <li>&quot;, I don&#x27;t have to moisturize and, for a refreshing change, my skin doesn&#x27;t have some dry spots and some greasy spots; however, it doesn&#x27;t quite remove every bit of makeup.</li>
            <li>So I suppose if I want to use this product more, I&#x27;ll have to decide if I&#x27;d rather have dry skin and no acne, or hydrated skin and acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012o I suppose if I want to use this product more, I&#x27;ll have to decide if I&#x27;d rather have dry skin and no acne, or hydrated skin and acne.  </li>
            <li>Pimples hurt, physically, emotionally and financially; research has shown that if two applicants of equal qualification interview for the same job, the more attractive one will get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face has certainly cleared up a lot since I switched.</li>
            <li>Despite this winter&#x27;s strange up-and-down temperatures in Chesapeake, VA, my complexion, thanks to the Simple Wash, is looking quite good.  </li>
            <li>Despite this winter&#x27;s strange up-and-down temperatures in Chesapeake, VA, my complexion, thanks to the Simple Wash, is looking quite good.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, big enough for the whole face and neck, and nice for those times you need to clean up in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It could be that I should use some sort of cleansing cloth with this product to more or less scrub the makeup off, but then there&#x27;s dealing with fresh towels and cleaning them or otherwise using some disposable cloth, and then that sort of defeats the purpose of choosing this product over a cleansing cloth.  </li>
            <li>The face wash initially seemed good, as it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (no artificial perfumes), and I guess I expected it to not have much of a smell.</li>
            <li>In short, I disliked it greatly.  </li>
            <li>mostly I love that I can&#x27;t feel a drag on my face after I use it.</li>
            <li>REALLY enjoy this and feel it is one of the better/best facial washes I have tried and that WORKS!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0029Z9L7C Simple Hydrating Light Moisturiser]]  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not marketed to exfoliate, it seems to take care of the flakiness too...very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Basically, the Simple Wash is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>my face will develop a very irritated itchy rash.</li>
            <li>OOOOH really?</li>
            <li>so finding a product that cleanses without over drying and causing redness is a real challenge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>I like Simple Kind To Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash.  </li>
            <li>I then use Simple kind Facial Wash</li>
            <li>A product that is highly popular in England, the Simple Wash has just recently been introduced into the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is quite good and delicate.</li>
            <li>I loved the creamy gel feeling of the product, and didn&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t lather up into big bubbles because it spread easily on wet skin and then washed off without a ton of splashing.</li>
            <li>If you like more of a harsh, sandy exfoliating scrub, this isn&#x27;t the right cleanser for you.</li>
            <li>During the first week, I didn&#x27;t seem to notice much of a difference, but then at the end of the second week, someone commented about how soft and smooth my face &amp; completion were.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this will work better for people with other types of skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this will work better for people with other types of skin.  </li>
            <li>So, I was excited to try this Simple brand.  </li>
            <li>commented by the other reviewer, this is also not the most \\&quot;simple\\&quot; product, in case</li>
            <li>360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot Beads, 6-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>This did not have the same problem - it just felt clean.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling clean, moist, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>but first of all not using it on our sensitive</li>
            <li>It has a light flowery kind of scent (at least to me) and creates a thinner white foam when lathered.  </li>
            <li>I could feel a difference after the first time I used it in how soft and hydrated my skin felt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a fan of natural or organic products, but I&#x27;m not above using regular products if they work well or have some kind of benefit to them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews and seems to be a hit or miss situation regarding whether this product will have a good or bad effect on your skin.</li>
            <li>After using this product for about two weeks, I noticed my skin felt smooth and didn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give the face wash a bit more time, but after 2 weeks of using it only once a day, my skin feels scaly, almost as though it was burned, itchy &amp; is blotchy &amp; red.  </li>
            <li>One of the side effects of face washing is that you occasionally taste the cleaning products, and this has an unwelcome taste but it dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BEWARE of this product if you too have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d prefer something with a little more grit to it to help exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>I like to think of it as a little vacation for my skin. :-)</li>
            <li>I prefer something with a little more scrubbing power that leaves my skin feeling tingly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and my face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>(When I did get a pimple, it seemed to vanish sooner than normal.)  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers question the list of ingredients, but most facial washes have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients.</li>
            <li>This happens with most products that have too harsh of chemicals and they burn my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always up for a trying a new facial cleanser, especially ones that are supposed to be better for your sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I had been a loyal Clinique customer for many years but grew tired of paying department store prices.  </li>
            <li>i have normal but very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product has some not so nice ingredients in it that I&#x27;m not really a big fan of, but at the same token the list of ingredients isn&#x27;t as long as it could be, so that&#x27;s something.  </li>
            <li>But I figured since it was new to my skin I would give it a month before I tossed it.</li>
            <li>Buying white is worth the clear skin I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li>The others are typically 5% &amp; 10% and are too strong.  </li>
            <li>All in all I like this product, I do not have very sensitive skin and have not had any reaction.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which is prone to rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Having recently read an article about this chemical--and industrial degreaser used in many soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and other products for cleaning because it&#x27;s cheap--I think it&#x27;s probably part of the problem.</li>
            <li>It took 2 days for my white heads to disappear, and now, on my 4th day, I only have 3 of my original cysts.</li>
            <li>I used it first last night (about 24 hours ago), and have not had any signs of imminent cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>I tried this out for the first time earlier this year.</li>
            <li>I do use other cleansers particularly in the winter which do better at keeping my skin moisturized and minimizing the dry spots and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I realized that the rash came from using Simple, as this was the only thing that I had been using on my face that was new, I quickly stopped and threw it out.</li>
            <li>I like this facial wash because it is easy on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Since recently running out of my facial toner &amp; breaking out, I have begun my full treatment regimen again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells amazing - not too overpowering but not so weak you can&#x27;t pick up that light scent - and a LITTLE bit goes a LOOOOOOOOOOONG way.</li>
            <li>This product worked just as good, but not better than other products I tried.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my face felt soft and ready for me to apply my make up.</li>
            <li>and I am sitting here with almost clear skin thanks to a combination of products that are actually working!</li>
            <li>I got this moisturizer to try it out because my husband has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give quite as much moisturizing effect as I&#x27;d hoped, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>I have to pay extra close attention as to not squeeze out too much, for even just about a dime-size bit works wonders.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m cursed with frustratingly sensitive, reactive skin.</li>
            <li>I think it might be time to remove it completely from our home</li>
            <li>and it soothes my face and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I use a nickle size amount and apply it by gently smoothing it over my entire face.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I lather my face with the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B002UUT38I Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, 6 Ounce]])</li>

            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and used this product.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to anyone else who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They state there are \\&quot;no harsh irritants\\&quot; \\&quot;dyes\\&quot; \\&quot;perfumes\\</li>
            <li>It could be that my skin is sensitive to one of these ingredients.</li>
            <li>Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash left my skin soft and clean.  </li>

            <li>My face never gets dry, even in the extremely hot Texas summer.  </li>
            <li>For the first two weeks, my skin was slightly dry and taut.  </li>
            <li>For the first two weeks, my skin was slightly dry and taut.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not all make the cut; as is the case with [[ASIN:B005TI7LB4 Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is clean without feeling tight and I don&#x27;t have to put an icepack on my face after cleaning to calm down redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, the Simple Wash can be easily ordered through Amazon if not readily available in department stores.  </li>
            <li>I found with Simple that even though I forgot to moisturize again I had a softer face than normal.</li>
            <li>What I normally use is the Olay (or generic) cleansing cloth that is disposable, so that&#x27;s my source of comparison for this product.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using zinc oxide and cortisone cream on my face to get it back to normal, as well as switching to Neutrogena products which have worked wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most things cause my skin to look like I&#x27;ve gotten a very bad sunburn - it will itch, feel like it&#x27;s burning, and get bright red.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin; instead it leaves it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Obviously I have stopped using it, but am surprised that this is marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am still using the same facial wash that I started using 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t really tried any others.  </li>
            <li>However, as I wrote earlier, it is sometimes good to vary one&#x27;s beauty regiment because, like a workout regiment, it can grow stale.  </li>

            <li>The reason I&#x27;ve been such a Clinique fan was because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and have used Cetaphil for 10+yrs but recently felt it was too drying</li>
            <li>i bought this product after having success with other simple products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but have to deal with wearing lots of makeup everyday as a performer, so keeping my skin clean while not overdrying is a challenge, especially when I&#x27;ve been filling my pores with various powders and letting them absorb under the heat of the lights.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying this again as it seems to clean well and not be very harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>Before my face was clear I still used my foundation over my entire face.</li>
            <li>Especially for sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and obviously there is something in this product that I am allergic to.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use facial products, especially soaps, because I find them drying.  </li>
            <li>I quit using it for a week and switched back to a face wash I had used before, and my skin went back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product and it seemed ok but not great.</li>
            <li>There are only a few things I&#x27;m brand loyal to.</li>
            <li>Maybe its just my skin type, but in an overall experience, this one just didn&#x27;t work out for me in most ways, although it did help in a few other</li>
            <li>I also use it before attending a social event.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like it was really thick and not all that special.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say we&#x27;ve gone back to our old product and will not be using Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.</li>
            <li>Just because other face washes have similar ingredient lists doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It took a few days for my sensitive skin to adjust to a new product line, but now I am hooked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I feel like a high schooler on prom night, but not only do I have the zits, my skin also feels really dried out despite this being advertised as a \\&quot;moisturizing facial wash\\&quot; created by \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend Simple to anyone with dry skin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin that only occasionally breaks out.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Shop online to find the best prices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the best way to start is with the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> o&#x27; delicious cream.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Is it the best thing ever?</li>
            <li> This product is impressive.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price point too!</li>
            <li> Even the one cleanser I&#x27;ve found that is alright for my skin isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> The scrub works great for me.  </li>
            <li> I dare say that I experienced miraculous results using the Olay products.  </li>
            <li> My son says they work great</li>
            <li> and he uses them all the time, Every time he takes a shower he uses them and says they are great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to alter a cleansing regiment that had been proven successful.  </li>
            <li> He is a good cleanser</li>
            <li> It has a good feel when I used it to wash my face.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s the good part.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price is good.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this product because I had heard/read good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s tourmeline charged cleanser and (rather sticky) moisturizer -- which has greatly improved my skin&#x27;s appearance, but I&#x27;m not so in love that I don&#x27;t continue to search for something easier on the wallet.  </li>
            <li> No, but I&#x27;m happy with it and probably most people would be too.</li>
            <li> It lathers nice and smells good.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me surprisingly was the smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this wash!</li>
            <li> You should barely be touching your face!)  </li>
            <li> I do like that the list is shorter than many others, and while I wish that I was able to use those plentiful \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; skincare washes and lotions, I am just happy to find another option that is fairly inexpensive and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Fortunately this great product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I liked this wash.</li>
            <li> I found it a nice change.</li>
            <li> He has his own skin care line now, which I&#x27;ve never tried.</li>
            <li> And I liked that about it.  </li>
            <li> I liked how it lathered with my clairisonic face brush and removed all traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes our bodies become immune to them and they no longer work as effectively.  </li>
            <li> Use this product at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and all but at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser to be quite nice.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was something else, as I&#x27;ve never reacted like this to a face wash that didn&#x27;t have some kind of acne medication added to it.  </li>
            <li> and the wife liked it</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also quite nice.  </li>
            <li> Silky smooth, very, very, light pleasant fragrance (almost undetectable), not oily or greasy, not drying.  </li>
            <li> Light, feels good when washing and</li>
            <li> I definitely liked them better than the face wash.</li>
            <li> Honestly though, that is ok because I use a moisturizer anyway</li>
            <li> Take it easy!  </li>
            <li> That I can forgive however, if I get a good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> And this worked much better than what I was using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many over the counter products without improvement.</li>
            <li> I use Dan&#x27;s Regimen as a guide on how to treat my skin and use most of his recommendations.  </li>
            <li> I love this scrub and found in when I tried the Derma trial size skin care set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as you&#x27;ve guessed I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as you&#x27;ve guessed I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> We ordered more after this one ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My complexion is best described as oily, especially my forehead.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are too many to list here; however, many of them are also used in the Olay Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It does not have an overwhelming flowery fragrance that some people might find offensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li> My skin looks lovely.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a bit more moisturizing in my face wash, though.  </li>
            <li> The product worked OK.</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;Okay,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> So in the end, I would say this is OK</li>
            <li> but there are better products i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> so we got some more.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause pimples, but it sure as heck did nothing to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I cannot even use this more than once a day</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;Please check out the site and learn more about what we are putting on our bodies not just in them.</li>
            <li> Put seems to work well and leave a nice clean feeling without over drying</li>
            <li> Love this stuff light weight no smell and it does not make you break out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to do this and a nickel sized drop is plenty to work up a good amount for your face.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this particularly moisturizing nor pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and all my life had oily skin which could break out and get clogged pores easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild, without that \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it at first.</li>
            <li> It is good to try a new product.  </li>
            <li> Once a day works for me, but if need be, twice a day would be just as fine</li>
            <li> While washing my face it felt fine.</li>
            <li> However, Simple is great.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser does has a light scent; even though it says \\&quot;NO</li>
            <li> but I am happy with this product to supplement my use with my regular routine I have using an exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It felt light and smooth.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it is definitely more economical.  </li>
            <li> I rarely wear moisturizer because I&#x27;ve never been able to find something calming, hypo-allergenic and non clogging to help me.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Well, so far so good.</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother, more vibrant and more toned.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; am always looking for a good face wash that will not strip my skin, break me out but will still make it feel clean.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me strongly of the luxury Exuvia cleansing cream, but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I gave it one more chance, just thinking maybe I might have had shampoo or something on my hands the first wash.</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price, but there are others in the price range for sensitive skin which have better results.</li>
            <li> It washes well and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, but it feels clean.</li>
            <li> recommend finding a face wash that is made with mostly oils and definitely AVOID sulfate of any kind.</li>
            <li> My skin has felt great all day, and there are no signs of dry, flaky patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just clean.  </li>
            <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin and leaves it squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this wash can clean off cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Something with the word &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; has to be good for my sensitive face, right?</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any other spectacular or amazing effects..</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing special about it though.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this facial wash because of its moisturizing effect and it does a good job leaving the skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> After a few months of continual usage, my skin became remarkably healthier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> and I had a bright red rash all over my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well so that I know it&#x27;s working because it&#x27;s more of a gel form than a liquid cleanser.</li>
            <li> Simple&#x27;s claims sounded good</li>
            <li> Then, in my early thirties &amp; 2 kids of my own, I was still breaking out</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hope this was a help full review</li>
            <li> So far, so good, am really liking how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start looking for a better alternative in hopes of finally having happy skin.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I decided to try the Simple Wash.  If I experienced difficulties, I would gladly run back to the Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> But since my husband was also using it and had initially said he liked it</li>
            <li> I know things with sulfates are drying, so I only use 1/2 pea-sized amount and make sure I rub it into a light lather before washing just around the oiler T-zone...</li>
            <li> and I have not found anything better yet for cleansing my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But quickly after it was washed off my skin felt hot, my face flushed</li>
            <li> While the eyes are part of the face, it&#x27;s a special part that is super sensitive, which is why there are special products just for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it will foam if you use the right amount of water (which is why it might make sense to use it in the shower).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much product to get a good lather, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I picked this up, since it was labeled MOISURIZING and it only contains &amp;#34;skin loving ingredients.&amp;#34; I LOVE this facial wash.</li>
            <li> Used with my Clarisonic, it provided a great clean without irritating my face at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But overall, I recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> For the scrub I use Walmart or Target versions which are similar to St. Ives apricot scrub, but, I think, more aggrerssive.  </li>
            <li> Afterward, my skin feels soft, smooth and well hydrated.  </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]) which taught me the importance of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely be looking for this product on the market.</li>
            <li> ; Sure enough, I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t  used a lot of facial moisturizers, but enjoyed the after effects.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my face without feeling harsh or leaving my skin feeling slimy.</li>
            <li> This Facial Wash was fine, but since I don&#x27;t have a lot I could compare it to, I really didn&#x27;t see anything special about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old female with fair, pretty normal skin.</li>
            <li> and you wouldn&#x27;t even use THAT much more, since - again - little bit goes far! :)</li>
            <li> Start with a gentle oil free eye make up remover for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would be willing to use it again.  </li>
            <li> All in all its a great balance between clean and not overly dry and tight</li>
            <li> Compared to those, I found this Simple face wash better, softer, less detergent-y, and with a mild pleasant natural-y smell (that as far as I can tell does not stick with you after you complete the face washing).</li>
            <li> Overall the facial wash felt nice, and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Keeping my face free of acne was a daily struggle until I received the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I preface this review by pointing out that I am not an expert on advanced facial cleaning products and most of the time I use mass-market national brands (or store-brand clones) found at various drugstores (Clearasil, Nivea, Gillette, etc).</li>
            <li> Thanks, Simple, for lovely new skin!</li>
            <li> &quot;, I don&#x27;t have to moisturize and, for a refreshing change, my skin doesn&#x27;t have some dry spots and some greasy spots; however, it doesn&#x27;t quite remove every bit of makeup.</li>
            <li> So I suppose if I want to use this product more, I&#x27;ll have to decide if I&#x27;d rather have dry skin and no acne, or hydrated skin and acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012o I suppose if I want to use this product more, I&#x27;ll have to decide if I&#x27;d rather have dry skin and no acne, or hydrated skin and acne.  </li>
            <li> Pimples hurt, physically, emotionally and financially; research has shown that if two applicants of equal qualification interview for the same job, the more attractive one will get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face has certainly cleared up a lot since I switched.</li>
            <li> Despite this winter&#x27;s strange up-and-down temperatures in Chesapeake, VA, my complexion, thanks to the Simple Wash, is looking quite good.  </li>
            <li> Despite this winter&#x27;s strange up-and-down temperatures in Chesapeake, VA, my complexion, thanks to the Simple Wash, is looking quite good.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, big enough for the whole face and neck, and nice for those times you need to clean up in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It could be that I should use some sort of cleansing cloth with this product to more or less scrub the makeup off, but then there&#x27;s dealing with fresh towels and cleaning them or otherwise using some disposable cloth, and then that sort of defeats the purpose of choosing this product over a cleansing cloth.  </li>
            <li> The face wash initially seemed good, as it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (no artificial perfumes), and I guess I expected it to not have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> In short, I disliked it greatly.  </li>
            <li> mostly I love that I can&#x27;t feel a drag on my face after I use it.</li>
            <li> REALLY enjoy this and feel it is one of the better/best facial washes I have tried and that WORKS!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0029Z9L7C Simple Hydrating Light Moisturiser]]  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not marketed to exfoliate, it seems to take care of the flakiness too...very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Basically, the Simple Wash is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> my face will develop a very irritated itchy rash.</li>
            <li> OOOOH really?</li>
            <li> so finding a product that cleanses without over drying and causing redness is a real challenge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> I like Simple Kind To Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash.  </li>
            <li> I then use Simple kind Facial Wash</li>
            <li> A product that is highly popular in England, the Simple Wash has just recently been introduced into the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is quite good and delicate.</li>
            <li> I loved the creamy gel feeling of the product, and didn&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t lather up into big bubbles because it spread easily on wet skin and then washed off without a ton of splashing.</li>
            <li> If you like more of a harsh, sandy exfoliating scrub, this isn&#x27;t the right cleanser for you.</li>
            <li> During the first week, I didn&#x27;t seem to notice much of a difference, but then at the end of the second week, someone commented about how soft and smooth my face &amp; completion were.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this will work better for people with other types of skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this will work better for people with other types of skin.  </li>
            <li> So, I was excited to try this Simple brand.  </li>
            <li> commented by the other reviewer, this is also not the most \\&quot;simple\\&quot; product, in case</li>
            <li> 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot Beads, 6-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This did not have the same problem - it just felt clean.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling clean, moist, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> but first of all not using it on our sensitive</li>
            <li> It has a light flowery kind of scent (at least to me) and creates a thinner white foam when lathered.  </li>
            <li> I could feel a difference after the first time I used it in how soft and hydrated my skin felt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a fan of natural or organic products, but I&#x27;m not above using regular products if they work well or have some kind of benefit to them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews and seems to be a hit or miss situation regarding whether this product will have a good or bad effect on your skin.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about two weeks, I noticed my skin felt smooth and didn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give the face wash a bit more time, but after 2 weeks of using it only once a day, my skin feels scaly, almost as though it was burned, itchy &amp; is blotchy &amp; red.  </li>
            <li> One of the side effects of face washing is that you occasionally taste the cleaning products, and this has an unwelcome taste but it dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BEWARE of this product if you too have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d prefer something with a little more grit to it to help exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I like to think of it as a little vacation for my skin. :-)</li>
            <li> I prefer something with a little more scrubbing power that leaves my skin feeling tingly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and my face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> (When I did get a pimple, it seemed to vanish sooner than normal.)  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers question the list of ingredients, but most facial washes have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients.</li>
            <li> This happens with most products that have too harsh of chemicals and they burn my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for a trying a new facial cleanser, especially ones that are supposed to be better for your sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been a loyal Clinique customer for many years but grew tired of paying department store prices.  </li>
            <li> i have normal but very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product has some not so nice ingredients in it that I&#x27;m not really a big fan of, but at the same token the list of ingredients isn&#x27;t as long as it could be, so that&#x27;s something.  </li>
            <li> But I figured since it was new to my skin I would give it a month before I tossed it.</li>
            <li> Buying white is worth the clear skin I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li> The others are typically 5% &amp; 10% and are too strong.  </li>
            <li> All in all I like this product, I do not have very sensitive skin and have not had any reaction.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which is prone to rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Having recently read an article about this chemical--and industrial degreaser used in many soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and other products for cleaning because it&#x27;s cheap--I think it&#x27;s probably part of the problem.</li>
            <li> It took 2 days for my white heads to disappear, and now, on my 4th day, I only have 3 of my original cysts.</li>
            <li> I used it first last night (about 24 hours ago), and have not had any signs of imminent cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for the first time earlier this year.</li>
            <li> I do use other cleansers particularly in the winter which do better at keeping my skin moisturized and minimizing the dry spots and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I realized that the rash came from using Simple, as this was the only thing that I had been using on my face that was new, I quickly stopped and threw it out.</li>
            <li> I like this facial wash because it is easy on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since recently running out of my facial toner &amp; breaking out, I have begun my full treatment regimen again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells amazing - not too overpowering but not so weak you can&#x27;t pick up that light scent - and a LITTLE bit goes a LOOOOOOOOOOONG way.</li>
            <li> This product worked just as good, but not better than other products I tried.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my face felt soft and ready for me to apply my make up.</li>
            <li> and I am sitting here with almost clear skin thanks to a combination of products that are actually working!</li>
            <li> I got this moisturizer to try it out because my husband has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give quite as much moisturizing effect as I&#x27;d hoped, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> I have to pay extra close attention as to not squeeze out too much, for even just about a dime-size bit works wonders.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m cursed with frustratingly sensitive, reactive skin.</li>
            <li> I think it might be time to remove it completely from our home</li>
            <li> and it soothes my face and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I use a nickle size amount and apply it by gently smoothing it over my entire face.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I lather my face with the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B002UUT38I Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, 6 Ounce]])</li>

            <li> nearly all of my life and will continue to do so.  </li>

            <li> nearly all of my life and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and used this product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to anyone else who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They state there are \\&quot;no harsh irritants\\&quot; \\&quot;dyes\\&quot; \\&quot;perfumes\\</li>
            <li> It could be that my skin is sensitive to one of these ingredients.</li>
            <li> Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash left my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> If you are a man or woman who is searching for an economical facial cleanser that performs well at exfoliating skin, then I highly recommend you try the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.  </li>

            <li> My face never gets dry, even in the extremely hot Texas summer.  </li>
            <li> For the first two weeks, my skin was slightly dry and taut.  </li>
            <li> For the first two weeks, my skin was slightly dry and taut.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not all make the cut; as is the case with [[ASIN:B005TI7LB4 Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is clean without feeling tight and I don&#x27;t have to put an icepack on my face after cleaning to calm down redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, the Simple Wash can be easily ordered through Amazon if not readily available in department stores.  </li>
            <li> I found with Simple that even though I forgot to moisturize again I had a softer face than normal.</li>
            <li> What I normally use is the Olay (or generic) cleansing cloth that is disposable, so that&#x27;s my source of comparison for this product.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using zinc oxide and cortisone cream on my face to get it back to normal, as well as switching to Neutrogena products which have worked wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most things cause my skin to look like I&#x27;ve gotten a very bad sunburn - it will itch, feel like it&#x27;s burning, and get bright red.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin; instead it leaves it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Obviously I have stopped using it, but am surprised that this is marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am still using the same facial wash that I started using 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t really tried any others.  </li>
            <li> However, as I wrote earlier, it is sometimes good to vary one&#x27;s beauty regiment because, like a workout regiment, it can grow stale.  </li>
            <li> However, as I wrote earlier, it is sometimes good to vary one&#x27;s beauty regiment because, like a workout regiment, it can grow stale.  </li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;ve been such a Clinique fan was because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and have used Cetaphil for 10+yrs but recently felt it was too drying</li>
            <li> i bought this product after having success with other simple products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but have to deal with wearing lots of makeup everyday as a performer, so keeping my skin clean while not overdrying is a challenge, especially when I&#x27;ve been filling my pores with various powders and letting them absorb under the heat of the lights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this again as it seems to clean well and not be very harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> Before my face was clear I still used my foundation over my entire face.</li>
            <li> Especially for sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and obviously there is something in this product that I am allergic to.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use facial products, especially soaps, because I find them drying.  </li>
            <li> I quit using it for a week and switched back to a face wash I had used before, and my skin went back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product and it seemed ok but not great.</li>
            <li> There are only a few things I&#x27;m brand loyal to.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just my skin type, but in an overall experience, this one just didn&#x27;t work out for me in most ways, although it did help in a few other</li>
            <li> I also use it before attending a social event.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it was really thick and not all that special.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say we&#x27;ve gone back to our old product and will not be using Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.</li>
            <li> Just because other face washes have similar ingredient lists doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for my sensitive skin to adjust to a new product line, but now I am hooked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I feel like a high schooler on prom night, but not only do I have the zits, my skin also feels really dried out despite this being advertised as a \\&quot;moisturizing facial wash\\&quot; created by \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend Simple to anyone with dry skin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that only occasionally breaks out.</li>
            <li> I believe that one of the main reasons we both had this much trouble is that the second ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
            <li> The mild smell it does have was not pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I only use dove soap and I&#x27;ve been using Clinique facial products for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> At first it feels wet and heavy, but after a couple minutesit absorbs into my skin and dries.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other simple products and this was the only one who had this horrible effect on my skin :)</li>
            <li> Let last step dry about 5 minutes, or immediately apply Simple Hydrating Moisturizer if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash does not irritate my skin, whereas other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin washes have left my skin burning.  </li>
            <li> After using this cleanser for several weeks, I saw no difference in those dry areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any red, dry patches around the corners of my nose or mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any red, dry patches around the corners of my nose or mouth.    </li>
            <li> I was only using it in the morning, but my skin would feel itchy &amp; dry almost as soon as I washed my face.  </li>
            <li> However, if I raise a small dab of it to my right nostril, I do smell a slight odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this also broke my sister out who has dry less sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I know some were saying it didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing, but most regular washes leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> For those of you who get them you know how long they can take to go away.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get over the strange smell - it reminds me of lemon furniture polish.  </li>
            <li> i rewashed my face, within a few hours my entire face was was stingy and itchy by the morning one of my eyelids was swollen and my entire face was covered in white bumps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ingredients are not pure and simple.</li>
            <li> It cleanses the skin,but it strips the skin a little too much and leaves the skin a bit tight.</li>
            <li> So I washed with my regular facial cleaner, which got the rest of the makeup and dirt left behind from Simple, and finally felt fully clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before reviewing this product and make such a report,</li>
            <li> Generously Apply the Benzoyl Peroxide, large pea size amount, thin layer over my entire face &amp; neck area.  </li>
            <li> Every other day I use the Derma 24 Vitamin C Micro Delivery Facial Scrub.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have psoriasis (dry skin</li>
            <li> the skin around my eyebrows tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> and in this dry winter weather, it has helped my skin.  </li>
            <li> It gets dry and flaky (in addition to the redness and bumps of rosacea).  </li>
            <li> During the winter I get dry spots/patches on my face.</li>
            <li> No decrease in the seasonal redness or dry patches.</li>
            <li> Well, here I am finishing up my bottle and my skin is dry, itchy, flaking, and COVERED in zits.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin</li>
            <li> However, this product does make my face feel  dry.  </li>
            <li> and I so dry</li>
            <li> I do steps 1 &amp; 2, apply the mask in a thin layer over entire face &amp; neck leaving on for much longer than 10 minutes, &amp; then proceed with steps 4 &amp; 5 after rinsing off the mask.    </li>
            <li> Few suds, no deep cleaning, and a filmy feeling left after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> For a regular product, I would rate this about average in terms of ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use it to wash my face at least twice a day, in the morning while preparing to go to work and at night before retiring to bed.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve never had any problems with any type of face wash in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s free of the usual irritants, potential carcinogens, and other nasty surprises found in so many products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a typical, basic face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Ounce per ounce, the Simple Wash is half the price of the Olay Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small pearl-drop of the Simple Wash on my hands before rubbing it on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive for what you get, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep using it or not, though I have liked the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very moisturizing either, I washed my face twice a day with this product and was left with that tight dry feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> PLUS these new large, painful, deep cysts.</li>
            <li> &amp;lt;-- I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten some on/in the eye area (no direct contact,) and it doesn&#x27;t sting like other face products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though my skin took a few days to get used to it and felt dry during that time, when you use it regularly it is moisturizing as it claims.  </li>
            <li> I try to get products with as few artificial ingredients as possible because I don&#x27;t like chemicals and have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is not great at keeping acne at bay, though no worse than the typical cleanser in that regard.  </li>
            <li> so I instantly missed the little exfoliation beads.  </li>
            <li> With the wipes, I have to moisturize afterwards because they are a little aggressive; however, they take out all the makeup which, if left on, make my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> It only lathers a little, so</li>
            <li> The bad part is, this product causes me to break out in rather large painful pimples (and I&#x27;m sure you really wanted to know that about me) and its happened every time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I get bad breakouts in my t-zone mostly.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing but cleanses well.</li>
            <li> use of this product entails that it be applied to wet skin and worked into a lather.  </li>
            <li> Again, I wasn&#x27;t expecting those things either, but just pointing out the fact that this is your regular everyday cleanser, with no added benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see lemon listed anywhere on the ingredients list, but lemon seems too harsh on the skin, even if it&#x27;s only something else that smells like lemon.</li>
            <li> I am probably the worse person to review skin care product as I really don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> i have dry skin and a bit of rosacea, and generally have a hard time finding skincare that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how bad it is, I have tried almost every \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; label/brand on the market (\\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; and regular), and the only stuff I&#x27;ve been able to use long-term is Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream and Dry Skin Cream.</li>
            <li> The rash was red, raw, itchy, and peeling.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clarsonic almost everyday and it has helped prevent breakouts, even during high hormonal times (women will know what I mean).  </li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> It is less than half the price of the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and works just as well, if not better.</li>

            <li> Simple has very little suds.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this facial wash, but was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> In addition to white heads in my usual break out places.  </li>
            <li> Sulfate is extremely drying for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> And if that doesn&#x27;t happen, I end up with those cystic pimples within 24 hours of first use - uncomfortable and unattractive.</li>
            <li> It has a \\&quot;tough-action\\&quot; formula(well, at least for me, since I naturally have oily skin and [what I consider] bad acne - not super noticeable, but still there and prevalent), but is still soft and gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap at a little under $15 at my local store.</li>
            <li> A secondary rinse did the same.  </li>
            <li> (The five-ounce tube should last me at least two to three months.)  </li>
            <li> The rotating brush gently deep cleans my skin while removing dead cells as evidenced by the black grime found in its bristles; I&#x27;ve had to replace the brush since faithfully using it every day for the past year.  </li>
            <li> typically use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say, it was the same as I described above each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I started getting a slight rash on my face</li>
            <li> And sadly, this can also be said for the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.  </li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin that is slightly acne prone.</li>
            <li> Now it can get dry in wintertime as I moved to a house in the country with forced air heat.</li>
            <li> So I started using it about every other day for the past month or so</li>
            <li> I broke out less when I used a plain bar of hotel soap.  </li>
            <li> Ive&#x27;s Green Tea cleanser before using this.</li>
            <li> my skin was so flaky and dried out.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist prescribed a number of topical treatments, all making it worse.</li>
            <li> Dan recommends not using harsh scrubs, but I get a lot of sebum and dead skin cells that build up on my pores and cause acne.</li>
            <li> The result is that my skin has a few blemishes when I use this product over the course of a work week.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to waste anything after all.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any allergic reactions such as rashes, blisters, hives, etc.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks it started giving me pimples.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped using it and the rash went away after a few days.</li>
            <li> but i am not acne prone, but when a product is too harsh</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times and my skin did feel moister and smoother to the touch.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for a few days I noticed that my skin was drying out</li>
            <li> first two days that I used it my skin was so painfully parched and flaky I almost gave up.</li>
            <li> I usually expect a few pimples when I change my skin care regiment, so I gave it 2-3 weeks before deciding to throw out the rest of the container.</li>
            <li> Even worse, I also have extremely dry skin -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica for years but since getting pregnant, my skin changed and seems to reject the very expensive Dermalogica line!  </li>
            <li> Added plus -- no more crepey skin.</li>
            <li> To make it more awful</li>

            <li> The cleanser is a thick, creamy gel that is hard to squeeze out of the tube.  </li>

            <li> It is hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t have acne treatment (DRIES my skin out), mini scrubbies in it (too HARSH for my skin) and isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>

            <li> you mad or something?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the look and feel of this gel (it&#x27;s a semi-opaque whitish goop that is, let&#x27;s say, unpleasant to put on my face)</li>

            <li> The up side though is they are no longer painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used.  I normally don&#x27;t use facial products, especially soaps, because I find them drying.  However, Simple is great.  My face never gets dry, even in the extremely hot Texas summer.  I use this with my Clarsonic almost everyday and it has helped prevent breakouts, even during high hormonal times (women will know what I mean).  I would recommend Simple to anyone with dry skin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this moisturizer to try it out because my husband has sensitive skin.  He is a good cleanser and I like it but I prefer the foaming cleansers to this creamy stuff.  I have had no break outs since starting to use this stuff and my husband hasn&#x27;t complained at all about his skin.  Just wish it was in a pump instead of a tube.</li>
            <li> I was using the St. Ive&#x27;s Green Tea cleanser before using this. I still had some skin problems when I was using St. Ive&#x27;s. So, I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin. And this worked much better than what I was using. My face has certainly cleared up a lot since I switched. And the risk of breakouts has dropped a lot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m just iffy on is the texture (Hence 4 Stars). It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well so that I know it&#x27;s working because it&#x27;s more of a gel form than a liquid cleanser. It takes quite a bit to get it to lather up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I liked this wash. It lathers nice and smells good. It has a good feel when I used it to wash my face. However, I soon noticed that my face itched. It was splotchy, red and itchy all day. As I write this review, I looked up the ingredients. It turns out Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil is CHAMOMILE FLOWER, OIL according to the FDA website. I know I&#x27;m allergic to chamomile, so despite liking the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash, it won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have psoriasis (dry skin condition)and the skin around my eyebrows tends to get dry. I figured that a gentler soap would help from my skin getting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap seems to work well. It doesn&#x27;t give quite as much moisturizing effect as I&#x27;d hoped, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different. It is, however, a step above washing your face with a bar such as Dove or Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for 30 yrs but they keep changing their produst lines so I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that works well for my skin. It looks like the Simple line is it. Light, feels good when washing and mostly I love that I can&#x27;t feel a drag on my face after I use it. Added plus -- no more crepey skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;I only started using this about two-three weeks ago. During the first week, I didn&#x27;t seem to notice much of a difference, but then at the end of the second week, someone commented about how soft and smooth my face &amp; completion were. Since then, I&#x27;ve just been using it as my main/only face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing - not too overpowering but not so weak you can&#x27;t pick up that light scent - and a LITTLE bit goes a LOOOOOOOOOOONG way. I have to pay extra close attention as to not squeeze out too much, for even just about a dime-size bit works wonders. It has a \\&quot;tough-action\\&quot; formula(well, at least for me, since I naturally have oily skin and [what I consider] bad acne - not super noticeable, but still there and prevalent), but is still soft and gentle on the face and doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes. &amp;lt;-- I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten some on/in the eye area (no direct contact,) and it doesn&#x27;t sting like other face products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY enjoy this and feel it is one of the better/best facial washes I have tried and that WORKS! I highly recommend using this product. Once a day works for me, but if need be, twice a day would be just as fine and you wouldn&#x27;t even use THAT much more, since - again - little bit goes far! :)</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s probably the result of my gene pool but I&#x27;m cursed with frustratingly sensitive, reactive skin. Even the one cleanser I&#x27;ve found that is alright for my skin isn&#x27;t great. I recently decided to start looking for a better alternative in hopes of finally having happy skin. Simple&#x27;s claims sounded good so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two days that I used it my skin was so painfully parched and flaky I almost gave up. But I figured since it was new to my skin I would give it a month before I tossed it. Maybe I just needed to get used to it. I spent the next three weeks suffering from the worst acne breakout I have had in months! Break-through breakouts are not uncommon when switching cleansers but it just got worse and worse. To make it more awful my skin was so flaky and dried out. But since my husband was also using it and had initially said he liked it I left it for him to keep using. A week later he was having the same miserable breakout symptoms I had been having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say we&#x27;ve gone back to our old product and will not be using Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash. I believe that one of the main reasons we both had this much trouble is that the second ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Having recently read an article about this chemical--and industrial degreaser used in many soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and other products for cleaning because it&#x27;s cheap--I think it&#x27;s probably part of the problem. I think it might be time to remove it completely from our home but first of all not using it on our sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I hated this product, I did also try [[ASIN:B005TI7LHS Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)]] which I have had no adverse reaction to. They&#x27;re soft, big enough for the whole face and neck, and nice for those times you need to clean up in a hurry. I definitely liked them better than the face wash.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this skincare product based on the advertisement that it is a \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; facial wash with vitamins.  I thought, \\&quot;this can&#x27;t possibly hurt my skin.\\&quot;  I am a skeptic about putting anything on my face for fear of unwanted breakouts.  The words \\&quot;no dyes, artificial perfumes or harsh irritants\\&quot; won me over.  After using this product for about two weeks, I noticed my skin felt smooth and didn&#x27;t feel dry.  My nose did not peel and I had no redness, no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product again.</li>
            <li> Deeply cleans skin and without overdrying. It seemed to remove all traces of oil, dirt, and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use [[ASIN:B002PBCAEQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub,Natural Apricot Beads, 6-Fluid Ounce]] as my daily night time facial wash; it is a Deep Exfoliating Scrub - so I instantly missed the little exfoliation beads.  If you like more of a harsh, sandy exfoliating scrub, this isn&#x27;t the right cleanser for you. Overall the facial wash felt nice, and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth. The cleanser does has a light scent; even though it says \\&quot;NO PREFUME\\&quot; - it isn&#x27;t overpowering but I did want to make a note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the ingredients - Not as Simple as you think...&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua, Eau), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Bisabolol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Oil, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Polyquaternium-39, Laureth-10, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylparaben</li>
            <li> It cleanses the skin,but it strips the skin a little too much and leaves the skin a bit tight.Not very moisturizing but cleanses well.It is necessary u follow up with a moisturizer. All in all its a great balance between clean and not overly dry and tight</li>
            <li> I like Simple Kind To Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash.  I use it after using an apricot scrub.  For the scrub I use Walmart or Target versions which are similar to St. Ives apricot scrub, but, I think, more aggrerssive.  I then use Simple kind Facial Wash and it soothes my face and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this facial wash, but was somewhat disappointed. Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me surprisingly was the smell. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (no artificial perfumes), and I guess I expected it to not have much of a smell. The mild smell it does have was not pleasant to me. This is a white, creamy cleanser that seems to do the job alright. However, I&#x27;d prefer something with a little more grit to it to help exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have known of Simple for years as I am from England. Since moving to US I have been using the St Ives. When I saw Simple was over on this side of the pond I decided to give it a try. I found it a nice change. I used it in the shower while I washed my hair. I had no issues with rinsing it off or applying it to my face. The next morning my face felt soft and ready for me to apply my make up. I am bad at remembering to apply moisturizer after I have cleansed. I found with Simple that even though I forgot to moisturize again I had a softer face than normal. All in all I like this product, I do not have very sensitive skin and have not had any reaction. I would like to see if this range has an exfoliate product but I am happy with this product to supplement my use with my regular routine I have using an exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I have had pimples since the 5th grade, as soon as the hormones kicked in. Then, in my early thirties &amp; 2 kids of my own, I was still breaking out PLUS these new large, painful, deep cysts. They started on my neck, then my jaw line &amp; spread to my cheeks. I&#x27;ve used many over the counter products without improvement. My Dermatologist prescribed a number of topical treatments, all making it worse. Bactrim was the miracle pill for it, but the pill made me sick with flu like symptoms.    Here we are, 2 years later and I am sitting here with almost clear skin thanks to a combination of products that are actually working! Here is what I am doing that I am finally getting results from:    Products I use:  [[ASIN:B0073GO0CI Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash, 5 oz]]  [[ASIN:B0073GNZ8I Simple Soothing Facial Toner, 6.7 oz]]  [[ASIN:B0029Z9L7C Simple Hydrating Light Moisturiser]]  [[ASIN:B000052YJX Neutrogena On-The-Spot Acne Treatment, Vanishing Formula, 0.75 Ounce]]  [[ASIN:B002Q6JO6W C. Booth Facial Scrub, Vitamin C Micro Delivery 2.5 oz (71 g)]]  [[ASIN:B002Q6PVPU C. Booth Thermal Clay Mask, 10-Minute Oil Control 2.5 oz (71 g)]]     I use Dan&#x27;s Regimen as a guide on how to treat my skin and use most of his recommendations.  I wash my face twice a day.    1. Start with a gentle oil free eye make up remover for sensitive skin.  2. Wash using Dan&#x27;s technique with the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash, avoiding my eye area.  3. Apply the Simple Soothing Facial Toner with a cotton ball. I recently ran out of this toner for a week and broke out in cysts again, 10 of them! In addition to white heads in my usual break out places.  4. Generously Apply the Benzoyl Peroxide, large pea size amount, thin layer over my entire face &amp; neck area.  5. Let last step dry about 5 minutes, or immediately apply Simple Hydrating Moisturizer if I&#x27;m in a hurry. I use a nickle size amount and apply it by gently smoothing it over my entire face. At first it feels wet and heavy, but after a couple minutesit absorbs into my skin and dries.  Afterward, my skin feels soft, smooth and well hydrated.  6. When I have a pimple I will cover it with foundation and use it under my eyes. Before my face was clear I still used my foundation over my entire face. I&#x27;m now not needing it!    Every other day I use the Derma 24 Vitamin C Micro Delivery Facial Scrub. It is not cheap at a little under $15 at my local store. I love this scrub and found in when I tried the Derma trial size skin care set. Their line didn&#x27;t work for me, but the scub has. I use it only before bed. Dan recommends not using harsh scrubs, but I get a lot of sebum and dead skin cells that build up on my pores and cause acne. The scrub works great for me.  I do steps 1 &amp; 2 then use the scrub &amp; proceed with steps 4 &amp; 5.    2 times a week, on a night when I&#x27;m not using the Vitamin C scrub, I use the Derma 17, 10 Min Clay Mask.  I do steps 1 &amp; 2, apply the mask in a thin layer over entire face &amp; neck leaving on for much longer than 10 minutes, &amp; then proceed with steps 4 &amp; 5 after rinsing off the mask.    Since recently running out of my facial toner &amp; breaking out, I have begun my full treatment regimen again. It took 2 days for my white heads to disappear, and now, on my 4th day, I only have 3 of my original cysts. For those of you who get them you know how long they can take to go away. The up side though is they are no longer painful. The pain was gone on the 2nd day. They are now just flesh colored lumps under my skin.    Suggestions: Check out Dan&#x27;s Regimen at [...] He has his own skin care line now, which I&#x27;ve never tried. His steps and techniques have worked for me though.  Also remember, Benzoyl Peroxide will bleach anything it comes in contact with. Get dressed and undressed before you apply it and use a white pillow case and white towel for your face. It truly works and I will not go without it. Buying white is worth the clear skin I&#x27;m getting.  Neutrogena is the only brand with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide thatI&#x27;ve found. The others are typically 5% &amp; 10% and are too strong.  Shop online to find the best prices. Amazon and drugstore.com are my favorites!</li>
            <li> This product worked just as good, but not better than other products I tried.  I certainly would be willing to use it again.  The biggest decision maker to me would be the cost of this versus something else as I didn&#x27;t feel that there was any advantages or disadvantages to using this product.  It did moisturize without feeling greasy.  It felt light and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but have to deal with wearing lots of makeup everyday as a performer, so keeping my skin clean while not overdrying is a challenge, especially when I&#x27;ve been filling my pores with various powders and letting them absorb under the heat of the lights. What I normally use is the Olay (or generic) cleansing cloth that is disposable, so that&#x27;s my source of comparison for this product.  With the wipes, I have to moisturize afterwards because they are a little aggressive; however, they take out all the makeup which, if left on, make my skin break out.  With \\&quot;Simple\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t have to moisturize and, for a refreshing change, my skin doesn&#x27;t have some dry spots and some greasy spots; however, it doesn&#x27;t quite remove every bit of makeup. The result is that my skin has a few blemishes when I use this product over the course of a work week.  It could be that I should use some sort of cleansing cloth with this product to more or less scrub the makeup off, but then there&#x27;s dealing with fresh towels and cleaning them or otherwise using some disposable cloth, and then that sort of defeats the purpose of choosing this product over a cleansing cloth.  All that taken into consideration, I plan to keep my cleansing cloths for work days but to use this on days off when I don&#x27;t have to use makeup. I like to think of it as a little vacation for my skin. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got real mixed feelings about this product.  Maybe its just my skin type, but in an overall experience, this one just didn&#x27;t work out for me in most ways, although it did help in a few other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the best way to start is with the ingredients.  I&#x27;m normally a fan of natural or organic products, but I&#x27;m not above using regular products if they work well or have some kind of benefit to them or if a friend gives it to me to try out.  I don&#x27;t like to waste anything after all.  This product has some not so nice ingredients in it that I&#x27;m not really a big fan of, but at the same token the list of ingredients isn&#x27;t as long as it could be, so that&#x27;s something.  It does contain sodium laureth sulfate, for those of you who were wondering.  For a regular product, I would rate this about average in terms of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of this product entails that it be applied to wet skin and worked into a lather.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to do this and a nickel sized drop is plenty to work up a good amount for your face.  It has a light flowery kind of scent (at least to me) and creates a thinner white foam when lathered.  I&#x27;d say a bottle of this, used at that amount, could probably last a couple months at one use a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its supposed to be a moisturizing product and I do have to say that that part of it actually works.  I could feel a difference after the first time I used it in how soft and hydrated my skin felt.  And I liked that about it.  So I started using it about every other day for the past month or so and in this dry winter weather, it has helped my skin.  So that&#x27;s the good part.  The bad part is, this product causes me to break out in rather large painful pimples (and I&#x27;m sure you really wanted to know that about me) and its happened every time I&#x27;ve used it.  I thought maybe it was just my skin trying to get used to the product, so I kept trying, but now a month or so later, I still have the same problem every time.  And the effects are next day immediate.  So I suppose if I want to use this product more, I&#x27;ll have to decide if I&#x27;d rather have dry skin and no acne, or hydrated skin and acne.  I&#x27;m sure as you&#x27;ve guessed I&#x27;d rather it be the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this will work better for people with other types of skin.  Mines on the drier side to begin with which is why I was so attracted to this product but perhaps its just not for me.  I won&#x27;t use it again because of the unfortunate side effects, but if you have resistant to blemish dry skin, this may just work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M.

            <li> I have Rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.  It gets dry and flaky (in addition to the redness and bumps of rosacea).  I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica for years but since getting pregnant, my skin changed and seems to reject the very expensive Dermalogica line!  A pharmacist recommended this Simple product - it&#x27;s the only cleanser I can use now.  It moisturizes AND cleans...although I use another product to remove makeup (a Neutrogena product that I will review shortly).  The product sits in the shower and I use it every time.  Although it&#x27;s not marketed to exfoliate, it seems to take care of the flakiness too...very gentle.  You just need to get past the gel-like consistency...it will foam if you use the right amount of water (which is why it might make sense to use it in the shower).</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t toally dislike this facial wash, I wasn&#x27;t overly enthused about it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a typical, basic face cleanser. Creamy, lathers well and rinses well. It has a very light scent. I have to be picky with what I use on my face as my skin doesn&#x27;t like alot of products, but this one caused no irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; claim, I don&#x27;t feel that this product was moisturizing at all. During the winter I get dry spots/patches on my face. After using this cleanser for several weeks, I saw no difference in those dry areas. The cleanser did not add any moisturization. Honestly though, that is ok because I use a moisturizer anyway and I do not rely on a cleanser to add moisture, BUT if it claims to do something, you should see at least some sort of proof of those claims. I do use other cleansers particularly in the winter which do better at keeping my skin moisturized and minimizing the dry spots and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any other spectacular or amazing effects.. no glowing skin, no diminished wrinkles or anything else. No decrease in the seasonal redness or dry patches. Again, I wasn&#x27;t expecting those things either, but just pointing out the fact that this is your regular everyday cleanser, with no added benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily advise against buying this cleanser, but I also would not specifically recommend it. It is ok for the price, but there are others in the price range for sensitive skin which have better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for a trying a new facial cleanser, especially ones that are supposed to be better for your sensitive skin.  Unfortunately, not all make the cut; as is the case with [[ASIN:B005TI7LB4 Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wash, I like suds.  Simple has very little suds. That I can forgive however, if I get a good clean feeling.  With Simple, I didn&#x27;t.  After rinsing, it felt like there was still a film on my face.  A secondary rinse did the same.  So I washed with my regular facial cleaner, which got the rest of the makeup and dirt left behind from Simple, and finally felt fully clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before reviewing this product and make such a report, I used Simple facial wash ten times.  I&#x27;m sad to say, it was the same as I described above each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple is a no go for me.  Few suds, no deep cleaning, and a filmy feeling left after rinsing.  Ick.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until my wife has used it several times to see if there were any problems she could identify and if she continues to like it. We ordered more after this one ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing special about it though. My wife likes this facial wash because of its moisturizing effect and it does a good job leaving the skin clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash left my skin soft and clean.  I liked how it lathered with my clairisonic face brush and removed all traces of makeup.  I would recommend you give it a try.  It&#x27;s a good price point too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this particularly moisturizing nor pleasant to use.  It was a fairly generic, creamy white cleanser.  I prefer something with a little more scrubbing power that leaves my skin feeling tingly.  Not sure I would try this again.</li>
            <li> I am a forty-eight-year-old man who was born with raunchy skin. My complexion is best described as oily, especially my forehead.  Keeping my face free of acne was a daily struggle until I received the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]) which taught me the importance of exfoliation.  The rotating brush gently deep cleans my skin while removing dead cells as evidenced by the black grime found in its bristles; I&#x27;ve had to replace the brush since faithfully using it every day for the past year.  I lather my face with the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser ([[ASIN:B002UUT38I Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, 6 Ounce]]) prior to using the cleanser&#x27;s rotating brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I dare say that I experienced miraculous results using the Olay products.  After a few months of continual usage, my skin became remarkably healthier and more manageable.  There were fewer pimples, especially on my nose.  (When I did get a pimple, it seemed to vanish sooner than normal.)  My skin was smoother, more vibrant and more toned.  My self-confidence and self-esteem increased as my acne problems decreased.  Let&#x27;s face it, men also want healthier skin. Pimples hurt, physically, emotionally and financially; research has shown that if two applicants of equal qualification interview for the same job, the more attractive one will get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With that said, I was hesitant about trying the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.  I didn&#x27;t want to alter a cleansing regiment that had been proven successful.  However, I believe that beauty products are like medicines.  Sometimes our bodies become immune to them and they no longer work as effectively.  It is good to try a new product.  When I was bodybuilding, I had to change my weight lifting routines in order for my muscles to continue growing.  Therefore, I decided to try the Simple Wash.  If I experienced difficulties, I would gladly run back to the Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I quit using my Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar, Acne-Prone Skin Formula, ([[ASIN:B005CPZHOW Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bars, Acne-Prone Skin Formula, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]) and I continued using the Olay Cleansing System.  However, I substituted the Simple Wash for the Olay Cleanser.  Ounce per ounce, the Simple Wash is half the price of the Olay Cleanser.  Therefore, it is definitely more economical.  Also, the Simple Wash can be easily ordered through Amazon if not readily available in department stores.  A product that is highly popular in England, the Simple Wash has just recently been introduced into the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have posted some photographs of the Simple Wash on this web site.  It arrived in a five-ounce tube without a box or any paperwork.  Instructions and all ingredients are printed on the back of the tube, which, for safety reasons, had a cap that was sealed with plastic.  The ingredients are too many to list here; however, many of them are also used in the Olay Cleanser.  This led me to believe that the Simple Wash also exfoliates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have faithfully used the Simple Wash for ONE MONTH.  I normally use it to wash my face at least twice a day, in the morning while preparing to go to work and at night before retiring to bed.  I also use it before attending a social event.  I have not experienced any allergic reactions such as rashes, blisters, hives, etc.  Basically, the Simple Wash is fragrance free.  It does not have an overwhelming flowery fragrance that some people might find offensive.  However, if I raise a small dab of it to my right nostril, I do smell a slight odor.  My Olay Cleanser smells similar and it is also advertised as fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A little does go a long way. I only use a small pearl-drop of the Simple Wash on my hands before rubbing it on my face.  The amount of lather produced will depend upon the amount of Simple Wash used.  (The five-ounce tube should last me at least two to three months.)  For the first two weeks, my skin was slightly dry and taut.  I had to rub into my face a small amount of Suave Body Lotion, Vitamin E, ([[ASIN:B003ZYGTSA Suave Body Lotion, Vitamin E, 32-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]) in order to give it some moisture.  However, eventually my skin must have grown accustomed to the Simple Wash and became noticeably smoother, softer and refreshed.  Despite this winter&#x27;s strange up-and-down temperatures in Chesapeake, VA, my complexion, thanks to the Simple Wash, is looking quite good.  I don&#x27;t have any red, dry patches around the corners of my nose or mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you are a man or woman who is searching for an economical facial cleanser that performs well at exfoliating skin, then I highly recommend you try the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.  It is less than half the price of the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and works just as well, if not better. I am not criticizing Olay products in any way.  I&#x27;ve used the Olay Body Moisturizing Bath Soap ([[ASIN:B0029924L8 Olay body moisturizing bar soap for sensitive and hypo allergenic skin - 4.25 oz, 6 ea]]) nearly all of my life and will continue to do so.  However, as I wrote earlier, it is sometimes good to vary one&#x27;s beauty regiment because, like a workout regiment, it can grow stale.  Your skin, muscles, etc., will not respond as well with the same daily routine used year after year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosthree months.)

            <li> I LOVE this wash! It&#x27;s free of the usual irritants, potential carcinogens, and other nasty surprises found in so many products. It washes well and rinses off cleanly. Used with my Clarisonic, it provided a great clean without irritating my face at all. It reminds me strongly of the luxury Exuvia cleansing cream, but at a much more reasonable price. I&#x27;ve already ordered more. This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> i have dry skin and a bit of rosacea, and generally have a hard time finding skincare that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s tourmeline charged cleanser and (rather sticky) moisturizer -- which has greatly improved my skin&#x27;s appearance, but I&#x27;m not so in love that I don&#x27;t continue to search for something easier on the wallet.  Thank goodness for Simple!  I know things with sulfates are drying, so I only use 1/2 pea-sized amount and make sure I rub it into a light lather before washing just around the oiler T-zone... the rest of my face I tend to leave alone.  (We over cleanse our skin, ladies!  Take it easy!  You should barely be touching your face!)  I follow up with the SPF 15 pot o&#x27; delicious cream.  It took a few days for my sensitive skin to adjust to a new product line, but now I am hooked.  I only use the Aveda cream now as a night cream.  \\&quot;Whew,\\&quot; said my wallet.  Thanks, Simple, for lovely new skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last couple of months, and it works well.  Though my skin took a few days to get used to it and felt dry during that time, when you use it regularly it is moisturizing as it claims.  The only downside is that it is not great at keeping acne at bay, though no worse than the typical cleanser in that regard.  It is a little expensive for what you get, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep using it or not, though I have liked the product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;m 39 and all my life had oily skin which could break out and get clogged pores easily. Now it can get dry in wintertime as I moved to a house in the country with forced air heat. Well, so far so good. I found this product by accident and have been using it with the moisturizer. So far, so good, am really liking how my skin looks and feels. This product feels different from all the others I&#x27;ve tried over the years. Very happy with it. Will buy again. It&#x27;s great for winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, but it feels clean. My skin looks lovely. Very nice, thank you!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and used this product. It made my skin blotchy and red, it was painful and extremely drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are not pure and simple. Just because other face washes have similar ingredient lists doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay. Especially for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend finding a face wash that is made with mostly oils and definitely AVOID sulfate of any kind. Sulfate is extremely drying for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My son says they work great and he uses them all the time, Every time he takes a shower he uses them and says they are great.</li>
            <li> I try to get products with as few artificial ingredients as possible because I don&#x27;t like chemicals and have pretty sensitive skin.  So, I was excited to try this Simple brand.  I got the face wash and the facial moisturizer.  The moisturizer smelled terrible and so I stopped using it.  The face wash initially seemed good, as it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  However, both myself and my spouse noticed that this face wash started to irritate our skin.  After a few weeks it started giving me pimples.  I quit using it for a week and switched back to a face wash I had used before, and my skin went back to normal.  As the rest of my skin care remained the same and my diet didn&#x27;t change during that time, I can only conclude it was the face wash.  I would not recommend it to anyone else who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. Most things cause my skin to look like I&#x27;ve gotten a very bad sunburn - it will itch, feel like it&#x27;s burning, and get bright red. And if that doesn&#x27;t happen, I end up with those cystic pimples within 24 hours of first use - uncomfortable and unattractive. Even worse, I also have extremely dry skin - if I don&#x27;t moisturize twice a day, I end up with horrible dry, flaky patches. To give you an idea of how bad it is, I have tried almost every \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; label/brand on the market (\\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; and regular), and the only stuff I&#x27;ve been able to use long-term is Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream and Dry Skin Cream. So it is with some skepticism that I decided to try this when I spotted it at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I know some were saying it didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing, but most regular washes leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable. This did not have the same problem - it just felt clean. The smell is very mild, without that \\&quot;no scent\\&quot; scent that is so...icky. I used it first last night (about 24 hours ago), and have not had any signs of imminent cystic pimples. I did use the Pond&#x27;s lotion this morning, as I plan to gradually phase in the rest of the line, order to minimize any shock to my skin. My skin has felt great all day, and there are no signs of dry, flaky patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t speak to the ingredients, as plenty of others have done that. I do like that the list is shorter than many others, and while I wish that I was able to use those plentiful \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; skincare washes and lotions, I am just happy to find another option that is fairly inexpensive and does what it says.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it seemed ok but not great. Then I started getting a slight rash on my face so I stopped using it and the rash went away after a few days. I tried the product again and the rash reappeared. I have sensitive skin and obviously there is something in this product that I am allergic to.  Use this product at your own risk. I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews and seems to be a hit or miss situation regarding whether this product will have a good or bad effect on your skin. For me it had a bad effect and I threw the remaining product away.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers question the list of ingredients, but most facial washes have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients. Just because they sound weird, doesn&#x27;t make them bad. So unless you&#x27;re a chemist or a dermatologist, don&#x27;t assume that it&#x27;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least one reviewer gave the product bad marks because you can&#x27;t put it around your eyes. Lots of facial soaps/cremes make similar warnings. That doesn&#x27;t make this a lousy product. It&#x27;s not called, \\&quot;Eye cleaner\\&quot; or \\&quot;Eye moisturizer.\\&quot; It&#x27;s for the face. While the eyes are part of the face, it&#x27;s a special part that is super sensitive, which is why there are special products just for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is quite good and delicate. Is it the best thing ever? No, but I&#x27;m happy with it and probably most people would be too.</li>
            <li> This product is impressive.  Silky smooth, very, very, light pleasant fragrance (almost undetectable), not oily or greasy, not drying.  Left my skin feeling clean, moist, and refreshed.  I have a difficult time finding products that do not irritate my skin.  This did not cause any irritation, itching, burning, redness... nothing.  Just clean.  I will most definitely be looking for this product on the market.</li>
            <li> I purchased a tube of this face wash on closeout at my local store.  It&#x27;s just as well the store won&#x27;t be carrying it any longer because I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.  The cleanser is a thick, creamy gel that is hard to squeeze out of the tube.  It only lathers a little, so it&#x27;s easy to rinse off.  This face wash doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin and leaves it squeaky clean.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up, so I don&#x27;t know if this wash can clean off cosmetics.  I would prefer a bit more moisturizing in my face wash, though.  I just can&#x27;t get over the strange smell - it reminds me of lemon furniture polish.  I don&#x27;t see lemon listed anywhere on the ingredients list, but lemon seems too harsh on the skin, even if it&#x27;s only something else that smells like lemon.</li>
            <li> There are only a few things I&#x27;m brand loyal to. I only use dove soap and I&#x27;ve been using Clinique facial products for as long as I can remember. Nonetheless, I decided to give Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash a try. Why not!? The product worked OK. Nice texture and all but at the end of the day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer my Clinique.</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser to be quite nice.  It cleaned the oily t-zone area, but did not over-dry my cheeks.  I loved the creamy gel feeling of the product, and didn&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t lather up into big bubbles because it spread easily on wet skin and then washed off without a ton of splashing.</li>
            <li> i bought this product after having success with other simple products. i have normal but very sensitive skin but i am not acne prone, but when a product is too harsh my face will develop a very irritated itchy rash. usally because of this i approch skincare items with caution but because simple clams to be \\&quot;the simple skin experts\\&quot; i used this all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first i noticed a bit of a rash around my eyes thinking it was my makeup i rewashed my face, within a few hours my entire face was was stingy and itchy by the morning one of my eyelids was swollen and my entire face was covered in white bumps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this also broke my sister out who has dry less sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope this was a help full review I have tried many other simple products and this was the only one who had this horrible effect on my skin :)</li>
            <li> This stuff SUCKS. I&#x27;m a 23 year old female with fair, pretty normal skin. I am usually a faithful Purity (along with my Clarisonic) user... But since I am ballin&#x27; on a budget, I decided to give this a shot. They state there are \\&quot;no harsh irritants\\&quot; \\&quot;dyes\\&quot; \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot; that can upset skin. OOOOH really? Why did I wake up in hives? I thought, \\&quot;Okay, It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve switched up my skin care routine... I&#x27;ll give it time\\&quot;. Well, here I am finishing up my bottle and my skin is dry, itchy, flaking, and COVERED in zits. I don&#x27;t blame the pimples on the cleanser, it can be a number of things... But how do you explain everything else? I&#x27;ve purchased 3 bottles of Purity and I&#x27;m never switching again! UGH!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars, I would. I do not have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve never had any problems with any type of face wash in the past. After only 2 days of using this product, my husband approached me and he asked, &amp;#34;Are you mad or something? Your face is all red.&amp;#34; Sure enough, I looked in the mirror and I had a bright red rash all over my face. DO NOT USE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  It does not dry out my skin; instead it leaves it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week. I have very sensitive skin which is prone to rosacea.  I also have dry skin so finding a product that cleanses without over drying and causing redness is a real challenge.  This product as done everything as promised. My skin is clean without feeling tight and I don&#x27;t have to put an icepack on my face after cleaning to calm down redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; am always looking for a good face wash that will not strip my skin, break me out but will still make it feel clean.  I started using this face wash 2 weeks ago.  I was only using it in the morning, but my skin would feel itchy &amp; dry almost as soon as I washed my face.  I thought maybe it was something else, as I&#x27;ve never reacted like this to a face wash that didn&#x27;t have some kind of acne medication added to it.  I decided to give the face wash a bit more time, but after 2 weeks of using it only once a day, my skin feels scaly, almost as though it was burned, itchy &amp; is blotchy &amp; red.  Obviously I have stopped using it, but am surprised that this is marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this when I found out that I was going to Las Vegas over Christmas, because the air out there dries out my skin horribly (I&#x27;m an East Coast girl) and I was hoping to counter-act that. I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with it. You don&#x27;t need much product to get a good lather, so the bottle lasts a long time. It feels good on my face without feeling harsh or leaving my skin feeling slimy. It&#x27;s a face wash that I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I preface this review by pointing out that I am not an expert on advanced facial cleaning products and most of the time I use mass-market national brands (or store-brand clones) found at various drugstores (Clearasil, Nivea, Gillette, etc). Compared to those, I found this Simple face wash better, softer, less detergent-y, and with a mild pleasant natural-y smell (that as far as I can tell does not stick with you after you complete the face washing). You also use a smaller amount with this.  One of the side effects of face washing is that you occasionally taste the cleaning products, and this has an unwelcome taste but it dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> I am probably the worse person to review skin care product as I really don&#x27;t use it. I am still using the same facial wash that I started using 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t really tried any others.  Wait, that&#x27;s a lie, I have tried others, they just didn&#x27;t make me switch my brand.  And sadly, this can also be said for the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.  It seemed like it was really thick and not all that special.  It felt like I was putting soap on my face and not something that was different than simple body wash.  This Facial Wash was fine, but since I don&#x27;t have a lot I could compare it to, I really didn&#x27;t see anything special about it.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin that is slightly acne prone. I get bad breakouts in my t-zone mostly. I purchased this product in hopes of replacing Proactiv as my acne treatment. I used this product for over a month I would say and I don&#x27;t see any signifcant difference in my skin. It&#x27;s also not very moisturizing either, I washed my face twice a day with this product and was left with that tight dry feeling on my face. So in the end, I would say this is OK but there are better products i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I got a couple bottles of this from a Walmart order I did a couple months back and the wife liked it so we got some more.  I used this for a while and it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again as it seems to clean well and not be very harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times and my skin did feel moister and smoother to the touch.  I haven&#x27;t  used a lot of facial moisturizers, but enjoyed the after effects.</li>
            <li> After deciding to start cleaning my face with a different cleanser and moisturizer, I decided to give the Simple Skincare line a try. Something with the word &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; has to be good for my sensitive face, right? Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the facial cleanser and the moisturizer and I liked it at first. However, after using it for a few days I noticed that my skin was drying out and I was developing a rash underneath my eyes on my cheekbones. The rash was red, raw, itchy, and peeling. It stung too! It looked as if I had a bad bruise on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I realized that the rash came from using Simple, as this was the only thing that I had been using on my face that was new, I quickly stopped and threw it out. I ended up using zinc oxide and cortisone cream on my face to get it back to normal, as well as switching to Neutrogena products which have worked wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something inside of Simple that isn&#x27;t so simple. I know I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
            <li> This product gets a two star because a one star would&#x27;ve been tantamount to rubbing Crisco on my skin.  In short, I disliked it greatly.  I purchased this and the lotion.  Very disappointing.  I broke out less when I used a plain bar of hotel soap.  It didn&#x27;t cause pimples, but it sure as heck did nothing to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I like this facial wash because it is easy on sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Plus the price is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months and it does not do anything for me. It dries my skin and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for acne problems. I cannot even use this more than once a day it&#x27;s so drying. I&#x27;m going to buy burts bees face wash to see if that helps me. This product is a Walmart gimmick</li>
            <li> I have decided to go with non toxic skin care.... [...]&lt;br /&gt;Please check out the site and learn more about what we are putting on our bodies not just in them.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for the first time earlier this year. I have dry, sensitive skin that only occasionally breaks out. It is hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t have acne treatment (DRIES my skin out), mini scrubbies in it (too HARSH for my skin) and isn&#x27;t expensive. I picked this up, since it was labeled MOISURIZING and it only contains &amp;#34;skin loving ingredients.&amp;#34; I LOVE this facial wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and my face feels clean after using it. Amazon sends out a pack of 2 and is cheaper than my local stores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the look and feel of this gel (it&#x27;s a semi-opaque whitish goop that is, let&#x27;s say, unpleasant to put on my face) but I could get over that if it worked. I usually expect a few pimples when I change my skin care regiment, so I gave it 2-3 weeks before deciding to throw out the rest of the container. I&#x27;d say I feel like a high schooler on prom night, but not only do I have the zits, my skin also feels really dried out despite this being advertised as a \\&quot;moisturizing facial wash\\&quot; created by \\&quot;sensitive skin experts.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As commented by the other reviewer, this is also not the most \\&quot;simple\\&quot; product, in case that&#x27;s the impression you got by its brand name. It could be that my skin is sensitive to one of these ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff light weight no smell and it does not make you break out</li>
            <li> I have just recently received it and started to use it .  Put seems to work well and leave a nice clean feeling without over drying</li>
            <li> Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash does not irritate my skin, whereas other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin washes have left my skin burning.  However, this product does make my face feel  dry.  I do not have breakouts when I use this wash but I do notice that my skin does not feel moisturuzed after using this product.  Still it does remove make up well and I have not found anything better yet for cleansing my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product yesterday.  I had been a loyal Clinique customer for many years but grew tired of paying department store prices.  The reason I&#x27;ve been such a Clinique fan was because I have very sensitive skin and I itch at the drop of a hat.  Fortunately this great product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  It&#x27;s very creamy and you only need a tiny bit.  The fragrance is also quite nice.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this product because I had heard/read good reviews. I have VERY sensitive skin and have used Cetaphil for 10+yrs but recently felt it was too drying so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. While washing my face it felt fine. But quickly after it was washed off my skin felt hot, my face flushed and I felt like the Mohave desert. I rarely wear moisturizer because I&#x27;ve never been able to find something calming, hypo-allergenic and non clogging to help me. I really wanted this product to work. I gave it one more chance, just thinking maybe I might have had shampoo or something on my hands the first wash. But today, after the second wash I feel like my face is on fire and I so dry I want to cry. My skin is blotchy with red spots all over. This happens with most products that have too harsh of chemicals and they burn my face. Simple my butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE of this product if you too have very sensitive skin! It should be called Simply Acid!</li>
