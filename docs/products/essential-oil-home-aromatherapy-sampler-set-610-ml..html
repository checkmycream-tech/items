            <li>I like some of the smells better than others but they are all of high quality and nice.</li>
            <li>These pure essential oils are excellent!  </li>

            <li>As soon as i called the plant life customer service they were friendly and send me my two more samples really fast.</li>
            <li>These oils also seem to be pure and potent.  </li>
            <li>i love them so much.</li>
            <li>Love them all really.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on something that I might not like or even be able to do.</li>

            <li>It IS a good price for 6 oils and they all did smell exactly as I expected them to.  </li>
            <li>To me it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh-</li>
            <li>it is more over baring, but it might be that I am not use to the smell of a natural sent or something.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very pure smelling.  </li>
            <li>few drops of lavender oil in my bath last night sent me into one of the best sleeps I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
            <li>, the oils are quite potent -- this is a great value for your money especially if you&#x27;re not sure about how the oils</li>
            <li>the oils smells very intense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are immediately recognizable as the smells advertised.   </li>
            <li>I have used them theraputically with very satisfactory results!    </li>
            <li>These smell great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I&#x27;m now hooked: these are very long-lasting, pure oils without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s high praise!</li>
            <li>Oooh, and a couple of drops of the orange oil in the rinse cycle while washing towels today made the whole load -- and laundry room -- smell</li>
            <li>I guess for the price that I could not expect much</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much use for the others at the moment.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and no bottles leaked.</li>
            <li>The oil samples are Eucalyptus, Peppermint (not good smells to use for your house), Tea Tree ( smells \\&quot;icky\\&quot;), sweet orange, lavender, and rosemary (they smell OK).</li>
            <li>B000W3V6US Lemon 100% Pure Essential Oil -10 ml]]</li>
            <li>The only thing that really stands out is the lavender sent.</li>

            <li>It was just enough for my soaps to add a little fresh smell.</li>

            <li> I ordered this set to use in homemade room cleaning products, body oils and bath salts. Initially, I&#x27;d anticipated that I&#x27;d only like the orange and perhaps peppermint oils, but figured I&#x27;d give the others a try. Let me just say that I&#x27;m now hooked: these are very long-lasting, pure oils without being overpowering. Now I&#x27;m looking for all sorts of reasons to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops of lavender oil in my bath last night sent me into one of the best sleeps I&#x27;ve had in a while. I made an all-natural mosquito repellent spray by combining 10 drops each of peppermint, rosemary and tea tree oil in a spray bottle filled with 8 oz. of water. Sprayed on every 20 minutes it kept me from getting any bites last night, and considering how thick the mosquitoes on summer nights in Kansas, that&#x27;s high praise! Oooh, and a couple of drops of the orange oil in the rinse cycle while washing towels today made the whole load -- and laundry room -- smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very pure smelling.  Its not like you bought a vanilla candle and after 5 hours of burning you kind of think.  Hmmm... it sort of smells like... Wait... Yup it smells like vanilla in here \\&quot;i think\\&quot;.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are immediately recognizable as the smells advertised.   &lt;br /&gt;She loved them...</li>
            <li> I put essential oil on a cloth taped to the inside of my diaper pail.  Now every time I open it a nice scent goes into the air rather that what one would expect the diaper pail to smell like.</li>
            <li> I bought these oils to use in my Homemedic air revitalizer. It originally came with Brethe scents but the replacements were amazingly costly. I thought I would try these oils and see what transpired. I guess for the price that I could not expect much but they were just average at best.  It IS a good price for 6 oils and they all did smell exactly as I expected them to.  They just did not work that well at deodorizing the room. The scent would last about 10 minutes and then it would just evaporate. Perhaps I should work on different combinations or different dilutions and see how well that works. But for now, just using a few drops right into the water, it is nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> Good high quality product. I like some of the smells better than others but they are all of high quality and nice.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and recieved it quickly and with a surprise sample of lotion as well. I adore most of the scents and have been using them in my home a lot. I&#x27;ll probably re-order the sweet orange oils as that is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Got this to try the Tea Tree and Lavender oils.  Don&#x27;t have much use for the others at the moment.  They had leaked a little during shipping but nothing major.  Seller included two samples - lemongrass soap and mint body oil which were wonderful.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my 3rd kit...i love them so much. i have made hair tonics, lotions,baths, etc. the possibilities are endless. I especially love peppermint,spearmint, and lavender. Love them all really.</li>
            <li> It is a good item, but I do not like most of the smells. I didn&#x27;t know what to get so I bought this varity pack. It is a good pack for trying to figure out what you like.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product only problem was two of the sample came open and spilled in the box. As soon as i called the plant life customer service they were friendly and send me my two more samples really fast. I was really pleased with the response i got from them. I would definitely order again. Matter in fact i ordered their candle including some items. Candle is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product was great for me since I am starting out making my own soap etc and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on something that I might not like or even be able to do. The only thing that really stands out is the lavender sent. To me it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh- it is more over baring, but it might be that I am not use to the smell of a natural sent or something. Not sure. Overall, the sample set worked out great. It was just enough for my soaps to add a little fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scents that I get when using the oils.  A subtle, yet true scent fills my house, especially when added to my homemade cleaning products.</li>
            <li> These pure essential oils are excellent!  And the variety--well rounded. I have used them theraputically with very satisfactory results!    This along with a company which gave prompt service--Great! [[ASIN:B000W3V6US Lemon 100% Pure Essential Oil -10 ml]]</li>
            <li> This is a nice variety pack, and a great value for all the basics.  These oils also seem to be pure and potent.  I already made a lovely lavender linen spray, and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with the rest!</li>
            <li> These smell great and last a long time. I mix them with olive oil. It beats buying a bottle of massage oil.</li>
            <li> the oils smells very intense. It&#x27;s almost like a totally different smell than its name. the only one i can identify from the smell is the citrus oil. The rest smells aweful.     I thought of returing it, but counting the shipping cost, then decides not worth it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000K3JJZ4 Essential Oil Sampler- 6/ 10 ml.]]    I bought this for my mom and best friend as a gift.  They absolutely loved it because they got to sample the oils that they would not typically buy on their own.  I also loved it because I saved a ton of moeny buying in bulk.  I would recommend &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about these oils! They have come in handy so many ways  from healing a wound that would not respond to anything else to making me sleep much easier. Should be part of everyones medicine box!</li>
            <li> gave it as a gift so can&#x27;t say anything more about it but it look nice</li>
            <li> I use these oils for making massage oil, and other items.  The pricing was reasonable but there are times I had other fragrances.  These do work well but if you use them directly on your body for perfume, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long as you have to add other oils to help the scent stay longer.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey, but they do go along ways.    I use the orange spice in my dishwasher during its dry cycle, fills the entire kitchen up with the smell of oranges.  The lavender I use in my dryer (I wet a hand towel and place a few drops on the towel)  The grapefruit I haven&#x27;t found a use for yet.  The mints smell great mixed with some of my simmering oils.  I would buy again, but only the scent I needed.  Shipping was fast and no bottles leaked.</li>
            <li> I was looking for oil&#x27;s for Aromatherapy. The smells this kit comes with are not for Aromatherapy. The oil samples are Eucalyptus, Peppermint (not good smells to use for your house), Tea Tree ( smells \\&quot;icky\\&quot;), sweet orange, lavender, and rosemary (they smell OK).</li>
            <li> Great collection -- great variety, the oils are quite potent -- this is a great value for your money especially if you&#x27;re not sure about how the oils smell-- I only hope they come out with another collection with different samples</li>
            <li> The smell was awful. I did not like this product at all. I will not buy again. Not what it says it is.</li>
