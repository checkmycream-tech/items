            <li>Good quality, love the colors.</li>
            <li>I use these for my own hair.</li>
            <li>and I feel like dye brushes are kind of a scam.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and effective and will work great for dying my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice quality &amp; handy</li>
            <li>They are nice brushes.</li>
            <li>Works great.. Spreads better than just using fingers, much better coverage and helps to keep scalp cleaner.  </li>
            <li>so good enough.the color comes off easily off it , it sreads the color nicely</li>
            <li>They make applying dye very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>

            <li>, they look gorgeous, shipped really fast, and work AMAZING!</li>
            <li>those brushes are great to use and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>These are some good quality brushes, super price.</li>
            <li>good price, brush-tips were fair-to-good for dye placement, rat-tail end was cheap &amp; bent easily while trying to seperate/part hair....</li>
            <li>So if you looking for something cheap and not pro, then YES!</li>
            <li>Bristles could be softer and more flexible.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes, which spread the dye much more evenly and thoroughly than I&#x27;ve ever been able to do at home before.</li>
            <li>Also, they washed nicely, so I&#x27;ll be able to reuse.</li>
            <li>:) since there was three brushes I gave one to my mom.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>IF YOU BUY THESE TO USE THEM FOR A WHILE, GET BETTER QUALITY.</li>

            <li>I will be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>But really these work great and look forward to using over and over again.</li>
            <li>I am able to use one bottle of hair dye for my hair.</li>
            <li>unless you have more money to spend on hair dye, go for it.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 brushes.</li>
            <li>I have been box dying my hair for one year and my hair is in really healthy condition.</li>
            <li>But I was noticing that using gloves to apply the color would get on my ends where I didn&#x27;t need it so it would cause more split ends than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than what I ordered:)</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They come in a pack of 3, so if you lose or damage one, you get 2 more. :)</li>
            <li>im glad i bought them</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work well with henna, but they do.  </li>
            <li>Cheap too!</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I used them last night to color my hair and they worked great!</li>
            <li>otherwise, I need to start interacting with people more.</li>
            <li>i love the pointed ends so that it&#x27;s easier to section off the hair.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>and i just loved these brushes, they came in handy and the price was very low for this good product,</li>
            <li>It was a good price and the shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li>No need to wax poetic about dye brushes, although they are kind of cute with those translucent colors.</li>
            <li>They are also decent sized brushes and the colors are great as well.</li>
            <li>and i think i&#x27;m doing a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>and they work just as good as when I first got them.</li>
            <li>They wash out easily and aren&#x27;t losing the bristles, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they hold and apply cream dye easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, and the results are much better.  </li>
            <li>They are great quality and soft!</li>
            <li>For the price, this a great deal on three standard size dye brushes with cool colors and nice indents for gripping.</li>
            <li>They glide over the hair more smoothly than a lot of pricier brands.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very sturdy/ good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It is good for the whole head and highlight.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to use to part hair with during the dying process.</li>
            <li>I tend to lose things really easily.</li>
            <li>them easily for another use</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and it did the job</li>

            <li>The bristles on these brushes are a great length and texture; they are one inch long, and very stiff--it provides good coverage for hair-dyeing/</li>
            <li>Sturdy little brushes that worked perfectly for applying some hair product.</li>
            <li>But you can buy this off of drug stores cheap too</li>

            <li>Great product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Great priced item that doesn&#x27;t fall short on quality!</li>
            <li>I bought these for an extra set of brushes you can never have too many and the work just as good as any</li>
            <li>Very useful when dyeing hair.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel super cheap and they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t fallen out, not too many orange spots ( she&#x27;s a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain, can&#x27;t get too excited about them....</li>
            <li>The colors are super cool and they were easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>They also rinse clean of products after use for storage.</li>
            <li>They clean up well and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Size is nice, not small at all.</li>
            <li>IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR EVERYDAY USE</li>
            <li>Quality good enough for my dyes.</li>
            <li>These brushes worked really well and covered my hair with the dye better than my hands could.</li>
            <li>My old brush bristles were coming out, this set works nicely.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good size too, not tiny or anything.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and still love the colors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The nice stiff bristles held the color very well and the point at the end of the handle was great for separating sections of my hair for color.</li>
            <li>I use these brushes to put on my hair masks because it was much more convenient on getting my roots and such with a brush rather than my fingers. :)</li>
            <li>These work super well, and wash well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I have painted blue dye on the tips of my hair countless times with these, and I just rinse them off with water afterwards and they are still in great condition :) would recommend.</li>
            <li>;  I really like them, they are easy to use and help me a lot when I dying my hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily wash it afterwards and use it the next time with no problems.</li>
            <li>otherwise, good product/as expected.</li>
            <li>These things are dispensable but the bristles are soft and apply an even coverage for highlighting strips of hair on tin or for touching up roots if needed.</li>
            <li>but if you needed that extra 3$ to make the 25$ and more to get free delivery</li>
            <li>The brushes are larger than I expected which was great!</li>
            <li>I have no complaints thus far about this product. :)</li>
            <li>i am not a professional but they are pretty good for using for home hair coloring.</li>
            <li>They also clean off easily, which is definitely nice given how messy henna is.</li>
            <li>it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I ended up using one of the brushes twice to color my hair after a quick wash &amp; rinse of it the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to apply purple highlights to my hair, and these brushes are just the right tool to do so.</li>
            <li>Not sure about the durability, but certainly I am happy to have this one.</li>
            <li>the long handle makes a nice flip to make hair line or split hair in sections or to use as a stirring stick for your bleach or dye.</li>
            <li>And they clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Totally cute and totally would buy again.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest running them under warm water and brushing them around a bit to get rid of any loose bristles before using them.</li>
            <li>find these quite affordable, and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER IN OUR VERY FAST AND BUSSY WORLD.</li>
            <li>happy that the brushes got here so quickly, but very hard to use while trying to dye my hair.</li>
            <li>Yup, it looks exactly as the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it works exactly as you might</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>These brushes were exactly what I needed, plus my order arrived way before the date I&#x27;d been told to expect them.</li>
            <li>No issues and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that they come in three different colors.</li>
            <li>Considering how much I paid for these brushes, they are totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re best used for small, short sections like bangs.</li>
            <li>My fault - washed brush in hot water.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as described, arrived promptly, I use them to apply hair dye and they serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li>To soften them up just use a bit of shampoo and apply to the bristles then rub it onto each bristle while you run it under hot water.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>This was my first time dying hair</li>
            <li>We colored her hair with 2 colors that just happen to look exactly like the colors of the handles of these 3 brushes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product recently, It came out more that my expectation as compared to the price I paid.</li>
            <li>It gives an even look and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>But, here&#x27;s the deal: the bristles are good and stiff, enabling you to get the color where you want it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are long enough so it makes it easy to part in sections and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The pointed end makes seperating hair while dividing easier and the brush can hold a lot or a little product on it making it much easier to dye hair quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really small and easy to hold and manipulate...also very light too</li>
            <li>They come exactly as the ones pictured, and I am also happy to have found the pack of 3 for this price because after searching for a while online here at Amazon and elsewhere, I could not find any other seller that offered such a deal on dye brushes!</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and stiff and the little indentation on the top of the brush makes it really easy to hold and keep stable while applying whatever you wish.</li>
            <li>Washed out easily to re-use in the future.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to use when I need to apply deep conditioner to my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that, the bristles were super soft.</li>
            <li>The long tapered end makes it much easier to part my hair and get at the roots, and the brush helps spread the henna much more evenly.  </li>
            <li>Better than the other brushes, saves product  ;-)</li>
            <li>The little pointy end of the brush is nice for parting away hair strands as you brush on the product.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the size....</li>
            <li>but they work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors.</li>
            <li>Much easier to dye your hair.</li>
            <li>Better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>And fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t need 3</li>
            <li>These worked really well.</li>
            <li>Very functional.</li>
            <li>Makes dyeing my kids hair two colors at once much easier.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really distribute the dye through hair evenly.</li>
            <li>These make coloring my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>These brushes really make my coloring easier at home.</li>
            <li>Works really well with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>I use these every time I dye my hair; they make it so much easier to apply the dye than squirt bottles.</li>
            <li>i only used one of them so far, i were able to dye my hair without getting it on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Nice stiff bristles that hold the product as I&#x27;m applying.</li>
            <li>I have used other brushes with better results.</li>
            <li>I picked these up because they looked so much like the ones my stylist uses on my hair when she&#x27;s doing highlights or touching up my dark roots.</li>
            <li>Two of the brushes are still new because i havent had to use them!</li>
            <li>After years of using gloved fingers to touch up color at home, I decided to use what the pros use (more or less).</li>
            <li>the better half has turned me into the salon colorist</li>
            <li>But I would personally recommend using these more for hair extensions or smaller areas of your scalp when dyeing (i.e., hairline, sideburns, side cut area, roots).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I found the tips to be useful, but they do pick up a little more hair than I usually bleach at once if I am highlighting, but that&#x27;s nothing to complain over since you can easily pick the hair you want to dye out and leave the rest.</li>
            <li>The hold together and are way better than trying to use the little bottles that come in hair dye kits.</li>
            <li>Could have been a little more softer.</li>
            <li>Never complained of its quality, will buy them when we will need them.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean loose hairs out of our electric hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff, which helps in combing the dye through your hair and making sure to get every strand, and the plastic handle is not made out of flimsy plastic material.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly stiff to really be able to brush the color through.</li>
            <li>The price was right and I will use them for any any further hair treatments.</li>
            <li>I mean, when a product is cheap but it thoroughly does the job, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li>nice stiff bristles, the only thing is the handle seems like it might snap.</li>
            <li>sure did trim my hair.....was sharp enough...</li>
            <li>Like this soft brush set!</li>
            <li>(it was average,) or because they are cheap</li>
            <li>and I like how there are different sizes as that&#x27;s exactly what I needed .</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first because they looked a little \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It would be cool if they came in more colors though, so there would be less chance of me getting them mixed up with the other students&#x27; brushes.</li>
            <li>So, I looked around Amazon and found these inexpensive Soft &#x27;N Style 3-piece brushes.  </li>
            <li>IT MAY BE MORE MONEY, BUT AT LEAST IT WILL HOLD UP LONGER THAN THESE.</li>
            <li>Soft and efficient.  </li>
            <li>As described, on time or early shipping, and work well.</li>
            <li>but personally I would just prefer to use it straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Its damn cheap and few months into it has done the job every time.</li>
            <li>The Soft &#x27;N Style Brush Set makes hair coloring a breeze.  </li>
            <li>After getting it from brown to blonde, it was ready to color.</li>
            <li>, it was like we had paid a professional to do her hair.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to press down on the hair and apply dye, bleach etc.</li>
            <li>While they aren&#x27;t exceptional, there is also nothing wrong with these brushes, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>They have actually lasted the longest that we have bought so far!!</li>
            <li>I have very curly long hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also a little stiffer than some of my other brushes and I find that I use them more often.  </li>
            <li>I saw some listed here that were for one single brush and over $5 a piece, which is ridiculous, and if you know how cheap these are in a beauty supply store, you&#x27;ll know better than to waste money like that.</li>
            <li>They hold the dye well, are stiff enough to make application precise but soft enough not to irritate.</li>
            <li>These arrived near the last day listed.</li>
            <li>She wanted a few fun colors in it.</li>
            <li>i have to colour just the roots now due to streaaks in my hair, and these do the job really well.</li>
            <li>I used one last night to dye my hair back to a natural color</li>
            <li>The bristles are well manufactured, there is no shedding and they aren&#x27;t bent, so when applying streaks to hair you can run the brush lengthwise down strands and you will get a solid straight line of color/bleach.</li>

            <li> Good quality, love the colors.</li>
            <li> I use these for my own hair.</li>
            <li> and I feel like dye brushes are kind of a scam.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and effective and will work great for dying my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice quality &amp; handy</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes.</li>
            <li> Works great.. Spreads better than just using fingers, much better coverage and helps to keep scalp cleaner.  </li>
            <li> so good enough.the color comes off easily off it , it sreads the color nicely</li>
            <li> They make applying dye very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>

            <li> those brushes are great to use and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> These are some good quality brushes, super price.</li>
            <li> good price, brush-tips were fair-to-good for dye placement, rat-tail end was cheap &amp; bent easily while trying to seperate/part hair....</li>
            <li> So if you looking for something cheap and not pro, then YES!</li>
            <li> Bristles could be softer and more flexible.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes, which spread the dye much more evenly and thoroughly than I&#x27;ve ever been able to do at home before.</li>
            <li> Also, they washed nicely, so I&#x27;ll be able to reuse.</li>
            <li> :) since there was three brushes I gave one to my mom.</li>

            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> But really these work great and look forward to using over and over again.</li>
            <li> I am able to use one bottle of hair dye for my hair.</li>
            <li> unless you have more money to spend on hair dye, go for it.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been box dying my hair for one year and my hair is in really healthy condition.</li>
            <li> But I was noticing that using gloves to apply the color would get on my ends where I didn&#x27;t need it so it would cause more split ends than I wanted.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than what I ordered:)</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They come in a pack of 3, so if you lose or damage one, you get 2 more. :)</li>
            <li> im glad i bought them</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work well with henna, but they do.  </li>
            <li> Cheap too!</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I used them last night to color my hair and they worked great!</li>
            <li> otherwise, I need to start interacting with people more.</li>
            <li> i love the pointed ends so that it&#x27;s easier to section off the hair.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> and i just loved these brushes, they came in handy and the price was very low for this good product,</li>
            <li> It was a good price and the shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> No need to wax poetic about dye brushes, although they are kind of cute with those translucent colors.</li>
            <li> They are also decent sized brushes and the colors are great as well.</li>
            <li> and i think i&#x27;m doing a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li> and they work just as good as when I first got them.</li>
            <li> They wash out easily and aren&#x27;t losing the bristles, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they hold and apply cream dye easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, and the results are much better.  </li>
            <li> They are great quality and soft!</li>
            <li> For the price, this a great deal on three standard size dye brushes with cool colors and nice indents for gripping.</li>
            <li> They glide over the hair more smoothly than a lot of pricier brands.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very sturdy/ good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It is good for the whole head and highlight.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to use to part hair with during the dying process.</li>
            <li> I tend to lose things really easily.</li>
            <li> them easily for another use</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and it did the job</li>
            <li> it makes applying the color really easy.</li>
            <li> The clean-up is easy.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to ask my husband for help!&lt;br /&gt;Great price too and came quickly!</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes are a great length and texture; they are one inch long, and very stiff--it provides good coverage for hair-dyeing/</li>
            <li> Sturdy little brushes that worked perfectly for applying some hair product.</li>
            <li> But you can buy this off of drug stores cheap too</li>
            <li> but this was cheap too.</li>
            <li> Cheap price&lt;br /&gt;too.</li>
            <li> Cheap for the three brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Great priced item that doesn&#x27;t fall short on quality!</li>
            <li> I bought these for an extra set of brushes you can never have too many and the work just as good as any</li>
            <li> Very useful when dyeing hair.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel super cheap and they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t fallen out, not too many orange spots ( she&#x27;s a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, can&#x27;t get too excited about them....</li>
            <li> The colors are super cool and they were easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> They also rinse clean of products after use for storage.</li>
            <li> They clean up well and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Size is nice, not small at all.</li>
            <li> IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR EVERYDAY USE</li>
            <li> Quality good enough for my dyes.</li>
            <li> These brushes worked really well and covered my hair with the dye better than my hands could.</li>
            <li> My old brush bristles were coming out, this set works nicely.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good size too, not tiny or anything.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and still love the colors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The nice stiff bristles held the color very well and the point at the end of the handle was great for separating sections of my hair for color.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to put on my hair masks because it was much more convenient on getting my roots and such with a brush rather than my fingers. :)</li>
            <li> These work super well, and wash well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have painted blue dye on the tips of my hair countless times with these, and I just rinse them off with water afterwards and they are still in great condition :) would recommend.</li>
            <li> ;  I really like them, they are easy to use and help me a lot when I dying my hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily wash it afterwards and use it the next time with no problems.</li>
            <li> otherwise, good product/as expected.</li>
            <li> These things are dispensable but the bristles are soft and apply an even coverage for highlighting strips of hair on tin or for touching up roots if needed.</li>
            <li> but if you needed that extra 3$ to make the 25$ and more to get free delivery</li>
            <li> The brushes are larger than I expected which was great!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints thus far about this product. :)</li>
            <li> i am not a professional but they are pretty good for using for home hair coloring.</li>
            <li> They also clean off easily, which is definitely nice given how messy henna is.</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I ended up using one of the brushes twice to color my hair after a quick wash &amp; rinse of it the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to apply purple highlights to my hair, and these brushes are just the right tool to do so.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the durability, but certainly I am happy to have this one.</li>
            <li> the long handle makes a nice flip to make hair line or split hair in sections or to use as a stirring stick for your bleach or dye.</li>
            <li> And they clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Totally cute and totally would buy again.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest running them under warm water and brushing them around a bit to get rid of any loose bristles before using them.</li>
            <li> find these quite affordable, and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER IN OUR VERY FAST AND BUSSY WORLD.</li>
            <li> happy that the brushes got here so quickly, but very hard to use while trying to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> Yup, it looks exactly as the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it works exactly as you might</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> These brushes were exactly what I needed, plus my order arrived way before the date I&#x27;d been told to expect them.</li>
            <li> No issues and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love that they come in three different colors.</li>
            <li> Considering how much I paid for these brushes, they are totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re best used for small, short sections like bangs.</li>
            <li> My fault - washed brush in hot water.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as described, arrived promptly, I use them to apply hair dye and they serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li> To soften them up just use a bit of shampoo and apply to the bristles then rub it onto each bristle while you run it under hot water.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This was my first time dying hair</li>
            <li> We colored her hair with 2 colors that just happen to look exactly like the colors of the handles of these 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product recently, It came out more that my expectation as compared to the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It gives an even look and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> But, here&#x27;s the deal: the bristles are good and stiff, enabling you to get the color where you want it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are long enough so it makes it easy to part in sections and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The pointed end makes seperating hair while dividing easier and the brush can hold a lot or a little product on it making it much easier to dye hair quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really small and easy to hold and manipulate...also very light too</li>
            <li> They come exactly as the ones pictured, and I am also happy to have found the pack of 3 for this price because after searching for a while online here at Amazon and elsewhere, I could not find any other seller that offered such a deal on dye brushes!</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and stiff and the little indentation on the top of the brush makes it really easy to hold and keep stable while applying whatever you wish.</li>
            <li> Washed out easily to re-use in the future.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to use when I need to apply deep conditioner to my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that, the bristles were super soft.</li>
            <li> The long tapered end makes it much easier to part my hair and get at the roots, and the brush helps spread the henna much more evenly.  </li>
            <li> Better than the other brushes, saves product  ;-)</li>
            <li> The little pointy end of the brush is nice for parting away hair strands as you brush on the product.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the size....</li>
            <li> but they work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors.</li>
            <li> Much easier to dye your hair.</li>
            <li> Better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> And fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t need 3</li>
            <li> These worked really well.</li>
            <li> Very functional.</li>
            <li> Makes dyeing my kids hair two colors at once much easier.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really distribute the dye through hair evenly.</li>
            <li> These make coloring my hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> These brushes really make my coloring easier at home.</li>
            <li> Works really well with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I use these every time I dye my hair; they make it so much easier to apply the dye than squirt bottles.</li>
            <li> i only used one of them so far, i were able to dye my hair without getting it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles that hold the product as I&#x27;m applying.</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes with better results.</li>
            <li> I picked these up because they looked so much like the ones my stylist uses on my hair when she&#x27;s doing highlights or touching up my dark roots.</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes are still new because i havent had to use them!</li>
            <li> After years of using gloved fingers to touch up color at home, I decided to use what the pros use (more or less).</li>
            <li> the better half has turned me into the salon colorist</li>
            <li> But I would personally recommend using these more for hair extensions or smaller areas of your scalp when dyeing (i.e., hairline, sideburns, side cut area, roots).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found the tips to be useful, but they do pick up a little more hair than I usually bleach at once if I am highlighting, but that&#x27;s nothing to complain over since you can easily pick the hair you want to dye out and leave the rest.</li>
            <li> The hold together and are way better than trying to use the little bottles that come in hair dye kits.</li>
            <li> Could have been a little more softer.</li>
            <li> Never complained of its quality, will buy them when we will need them.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean loose hairs out of our electric hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff, which helps in combing the dye through your hair and making sure to get every strand, and the plastic handle is not made out of flimsy plastic material.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly stiff to really be able to brush the color through.</li>
            <li> The price was right and I will use them for any any further hair treatments.</li>
            <li> I mean, when a product is cheap but it thoroughly does the job, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li> nice stiff bristles, the only thing is the handle seems like it might snap.</li>
            <li> sure did trim my hair.....was sharp enough...</li>
            <li> Like this soft brush set!</li>
            <li> (it was average,) or because they are cheap</li>
            <li> and I like how there are different sizes as that&#x27;s exactly what I needed .</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first because they looked a little \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It would be cool if they came in more colors though, so there would be less chance of me getting them mixed up with the other students&#x27; brushes.</li>
            <li> So, I looked around Amazon and found these inexpensive Soft &#x27;N Style 3-piece brushes.  </li>
            <li> IT MAY BE MORE MONEY, BUT AT LEAST IT WILL HOLD UP LONGER THAN THESE.</li>
            <li> Soft and efficient.  </li>
            <li> As described, on time or early shipping, and work well.</li>
            <li> but personally I would just prefer to use it straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Its damn cheap and few months into it has done the job every time.</li>
            <li> The Soft &#x27;N Style Brush Set makes hair coloring a breeze.  </li>
            <li> After getting it from brown to blonde, it was ready to color.</li>
            <li> , it was like we had paid a professional to do her hair.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to press down on the hair and apply dye, bleach etc.</li>
            <li> While they aren&#x27;t exceptional, there is also nothing wrong with these brushes, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> They have actually lasted the longest that we have bought so far!!</li>
            <li> I have very curly long hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also a little stiffer than some of my other brushes and I find that I use them more often.  </li>
            <li> I saw some listed here that were for one single brush and over $5 a piece, which is ridiculous, and if you know how cheap these are in a beauty supply store, you&#x27;ll know better than to waste money like that.</li>
            <li> They hold the dye well, are stiff enough to make application precise but soft enough not to irritate.</li>
            <li> These arrived near the last day listed.</li>
            <li> She wanted a few fun colors in it.</li>
            <li> i have to colour just the roots now due to streaaks in my hair, and these do the job really well.</li>
            <li> I used one last night to dye my hair back to a natural color</li>
            <li> The bristles are well manufactured, there is no shedding and they aren&#x27;t bent, so when applying streaks to hair you can run the brush lengthwise down strands and you will get a solid straight line of color/bleach.</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty hard.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles are too soft; I use them to brush color when coloring my hair but since the brushes are too soft they don&#x27;t work well with my wavy and somewhat thick hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush was a little too wide to fit in the hair dye jar (I use manic panic)</li>
            <li> I have a feeling i won&#x27;t need to replace them for a long time.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but firm.</li>
            <li> it took a very long to come, not really soft, but i guess it still gets its job done .</li>
            <li> -- it allows you to apply dye or bleach in the hard-to-reach areas easier than a short brush, which brings me to this: super short brushes are useless if you&#x27;re planning to dye/bleach a few inches in length of hair.</li>
            <li> Not high quality</li>
            <li> I think these brushes serve their purpose for hair coloring and will do so for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes I did not like, except for the color of the brush handles but for function not really.</li>
            <li> The product arrived around the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> will minimal dye getting on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I use them to apply heavy deep conditioner to my hair and they do the job.</li>
            <li> Bristles hold just enough dye to apply without waste.</li>
            <li> Wide brush head, pleasing colors.</li>
            <li> So for a few weeks she had dark pink, teal blue and violet highlights on the underside of her hair.</li>
            <li> They can also be used for other things, even watercolor painting.</li>
            <li> I can do it myself without the help of other people putting coloring product on my hair.</li>
            <li> They are brushes - so not much to say other than they do the job!</li>
            <li> Wide and hair strands are hard enough to dye by self.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t frayed from use (yet), and I think I can be a little rough</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy enough to hold product and spread it into hair, but they aren&#x27;t uncomfortably hard.</li>
            <li> They look cheap and the quality is really bad.</li>
            <li> brushes work way better than that cheapo piece of crap brush that comes in the hair bleach/dye box.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes would be half the size they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little picky about who does my hair</li>
            <li> One note: they are a little wider than the manic panic 4 oz jar.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were a little stiffer but they still work well the way they are.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few months now, and the bristles have held up well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are fairly firm and 1 inch in length.  </li>
            <li> brush first comes very hard like the bristles are tough!</li>
            <li> so I wanted something stiff but flexible.</li>
            <li> A bit on the stiff side.</li>
            <li> so I usually do it myself</li>
            <li> no more drippy hairline</li>
            <li> After an expensive trip to the salon and having some short lived extensions put in, we decided to just color the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We got a beaching kit and lightened a small section of the underside of her hair.</li>
            <li> It works well on a small portion of hair.</li>
            <li> very stiff , I do nto like this for the price,</li>
            <li> Hard bristles.</li>
            <li> so that was a little inconvenient at times.</li>
            <li> but the product is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> The width is just shy of 2 inches.  </li>
            <li> I gave this item an in-the-middle rating not because the shipping was bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to visit a beauty supply store because of the outrageous prices for just one brush.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> These brushes I did not like, except for the color of the brush handles but for function not really. The plastic bristles are too soft; I use them to brush color when coloring my hair but since the brushes are too soft they don&#x27;t work well with my wavy and somewhat thick hair.</li>
            <li> Yup, it looks exactly as the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, it works exactly as you might imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, It&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li> super easy to use. would buy again!</li>
            <li> they are as described. simple affordable dye brushes. would and probably will buy again.</li>
            <li> Hard bristles. Just what I was looking for though so am happy with it! Not high quality but will do the job for hair coloring at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> What can I say....sure did trim my hair.....was sharp enough...but I really like the size....it&#x27;s really small and easy to hold and manipulate...also very light too</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture. The handle is easy to use to part hair with during the dying process. They don&#x27;t feel super cheap and they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Quality good enough for my dyes. So if you looking for something cheap and not pro, then YES!</li>
            <li> The little pointy end of the brush is nice for parting away hair strands as you brush on the product.  I have had these for a few months now, and the bristles have held up well.  They haven&#x27;t frayed from use (yet), and I think I can be a little rough sometimes when applying product on my hair.  They also rinse clean of products after use for storage.</li>
            <li> I had to get my hair dye brush replaced after using it for several years.  I didn&#x27;t want to visit a beauty supply store because of the outrageous prices for just one brush.  So, I looked around Amazon and found these inexpensive Soft &#x27;N Style 3-piece brushes.  To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first because they looked a little \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  However, after trying one out for the first time, I was highly impressed.  The bristles are stiff, which helps in combing the dye through your hair and making sure to get every strand, and the plastic handle is not made out of flimsy plastic material.  The product arrived around the expected delivery date.  I would definitely order these brushes again.</li>
            <li> Like this soft brush set!</li>
            <li> These are good brushes. I&#x27;ve used them once but they work very well. None of the bristles have fallen out or have bent. I really like the colors. It was a good price and the shipping was right on time. It came when they said it would come. I have a feeling i won&#x27;t need to replace them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good quality, love the colors. Bristles could be softer and more flexible.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes had squished/misshapen bristles from the packaging, I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll flatten/straighten out after being out of the package for a bit...otherwise, good product/as expected.</li>
            <li> These brushes were exactly what I needed, plus my order arrived way before the date I&#x27;d been told to expect them.</li>
            <li> Use these everytime!!!</li>
            <li> After years of using gloved fingers to touch up color at home, I decided to use what the pros use (more or less). Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes, which spread the dye much more evenly and thoroughly than I&#x27;ve ever been able to do at home before. Also, they washed nicely, so I&#x27;ll be able to reuse.</li>
            <li> i bought this to put henna at home for my hair. Make my work neat !!!</li>
            <li> The work just great. No issues and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes if you need some for home dying.  They&#x27;re plastic but sturdy.  Good quality so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles coming out either.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of coloring and dyeing at home and these work great. The bristles are sturdy enough to hold product and spread it into hair, but they aren&#x27;t uncomfortably hard. The pointed end can be used for sectioning hair. The bristles are well manufactured, there is no shedding and they aren&#x27;t bent, so when applying streaks to hair you can run the brush lengthwise down strands and you will get a solid straight line of color/bleach.</li>
            <li> These brushes were cheap yet worked great for my hair dye I put on at home. For that price it can&#x27;t get any better!! :) since there was three brushes I gave one to my mom.</li>
            <li> The brushes worked great for what I needed them for. They are really good for applying color to the roots of the hair will minimal dye getting on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for coloring my daughters hair at home! Wonderful item to have around the house. Worked perfect for coloring roots</li>
            <li> if you color you hair those brushes are great to use and clean up is easy. I love it you would too</li>
            <li> These things are dispensable but the bristles are soft and apply an even coverage for highlighting strips of hair on tin or for touching up roots if needed. But you can buy this off of drug stores cheap too but this was cheap too. Either or it doesn&#x27;t matter but if you needed that extra 3$ to make the 25$ and more to get free delivery it&#x27;s a good addition to your hair dying set.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the long handle makes a nice flip to make hair line or split hair in sections or to use as a stirring stick for your bleach or dye. Just a versatile tool to have to add on with your hair dying order on here.</li>
            <li> Way bigger than I thought they would be but I like them, can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> The colors are super cool and they were easy to wash off. Great product!</li>
            <li> Lot bigger than I thought they would be. I thought the brushes would be half the size they are. Hopefully they will work well when I put the streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li> IF YOU BUY THESE TO USE THEM FOR A WHILE, GET BETTER QUALITY. IT MAY BE MORE MONEY, BUT AT LEAST IT WILL HOLD UP LONGER THAN THESE. THERE TOO FLIMSY AND BROKE AFTER A COUPLE OF USES.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes an my daughter as well. Much easier to dye your hair. Would recommend this to anyone. Cheap price&lt;br /&gt;too.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this buy</li>
            <li> Better than expected for the price. i have used one brush for three hair color applications already and no bristles have come out... i&#x27;d say these are a TERRIFIC VALUE for the price! Very happy with my purchase:)</li>
            <li> Pefect! Do their job and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of these brushes.  They&#x27;re wider than some I have had and that is helpful.  They&#x27;re also a little stiffer than some of my other brushes and I find that I use them more often.  They wash out easily and aren&#x27;t losing the bristles, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good price. Cheap for the three brushes. They do the job. Plus, I love that they come in three different colors. I think these brushes serve their purpose for hair coloring and will do so for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Great price! Sturdy little brushes that worked perfectly for applying some hair product. Washed out easily to re-use in the future.</li>
            <li> Perfectly stiff to really be able to brush the color through. I was able to easily wash it afterwards and use it the next time with no problems. It didn&#x27;t fall apart at all. Very pleased with this product for the price!</li>
            <li> Considering how much I paid for these brushes, they are totally worth the money. I mean, when a product is cheap but it thoroughly does the job, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li> great price fast ship</li>
            <li> For the price, this a great deal on three standard size dye brushes with cool colors and nice indents for gripping.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very good brush. My mom loved it</li>
            <li> These brushes are very versatile and great quality.  I would highly recommend these. They make applying dye very easy. I will be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> it is okay,with this price i think it is good.</li>
            <li> Good price and it does work.</li>
            <li> Arrived when it said it would. The pointed end makes seperating hair while dividing easier and the brush can hold a lot or a little product on it making it much easier to dye hair quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> The brushes are larger than I expected which was great! I used a brush to apply a keratin treatment. It was just what I needed. Very glad I got these. The price was right and I will use them for any any further hair treatments. Worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> happy that the brushes got here so quickly, but very hard to use while trying to dye my hair. Too large/wide to try and do multiple colors and not have it smear together. I ended up just having to use my hands instead.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for hair relaxing and it works perfectly. The bristles are the perfect length and I&#x27;m happy it came in a pack cause I tend to lose things really easily. I have no complaints thus far about this product. :)</li>
            <li> the quality of the brushes is very good. for the price we pay for this they are amazingly good. i am not a professional but they are pretty good for using for home hair coloring. one of the best i have purchased.</li>
            <li> I was actually suprised at how well these actually worked; I&#x27;ve dyed my hair a total of 7 times, but this time I was using two colors (manic panic Electric Amethyst and Cotton Candy) so I had to mix them. These brushes worked really well and covered my hair with the dye better than my hands could. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Wide and hair strands are hard enough to dye by self. Would recommend this to everyone who would like to color by yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for the set. I ended up using one of the brushes twice to color my hair after a quick wash &amp; rinse of it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice stiff bristles held the color very well and the point at the end of the handle was great for separating sections of my hair for color.</li>
            <li> worked for what i needed done (keratin straightening treatment)&lt;br /&gt;washed them easily for another use&lt;br /&gt;bristles stayed in tact well</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to put on my hair masks because it was much more convenient on getting my roots and such with a brush rather than my fingers. :)</li>
            <li> Great for at home use and agreat price!</li>
            <li> Worked well in using them to put color in my hair. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My old brush bristles were coming out, this set works nicely.</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes are still new because i havent had to use them! They are great quality and soft! And they clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Totally cute and totally would buy again. But I think all 3 will last me for the next 5-8 years. (I use them like once a month)</li>
            <li> Great for cheaper brushes you don&#x27;t mind staining with hair dye</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Soft and efficient.  Very happy with the product.  And fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t pass up the price and buying in bulk I won&#x27;t need to buy anymore for a while. But really these work great and look forward to using over and over again.</li>
            <li> I needed several of these for a project. They were perfect.</li>
            <li> I use these for my own hair. I&#x27;m a little picky about who does my hair so I usually do it myself bc I have very curly long hair. I will definitely get not or differant sizes if possible. They were packaged well and arrived on time</li>
            <li> This is a great product;)Perfect for coloring hair!&lt;br /&gt;I love how they&#x27;re so bright, so cute:)I am a hair stylist and these work for me!</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes and the colors. I use them to apply heavy deep conditioner to my hair and they do the job. They&#x27;re also very sturdy/ good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I gave this item an in-the-middle rating not because the shipping was bad (it was average,) or because they are cheap (I used them last night and they do the job. I have never tried dye brushes before. I used one last night to dye my hair back to a natural color and I feel like dye brushes are kind of a scam. I am able to use one bottle of hair dye for my hair. I probably would have needed two if I used the brushes on all the hair dye in one bottle. unless you have more money to spend on hair dye, go for it. But I would personally recommend using these more for hair extensions or smaller areas of your scalp when dyeing (i.e., hairline, sideburns, side cut area, roots).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it holds up since I&#x27;ve only used it once. I would have preferred a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> These arrived near the last day listed. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely purchase from this seller again. I love the 3 brushes. They come exactly as the ones pictured, and I am also happy to have found the pack of 3 for this price because after searching for a while online here at Amazon and elsewhere, I could not find any other seller that offered such a deal on dye brushes! I saw some listed here that were for one single brush and over $5 a piece, which is ridiculous, and if you know how cheap these are in a beauty supply store, you&#x27;ll know better than to waste money like that. But, I am happy with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well. I like the length -- it allows you to apply dye or bleach in the hard-to-reach areas easier than a short brush, which brings me to this: super short brushes are useless if you&#x27;re planning to dye/bleach a few inches in length of hair. They&#x27;re best used for small, short sections like bangs. I would recommend this brush set, especially since you get three! I found the tips to be useful, but they do pick up a little more hair than I usually bleach at once if I am highlighting, but that&#x27;s nothing to complain over since you can easily pick the hair you want to dye out and leave the rest. To use the pointed tip, you simply use a weaving-like motion throughout hair (at the scalp) to highlight. These brushes are also very handy for all-over dying.</li>
            <li> As described, on time or early shipping, and work well. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These work super well, and wash well so I can reuse them. I love the colors and they hold and apply cream dye easily. Great value.</li>
            <li> Does the job, well priced.</li>
            <li> I touch up my roots every week. Bristles hold just enough dye to apply without waste. A thorough cleaning takes all of two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: @ 1 year, finally unwrapping brush #2. My fault - washed brush in hot water. Would&#x27;ve lasted longer otherwise. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for those of us who dye our hair at home!  I use mine to do highlights at home with Revlon&#x27;s frost and glow kit.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in store anywhere. So once again amazon saves the day. They are cheap and effective and will work great for dying my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these to mix and to help apply bleach and hair paints I kept one and gave one to my sister and one to my brother these are also great stocking stuffers I will buy more</li>
            <li> Great brushes for applying hair color. I really didn&#x27;t need 3 but this is great deal. They&#x27;re a good size too, not tiny or anything.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great. Get&#x27;s the job done. One note: they are a little wider than the manic panic 4 oz jar.</li>
            <li> I used it to apply my keratin treatment and I loved it. It was easy to use and it did the job</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves all the manic panics and loves to mix them too with these brushes when she feels like it to great effect.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as described, arrived promptly, I use them to apply hair dye and they serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush. It makes it easy to use when I need to apply deep conditioner to my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush first comes very hard like the bristles are tough! To soften them up just use a bit of shampoo and apply to the bristles then rub it onto each bristle while you run it under hot water. After that, the bristles were super soft.</li>
            <li> These appear to be well made and unbreakable.  I wish they had come in 3 different sizes instead of 3 of the same size, but they&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have been box dying my hair for one year and my hair is in really healthy condition. But I was noticing that using gloves to apply the color would get on my ends where I didn&#x27;t need it so it would cause more split ends than I wanted. I decided to purchase a dye brush and I came across these, they look gorgeous, shipped really fast, and work AMAZING! The bristles are really strong and don&#x27;t fall out. it makes applying the color really easy. The brushes are long enough so it makes it easy to part in sections and easy to clean. Great product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good item! ヾ|*ﾟ∀ﾟ*|ﾉ&amp;#34;  I really like them, they are easy to use and help me a lot when I dying my hair.</li>
            <li> They do what they are intended for.  Good Purchase!</li>
            <li> These have lasted me FOREVER. I have painted blue dye on the tips of my hair countless times with these, and I just rinse them off with water afterwards and they are still in great condition :) would recommend.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes are a great length and texture; they are one inch long, and very stiff--it provides good coverage for hair-dyeing/bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;I find these quite affordable, and shipping was very fast. While they aren&#x27;t exceptional, there is also nothing wrong with these brushes, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than what I ordered:)</li>
            <li> These work great for when you are trying to get your roots... but personally I would just prefer to use it straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Arrived within 2 days (without express) and is just as described. I use them to apply relaxers so I wanted something stiff but flexible. Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> These are some good quality brushes, super price.</li>
            <li> Very useful when dyeing hair. I love them.</li>
            <li> These worked really well. But I really only needed one. But oh well the bristles are plastic, so the dye doesn&#x27;t stain them.</li>
            <li> Better than the other brushes, saves product  ;-)</li>
            <li> Very easy to use I was recommended anytime</li>
            <li> good price, brush-tips were fair-to-good for dye placement, rat-tail end was cheap &amp; bent easily while trying to seperate/part hair....i believe i got what i paid for</li>
            <li> These brushes work great. The color washes out with water. So you can reuse them over and over again. They are also decent sized brushes and the colors are great as well.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Spread the dye evenly. Not too hard and not too soft. The bristles don&#x27;t lose their shape and don&#x27;t fall off. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it is meant for so good enough.the color comes off easily off it , it sreads the color nicely</li>
            <li> Great for my salon for the price!! Like the softness and flexibility of the bristles. Also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Three perfectly good dye brushes.  I&#x27;d give them 5 stars, but part way through dying my hair the brush we were using lost some bristles in the dye.  I&#x27;d suggest running them under warm water and brushing them around a bit to get rid of any loose bristles before using them.</li>
            <li> very stiff , I do nto like this for the price,</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they worked great and I like how there are different sizes as that&#x27;s exactly what I needed .</li>
            <li> These are good brushes for dying hair. My only complaint is that the brush was a little too wide to fit in the hair dye jar (I use manic panic) so that was a little inconvenient at times. Otherwise, the brushes did their job well</li>
            <li> Nice 3 pack of brushes, good quality bristles. Easy to use and clean. Very functional. Arrived super fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> No complaints with these.  They were a good price and they do the job.  I like the different colors too.</li>
            <li> Work well. Like the different colors. Strong enough to press down on the hair and apply dye, bleach etc.</li>
            <li> Makes dyeing my kids hair two colors at once much easier.</li>
            <li> Bought these to apply henna in my hair. Nice stiff bristles that hold the product as I&#x27;m applying. These should last me for years.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy, well-made brushes with a 6-inch handle (total length is 8 inches).  The bristles are fairly firm and 1 inch in length.  The width is just shy of 2 inches.  Great buy for 3 brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are just what I wanted! I wanted to apply purple highlights to my hair, and these brushes are just the right tool to do so. They are super durable and the price is very good. They can also be used for other things, even watercolor painting. I&#x27;m so glad I bought them! They come in a pack of 3, so if you lose or damage one, you get 2 more. :)</li>
            <li> This was my first time dying hair and i just loved these brushes, they came in handy and the price was very low for this good product, im glad i bought them</li>
            <li> I bought these for an extra set of brushes you can never have too many and the work just as good as any</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom but what I received was completely different from what was described and shown in the pictures. The pictures show brushes with bristles, but I received brushes with rubber. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do DIY homemade hair tonics, masques, conditioning treatments to assuage my assaulted tresses.  Its damn cheap and few months into it has done the job every time.</li>
            <li> A bit on the stiff side. They didn&#x27;t really distribute the dye through hair evenly. I have used other brushes with better results.</li>
            <li> These make coloring my hair so much easier.  I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work well with henna, but they do.  The long tapered end makes it much easier to part my hair and get at the roots, and the brush helps spread the henna much more evenly.  They also clean off easily, which is definitely nice given how messy henna is.</li>
            <li> These brushes really make my coloring easier at home. I can do it myself without the help of other people putting coloring product on my hair. Definitely a good set of tool if you color the hair yourself. It is good for the whole head and highlight.</li>
            <li> These brushes do their job. I wish the bristles were a little stiffer but they still work well the way they are.</li>
            <li> They glide over the hair more smoothly than a lot of pricier brands.  It would be cool if they came in more colors though, so there would be less chance of me getting them mixed up with the other students&#x27; brushes.</li>
            <li> the better half has turned me into the salon colorist and i think i&#x27;m doing a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out, not too many orange spots ( she&#x27;s a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these brushes work way better than that cheapo piece of crap brush that comes in the hair bleach/dye box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s says a \\&quot;brush\\&quot; but what mine have instead of bristle is a rubber piece. I have no idea how that&#x27;s going to work out but the product is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> Three hair brushes, they did their job well. Seem sturdy enough. The hold together and are way better than trying to use the little bottles that come in hair dye kits. Cheap too!</li>
            <li> Just used my brush this weekend. Like how can use point to separate the hair and then brush the  color in</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dye brushes. What can you say? They hold the dye well, are stiff enough to make application precise but soft enough not to irritate.</li>
            <li> no more drippy hairline</li>
            <li> With these brushes you get what you pay for. They look cheap and the quality is really bad. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying them</li>
            <li> The Soft &#x27;N Style Brush Set makes hair coloring a breeze.  I no longer have to struggle to get the hair color out of a tube or bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I mix the hair color in a plastic dish and apply the hair color to my hair.  It&#x27;s so easy, and the results are much better.  Works really well with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> Since I had to have a set I loved these for their great colors.  They are very sturdy and still love the colors.  They clean up well and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I picked these up because they looked so much like the ones my stylist uses on my hair when she&#x27;s doing highlights or touching up my dark roots. The plan was to use them for doing some colored highlights in my teen daughter&#x27;s hair. She wanted a few fun colors in it. After an expensive trip to the salon and having some short lived extensions put in, we decided to just color the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got a beaching kit and lightened a small section of the underside of her hair. After getting it from brown to blonde, it was ready to color. I used these brushes for both the bleach lightening kit and the Manic Panic colors we put in on the under sections of her hair. Using these brushes and some foil, everything came out perfectly. It looks so good, it was like we had paid a professional to do her hair. We colored her hair with 2 colors that just happen to look exactly like the colors of the handles of these 3 brushes. So for a few weeks she had dark pink, teal blue and violet highlights on the underside of her hair. It looked awesome and these brushes worked perfectly for applying the colors.</li>
            <li> I use these every time I dye my hair; they make it so much easier to apply the dye than squirt bottles.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly applying Redken color gel</li>
            <li> Cheap and amazing, they were so easy to use, exactly how the picture show. i only used one of them so far, i were able to dye my hair without getting it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Great priced item that doesn&#x27;t fall short on quality! Look like a durable brush that looked no different then some of the more expensive brushes. Glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> it took a very long to come, not really soft, but i guess it still gets its job done .</li>
            <li> I got them to help cover my roots when I dye my hair myself.  They were a good value and work fine.  They are brushes - so not much to say other than they do the job!</li>
            <li> good quality for the price, used it to balyage my sister&#x27;s hair. brushes worked perfectly and cleaned out easily.</li>
            <li> IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR EVERYDAY USE THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER IN OUR VERY FAST AND BUSSY WORLD.</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li> I ordered this product recently, It came out more that my expectation as compared to the price I paid. Nice quality &amp; handy what it meant for. Not sure about the durability, but certainly I am happy to have this one.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money!</li>
            <li> You get 3 in this set in jelly like colors. Functional and affordable for your haircolor needs, I purchased these when buying my haircolor.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean loose hairs out of our electric hair trimmers. They work great and are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic, but perfect!</li>
            <li> nice stiff bristles, the only thing is the handle seems like it might snap.</li>
            <li> Helps me dye my hair, that&#x27;s all I ask for.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful and they work great!</li>
            <li> These are perfect: just what advertised, sturdy, and reusable over and over!</li>
            <li> The brushes are a good value for the price. I was hoping for stiffer bristles but I can make these work, and they will make my job easier.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. I used them last night to color my hair and they worked great! It was a lot easier to do my hair then using a comb. I didn&#x27;t even have to ask my husband for help!&lt;br /&gt;Great price too and came quickly! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these to help apply the bleach and developer to my hair.  The bristles are nice and stiff and the little indentation on the top of the brush makes it really easy to hold and keep stable while applying whatever you wish.</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty hard.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my wife. She uses them often. Never complained of its quality, will buy them when we will need them. Durable and works as they should be.</li>
            <li> The best for the price...They have actually lasted the longest that we have bought so far!!</li>
            <li> Looks fine to me..I like it</li>
            <li> They look good, but I was expecting stiffer bristles than rubbery ones.  Haven&#x27;t needed to use them yet ( bought for a cosmetology class).</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but firm. It works well on a small portion of hair. It gives an even look and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> These are just brushes. They work well. Can&#x27;t complain, can&#x27;t get too excited about them.... otherwise, I need to start interacting with people more.</li>
            <li> i have to colour just the roots now due to streaaks in my hair, and these do the job really well.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color brush size for me to use and i like that they come in different colors. i love the pointed ends so that it&#x27;s easier to section off the hair. I would definitely recommend this product to consumers.</li>
            <li> No need to wax poetic about dye brushes, although they are kind of cute with those translucent colors. But, here&#x27;s the deal: the bristles are good and stiff, enabling you to get the color where you want it. The clean-up is easy. It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Size is too big for guys hair</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes. Maybe I missed the size somewhere in the description, but they are bigger than I was expecting. They are 7.5 inches.</li>
            <li> Good product. Wide brush head, pleasing colors. Could have been a little more softer. Will definitely recommend a buy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great Price.</li>
            <li> Works well , and can be used again. Creates an even color throughout hair.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Its been over a year since I purchased them.  I use them to dye my hair different colors 3-4 times a month and they work just as good as when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Works great.. Spreads better than just using fingers, much better coverage and helps to keep scalp cleaner.  Size is nice, not small at all. Just as pictured. Someone said they got rubber ends, not the case, these c are as advertized and pictured.</li>
            <li> Great for applying henna... Great price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for touch ups between salon visits.  Easy to use and the hair parting end comes in very handy.</li>
            <li> these worked great for what I wanted to do (purple streaks) and they are just like the ones my hairdresser uses</li>
            <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
