            <li>I like to get my products fast and this seller is the best.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage for powder (foundation or blush) and washes really clean with Ivory soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>Basically, it is a very cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>After several attempts the use it and a lot of the bristles falling out, we decided it was best to use for the trash.</li>
            <li>the description stated it was a Mac authentic brush</li>
            <li>I saw this item at the MAC counter for way more than what I paid for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Please save up a lil more money and then buy from the online or brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>The fakes are getting better looking now and days(especially</li>
            <li>So use your money wisely and do not buy from any Sellers/Ebayers/Whateverer&#x27;s that are new, have any low/bad feedback about quality, or if you just don&#x27;t feel right about it cuz the price is to good to be true.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the kind they use at the Mac store</li>
            <li>and I always  get free shipping from them.</li>
            <li>My first Mac!!</li>
            <li>not even a minute after I held it in my hand for the first time, that I plopped it on top of my table and it fell apart.</li>
            <li>this product is not that much more to buy the REAL stuff!  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t your face or clients worth it?!   </li>
            <li>Just always do a quick search for their \\&quot;free shipping</li>
            <li>The seller did issue me a full refund.</li>
            <li>Shipping was so quick (thank you seller) and I love how baby soft it feels.</li>
            <li>only this is clearly more than $20 cheaper.</li>
            <li>We do not even know whats its really made with!  </li>
            <li>&quot; You do not have to only get free shipping if spending over fifty dollars like the site says!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>That was a huge RED FLAG!</li>
            <li>Lastly, it seems to be made of cheap materials.</li>
            <li>Look for the real thing in person or look at MACs website to see what it should look like.</li>
            <li>It is a quality brush, and I find that I really like the results I get by &#x27;stippling&#x27; my liquid foundation on with this</li>
            <li>so you might as well buy the real product from there.</li>
            <li>I believe it is authentic, but even if it isn&#x27;t the same brand, the quality is the same and that&#x27;s what matters most especially with how much I saved.</li>
            <li>If it looks to good to be true then its most likely a fake!   </li>
            <li>The price had seemed too good to be true, sure enough it was :(</li>
            <li>the real one is the exact same price on the official mac site.</li>
            <li>it is really soft and it does work</li>
            <li>I finally got my hands on a REAL MAC 187</li>
            <li>Some light fall out of bristles does occur, but nothing heavy.</li>
            <li>It has synthetic (for liquid make up) and natural (for powder) hairs for optimal use.</li>
            <li>First off, it took longer than expected to arrive since it was coming from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP IMITATION!!!</li>
            <li>Next, it wasn&#x27;t shipped in a protective box or anything, but slipped in a plastic pouch, then in a small cheap padded envelope.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quicker applying makeup with this mac 187 brush than it is with a sponge or any other makeup brush out there.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We ordered this brush because it is suppose to be the one the MAC reps use. First off, it took longer than expected to arrive since it was coming from Hong Kong. Next, it wasn&#x27;t shipped in a protective box or anything, but slipped in a plastic pouch, then in a small cheap padded envelope. It was shipped ceritified mail, which means I had be home to receive it, which I wasn&#x27;t, or go to the post office to pick up, which I did during the holiday shipping chaos. Lastly, it seems to be made of cheap materials. The brisltes also did not feel like the MAC&#x27;s and the logo stenciling was sloppy. When my wife started to use it, the bristles started to fall out.  After several attempts the use it and a lot of the bristles falling out, we decided it was best to use for the trash. Basically, it is a very cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> I was unsure how legitimate this was.. it is really soft and it does work but it isnt identical to the mac brushes in the store and my friends brush. soo.. if you can accept that this might be fake then go for it! it still works!</li>
            <li> This Brush is awesome! When I put on my makeup it gave me so much beautiful and full coverage. I thought it would take forever to stipple my makeup on but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s much quicker applying makeup with this mac 187 brush than it is with a sponge or any other makeup brush out there. The seller is awesome! It&#x27;s the fastest delivery I have ever experienced. I&#x27;m going to buy from this seller in the future. Even if another seller sells the same product it doesn&#x27;t matter. I like to get my products fast and this seller is the best. The product is a 10 and the seller is a 10!</li>
            <li> Almost as soon as I opened the envelope I realized something was wrong... and not even a minute after I held it in my hand for the first time, that I plopped it on top of my table and it fell apart. That was a huge RED FLAG! The price had seemed too good to be true, sure enough it was :( I finally got my hands on a REAL MAC 187 and I saw the difference. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP IMITATION!!! Look for the real thing in person or look at MACs website to see what it should look like.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush I purchased! It is a quality brush, and I find that I really like the results I get by &#x27;stippling&#x27; my liquid foundation on with this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &amp; Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Linda ~</li>
            <li> I waited for a couple of weeks to recieve the product and once i did i was a FAKE!!! the description stated it was a Mac authentic brush and it wasnt. The seller did issue me a full refund.</li>
            <li> It works great! It came on time. It&#x27;s exactly like the kind they use at the Mac store only this is clearly more than $20 cheaper. Great buy and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted this brush for a while now, but never really got around to get it. i went shopping and found out that the price for this same brush in the store is $60. i came home and order it that day. 5 days later i got my brush.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived on time and I compared it with my friend&#x27;s brush. They looked and felt the same-density included. I believe it is authentic, but even if it isn&#x27;t the same brand, the quality is the same and that&#x27;s what matters most especially with how much I saved.</li>
            <li> I saw this item at the MAC counter for way more than what I paid for it on Amazon. It seems to always be out of stock at the retail counters. Shipping was so quick (thank you seller) and I love how baby soft it feels. Nice coverage for powder (foundation or blush) and washes really clean with Ivory soap and warm water. Some light fall out of bristles does occur, but nothing heavy. Glad I have this in my makeup case!</li>
            <li> This brush can be used for many makeup purposes and gives amazing application!  Checked &amp; 100% Authentic!  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!!!!!! I like how it applies  the powder or when I highlighting or contouring the face as a makeup artist and hair stylist this it the best brush iv used</li>
            <li> My first Mac!! Waow!!! The fiber is uncomparable!!! I&#x27;m so happy to have it!!! And the sensation on my skin in the morning when I apply my foundation!!! It&#x27;s for me the best brush ever!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the MAC 187 DUO brush about two weeks ago &amp; received it earlier then the expected date. When I opened the package I could tell right away that the brushes were fake. I emailed her and insisted I get my money back &amp; she emailed me that SHE decided to send me a \\&quot;free\\&quot; replacement instead of giving me my money back. How is she going to try to decide what to do with my money?! So when I received the second brush it was broken. I emailed her back stating that I DID NOT want a replacement at all I wanted my money back.  She ended up reimbursing my money and I am sending her the brushes back. I do not recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> This is FAKE and I wholeheartedly promise you!!!!   Makeup lovers,   If you think about it... this product is not that much more to buy the REAL stuff!  I mean why \\&quot;waste\\&quot; and throw away any of your hard earned money on fake junk?  We do not even know whats its really made with!  Please save up a lil more money and then buy from the online or brick and mortar stores.  Isn&#x27;t your face or clients worth it?!   So use your money wisely and do not buy from any Sellers/Ebayers/Whateverer&#x27;s that are new, have any low/bad feedback about quality, or if you just don&#x27;t feel right about it cuz the price is to good to be true.   If it looks to good to be true then its most likely a fake!   The fakes are getting better looking now and days(especially the eyeshadows...they no longer have the foam brush section in the bottom of them!)  Oh! and I always  get free shipping from them. Even if I am only spending eight dollars! Just always do a quick search for their \\&quot;free shipping codes\\&quot; You do not have to only get free shipping if spending over fifty dollars like the site says! ;)</li>
            <li> This product was shipped to me, I opened it and the head of it was off of the base. Kinda stupid when I paid 30+ dollars for this brush and its broke... The brush part is great tho. Will see if I can glue and put together</li>
            <li> This product was shipped to me late, I opened it and the head of it was off of the base.</li>
            <li> Everywhere else I have looked for this brush it has been 42.00 and here it was 35. I have always heard awesome things about this MAC #187 brush, so I decided to try it. OH MY GOODNESS this is one of the best brushes I have ever used. It has synthetic (for liquid make up) and natural (for powder) hairs for optimal use. You can use this brush for the entire spectrum of face make up. Its fantastic, picks up make up well and is great</li>
            <li> I don´t realy think that you have a good service, because you haven´t answered any of my e-mail I have sent you asking about my product, which I bought one months ago</li>
            <li> I havent used this brush yet but i&#x27;m letting everyone know the real one is the exact same price on the official mac site. so you might as well buy the real product from there.</li>
