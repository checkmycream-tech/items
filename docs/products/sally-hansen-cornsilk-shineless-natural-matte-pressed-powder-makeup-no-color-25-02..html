            <li>The art work is beautiful and fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always rather liked my freckles.</li>
            <li>This is a nice pressed powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and covers nicely over liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The applicator is kind of a foam sponge, which holds the powder well and spreads on my face nicely.</li>
            <li>I love this powder because it really helps with making your complexion look flawless.</li>
            <li>Most of all it is translucent</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>If it were undue ted it would have been much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it will buy again.</li>
            <li>i used other pressed powder brands for oily skins and Cornsilk is perfect.</li>
            <li>I have ordered from this vendor previously and received excellent service as always.  </li>
            <li>Has an amazing smoothing effect that blurs imperfections much like an app filter.</li>
            <li>product is the BEST one out there for absorbing oil, matting shine, and smoothing imperfections like large pores or wrinkles, while looking completely NATURAL on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>the life of me, I can&#x27;t understand why Coty/Sally Hansen would tamper with this successful formula--not only changing the ingredient list when they DID carry it...but now discontinuing it altogether.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product not available in my area.</li>
            <li>It really takes away any shine, and I love the translucent non-color.</li>
            <li>/matte while perfectly covering blemishes (not too much, not too little).</li>
            <li>Through my research, I was able to ascertain that Sally decided some time ago to completely discontinue the Cornsilk line, but continued to make the NO COLOR version of the product until supplies ran out.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I am glad Amazon offers this.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I was able to find it here on amazon because it is hard to find, where I live.</li>
            <li>This works better than ANYTHING similar out there!</li>
            <li>Sad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores but happy to find it here!</li>
            <li>This powder goes on cleanly and blends into my natural skin color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like makeup to look much like a manican.</li>
            <li>my skin is very oily but with cornsilk seems like porcelain for hours, i&#x27;m appling it 2 times by day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this .  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have as much of a scent as it does.</li>
            <li>Observant longtime users noted that, once the product was sold under the Sally name, the ingredients list changed--the most noteworthy change being that their most touted ingredient, walnut husks, dropped down the ingredients list considerably, and talc, which can be irritating to skin, among other flaws, was now the TOP ingredient.</li>
            <li>I am a sixty year old that still has oily skin, and I am surprised more oil-absorbing makeup is not available.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve never promoted the line very well--I&#x27;ve NEVER ONCE seen a tv commercial for this product.</li>
            <li>So anyone who wants this product back should take a moment to contact Sally Hansen at TalkToUs@cotyinc.com or  1-800-953-5080.</li>
            <li>I put it on over my blush for a natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to wash with a little bit of face wash (way easier than the round cloth-like applicators in some pressed powder).</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why there is SUCH fervor over all the mineral powders that are on the market, like Bare Minerals and Sheer Cover.</li>
            <li>I finally got a response when I mentionedmy reviews here on Amazon, and the considerable response that they were getting.</li>
            <li>and apparently it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps the shine down.</li>

            <li> It keeps the oily areas dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve placed the same review on every Sally Hansen Cornsilk product I can find on Amazon, because I LOVE this product, HATE that it&#x27;s discontinued, and want it back...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of them, and all cake into cracks and crevices TERRIBLY and make the face look MORE aged and completely unnatural...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, the only complaint I have is that it could be a finer powder.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely relieved to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was forced to try other compact powders in the meantime, but nothing works like this one does.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, my various calls were not placed back-to-back, but at random times over the course of a year.</li>
            <li> This is a neat product, but I&#x27;m not happy because I ordered a color</li>
            <li> A real hard to find item.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not happy because I can&#x27;t use this at all!</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;ve given up hope that we&#x27;ll ever see this product again. :(</li>

            <li> Not what I expected.  Seemed to dry out my face. Wont order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve placed the same review on every Sally Hansen Cornsilk product I can find on Amazon, because I LOVE this product, HATE that it&#x27;s discontinued, and want it back...we all need to contact Sally Hansen and demand the product comes back~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was discontinued for a while, somewhere around 2006 or 2007-ish. I&#x27;ve done some considerable reading on other message boards on this product, as well as having contacted Sally Hansen itself. What I learned was that the product had been discontinued back in that &#x27;06-&#x27;07 time period shortly before Cornsilk&#x27;s manufacturer, Coty, had acquired Sally Hansen. Once they did that, they decided to move their Cornsilk line over to the Sally Hansen label, and began selling it again, as a Sally product. Observant longtime users noted that, once the product was sold under the Sally name, the ingredients list changed--the most noteworthy change being that their most touted ingredient, walnut husks, dropped down the ingredients list considerably, and talc, which can be irritating to skin, among other flaws, was now the TOP ingredient. Despite this disappointing change, this new product was nevertheless STILL better than any other facial powder on the market by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it appears the product is discontinued again. Sally no longer makes it. Through my research, I was able to ascertain that Sally decided some time ago to completely discontinue the Cornsilk line, but continued to make the NO COLOR version of the product until supplies ran out. They finally stopped making the product around the end of 2008. So all the Cornsilk you&#x27;ll find out there now are from businesses that specialize in discontinued make-up, or stores that buy discontinued lots, like Big Lots or the like. This is why the product is now suddenly much harder to find, and a LOT more expensive than it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile...there is NOTHING else like it on the market. I really don&#x27;t understand why there is SUCH fervor over all the mineral powders that are on the market, like Bare Minerals and Sheer Cover. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of them, and all cake into cracks and crevices TERRIBLY and make the face look MORE aged and completely unnatural...NOTHING like what they seem on TV.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the BEST one out there for absorbing oil, matting shine, and smoothing imperfections like large pores or wrinkles, while looking completely NATURAL on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the life of me, I can&#x27;t understand why Coty/Sally Hansen would tamper with this successful formula--not only changing the ingredient list when they DID carry it...but now discontinuing it altogether. They&#x27;ve never promoted the line very well--I&#x27;ve NEVER ONCE seen a tv commercial for this product. But it&#x27;s a gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they reconsider their decision and bring the product back to the market. Maybe if enough consumers protest...on one board that I read, a consumer who had contacted Sally mentioned that the Sally rep was keeping a list of names and numbers of those requesting that the product is reincarnated, and perhaps if enough requests are made, they&#x27;ll reinstate the product. So anyone who wants this product back should take a moment to contact Sally Hansen at TalkToUs@cotyinc.com or  1-800-953-5080. Perhaps a grass roots effort is what is needed to return this product back to the shelves. I&#x27;d let Sally know that if they only MARKETED the darned product, the customers would buy! If you&#x27;ve never used this product before, just give it a try--you&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 02/23/2011: On the several occasions I tried calling the customer service number for Coty, I got a msg that said their customer service department was unavailable while in training. Interestingly, my various calls were not placed back-to-back, but at random times over the course of a year. They must do a lot of training there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote customer service once, but got no answer back, and wrote again recently. I finally got a response when I mentionedmy reviews here on Amazon, and the considerable response that they were getting. Please see the comments for this review to read the letter sent to me. At this point, I&#x27;ve given up hope that we&#x27;ll ever see this product again. :(</li>
            <li> I was having some panic attacks when I couldn&#x27;t find this powder anymore in any of my local stores. I was extremely relieved to find it on Amazon! I was forced to try other compact powders in the meantime, but nothing works like this one does. It keeps the oily areas dry/matte while perfectly covering blemishes (not too much, not too little). I don&#x27;t like makeup to look much like a manican. I&#x27;ve always rather liked my freckles. This works better than ANYTHING similar out there!</li>
            <li> i used other pressed powder brands for oily skins and Cornsilk is perfect. my skin is very oily but with cornsilk seems like porcelain for hours, i&#x27;m appling it 2 times by day. Its a great product that i would recomend.</li>
            <li> This powder goes on cleanly and blends into my natural skin color. I put it on over my blush for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I love this powder because it really helps with making your complexion look flawless. Most of all it is translucent so it is awesome for any complexion. I am so happy that I was able to find it here on amazon because it is hard to find, where I live.</li>
            <li> This is a neat product, but I&#x27;m not happy because I ordered a color and it turns out to be almost white!  So, I&#x27;m not happy because I can&#x27;t use this at all!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. Does not clog pores. It has a fine finish that provides perfect coverage. The corn powder soaks up oil leaving skin flawless looking. A real hard to find item. I only found it here. It does not make your make up looking caked on. Colors match perfectly. Great for oily skin and any skin with imperfections. You cannot beat the price either.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember it back in the 90s! Sad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores but happy to find it here! Has an amazing smoothing effect that blurs imperfections much like an app filter. Keeps oil away all day. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Good stuff I wish they had not discontinued it because it wirks really good and gets rid of shine on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Best compact powder I have ever used.  Hope I can continue to get it.  Thanks for offering this .  Terri</li>
            <li> This is a very good product not available in my area. Great value and color matches have always been perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, the only complaint I have is that it could be a finer powder.  I am a sixty year old that still has oily skin, and I am surprised more oil-absorbing makeup is not available.  I suppose the youngsters must not suffer from oily skin/hair anymore!  At any rate, I am glad Amazon offers this.</li>
            <li> This powder was discontinued several years ago. It was the only powder that controlled my oily complexion. Wish Sally Hansen would bring it back.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> So happy I can still get my Cornsilk!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have as much of a scent as it does. If it were undue ted it would have been much better.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this vendor previously and received excellent service as always.  The art work is beautiful and fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered it. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a summer must, if you have oily skin. I use it sparingly in the &amp;#34;T Zone&amp;#34; ... works great.</li>
            <li> I love it. I used to use it all the time and apparently it was discontinued.  It really keeps the shine down.</li>
            <li> This is a nice pressed powder. It&#x27;s lightweight, and covers nicely over liquid foundation. It really takes away any shine, and I love the translucent non-color. The applicator is kind of a foam sponge, which holds the powder well and spreads on my face nicely. It&#x27;s also super easy to wash with a little bit of face wash (way easier than the round cloth-like applicators in some pressed powder). Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again.</li>
