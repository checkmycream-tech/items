    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Happy shaving!</li>
            <li>He said the Merkur blades were the best out there.</li>
            <li>You will get the best shave of your life.     </li>
            <li>Precision engineered and beautifully crafted in Germany, this razor shines!  </li>
            <li>Happy shaving!</li>
            <li>I got a shaving brush,  shaving soap, and used my Safety Razor which worked but still not the  best.  </li>
            <li>Best shave</li>
            <li>The blade is perfectly aligned every time.  </li>
            <li>Your milage may vary, but the Merkur blades are not the best.  </li>
            <li>The handle could be a bit longer, but this razor is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>I looked at all reviews on amazon on all the razors and come to find out that the Merkur model is the best razor.</li>
            <li>As you slid the cartridge-razor over your youthful, silken face, the hair just seemed to glide away with the razor and you were very happy with that.  </li>
            <li>I bought the inexpensive Tweezerman brush, Tom&#x27;s of Maine cream, and the Derby blades, and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>but I feel compelled to praise this excellent razor.</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t be the greatest shave in the history of man.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome shaver!</li>
            <li>and this is a great shaver to do it with!</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome!</li>
            <li>It comes with one blade from the manufacturer, but grab a multipack to see which ones you like best.  </li>
            <li>For the best shaving experience get a shaving brush and some soap.</li>
            <li>This a wonderful razor that I would recommend over and over again to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with the shave.  </li>
            <li>Excellent starter safety razor for the price.</li>
            <li>For me, the quality of the shave from the HD is absolutely superb.</li>
            <li>And it is the best shave</li>
            <li>I am completely happy with this razor!</li>
            <li>I bought it for my son and he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>You can get a very good shave</li>
            <li>-Blades are incredibly cheaper.</li>
            <li>-Using soap is great and probably the best part of the process.  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Beautiful simplicity.</li>
            <li>But it is a beautifully balanced razor.</li>
            <li>All metal construction, looks very handsome, no slip handle, great angle of razor to skin for excellent shave.</li>
            <li>The quality and finish are great.</li>
            <li>Again I am happy with Amazon reviewers and I am  one too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For a great shave, unlearn your Mach3/Fusion holds.</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>Quality product, great shave.</li>
            <li>Happy shaving.</li>
            <li>Everything has worked out great.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing all this stuff, but it has worked out great.  </li>
            <li>I have happily used Gillette, Merkur, Personna, Walgreen&#x27;s, Wilkinson blades.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for a close shave and to keep that beard neat like barber did it.    </li>
            <li>I also purchased the 1904 replica for myself - I figured if it worked so well for the guys, it might work great for the girls.</li>
            <li>Got this after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Just a great razor.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I attribute this to GREATLY reduced irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li>great shave.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some great things about safety razors.</li>
            <li>Looks great too</li>
            <li>(I found that I like Feather the best), a good shaving brush (some good options here on Amazon -</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Much better of a shave then the newer cartridge types!!</li>
            <li>This Merkur is very nice.</li>
            <li>The weight of this instrument is great in the hand, and the build is impeccable.  </li>
            <li>How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not, in some way, improved?  </li>
            <li>Good for beginners or experienced.</li>
            <li>You can keep your Gilette Mach 24 vibrating, moisturizing, battery operated, turbo charged, multi-colored, shaver with replacement blades that cost more than a happy hour beer!</li>
            <li>After these steps you&#x27;ll be on your way to a great shave and can put more time into shaving rather than reading about products!</li>
            <li>And as any good tool, it \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; in your hand when you shave.</li>
            <li>Use a good razor blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of good quality steel,with a hefty feel.</li>
            <li>The shave quality is good, but temper your expectations.  </li>
            <li>You just have to put up with it if you want a good shave though and think about the end result.    </li>
            <li>Good luck on your shaving journey.     </li>
            <li>weight of the body feels good in your hands</li>
            <li>I recommend you get some good shaving cream.</li>
            <li>A good aftershave balm.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, this is a fantastic razor and the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>an inexpensive pack of merkur razors, and some good shave</li>
            <li>Good balance of comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li>Been using the cream and brush with my Gillete Fusion with good results.</li>
            <li>Well balanced and really good shave.  </li>
            <li>Get a good styptic pencil, and maybe some hydrocortison cream.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Chrome finish on the Edwin Jagger is definitely superior, but the finish on the Merkur is still good (time will tell).</li>
            <li>disposable razor industry sold us a bill of good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently using it with Astra Superior Platinum DE blades, after using Derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most others, I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years, I had to buy the latest, greatest design in razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this razor for 6 months now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My son is very pleased with the effortless saving experience.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this after 6 months.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, looks good.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s all metal construction gives it more weight than those plastic disposable razors I take with me on trips), still has that great easy surface grip handle, and with the Mekur blade is a joy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>The results are so much better!</li>
            <li>This one is so much better!</li>
            <li>First the razor: Excellent craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>they are cheap and give you a great shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Men have been shaving for hundreds of years and they didn&#x27;t need to shell out that kind of money.</li>
            <li>Pleased with what I saw, I placed the order through Amazon saving a good 25% of the cost, even with shipping.  </li>
            <li>Let the razors own weight do the shaving.</li>
            <li>It takes almost no effort at all to be honest.  </li>
            <li>razor is a nice addition to my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Edwin has nice plating and appearance.</li>
            <li>Nice product indeed.</li>
            <li>I was a bit spectacular about this razors.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get good blades.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave without stripping my skin.</li>
            <li>Very well made and a great investment !</li>
            <li>The shorter length allows you to manipulate the razor without bumping into your own hand.</li>
            <li>I own an Edwin Jagger DE89 safety razor and decided to try the Merkur HD as well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it, yet it&#x27;s not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very, very good; not too aggressive, just right.</li>
            <li>Overall a very popular safety razor that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent rendition of the classic safety razor.</li>
            <li>This classic way of shaving has been a perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have found it easy to use and of good quality.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I just let it slide, with it&#x27;s own weight on my face and</li>
            <li>If you want a good, cheap shave.</li>
            <li>Now, I get near perfect shaves every time.    </li>
            <li>Wow, this a great razor !</li>
            <li>The finish was beautiful, everything fit precisely together.</li>
            <li>Oh, the myth that DE shaving makes shaving fun or that you&#x27;ll want to do it every day more is bunk!!</li>
            <li>-The razor is very good, but I think some of the reviewers may be overly influenced by their desire to believe the razor is better than it really is.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE safety razor, and it has been great.</li>
            <li>and I had a great first shave with it.  </li>
            <li>This is one fine razor!  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a good start for a safety razor!</li>
            <li>The blade is easy to change and I can get a nice, close shave with this unit.  </li>
            <li>The shaver has a nice balance and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It still works great for a guy with large hands.  </li>
            <li>It feels very good on your skin and is far preferable to canned shaving cream.    </li>
            <li>Now, about 3 weeks later, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>and they got by ok.     </li>
            <li>and I love using it,</li>
            <li>because more material is used and its more of a specialty item but that is not the case, makes you wonder if the $40 price is inflated some.  </li>
            <li>Many decades ago in the USA streetcar tracks were ripped out in cities all across the country and replaced with buses.</li>
            <li>, I find they are better than the Merkur blade that comes included, but that&#x27;s another review.</li>
            <li>I found one in an upscale shaving boutique store in one of Atlanta&#x27;s more prestigious malls in Buckhead.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t know any better.</li>
            <li>Be warned that these will take more time to shave with.  </li>
            <li>My wife said my result is better.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Even better, you can find 100 \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; brand replacement blades online for around $15.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many shaving systems and nothing beats this.</li>
            <li>For closeness and ease of shaving the sensor was just much, much better.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Remember: the blade you put in it is even more important than the razor!  </li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t forget to dispose of your blades safely by putting them into the back-side of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>How many shaves would that be?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more the blade you choose to use in the end</li>
            <li>and how many passes you do.</li>
            <li>You can also experiment with how many fingers you use to hold the razor.</li>
            <li>You can get used to a shaved face feeling which can in effect make you want to shave more often though.</li>
            <li>most likely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And because this is fulfilled by Amazon, packaging is great and shipping is fast, as always.</li>
            <li>One pass with the grain for most is the way to go</li>
            <li>Either way, I would gladly recommend this razor to any friend, guy or girl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>- it beats my Norelco Reflex to shreds, and is also better than the venerable Gilette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you want to rush through shaving and just get it over with then stick with an electric that can&#x27;t take your face off like this thing can :-)</li>
            <li>is in much better condition then when using the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>The merkur blades were okay</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent razor.</li>
            <li>I was, like many people looking into this, a skeptic.</li>
            <li>This in-turn is much better on the enviroment with no plastic parts and lower amount of trash.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>My face is OK, just one nick on my chin.</li>
            <li>and I concur with many of the remarks made by the gentlemen.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that about the many disposable and cartridge razors I have used over the years, too many cuts to count.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used this type of razor for twenty-five years and says that there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>Ok about 10 or so.  </li>
            <li>Once with the grain and then once more after relathering.  </li>
            <li>It seems more \\&quot;strictly</li>
            <li>business\\&quot; than the more cosmetic 38c.  </li>
            <li>If you want something more substantial and aesthetic, buy the 38c.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a more enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>One blade is truly better than 3.</li>
            <li>so plan appropriately.  </li>
            <li>The bottom unscrews to release the top cover</li>
            <li>It also saves you money and is better for the environment.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I suppose like most people that have decided to take this route instead.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this safety razor may take longer(8 mins vs 2) but the shave afterwards is always better than any disposable can offer.</li>
            <li>Everybody points to the Merkur as the top dog.</li>
            <li>A good safety razor is both functional and economical.</li>
            <li>All in all more</li>
            <li>Sleek and stylish, thought it woulda been longer</li>
            <li>Thinking of perhaps maybe buying the HD gold version:)</li>
            <li>yourself a big favor and get a blade sampler pack to see which razor blade works best for you</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor that I have purchased and have loved it more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>The opening mechanism is machined perfectly, and is easy enough to work with, although I&#x27;m tempted to try one of the \\&quot;butterfly\\</li>
            <li>The screw-on top secures the razor perfectly and lets me worry about my shaving skills and not about the blade coming loose.  </li>
            <li>If you want a new shaver to pass to your grandchildren, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>The overall weight is good, heavier than a disposable system razor, but if you want something hefty, look for the HD models, which are a good deal heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After learning to take my time and be more careful I discovered that the Merkur gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Merkur after reading lots of great reviews, and because I have a nostalgia for old fashioned things.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade</li>
            <li>The primary reasons relate more to comfort than to blood loss, although both are valid concerns.  </li>
            <li>It feels good just to hold it, unlike those modern plasticky shiny Gillette handles.</li>
            <li>Cool!     </li>
            <li>this is not bad for a five years supply!  </li>
            <li>It cleans up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Changing blades is easy because it&#x27;s a two piece razor, and you just have to unscrew the head by turning the knob on the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>So, the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys (based on the reviews), but it isn&#x27;t for every beard.  </li>
            <li>A good shaving brush (Kingsley is the brand I bought, genuine badger hair for a reasonable amount of money).</li>
            <li>No on DE shaving in general: This is my first experience with DE shaving and it has been great!</li>
            <li>Easy to transport.  </li>
            <li>Easy to load.</li>
            <li>I did not cut myself and found it to be easy to learn to shave with.  </li>
            <li>it seems to be much smoother and more effective than a quatro or mach 3.</li>
            <li>and I got a nice, easy shave out of it the first time I tried.  </li>
            <li>But then I got some nice Wilkinsons and the whole experience was transformed: smooth, quick, and effective.    </li>
            <li>Wow, what an amazing difference!  </li>
            <li>It does a fine job of holding the blade and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of the razor and it makes me feel like a true gentleman.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After lathering up and assembling the razor with one of the Derby Extra blades, I had a very smooth and pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I use the derby blades, they work fine.</li>
            <li>For me, the size of the model 178 is just fine</li>
            <li>I love this razor super close shave, just have to be carful, don&#x27;t apply pressure just let the weight of the razor do the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a little bit longer to shave, but this is easily the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Wonderful first DE razor - not too aggressive and heavy for a nice shave.</li>
            <li>I can get a really smooth shave, closer than I&#x27;ve ever had, including in the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas like the neck.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it does not shave as close as the modern cartridges, so technology has moved on.</li>
            <li>Want a smooth shave that won&#x27;t take off your face?</li>
            <li>After a month or so of using these products your skin will look fantastic.</li>
            <li>The grip is comfortable and won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still keep a modern razor handy for those times when you are in a hurry (or a lot of bandaids and styptic pencils).</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li>And it is cheap to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, there are some important things to learn for this to work.</li>
            <li>They said they always used Gillette brand from the 1950s on and that GEM&#x27;s were the cheap brand of their day.</li>
            <li>And if he travels a lot, it does not come with a case, so consider this [[ASIN:B001O8NCI4 leather travel case]] to secure his razor.  </li>
            <li>but if you desire a closer shave then I suggest re-lather, (which is important for wetshaving) and lightly shave across, not against the grain.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about not getting the Heavy Duty, longer handle, or adjustable; but those concerns are gone and I am very happy with my purchase!    </li>
            <li>Great solid razor.</li>
            <li>Comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>I liked this one so much, I also bought the slant version.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li>-Don&#x27;t go really cheap on blades.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a fantastic razor look no further.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to get the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version (34C HD).&lt;br /&gt;It is a solid product, feels great, and shaves well.</li>
            <li>To learn more on how to get a great shave from this razor, watch Mantic59&#x27;s series of videos on safety razor wet shaving techniques on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Some say Edwin is more gentle and Merkur is more aggressive.</li>
            <li>nice solid construction, light years better than any disposable, and way closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this one, as the weight of the head is just right</li>
            <li>Plan on no less than five minutes for a good close shave from the start of lathering to toweling off.  </li>
            <li>Since its been 3 days since I had a shave, I was excited to experience this close smooth nick free shave.     </li>
            <li>I bought this as my first blade to get me into wet shaving and must say I am VERY happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>but these kind wont irritate your skin very much at all if you do it right.</li>
            <li>Also, buy yourself a good \\&quot;super badger\\&quot; shaving brush and some Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Down right the best razor I could have purchased.</li>
            <li>This was my first safety razor, and while it gets the job done, there are much better razors out there.</li>
            <li>so be prepared for some healthy razor burn at first.  </li>
            <li>I first started shaving with one of these things many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this, hands down,  to anyone looking for the best shave of their life and a huge cost savings over modern multiblade razors!</li>
            <li>This is for those times when you want to really enjoy a great, close, careful shave.</li>
            <li>razor has a good solid feel and is well balanced, which is important when you are going to cut yourself, if it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even 4-5 multiple good passes doesn&#x27;t get it smooth with the DE.</li>
            <li>I use it 3-5 times a week depending on how often I need to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic (more finally crafted than grandpa&#x27;s shaver) and have been extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Please at the office has stopped to ask me who do i get suck a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I always get clean shaves without any nicks (what would you expect after years of practice?).</li>
            <li>The length is nice because so many razors these days act like massive squeegees.</li>
            <li>The most basic razor ended up becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have now isn&#x27;t with the Merkur or the blade but simply discovering the best was to get those 2-3 places on my neck and jaw line that aren&#x27;t easily shaved.    </li>
            <li>I was originally going to go with a straight edged cut throat razor but the more research</li>
            <li>Hundredth review right now on this product!</li>
            <li>Grandpa had it right all along!</li>
            <li>weight, manufactured to last, and give good clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews on this razor, I decided to get one and found out that I was lucky to get the Merkur HD.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a brush or shaving soap but shave wet with an almond oil-base shaving oil and it works great.   </li>
            <li>And a great beginner razor for those exploring DE wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I learned Merkur is owned by Dovo - a reputable straight razor company located in Solingen, Germany known as the \\&quot;city of blades.\\</li>
            <li>This is a good razor overall.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Short handle but good heft.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know why so many people report having so much difficulty with this razor.  </li>
            <li>You can read the full account here:      </li>
            <li>Get a good badger hair shave brush and soap for the total experience!</li>
            <li>After shave is a must, and a good moisturizer afterwords makes you feel like you just left the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Good and solid feel.  </li>
            <li>First the downsides of DE shaving in general (not this razor) are it&#x27;s slower because it necessitates much more concentration, but that is also a huge part of the enjoyment for me because it makes it much more of a methodical ritual with an even meditative quality.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d head over to WhippedDog and get a $26 silvertip badger!), a good shave soap/cream (I prefer Mike&#x27;s Natural Soaps and Taylor of Old Bond Street Coconut Cream), an alum block (to get rid of razor burn), and a good aftershave balm (like Nivea for sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those wanting a good shave, you will have to spend a little more time than using the multiblade razors.  </li>
            <li>Wow, how close and clean this razor performs!!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bloodless however and it wasn&#x27;t quick.</li>
            <li>Your choice of blade and shaving cream or soap will have more to do with the quality of your shave than the razor itself (Derby Extra blades are my favorite).  </li>
            <li>Luckily, there is help out there.</li>
            <li>and I regret trading a quick cosmetic improvement for my face&#x27;s comfort.    </li>
            <li>Hopefully I will heal quick.</li>
            <li>I just wanted something more substantial, so I sent it back for a refund and ordered a 38c \\&quot;barber pole,\\&quot; which is more to my expectations and liking.      </li>
            <li>This in and of itself makes this a worthy purchase in my eyes.     </li>
            <li>Old school, good look works very well.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wanting a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>If I had all the information on how to get a good shave with a single edge that is now available on the Internet, I would probably still be using my old Schick injector instead of abandoning it many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor and the associated products</li>
            <li>To be honest, my main motivation was the sticker shock of dropping a pack of modern, 3 bladed cartridges into my shopping cart.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily and nicely and I can lay it on my counter to dry without the blade making contact and eventually dulling.  </li>
            <li>Put the new blade in, put the top on and screw</li>
            <li>I like the short handle which makes it very easy to maneuver with, and the thick knurled handle provides excellent grip.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was at Walmart, had Fusions in my cart and left them at the checkout when I realized it was going to cost me $25 for just 6 (or maybe 8) razors!  </li>
            <li>Those things are also fine and will give you a reasonably close shave, providing you have the time to devote to shaving; God help you if you oversleep and look in the mirror with thoughts of doing this \\&quot;quickly.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>the single edge razor is much more effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face nearly as much.</li>
            <li>Although a little intimidating at first, the Merkur is actually very easy to use, and provides a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur worked better than my old Safety Razor I have used since 1957.  </li>
            <li>The solid metal of the razor stays warm from the water while shaving creating a luxurious and relaxing shaving experience.   </li>
            <li>The Merkur DE Safety razor does a good job of holding the blade in place for a wet shave.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the whole experience is just much more satisfying.</li>
            <li>of these Merkur razors is an investment, as mine proves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to shave with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>This razor was worth every penny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>I started using this Razor in July with a wet shave and loved it.</li>
            <li>Now I own several DE&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It takes some getting accustomed to, but once you get it, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth noting.    </li>
            <li>The shave that you will receive using this safety razor is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>handle has knurling, so you get a good grip even when wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;blades are remarkably inexpensive, and extremely sharp!</li>
            <li>&quot; I mean superior to any 4 blade contraption or the latest from Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li>I will just say that my experience with this razor has been very, very positive once I somewhat mastered</li>
            <li>The only one that might be a better choice is the \\&quot;hefty\\&quot; variant of the Classic, but it costs a bit more, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After receiving and loading it with a blade, I became painfully aware of why these things are no longer commonly available on the market, and why I was so glad to see the banded razors come into play.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>This one is well crafted and made right</li>
            <li>If your still wondering about getting this, watch some videos on YouTube to see if its right for you.</li>
            <li>I was fascinated by the mechanism--so much simpler and easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this razor and wrote a full review, complete with day by day descriptions, on my blog.  </li>
            <li>-After 4 years of using it in the shower mostly and not drying it off before storing it head down, the chrome has started to flake a bit on the top curved portion.</li>
            <li>My father turned me onto double edged razor shaving, and once again, the old man proves wise.  </li>
            <li>The grip is wonderful and the razor length is kinda small and old school which is what attracted me in the first place.</li>
            <li>I just received the package a few hours ago and tried it out - Amazing shave!  </li>
            <li>Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades and its the more comfortable shave I can get.</li>
            <li>Whether your new to DE shaving, just shopping around for a new DE razor, or possibly wantiing to gift someone a razor, this is a great razor for any man.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it was so reasonably priced, I was expecting to pay more.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very well made, of smooth stainless steel.</li>
            <li>This nice hunk of stainless steel just feels solid and reliable in your hand, and isn&#x27;t going to degrade with time.</li>
            <li>Then, enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket.</li>
            <li>But remember, the actual blades are just as-if not more-important to make sure you get the smooth, steady shave you are looking for.</li>
            <li>With the initial cost of the safety razor, I was in the hole but after getting it I was delighted to see it in action.</li>
            <li>The razor provides an irritation free shave and has only caused two minor cuts... to be fair, I caused the cuts by speed shaving.</li>
            <li>A shaving stand is nice and pretty, and it keeps everything organized and allows your brush to dry well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>After all is said and done, I doubt very much that I&#x60;ll be using the Edwin Jagger DE89l razor again (packed away); the difference in the quality of the shave between the two is night and day for me.</li>
            <li>I do spend more time shaving now, but hey, I enjoy it, and I know it&#x27;ll be the time well spent!</li>
            <li>I had thought about getting one with a longer handle, and was concerned about the length of this one at first; but as soon as you begin shaving with it, the short handle becomes a virtue, allowing you to spin, tilt and otherwise adjust your shaving angle quickly and easily.    </li>
            <li>Same for the DE razor:  manufacturers discovered they could make more money with an inferior product but call it \\&quot;progress.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>When I first started shaving in the 1970&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Even if I only use each blade 4 times, I will still be able to shave for over a year with 100 blades.</li>
            <li>Just put the hot water in a shaving cup, dip in the brush, make your shaving foam, and use the hot water to dip your razor.</li>
            <li>Good German Engineering apparently applies to their razors also.</li>
            <li>for example, is of much higher quality</li>
            <li>Upon my first shave with this razor</li>
            <li>Purchased this razor, some blades, a cheap badger brush, and some shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street).     </li>
            <li>You can hardly do better than a non-adjustible safety razor made by Merkur if you&#x27;re just starting out.  </li>
            <li>The first is that you should immediately trash the blade that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li>My first razor was the Gillette Techmatic--</li>
            <li>I generally get a lot of cuts even with proper prep, good amount of soap on my face, water hydration.</li>
            <li>If you have bigger hands you might dig the Edwin more.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a well made razor that will last for many years.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I no longer get the razor burn and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>This razor is exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to get some blades for him as this only comes with one Merkur blade.  </li>
            <li>Well, that got me interested in wet shaving, which went out of popular style well before I was even conceived.  </li>
            <li>Just finished my first shave with this razor and no cuts, no razor burn, and the closest smoothest shave</li>
            <li>Like many people I did a lot of research before deciding to upgrade to using a double edged (DE) safety razor.</li>
            <li>Very close shave even with one pass and no across or against the grain pass for me yet!</li>
            <li>It was my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor (non-cartridge) and the hype matched the results.</li>
            <li>Do you remember the first time that you shaved with a Mach 3 Turbo?  </li>
            <li>This was my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>And I nicked myself a couple of times the first time.</li>
            <li>While not delivering on a super close shave, the Merkur Classic has the advantage of gliding across beard without tugging.  </li>
            <li>This is one of three Merkur razors I have purchased - the first one was the long-handled version of this one - I purchased for my husband.</li>
            <li>This is one of my first.  </li>
            <li>I used this razor for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>They last longer as well, which makes it an even better deal.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back to the latest fades in shaving.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to recognize the limits you can achieve, otherwise you&#x27;ll find yourself taking far more passes than would be advisable, especially when the razor burn kicks in.  </li>
            <li>my first shave took me almost 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I first wanted to try a cut-throat razor, but after reading about it a bit I learned i had to learn how to sharpen it, buy a strop for 100 bucks, and the razor itself was over 100.</li>
            <li>My first safety razor, it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I did the more I wanted to purchase a Double Edge.</li>
            <li>First of all, Merkur 178 &#x3D; Merkur 34C &#x3D; Merkur HD.</li>
            <li>It is my first DE razor</li>
            <li>a lot--it&#x27;s heavy, shiny, and the texturing on the handle looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>A slightly longer handle might be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for about eight weeks and my first impressions are positive.    </li>
            <li>To change blades, one simply unscrews the top surface which is attached to a long threaded screw inserted into the top of the handle.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used my Merkur Classic was on my chest (my wife likes it smooth) and as it isn&#x27;t particularly hairy it wasn&#x27;t much of a challenge.</li>
            <li>Walking out an hour later after buying nothing since there was so much to choose from that it became too overwhelming to make a choice.</li>
            <li>I just use Nivea Sensitive, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind having something with a more natural smell.</li>
            <li>Also it seems like the \\&quot;Long Handle\\&quot; would cost more then the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot;</li>
            <li>However, the closeness of the shave, the reduced irritation, and the warm badger hair brush definitely make it worth the extra time.    </li>
            <li>As they say, \\&quot;Good things come in small packages\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>That said you feel really cool and old fashioned shaving with one of these, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li>If you have smaller hands or want a more classic design pick up the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>People and websites say that it takes more time with a classic razor, but in my experience it is about the same.</li>
            <li>Your first shave with this simple, single-blade, stainless steel safety razor from Merkur will not be easy.  </li>
            <li>It used a razor strip rather than blades and one got a new surface by turning a wheel to get fresh blade surface.  </li>
            <li>It felt like the brand new blade was pulling the hairs, not cutting them.</li>
            <li>The posture you&#x27;ll need to use the razor is a bit different than a disposable, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>I would say that the learning curve switching from a modular disposable razor is short and easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small safety razor (roughly 3\\&quot; tall), with excellent weight and balance.  </li>
            <li>If I haven&#x27;t convinced you to pay the upfront cost of getting this razor and a pack of 100 blades, I recommend buying an old Gillette Super Speed or Tech razor from an online auction or a Feather Portable razor, along with a blade sample pack from an online retailer.</li>
            <li>Epoxy isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold.    </li>
            <li>Four years later (bought in Apr 2010), it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>(which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how steady your hand is)and it shaves as smooth as fresh as the first time, every time (because you can change out the razor blades which come in huge packs at once for a reasonable price).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li>This is certainly one of them.</li>
            <li>Pick up a good badger brush (best you have the money for), shave pucks if you need them and a few different blades and a stand to dry your brush correctly upside down</li>
            <li>First and only double edged razor I own.</li>
            <li>After many years with the multiblade, titanium, battery powered, \\&quot;real man\\&quot; shaving systems who&#x27;s blades last 2 shaves I decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>If you are considering this as your first safety razor, please note that it&#x27;s significantly shorter than traditional disposable razors.</li>
            <li>After reading lots of reviews, I went with the Merkur Classic as my first safety razor and couldn&#x27;t be happier.      </li>
            <li>The Merkur classic 178 is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>This was my first classic razor.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used a classic safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself is of very high quality.  </li>
            <li>On the whole, I love this razor and would buy it again in an instant; I&#x27;m not sure why it took me 15 years to try a DE razor, but I&#x27;m sure glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li>Nice once you learn how to use it - if you are not familiar with safety razors.</li>
            <li>There is a little more technique involved using this razor, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>Switched to a double edge (\\&quot;DE\\&quot;) razor after becoming fed up with the high price and inconsistent quality of cartridge-style razors from Gillete (the Atra, Sensor, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Because it is smaller, I can see where the 178 may be a little more managable and agile.  </li>
            <li>It is such a smooth shave and so much cheaper than the five bladed shavers.  </li>
            <li>I also feel smug when out shopping and look at the prices of modern razors blades.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>rugged design, all stainless.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s in a green tube, cost about $10 for enough to last seemingly forever, and it works great!)    </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the cartridge type.  </li>
            <li>This has a much heavier feel.  </li>
            <li>much easier.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll change shaving technologies again when they invent the laser that does your whole face in one pass...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s another thing I really like about a double-edge.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter really.</li>
            <li>Mach 3 and all those razors would leave my skin really irritated and scratched up</li>
            <li>As much as you have to adjust for all the angles of your face, I think I would have struggled with the longer handle.</li>
            <li>Besides, you will want to hold this razor with two fingers anyway, on the very tip, so why get a longer handle?</li>
            <li>However, after using it a few times I realized that the smaller handle is better as I feel I have more control and precision over the blade.</li>
            <li>I change blades weekly and have had no issues; if you go more than a week, you will find that the blades are rough and need to be changed lest you cut your face.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I decided to buy one for myself and I will never go back to cheap, disposable, plastic razors ever again.</li>
            <li>This razor also has a much closer shave and leaves a smoother finish.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy</li>
            <li>Well, I had an important meeting earlier and had forgotten to shave this morning</li>
            <li>Give a real razor a shot</li>
            <li>Merkur&#x27;s stainless steel blades work well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Although I do enjoy my 38c, having shaved a couple of times with it, I can see why one would opt for the smaller 178.  </li>
            <li>Once you understand how to properly use this you will enjoy your shave if you don&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li>I bought this tool based on the necessity to find a cheap way to shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>As others have said, you want to apply light pressure and make multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>Still, it does give a reasonably close shave, or as close as you dare.  </li>
            <li>If I try that with this straight edged thing, I&#x27;ll be going to the emergency room.  </li>
            <li>When using the same blades in both razors, I find the Merkur HD a much smoother and a far better quality shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband two years ago, who had never had a straight razor but wanted one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge guy, but have bigger hands than some, and it fits perfectly in my hand and has enough weight to it that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to lose control.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, you have to pay a little bit more attention to what you are doing with this razor - also, you have to do it right with a badger brush and shaving soap</li>
            <li>Wait til the first time your lady friend feels the new shave and comments on your smoothness.....</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, so this means patting on some more water once or twice while I&#x27;m finishing up.</li>
            <li>You must be more careful using a classic razor as it is easier to cut your face by accident.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s important to be realistic and objective in your assessment when deciding whether or not a safety razor is for you.</li>
            <li>I wish someone would have posted pictures of the two side by side and give a reason as to why one is better then the other or If it even matters.</li>
            <li>The Merkur products are very cost effective, long lasting, and well made, plus the razor blades costs about 1.7 cents a piece.  </li>
            <li>These products aren&#x27;t necessary, but they do add significantly to the pleasure of shaving.</li>
            <li>Perhaps you&#x27;ve even tried to convert to some other brand, hoping that even more razors crammed into a piece of plastic would do the trick.  </li>

            <li>[[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]]    </li>
            <li>Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany    </li>
            <li>Here are my main thoughts if you don&#x27;t want to read the whole thing:    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an extremely well-built razor, pretty heavy, with a great non-slip handle.</li>
            <li>thing newcomers may find our quickly is that this razor absolutely devours facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Next, you absolutely must keep your face (not just the razor) nice and wet.</li>
            <li>However, since there is a lot more room underneath the blade compared to common N-blade razors, I believe it can definitely cut more hair before it clogs.    </li>
            <li>When I am satisfied I havegotten the ins and outs of this razor down</li>
            <li>Changing razors is a breeze, and with the screw down mechanism, you can feel confident the blade is not shifting, nor going anywhere.</li>
            <li>I am continuing to get \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shaves (better than I could from any other shaving modality I  have used) and can now do it bloodless!</li>
            <li>I did see one comment about others being better, but I can not comment on that as I have only used the German ones.    </li>
            <li>So, I began my research on the Internet and discovered the Merkur Classic Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li>I now make about two passes following the grain, then go back for one or two more passes against it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Merkur Classic and have been using it for a week now.  </li>
            <li>being said, the Merkur 178 is a decent shaver on which I learned to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I have a giant beard that grows quickly.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I paid $50 to make the transition, but that would have been what I would have paid for 2 packages of Fusion blades that would only last at the most, 4 months.  </li>
            <li>I do have a favorite in the sampler, but I&#x27;ll wait til I&#x27;m running low to order a year&#x27;s supply of the one I like, and that will still only cost about $15.  </li>
            <li>It may be that I&#x27;m still getting used to using a safety razor, but I don&#x27;t feel it shaves as close as my old cheap blue target razors.</li>
            <li>I decided to try wet-shaving using a safety razor, and after reading reviews, I went with the Merkur classic.      </li>
            <li>Combine with a decent blade, brush, and cream, and you&#x27;re on your way.  </li>
            <li>The grip is steady, even with damp hands and the weight of the razor does all the work for you.    </li>
            <li>Mainly because I just use the weight of the razor</li>
            <li>I have yet to use my contemporary five razor over this one.</li>
            <li>one is &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; classic for a reason and while I like the razor (34C)</li>
            <li>I chose the Merkur Classic by the reviews, giving this product high marks.</li>
            <li>If you need a good, long lasting double edge razor then you need a Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The single, straight edge makes shaping sideburns and facial hair pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this or any Merkur model razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>so anyway, extremely high quality product.</li>
            <li>The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather&#x27;s old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave.</li>
            <li>Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to (expensive) replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Besides the purely practical aspects of the length and weight it&#x27;s a classy looking piece of metal.</li>
            <li>It does take a little more time though.  </li>
            <li>Cost effective in the medium-long run with very nice blades (I used the 1 Merkur blade that came with it and some Derby Extras, which were both satisfactory) costing a tiny fraction of even cheap disposable razors, not to mention the outrageous cost of high-end models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, but the older I got, the more retro I started getting; at least with shaving.</li>
            <li>The short-handled razors like this one are great for my small hands and my teenage son, but a man with large hands would probably prefer the long-handled razor (which is about the same length as a Mach razor).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spending tons on the latest multi blade refills for years, roughly 2-3 bucks a refill!!!</li>
            <li>the feel, the positive results, the endless supplies of razor blades you can purchase aside from this, and the fact that it is just cool looking.</li>
            <li>I have a relatively soft beard, not the Fred Flinstone type, but it grows fast.  </li>
            <li>After much deliberation, I went with this Merkur and some Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Soap.  </li>
            <li>and it gives him a very close, non-irritating shave (we also use natural goats milk soap rather than chemical \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>Shaves very well, will only nick and scratch on your first time, but from that point on it is close shave after close shave.  </li>
            <li>During my first few strokes I almost reached smooth skinned nirvana</li>
            <li>The initial cost may be more, but you will save money in the long run.    </li>
            <li>With each new design, the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I&#x27;ve never experienced a closer, more satisfying shave outside of an old fashioned barbershop.  </li>
            <li>Also, the included Merkur blade is intensely sharp, but not too sharp as to not allow for a second pass against the grain (where I cut myself, lol).  </li>
            <li>I wanted os much to enjoy this product as I invested in the other accessories.</li>
            <li>The kind that has the little hangar-type doors that open up for blade</li>
            <li>It took me about 2 weeks to get used to the new way of shaving.</li>
            <li>I was given a Gillette cartridge razor and was told this was \\&quot;new and better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it is still like new.</li>
            <li>This may be my learning curve  with the new razor.  </li>
            <li>My razor could pass for new.  </li>
            <li>just a new blade</li>
            <li>the fact I&#x27;d have to replace the razors that are made for women, whether it&#x27;s paying $30 for a new razor head, or just buying a new razor all together.</li>
            <li>It also takes about a week for your face to get used to the new razor</li>
            <li>I ended up buying my first DE after being interested for a long time in the subject and seeing old second hand ones by the GEM brand for $5 at a local antique fair</li>
            <li>The available replacement blades are all generally sharper than in the disposables, but the design of the #178 allows for some lee-way, you&#x27;re not going to cut yourself as long as you use deliberate strokes and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having done the same exercise with gilette swivel-head razors, my face feels better after the Merkur (though the shave isn&#x27;t as close--I&#x27;m inexperienced).    </li>
            <li>-I went from having a constant red razor burn rash on my neck to basically blemish free skin.</li>
            <li>It really feels and it looks like a very well-made Chinese Product</li>
            <li>I started shaving in the very early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>First of all, to clear away any confusion, the #178 is the same razor as the 34c and the HD Classic/Hefty Classic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the true \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; process, and am hooked.</li>
            <li>First off, there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.  </li>
            <li>Think of going to wall-mart and buying a knockoff tool, and then comparing that same tool to a craftsman or other reputable tool maker.</li>
            <li>I went with the grain of the whiskers first, reapplied some shaving soap, with a boar brush, and then against the grain for the second pass.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this razor and shaved with it using some Taylor of Bond Street avocado cream along with a vulfix brush last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Now I actually look forward to shaving , thats a first for me.</li>
            <li>can and do shave against the grain with this thing, but only after making a first pass with the grain.    </li>
            <li>First things first, this is really the Merkur 34C also known as the Merkur HD (Heavy Duty).  </li>
            <li>Ive had this bad boy for 3 years now, its not going anywhere, blades are super cheap and environmentally this is a more responsible option than your standard supermarket options.</li>
            <li>The learning curve for this guy, or any DE razor, is about 5-10 shaves, but once I got that down, I get a close, smooth, no-cut shave in about 6 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Just know that there is a wide range of replacement blades, and it could mean the difference between a slightly better than average shave, and an exceptional shave.</li>
            <li>So far I have been able to learn with this one with only very minimal damage to my face.</li>
            <li>My (old school) barber was interested in my change, so I brought it in to show him the next haircut I had.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful the first times, as there is a tendency to apply too much pressure when you&#x27;re used to M3.</li>
            <li>But I still need a place to put my wet brush down, so a bowl works nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was a shame to realize a classic Fatboy or other DE razors may have been just thrown out and how they&#x27;re worth quite a bit of money today.    </li>
            <li>I ordered this razor because of all the positive reviews, got it a while back</li>
            <li>The razor has a short handle, which is ok for me, but for some guys with larger mitts they would need the long handled razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I have a heavy beard shadow by 11am, but with this I am baby smooth through the day, no irritation, just soft skin.</li>
            <li>All of the pictures of the long handle seem about right as far as height</li>
            <li>The heavy weight and handle length make it easy to get the right angle and pressure to learn the wet shaving method.  </li>
            <li>I did ding that part up a little by dropping it a while back, so I&#x27;m going to say that&#x27;s mostly my fault.</li>
            <li>Does seem to be slightly more aggressive, which seems to works well for my hard stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After you finish shaving rinse your face with cold water and finish by running an Alum Block (Bloc Osma is great) on your face.</li>
            <li>I shaved for 20 years with multi-blade razors and their ilk, and it was a huge waste.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me as a not very aggressive safety razor that you&#x27;ll be able to learn how to wet shave with</li>
            <li>So your total cost in blades for a whole year is about $7 to $8.     </li>
            <li>Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li>Whereas I could shave with my old Mach 3 in about 5 minutes, I now set aside about 20.  </li>
            <li>I just took an old electric kettle and put it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Have used it for nearly 6 months now and no complaints here.</li>
            <li>In reality I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  </li>
            <li>Have had a few others and they were build cheap.</li>
            <li>The German&#x27;s really know how to craft a piece of steel, and I doubt it will ever wear out.  </li>
            <li>related recommendation is that you use real shaving soap or cream, not canned foam.</li>
            <li>that I used to get with my old razor.</li>
            <li>You can get cheaper brushes at CVS or Walmart, but they are not going to be near as soft as a quality badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>A box of at least 10 more spare blades.</li>
            <li>Oh, well I now get a shave that my old Fusion, or even Mach 3, couldn&#x27;t get close to.  </li>
            <li>Very well made with durable construction and should last a lifetime or even longer.</li>
            <li>and wow did I feel the difference between my Fusion and the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>You were young, perhaps, and the hair on your face was effeminate and soft.  </li>
            <li>My whole neck is cut up and red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going old school...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stainless steel with a solid weight to it.</li>
            <li>After decades of use with my old Merkur razor, I checked to see if this razor is still being made.  </li>
            <li>I bought the same, identical replacement razor, which should tell you how much I believe in this razor.  </li>
            <li>Went old school and decided to go for the Merkur Safety razor.</li>
            <li>The moral of all of this is, get the double edged razor if the rising cost of banded razors is your primary concern.  </li>
            <li>and I had several nics(this is more about my inexperience, and less about the shaver/blade!)</li>
            <li>Many people who use DE razors buy shaving brushes and various products, which tend to intimidate people due to the time, expense, and technique necessary to use them.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette razors for years and only recently discovered this whole world of \\&quot;classic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, be sure to get a stand to hang the razor when not in use, as its generally not a great idea to have the razor&#x27;s edge so close to a hard surface, as it would be if you just laid the razor down on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #178 has a lot of great points</li>
            <li>The learning curve is not as big as other people seem to think, just make sure not to rush your way through the first few times you shave with it.</li>
            <li>The classic I ordered isn&#x27;t too short.</li>
            <li>You can get expensive creams but the best I have found is an ordinary can of gillette cream.</li>
            <li>These are various names and product numbers used interchangeably for the exact same razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the traditional shaving creams and not the new chemical-based ones; my preference is Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>I prefer the shorter-handle because it encourages me to hold the razor properly and the balance feels a little better than the long-handled ones, but that&#x27;s all personal preference.  </li>
            <li>The only con I can think of is the time it takes to learn to use a DE and the fact that I do have to shave a little more regularly since it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and then cut it like the multi-blade cartridges do.</li>
            <li>It was a bit smaller than I expected, but I warmed up to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>This razor has a small but important learning curve.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this razor and made my first foray into old-fashioned wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to using something like a Mach 3 (as that was my first wet shave razor)or any of the multi-blades this will take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>this is the razor you should start with if you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving.  </li>
            <li>Just like with cheap plastic razors, I usually lather with plain soap in the shower and shave quickly.</li>
            <li>I currently use the Merkur double edge razor blades with this model, but am going to switch to Feather as I have read they are very well made blades; have not had any issues with the Merkur blades, but want to try the others to compare.</li>
            <li>In the end, it&#x27;s only a razor and there is only so much you can accomplish in terms of shaving.  </li>
            <li>A solid and overall very well made product.</li>
            <li>With my banded razor, I could bear down on an area of my face that came out less than smooth after the first try.  </li>
            <li>I spent a good while researching the different types of razors available, and pondered long and hard on whether to get this one or Merkur&#x27;s \\&quot;Heavy Duty\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li>I would also like to add that I don&#x27;t normally shave upside down, but did with this razor and got a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I got my first \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shave with this razor the other day.</li>
            <li>A styptic pen (any major drugstore will have them).</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice, but it is now fun to shave with Mekur Model 178.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a really tough beard; I can&#x27;t say for sure.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I hope this helps other guys who might be taking a look at the Merkur or other classic safety razors.  </li>
            <li>You can get a special shaving bowl, but a small ceramic cereal bowl oreven a cup works just as well.</li>
            <li>handle is a bit short, if you&#x27;ve large hands, I would suggest you consider getting the #180, which is the same basic no-frills design, just a longer handle.</li>
            <li>As I said earlier I sometimes skip a week or two of shaving and my nick name in high school was Teen Wolf.</li>
            <li>I tried soldering it and ended up with the head melting -- apparently it&#x27;s made of die-cast zinc, like a Tootsie Toy or Hotwheels.</li>
            <li>The 5th shave was \\&quot;very good\\&quot; with no nicks and not much</li>
            <li>&quot; They have stringent quality control and a product can only be marked with the \\&quot;Solingen\\&quot; name if it meets the criteria for quality set by the government.</li>
            <li>Apparently it goes under the name HD, 34C and 178 on the internet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a bare minimum of what you will need.</li>
            <li>I suggest a badger hair brush with some traditional shave cream or soap like Geo F. Trumpers or Trufitt or Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy enough to be a problem.</li>
            <li>Try a single blade, with a decent brush &amp; soap.</li>
            <li>You may cut yourself if your not careful with this classic razor, but its expected to take your time.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have stated, you don&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure.</li>
            <li>the blades are so incredibly sharp that all you need to do is gently \\&quot;wipe\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all about patience - short, careful strokes with almost no pressure (let the weight of the razor do the work) and after the first pass, re-lather and make a second pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being 25 years old and far from financially wealthy, I became sick of paying so much for cartridge blades and looked into my grandpa&#x27;s way of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and wet shaving in general.</li>
            <li>Which brings me to another advantage of this razor: if you put off shaving for too long, this razor doesn&#x27;t pull out long hairs, like contemporary razors do, it cuts them off clean, which is a godsend for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice heavy feel so you don&#x27;t have to press hard on your face.</li>
            <li>I became confused when I noticed it was called the classic but the picture looked so much like the classic HD.</li>
            <li>What once was my most hated and dreaded of chores is now one of my favorite hobbies.</li>
            <li>i had about 4 days of beard growth, i took a shower before shaving, washed my face a few times, kept my face wet, lathered up with dial bar soap [using my hands], and had a nick free shave.</li>
            <li>When I first received this handle, I was a little upset that I had not gotten the longer handle version.</li>
            <li>i havent cut myself with a cartridge razor since i first started shaving, but i was still a little worried after reading reviews and warnings.     </li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger DE89-they&#x27;re a little more refined, less aggressive, and more expensive.</li>
            <li>Small easy strokes with absolutely no pressure except by the weight of this razor are the way to go.  </li>
            <li>A few minor nicks the first few times he used it, but quickly got the hang of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got the razor I intended, but anyone not wanting the heavier razor will be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Yes, you *WILL* cut yourself the first few times, if you are switching from a \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li>I cut myself the first few times shaving with it.</li>
            <li>I can now shave in 10 mins, but give yourself 30-45 mins for the first few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my older relatives kept their DE razors for many years  but when they went to check for me it turned out they had been thrown out or given away which was disappointing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re constantly in a hurry to shave and be on your way, I don&#x27;t suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor for that matter.</li>
            <li>I used to get razor burn on my upper lip when using the 3-5 blade systems, but once I switched to this, I have gotten none of it; I can shave daily with no irritation, when with the &#x27;modern&#x27; razors, I would have to shave every other day.</li>
            <li>New to the safety razor arena, but the handle was shorter than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I use Proraso, but there are plenty of other high quality shaving creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>dont press down as you would a mach three, or disposable, as you&#x27;re working with the sheer face of a real razor against your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do note that the handle is not very long, at about 75mm total, with 50mm for the actual handle portion.</li>
            <li>The advertised picture on every website that sells the 178 is a little misleading; it appears bigger than it really is.      </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical that I would be able to get a \\&quot;barber\\&quot; style shave with it, being an absolute novice with the handling of it.  </li>
            <li>By switching I have lost the terrible, scarring ingrown hairs, the patchy rough spots, the excessive expense of buying replacement cartridges, and instead gained smooth skin, a high quality piece of machined and chromed metal, and shaving has gone from daily chore to a great pleasure.</li>
            <li>Ok, well, it&#x27;s still kind of a chore, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need to stretch my razor blade&#x27;s life (thus cutting my face) because they are so expensive anymore.  </li>

            <li> Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> He said the Merkur blades were the best out there.</li>
            <li> You will get the best shave of your life.     </li>
            <li> Precision engineered and beautifully crafted in Germany, this razor shines!  </li>
            <li> Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> I got a shaving brush,  shaving soap, and used my Safety Razor which worked but still not the  best.  </li>
            <li> Best shave</li>
            <li> The blade is perfectly aligned every time.  </li>
            <li> Your milage may vary, but the Merkur blades are not the best.  </li>
            <li> The handle could be a bit longer, but this razor is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I looked at all reviews on amazon on all the razors and come to find out that the Merkur model is the best razor.</li>
            <li> As you slid the cartridge-razor over your youthful, silken face, the hair just seemed to glide away with the razor and you were very happy with that.  </li>
            <li> I bought the inexpensive Tweezerman brush, Tom&#x27;s of Maine cream, and the Derby blades, and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> but I feel compelled to praise this excellent razor.</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t be the greatest shave in the history of man.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver!</li>
            <li> and this is a great shaver to do it with!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!</li>
            <li> It comes with one blade from the manufacturer, but grab a multipack to see which ones you like best.  </li>
            <li> For the best shaving experience get a shaving brush and some soap.</li>
            <li> This a wonderful razor that I would recommend over and over again to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the shave.  </li>
            <li> Excellent starter safety razor for the price.</li>
            <li> For me, the quality of the shave from the HD is absolutely superb.</li>
            <li> And it is the best shave</li>
            <li> I am completely happy with this razor!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son and he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> You can get a very good shave</li>
            <li> -Blades are incredibly cheaper.</li>
            <li> -Using soap is great and probably the best part of the process.  </li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> Beautiful simplicity.</li>
            <li> But it is a beautifully balanced razor.</li>
            <li> All metal construction, looks very handsome, no slip handle, great angle of razor to skin for excellent shave.</li>
            <li> The quality and finish are great.</li>
            <li> Again I am happy with Amazon reviewers and I am  one too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For a great shave, unlearn your Mach3/Fusion holds.</li>
            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> Quality product, great shave.</li>
            <li> Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Everything has worked out great.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing all this stuff, but it has worked out great.  </li>
            <li> I have happily used Gillette, Merkur, Personna, Walgreen&#x27;s, Wilkinson blades.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for a close shave and to keep that beard neat like barber did it.    </li>
            <li> I also purchased the 1904 replica for myself - I figured if it worked so well for the guys, it might work great for the girls.</li>
            <li> Got this after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Just a great razor.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> I attribute this to GREATLY reduced irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> great shave.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some great things about safety razors.</li>
            <li> Looks great too</li>
            <li> (I found that I like Feather the best), a good shaving brush (some good options here on Amazon -</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Much better of a shave then the newer cartridge types!!</li>
            <li> This Merkur is very nice.</li>
            <li> The weight of this instrument is great in the hand, and the build is impeccable.  </li>
            <li> How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not, in some way, improved?  </li>
            <li> Good for beginners or experienced.</li>
            <li> You can keep your Gilette Mach 24 vibrating, moisturizing, battery operated, turbo charged, multi-colored, shaver with replacement blades that cost more than a happy hour beer!</li>
            <li> After these steps you&#x27;ll be on your way to a great shave and can put more time into shaving rather than reading about products!</li>
            <li> And as any good tool, it \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; in your hand when you shave.</li>
            <li> Use a good razor blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of good quality steel,with a hefty feel.</li>
            <li> The shave quality is good, but temper your expectations.  </li>
            <li> You just have to put up with it if you want a good shave though and think about the end result.    </li>
            <li> Good luck on your shaving journey.     </li>
            <li> weight of the body feels good in your hands</li>
            <li> I recommend you get some good shaving cream.</li>
            <li> A good aftershave balm.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, this is a fantastic razor and the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> an inexpensive pack of merkur razors, and some good shave</li>
            <li> Good balance of comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> Been using the cream and brush with my Gillete Fusion with good results.</li>
            <li> Well balanced and really good shave.  </li>
            <li> Get a good styptic pencil, and maybe some hydrocortison cream.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Chrome finish on the Edwin Jagger is definitely superior, but the finish on the Merkur is still good (time will tell).</li>
            <li> disposable razor industry sold us a bill of good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently using it with Astra Superior Platinum DE blades, after using Derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most others, I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years, I had to buy the latest, greatest design in razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for 6 months now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My son is very pleased with the effortless saving experience.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, looks good.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s all metal construction gives it more weight than those plastic disposable razors I take with me on trips), still has that great easy surface grip handle, and with the Mekur blade is a joy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> The results are so much better!</li>
            <li> This one is so much better!</li>
            <li> First the razor: Excellent craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> they are cheap and give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Men have been shaving for hundreds of years and they didn&#x27;t need to shell out that kind of money.</li>
            <li> Pleased with what I saw, I placed the order through Amazon saving a good 25% of the cost, even with shipping.  </li>
            <li> Let the razors own weight do the shaving.</li>
            <li> It takes almost no effort at all to be honest.  </li>
            <li> razor is a nice addition to my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Edwin has nice plating and appearance.</li>
            <li> Nice product indeed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit spectacular about this razors.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get good blades.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave without stripping my skin.</li>
            <li> Very well made and a great investment !</li>
            <li> The shorter length allows you to manipulate the razor without bumping into your own hand.</li>
            <li> I own an Edwin Jagger DE89 safety razor and decided to try the Merkur HD as well.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it, yet it&#x27;s not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very, very good; not too aggressive, just right.</li>
            <li> Overall a very popular safety razor that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent rendition of the classic safety razor.</li>
            <li> This classic way of shaving has been a perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have found it easy to use and of good quality.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I just let it slide, with it&#x27;s own weight on my face and</li>
            <li> If you want a good, cheap shave.</li>
            <li> Now, I get near perfect shaves every time.    </li>
            <li> Wow, this a great razor !</li>
            <li> The finish was beautiful, everything fit precisely together.</li>
            <li> Oh, the myth that DE shaving makes shaving fun or that you&#x27;ll want to do it every day more is bunk!!</li>
            <li> -The razor is very good, but I think some of the reviewers may be overly influenced by their desire to believe the razor is better than it really is.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE safety razor, and it has been great.</li>
            <li> and I had a great first shave with it.  </li>
            <li> This is one fine razor!  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a good start for a safety razor!</li>
            <li> The blade is easy to change and I can get a nice, close shave with this unit.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has a nice balance and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It still works great for a guy with large hands.  </li>
            <li> It feels very good on your skin and is far preferable to canned shaving cream.    </li>
            <li> Now, about 3 weeks later, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> and they got by ok.     </li>
            <li> and I love using it,</li>
            <li> because more material is used and its more of a specialty item but that is not the case, makes you wonder if the $40 price is inflated some.  </li>
            <li> Many decades ago in the USA streetcar tracks were ripped out in cities all across the country and replaced with buses.</li>
            <li> , I find they are better than the Merkur blade that comes included, but that&#x27;s another review.</li>
            <li> I found one in an upscale shaving boutique store in one of Atlanta&#x27;s more prestigious malls in Buckhead.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t know any better.</li>
            <li> Be warned that these will take more time to shave with.  </li>
            <li> My wife said my result is better.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Even better, you can find 100 \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; brand replacement blades online for around $15.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many shaving systems and nothing beats this.</li>
            <li> For closeness and ease of shaving the sensor was just much, much better.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> Remember: the blade you put in it is even more important than the razor!  </li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t forget to dispose of your blades safely by putting them into the back-side of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> How many shaves would that be?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more the blade you choose to use in the end</li>
            <li> and how many passes you do.</li>
            <li> You can also experiment with how many fingers you use to hold the razor.</li>
            <li> You can get used to a shaved face feeling which can in effect make you want to shave more often though.</li>
            <li> most likely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And because this is fulfilled by Amazon, packaging is great and shipping is fast, as always.</li>
            <li> One pass with the grain for most is the way to go</li>
            <li> Either way, I would gladly recommend this razor to any friend, guy or girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> - it beats my Norelco Reflex to shreds, and is also better than the venerable Gilette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you want to rush through shaving and just get it over with then stick with an electric that can&#x27;t take your face off like this thing can :-)</li>
            <li> is in much better condition then when using the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> The merkur blades were okay</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> I was, like many people looking into this, a skeptic.</li>
            <li> This in-turn is much better on the enviroment with no plastic parts and lower amount of trash.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> My face is OK, just one nick on my chin.</li>
            <li> and I concur with many of the remarks made by the gentlemen.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that about the many disposable and cartridge razors I have used over the years, too many cuts to count.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used this type of razor for twenty-five years and says that there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Ok about 10 or so.  </li>
            <li> Once with the grain and then once more after relathering.  </li>
            <li> It seems more \\&quot;strictly</li>
            <li> business\\&quot; than the more cosmetic 38c.  </li>
            <li> If you want something more substantial and aesthetic, buy the 38c.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a more enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> One blade is truly better than 3.</li>
            <li> so plan appropriately.  </li>
            <li> The bottom unscrews to release the top cover</li>
            <li> It also saves you money and is better for the environment.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I suppose like most people that have decided to take this route instead.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this safety razor may take longer(8 mins vs 2) but the shave afterwards is always better than any disposable can offer.</li>
            <li> Everybody points to the Merkur as the top dog.</li>
            <li> A good safety razor is both functional and economical.</li>
            <li> All in all more</li>
            <li> Sleek and stylish, thought it woulda been longer</li>
            <li> Thinking of perhaps maybe buying the HD gold version:)</li>
            <li> yourself a big favor and get a blade sampler pack to see which razor blade works best for you</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor that I have purchased and have loved it more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> The opening mechanism is machined perfectly, and is easy enough to work with, although I&#x27;m tempted to try one of the \\&quot;butterfly\\</li>
            <li> The screw-on top secures the razor perfectly and lets me worry about my shaving skills and not about the blade coming loose.  </li>
            <li> If you want a new shaver to pass to your grandchildren, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> The overall weight is good, heavier than a disposable system razor, but if you want something hefty, look for the HD models, which are a good deal heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After learning to take my time and be more careful I discovered that the Merkur gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur after reading lots of great reviews, and because I have a nostalgia for old fashioned things.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade</li>
            <li> The primary reasons relate more to comfort than to blood loss, although both are valid concerns.  </li>
            <li> It feels good just to hold it, unlike those modern plasticky shiny Gillette handles.</li>
            <li> Cool!     </li>
            <li> this is not bad for a five years supply!  </li>
            <li> It cleans up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Changing blades is easy because it&#x27;s a two piece razor, and you just have to unscrew the head by turning the knob on the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> So, the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys (based on the reviews), but it isn&#x27;t for every beard.  </li>
            <li> A good shaving brush (Kingsley is the brand I bought, genuine badger hair for a reasonable amount of money).</li>
            <li> No on DE shaving in general: This is my first experience with DE shaving and it has been great!</li>
            <li> Easy to transport.  </li>
            <li> Easy to load.</li>
            <li> I did not cut myself and found it to be easy to learn to shave with.  </li>
            <li> it seems to be much smoother and more effective than a quatro or mach 3.</li>
            <li> and I got a nice, easy shave out of it the first time I tried.  </li>
            <li> But then I got some nice Wilkinsons and the whole experience was transformed: smooth, quick, and effective.    </li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing difference!  </li>
            <li> It does a fine job of holding the blade and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of the razor and it makes me feel like a true gentleman.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After lathering up and assembling the razor with one of the Derby Extra blades, I had a very smooth and pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I use the derby blades, they work fine.</li>
            <li> For me, the size of the model 178 is just fine</li>
            <li> I love this razor super close shave, just have to be carful, don&#x27;t apply pressure just let the weight of the razor do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a little bit longer to shave, but this is easily the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Wonderful first DE razor - not too aggressive and heavy for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> I can get a really smooth shave, closer than I&#x27;ve ever had, including in the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas like the neck.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it does not shave as close as the modern cartridges, so technology has moved on.</li>
            <li> Want a smooth shave that won&#x27;t take off your face?</li>
            <li> After a month or so of using these products your skin will look fantastic.</li>
            <li> The grip is comfortable and won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still keep a modern razor handy for those times when you are in a hurry (or a lot of bandaids and styptic pencils).</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> And it is cheap to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, there are some important things to learn for this to work.</li>
            <li> They said they always used Gillette brand from the 1950s on and that GEM&#x27;s were the cheap brand of their day.</li>
            <li> And if he travels a lot, it does not come with a case, so consider this [[ASIN:B001O8NCI4 leather travel case]] to secure his razor.  </li>
            <li> but if you desire a closer shave then I suggest re-lather, (which is important for wetshaving) and lightly shave across, not against the grain.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about not getting the Heavy Duty, longer handle, or adjustable; but those concerns are gone and I am very happy with my purchase!    </li>
            <li> Great solid razor.</li>
            <li> Comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> I liked this one so much, I also bought the slant version.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li> -Don&#x27;t go really cheap on blades.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a fantastic razor look no further.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to get the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version (34C HD).&lt;br /&gt;It is a solid product, feels great, and shaves well.</li>
            <li> To learn more on how to get a great shave from this razor, watch Mantic59&#x27;s series of videos on safety razor wet shaving techniques on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Some say Edwin is more gentle and Merkur is more aggressive.</li>
            <li> nice solid construction, light years better than any disposable, and way closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this one, as the weight of the head is just right</li>
            <li> Plan on no less than five minutes for a good close shave from the start of lathering to toweling off.  </li>
            <li> Since its been 3 days since I had a shave, I was excited to experience this close smooth nick free shave.     </li>
            <li> I bought this as my first blade to get me into wet shaving and must say I am VERY happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> but these kind wont irritate your skin very much at all if you do it right.</li>
            <li> Also, buy yourself a good \\&quot;super badger\\&quot; shaving brush and some Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Down right the best razor I could have purchased.</li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor, and while it gets the job done, there are much better razors out there.</li>
            <li> so be prepared for some healthy razor burn at first.  </li>
            <li> I first started shaving with one of these things many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this, hands down,  to anyone looking for the best shave of their life and a huge cost savings over modern multiblade razors!</li>
            <li> This is for those times when you want to really enjoy a great, close, careful shave.</li>
            <li> razor has a good solid feel and is well balanced, which is important when you are going to cut yourself, if it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even 4-5 multiple good passes doesn&#x27;t get it smooth with the DE.</li>
            <li> I use it 3-5 times a week depending on how often I need to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic (more finally crafted than grandpa&#x27;s shaver) and have been extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Please at the office has stopped to ask me who do i get suck a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I always get clean shaves without any nicks (what would you expect after years of practice?).</li>
            <li> The length is nice because so many razors these days act like massive squeegees.</li>
            <li> The most basic razor ended up becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have now isn&#x27;t with the Merkur or the blade but simply discovering the best was to get those 2-3 places on my neck and jaw line that aren&#x27;t easily shaved.    </li>
            <li> I was originally going to go with a straight edged cut throat razor but the more research</li>
            <li> Hundredth review right now on this product!</li>
            <li> Grandpa had it right all along!</li>
            <li> weight, manufactured to last, and give good clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this razor, I decided to get one and found out that I was lucky to get the Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a brush or shaving soap but shave wet with an almond oil-base shaving oil and it works great.   </li>
            <li> And a great beginner razor for those exploring DE wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I learned Merkur is owned by Dovo - a reputable straight razor company located in Solingen, Germany known as the \\&quot;city of blades.\\</li>
            <li> This is a good razor overall.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Short handle but good heft.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know why so many people report having so much difficulty with this razor.  </li>
            <li> You can read the full account here:      </li>
            <li> Get a good badger hair shave brush and soap for the total experience!</li>
            <li> After shave is a must, and a good moisturizer afterwords makes you feel like you just left the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Good and solid feel.  </li>
            <li> First the downsides of DE shaving in general (not this razor) are it&#x27;s slower because it necessitates much more concentration, but that is also a huge part of the enjoyment for me because it makes it much more of a methodical ritual with an even meditative quality.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d head over to WhippedDog and get a $26 silvertip badger!), a good shave soap/cream (I prefer Mike&#x27;s Natural Soaps and Taylor of Old Bond Street Coconut Cream), an alum block (to get rid of razor burn), and a good aftershave balm (like Nivea for sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those wanting a good shave, you will have to spend a little more time than using the multiblade razors.  </li>
            <li> Wow, how close and clean this razor performs!!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bloodless however and it wasn&#x27;t quick.</li>
            <li> Your choice of blade and shaving cream or soap will have more to do with the quality of your shave than the razor itself (Derby Extra blades are my favorite).  </li>
            <li> Luckily, there is help out there.</li>
            <li> and I regret trading a quick cosmetic improvement for my face&#x27;s comfort.    </li>
            <li> Hopefully I will heal quick.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something more substantial, so I sent it back for a refund and ordered a 38c \\&quot;barber pole,\\&quot; which is more to my expectations and liking.      </li>
            <li> This in and of itself makes this a worthy purchase in my eyes.     </li>
            <li> Old school, good look works very well.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wanting a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> If I had all the information on how to get a good shave with a single edge that is now available on the Internet, I would probably still be using my old Schick injector instead of abandoning it many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor and the associated products</li>
            <li> To be honest, my main motivation was the sticker shock of dropping a pack of modern, 3 bladed cartridges into my shopping cart.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily and nicely and I can lay it on my counter to dry without the blade making contact and eventually dulling.  </li>
            <li> Put the new blade in, put the top on and screw</li>
            <li> I like the short handle which makes it very easy to maneuver with, and the thick knurled handle provides excellent grip.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was at Walmart, had Fusions in my cart and left them at the checkout when I realized it was going to cost me $25 for just 6 (or maybe 8) razors!  </li>
            <li> Those things are also fine and will give you a reasonably close shave, providing you have the time to devote to shaving; God help you if you oversleep and look in the mirror with thoughts of doing this \\&quot;quickly.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> the single edge razor is much more effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face nearly as much.</li>
            <li> Although a little intimidating at first, the Merkur is actually very easy to use, and provides a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur worked better than my old Safety Razor I have used since 1957.  </li>
            <li> The solid metal of the razor stays warm from the water while shaving creating a luxurious and relaxing shaving experience.   </li>
            <li> The Merkur DE Safety razor does a good job of holding the blade in place for a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the whole experience is just much more satisfying.</li>
            <li> of these Merkur razors is an investment, as mine proves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to shave with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> This razor was worth every penny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> I started using this Razor in July with a wet shave and loved it.</li>
            <li> Now I own several DE&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It takes some getting accustomed to, but once you get it, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s worth noting.    </li>
            <li> The shave that you will receive using this safety razor is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> handle has knurling, so you get a good grip even when wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;blades are remarkably inexpensive, and extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> &quot; I mean superior to any 4 blade contraption or the latest from Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> I will just say that my experience with this razor has been very, very positive once I somewhat mastered</li>
            <li> The only one that might be a better choice is the \\&quot;hefty\\&quot; variant of the Classic, but it costs a bit more, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After receiving and loading it with a blade, I became painfully aware of why these things are no longer commonly available on the market, and why I was so glad to see the banded razors come into play.  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> This one is well crafted and made right</li>
            <li> If your still wondering about getting this, watch some videos on YouTube to see if its right for you.</li>
            <li> I was fascinated by the mechanism--so much simpler and easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this razor and wrote a full review, complete with day by day descriptions, on my blog.  </li>
            <li> -After 4 years of using it in the shower mostly and not drying it off before storing it head down, the chrome has started to flake a bit on the top curved portion.</li>
            <li> My father turned me onto double edged razor shaving, and once again, the old man proves wise.  </li>
            <li> The grip is wonderful and the razor length is kinda small and old school which is what attracted me in the first place.</li>
            <li> I just received the package a few hours ago and tried it out - Amazing shave!  </li>
            <li> Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades and its the more comfortable shave I can get.</li>
            <li> Whether your new to DE shaving, just shopping around for a new DE razor, or possibly wantiing to gift someone a razor, this is a great razor for any man.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it was so reasonably priced, I was expecting to pay more.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very well made, of smooth stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This nice hunk of stainless steel just feels solid and reliable in your hand, and isn&#x27;t going to degrade with time.</li>
            <li> Then, enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket.</li>
            <li> But remember, the actual blades are just as-if not more-important to make sure you get the smooth, steady shave you are looking for.</li>
            <li> With the initial cost of the safety razor, I was in the hole but after getting it I was delighted to see it in action.</li>
            <li> The razor provides an irritation free shave and has only caused two minor cuts... to be fair, I caused the cuts by speed shaving.</li>
            <li> A shaving stand is nice and pretty, and it keeps everything organized and allows your brush to dry well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> After all is said and done, I doubt very much that I&#x60;ll be using the Edwin Jagger DE89l razor again (packed away); the difference in the quality of the shave between the two is night and day for me.</li>
            <li> I do spend more time shaving now, but hey, I enjoy it, and I know it&#x27;ll be the time well spent!</li>
            <li> I had thought about getting one with a longer handle, and was concerned about the length of this one at first; but as soon as you begin shaving with it, the short handle becomes a virtue, allowing you to spin, tilt and otherwise adjust your shaving angle quickly and easily.    </li>
            <li> Same for the DE razor:  manufacturers discovered they could make more money with an inferior product but call it \\&quot;progress.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> When I first started shaving in the 1970&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Even if I only use each blade 4 times, I will still be able to shave for over a year with 100 blades.</li>
            <li> Just put the hot water in a shaving cup, dip in the brush, make your shaving foam, and use the hot water to dip your razor.</li>
            <li> Good German Engineering apparently applies to their razors also.</li>
            <li> for example, is of much higher quality</li>
            <li> Upon my first shave with this razor</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor, some blades, a cheap badger brush, and some shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street).     </li>
            <li> You can hardly do better than a non-adjustible safety razor made by Merkur if you&#x27;re just starting out.  </li>
            <li> The first is that you should immediately trash the blade that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> My first razor was the Gillette Techmatic--</li>
            <li> I generally get a lot of cuts even with proper prep, good amount of soap on my face, water hydration.</li>
            <li> If you have bigger hands you might dig the Edwin more.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a well made razor that will last for many years.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I no longer get the razor burn and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> This razor is exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to get some blades for him as this only comes with one Merkur blade.  </li>
            <li> Well, that got me interested in wet shaving, which went out of popular style well before I was even conceived.  </li>
            <li> Just finished my first shave with this razor and no cuts, no razor burn, and the closest smoothest shave</li>
            <li> Like many people I did a lot of research before deciding to upgrade to using a double edged (DE) safety razor.</li>
            <li> Very close shave even with one pass and no across or against the grain pass for me yet!</li>
            <li> It was my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor (non-cartridge) and the hype matched the results.</li>
            <li> Do you remember the first time that you shaved with a Mach 3 Turbo?  </li>
            <li> This was my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> And I nicked myself a couple of times the first time.</li>
            <li> While not delivering on a super close shave, the Merkur Classic has the advantage of gliding across beard without tugging.  </li>
            <li> This is one of three Merkur razors I have purchased - the first one was the long-handled version of this one - I purchased for my husband.</li>
            <li> This is one of my first.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> They last longer as well, which makes it an even better deal.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back to the latest fades in shaving.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important to recognize the limits you can achieve, otherwise you&#x27;ll find yourself taking far more passes than would be advisable, especially when the razor burn kicks in.  </li>
            <li> my first shave took me almost 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I first wanted to try a cut-throat razor, but after reading about it a bit I learned i had to learn how to sharpen it, buy a strop for 100 bucks, and the razor itself was over 100.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor, it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I did the more I wanted to purchase a Double Edge.</li>
            <li> First of all, Merkur 178 &#x3D; Merkur 34C &#x3D; Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> It is my first DE razor</li>
            <li> a lot--it&#x27;s heavy, shiny, and the texturing on the handle looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> A slightly longer handle might be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about eight weeks and my first impressions are positive.    </li>
            <li> To change blades, one simply unscrews the top surface which is attached to a long threaded screw inserted into the top of the handle.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used my Merkur Classic was on my chest (my wife likes it smooth) and as it isn&#x27;t particularly hairy it wasn&#x27;t much of a challenge.</li>
            <li> Walking out an hour later after buying nothing since there was so much to choose from that it became too overwhelming to make a choice.</li>
            <li> I just use Nivea Sensitive, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind having something with a more natural smell.</li>
            <li> Also it seems like the \\&quot;Long Handle\\&quot; would cost more then the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However, the closeness of the shave, the reduced irritation, and the warm badger hair brush definitely make it worth the extra time.    </li>
            <li> As they say, \\&quot;Good things come in small packages\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> That said you feel really cool and old fashioned shaving with one of these, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> If you have smaller hands or want a more classic design pick up the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> People and websites say that it takes more time with a classic razor, but in my experience it is about the same.</li>
            <li> Your first shave with this simple, single-blade, stainless steel safety razor from Merkur will not be easy.  </li>
            <li> It used a razor strip rather than blades and one got a new surface by turning a wheel to get fresh blade surface.  </li>
            <li> It felt like the brand new blade was pulling the hairs, not cutting them.</li>
            <li> The posture you&#x27;ll need to use the razor is a bit different than a disposable, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I would say that the learning curve switching from a modular disposable razor is short and easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small safety razor (roughly 3\\&quot; tall), with excellent weight and balance.  </li>
            <li> If I haven&#x27;t convinced you to pay the upfront cost of getting this razor and a pack of 100 blades, I recommend buying an old Gillette Super Speed or Tech razor from an online auction or a Feather Portable razor, along with a blade sample pack from an online retailer.</li>
            <li> Epoxy isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold.    </li>
            <li> Four years later (bought in Apr 2010), it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> (which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how steady your hand is)and it shaves as smooth as fresh as the first time, every time (because you can change out the razor blades which come in huge packs at once for a reasonable price).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is certainly one of them.</li>
            <li> Pick up a good badger brush (best you have the money for), shave pucks if you need them and a few different blades and a stand to dry your brush correctly upside down</li>
            <li> First and only double edged razor I own.</li>
            <li> After many years with the multiblade, titanium, battery powered, \\&quot;real man\\&quot; shaving systems who&#x27;s blades last 2 shaves I decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> If you are considering this as your first safety razor, please note that it&#x27;s significantly shorter than traditional disposable razors.</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews, I went with the Merkur Classic as my first safety razor and couldn&#x27;t be happier.      </li>
            <li> The Merkur classic 178 is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> This was my first classic razor.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used a classic safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself is of very high quality.  </li>
            <li> On the whole, I love this razor and would buy it again in an instant; I&#x27;m not sure why it took me 15 years to try a DE razor, but I&#x27;m sure glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li> Nice once you learn how to use it - if you are not familiar with safety razors.</li>
            <li> There is a little more technique involved using this razor, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> Switched to a double edge (\\&quot;DE\\&quot;) razor after becoming fed up with the high price and inconsistent quality of cartridge-style razors from Gillete (the Atra, Sensor, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Because it is smaller, I can see where the 178 may be a little more managable and agile.  </li>
            <li> It is such a smooth shave and so much cheaper than the five bladed shavers.  </li>
            <li> I also feel smug when out shopping and look at the prices of modern razors blades.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> rugged design, all stainless.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s in a green tube, cost about $10 for enough to last seemingly forever, and it works great!)    </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the cartridge type.  </li>
            <li> This has a much heavier feel.  </li>
            <li> much easier.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll change shaving technologies again when they invent the laser that does your whole face in one pass...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s another thing I really like about a double-edge.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter really.</li>
            <li> Mach 3 and all those razors would leave my skin really irritated and scratched up</li>
            <li> As much as you have to adjust for all the angles of your face, I think I would have struggled with the longer handle.</li>
            <li> Besides, you will want to hold this razor with two fingers anyway, on the very tip, so why get a longer handle?</li>
            <li> However, after using it a few times I realized that the smaller handle is better as I feel I have more control and precision over the blade.</li>
            <li> I change blades weekly and have had no issues; if you go more than a week, you will find that the blades are rough and need to be changed lest you cut your face.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided to buy one for myself and I will never go back to cheap, disposable, plastic razors ever again.</li>
            <li> This razor also has a much closer shave and leaves a smoother finish.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy</li>
            <li> Well, I had an important meeting earlier and had forgotten to shave this morning</li>
            <li> Give a real razor a shot</li>
            <li> Merkur&#x27;s stainless steel blades work well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Although I do enjoy my 38c, having shaved a couple of times with it, I can see why one would opt for the smaller 178.  </li>
            <li> Once you understand how to properly use this you will enjoy your shave if you don&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool based on the necessity to find a cheap way to shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> As others have said, you want to apply light pressure and make multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> Still, it does give a reasonably close shave, or as close as you dare.  </li>
            <li> If I try that with this straight edged thing, I&#x27;ll be going to the emergency room.  </li>
            <li> When using the same blades in both razors, I find the Merkur HD a much smoother and a far better quality shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband two years ago, who had never had a straight razor but wanted one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge guy, but have bigger hands than some, and it fits perfectly in my hand and has enough weight to it that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to lose control.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, you have to pay a little bit more attention to what you are doing with this razor - also, you have to do it right with a badger brush and shaving soap</li>
            <li> Wait til the first time your lady friend feels the new shave and comments on your smoothness.....</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, so this means patting on some more water once or twice while I&#x27;m finishing up.</li>
            <li> You must be more careful using a classic razor as it is easier to cut your face by accident.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s important to be realistic and objective in your assessment when deciding whether or not a safety razor is for you.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would have posted pictures of the two side by side and give a reason as to why one is better then the other or If it even matters.</li>
            <li> The Merkur products are very cost effective, long lasting, and well made, plus the razor blades costs about 1.7 cents a piece.  </li>
            <li> These products aren&#x27;t necessary, but they do add significantly to the pleasure of shaving.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you&#x27;ve even tried to convert to some other brand, hoping that even more razors crammed into a piece of plastic would do the trick.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]]    </li>
            <li> Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany    </li>
            <li> Here are my main thoughts if you don&#x27;t want to read the whole thing:    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely well-built razor, pretty heavy, with a great non-slip handle.</li>
            <li> thing newcomers may find our quickly is that this razor absolutely devours facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Next, you absolutely must keep your face (not just the razor) nice and wet.</li>
            <li> However, since there is a lot more room underneath the blade compared to common N-blade razors, I believe it can definitely cut more hair before it clogs.    </li>
            <li> When I am satisfied I havegotten the ins and outs of this razor down</li>
            <li> Changing razors is a breeze, and with the screw down mechanism, you can feel confident the blade is not shifting, nor going anywhere.</li>
            <li> I am continuing to get \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shaves (better than I could from any other shaving modality I  have used) and can now do it bloodless!</li>
            <li> I did see one comment about others being better, but I can not comment on that as I have only used the German ones.    </li>
            <li> So, I began my research on the Internet and discovered the Merkur Classic Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> I now make about two passes following the grain, then go back for one or two more passes against it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Merkur Classic and have been using it for a week now.  </li>
            <li> being said, the Merkur 178 is a decent shaver on which I learned to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have a giant beard that grows quickly.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I paid $50 to make the transition, but that would have been what I would have paid for 2 packages of Fusion blades that would only last at the most, 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I do have a favorite in the sampler, but I&#x27;ll wait til I&#x27;m running low to order a year&#x27;s supply of the one I like, and that will still only cost about $15.  </li>
            <li> It may be that I&#x27;m still getting used to using a safety razor, but I don&#x27;t feel it shaves as close as my old cheap blue target razors.</li>
            <li> I decided to try wet-shaving using a safety razor, and after reading reviews, I went with the Merkur classic.      </li>
            <li> Combine with a decent blade, brush, and cream, and you&#x27;re on your way.  </li>
            <li> The grip is steady, even with damp hands and the weight of the razor does all the work for you.    </li>
            <li> Mainly because I just use the weight of the razor</li>
            <li> I have yet to use my contemporary five razor over this one.</li>
            <li> one is &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; classic for a reason and while I like the razor (34C)</li>
            <li> I chose the Merkur Classic by the reviews, giving this product high marks.</li>
            <li> If you need a good, long lasting double edge razor then you need a Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The single, straight edge makes shaping sideburns and facial hair pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this or any Merkur model razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> so anyway, extremely high quality product.</li>
            <li> The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather&#x27;s old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave.</li>
            <li> Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to (expensive) replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Besides the purely practical aspects of the length and weight it&#x27;s a classy looking piece of metal.</li>
            <li> It does take a little more time though.  </li>
            <li> Cost effective in the medium-long run with very nice blades (I used the 1 Merkur blade that came with it and some Derby Extras, which were both satisfactory) costing a tiny fraction of even cheap disposable razors, not to mention the outrageous cost of high-end models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, but the older I got, the more retro I started getting; at least with shaving.</li>
            <li> The short-handled razors like this one are great for my small hands and my teenage son, but a man with large hands would probably prefer the long-handled razor (which is about the same length as a Mach razor).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending tons on the latest multi blade refills for years, roughly 2-3 bucks a refill!!!</li>
            <li> the feel, the positive results, the endless supplies of razor blades you can purchase aside from this, and the fact that it is just cool looking.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively soft beard, not the Fred Flinstone type, but it grows fast.  </li>
            <li> After much deliberation, I went with this Merkur and some Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Soap.  </li>
            <li> and it gives him a very close, non-irritating shave (we also use natural goats milk soap rather than chemical \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> Shaves very well, will only nick and scratch on your first time, but from that point on it is close shave after close shave.  </li>
            <li> During my first few strokes I almost reached smooth skinned nirvana</li>
            <li> The initial cost may be more, but you will save money in the long run.    </li>
            <li> With each new design, the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I&#x27;ve never experienced a closer, more satisfying shave outside of an old fashioned barbershop.  </li>
            <li> Also, the included Merkur blade is intensely sharp, but not too sharp as to not allow for a second pass against the grain (where I cut myself, lol).  </li>
            <li> I wanted os much to enjoy this product as I invested in the other accessories.</li>
            <li> The kind that has the little hangar-type doors that open up for blade</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 weeks to get used to the new way of shaving.</li>
            <li> I was given a Gillette cartridge razor and was told this was \\&quot;new and better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and it is still like new.</li>
            <li> This may be my learning curve  with the new razor.  </li>
            <li> My razor could pass for new.  </li>
            <li> just a new blade</li>
            <li> the fact I&#x27;d have to replace the razors that are made for women, whether it&#x27;s paying $30 for a new razor head, or just buying a new razor all together.</li>
            <li> It also takes about a week for your face to get used to the new razor</li>
            <li> I ended up buying my first DE after being interested for a long time in the subject and seeing old second hand ones by the GEM brand for $5 at a local antique fair</li>
            <li> The available replacement blades are all generally sharper than in the disposables, but the design of the #178 allows for some lee-way, you&#x27;re not going to cut yourself as long as you use deliberate strokes and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having done the same exercise with gilette swivel-head razors, my face feels better after the Merkur (though the shave isn&#x27;t as close--I&#x27;m inexperienced).    </li>
            <li> -I went from having a constant red razor burn rash on my neck to basically blemish free skin.</li>
            <li> It really feels and it looks like a very well-made Chinese Product</li>
            <li> I started shaving in the very early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> First of all, to clear away any confusion, the #178 is the same razor as the 34c and the HD Classic/Hefty Classic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the true \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; process, and am hooked.</li>
            <li> First off, there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> Think of going to wall-mart and buying a knockoff tool, and then comparing that same tool to a craftsman or other reputable tool maker.</li>
            <li> I went with the grain of the whiskers first, reapplied some shaving soap, with a boar brush, and then against the grain for the second pass.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this razor and shaved with it using some Taylor of Bond Street avocado cream along with a vulfix brush last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Now I actually look forward to shaving , thats a first for me.</li>
            <li> can and do shave against the grain with this thing, but only after making a first pass with the grain.    </li>
            <li> First things first, this is really the Merkur 34C also known as the Merkur HD (Heavy Duty).  </li>
            <li> Ive had this bad boy for 3 years now, its not going anywhere, blades are super cheap and environmentally this is a more responsible option than your standard supermarket options.</li>
            <li> The learning curve for this guy, or any DE razor, is about 5-10 shaves, but once I got that down, I get a close, smooth, no-cut shave in about 6 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just know that there is a wide range of replacement blades, and it could mean the difference between a slightly better than average shave, and an exceptional shave.</li>
            <li> So far I have been able to learn with this one with only very minimal damage to my face.</li>
            <li> My (old school) barber was interested in my change, so I brought it in to show him the next haircut I had.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful the first times, as there is a tendency to apply too much pressure when you&#x27;re used to M3.</li>
            <li> But I still need a place to put my wet brush down, so a bowl works nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was a shame to realize a classic Fatboy or other DE razors may have been just thrown out and how they&#x27;re worth quite a bit of money today.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because of all the positive reviews, got it a while back</li>
            <li> The razor has a short handle, which is ok for me, but for some guys with larger mitts they would need the long handled razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I have a heavy beard shadow by 11am, but with this I am baby smooth through the day, no irritation, just soft skin.</li>
            <li> All of the pictures of the long handle seem about right as far as height</li>
            <li> The heavy weight and handle length make it easy to get the right angle and pressure to learn the wet shaving method.  </li>
            <li> I did ding that part up a little by dropping it a while back, so I&#x27;m going to say that&#x27;s mostly my fault.</li>
            <li> Does seem to be slightly more aggressive, which seems to works well for my hard stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After you finish shaving rinse your face with cold water and finish by running an Alum Block (Bloc Osma is great) on your face.</li>
            <li> I shaved for 20 years with multi-blade razors and their ilk, and it was a huge waste.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me as a not very aggressive safety razor that you&#x27;ll be able to learn how to wet shave with</li>
            <li> So your total cost in blades for a whole year is about $7 to $8.     </li>
            <li> Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> Whereas I could shave with my old Mach 3 in about 5 minutes, I now set aside about 20.  </li>
            <li> I just took an old electric kettle and put it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Have used it for nearly 6 months now and no complaints here.</li>
            <li> In reality I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  </li>
            <li> Have had a few others and they were build cheap.</li>
            <li> The German&#x27;s really know how to craft a piece of steel, and I doubt it will ever wear out.  </li>
            <li> related recommendation is that you use real shaving soap or cream, not canned foam.</li>
            <li> that I used to get with my old razor.</li>
            <li> You can get cheaper brushes at CVS or Walmart, but they are not going to be near as soft as a quality badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> A box of at least 10 more spare blades.</li>
            <li> Oh, well I now get a shave that my old Fusion, or even Mach 3, couldn&#x27;t get close to.  </li>
            <li> Very well made with durable construction and should last a lifetime or even longer.</li>
            <li> and wow did I feel the difference between my Fusion and the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> You were young, perhaps, and the hair on your face was effeminate and soft.  </li>
            <li> My whole neck is cut up and red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going old school...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stainless steel with a solid weight to it.</li>
            <li> After decades of use with my old Merkur razor, I checked to see if this razor is still being made.  </li>
            <li> I bought the same, identical replacement razor, which should tell you how much I believe in this razor.  </li>
            <li> Went old school and decided to go for the Merkur Safety razor.</li>
            <li> The moral of all of this is, get the double edged razor if the rising cost of banded razors is your primary concern.  </li>
            <li> and I had several nics(this is more about my inexperience, and less about the shaver/blade!)</li>
            <li> Many people who use DE razors buy shaving brushes and various products, which tend to intimidate people due to the time, expense, and technique necessary to use them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette razors for years and only recently discovered this whole world of \\&quot;classic</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, be sure to get a stand to hang the razor when not in use, as its generally not a great idea to have the razor&#x27;s edge so close to a hard surface, as it would be if you just laid the razor down on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #178 has a lot of great points</li>
            <li> The learning curve is not as big as other people seem to think, just make sure not to rush your way through the first few times you shave with it.</li>
            <li> The classic I ordered isn&#x27;t too short.</li>
            <li> You can get expensive creams but the best I have found is an ordinary can of gillette cream.</li>
            <li> These are various names and product numbers used interchangeably for the exact same razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the traditional shaving creams and not the new chemical-based ones; my preference is Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> I prefer the shorter-handle because it encourages me to hold the razor properly and the balance feels a little better than the long-handled ones, but that&#x27;s all personal preference.  </li>
            <li> The only con I can think of is the time it takes to learn to use a DE and the fact that I do have to shave a little more regularly since it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and then cut it like the multi-blade cartridges do.</li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller than I expected, but I warmed up to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a small but important learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this razor and made my first foray into old-fashioned wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to using something like a Mach 3 (as that was my first wet shave razor)or any of the multi-blades this will take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> this is the razor you should start with if you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving.  </li>
            <li> Just like with cheap plastic razors, I usually lather with plain soap in the shower and shave quickly.</li>
            <li> I currently use the Merkur double edge razor blades with this model, but am going to switch to Feather as I have read they are very well made blades; have not had any issues with the Merkur blades, but want to try the others to compare.</li>
            <li> In the end, it&#x27;s only a razor and there is only so much you can accomplish in terms of shaving.  </li>
            <li> A solid and overall very well made product.</li>
            <li> With my banded razor, I could bear down on an area of my face that came out less than smooth after the first try.  </li>
            <li> I spent a good while researching the different types of razors available, and pondered long and hard on whether to get this one or Merkur&#x27;s \\&quot;Heavy Duty\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> I would also like to add that I don&#x27;t normally shave upside down, but did with this razor and got a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I got my first \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shave with this razor the other day.</li>
            <li> A styptic pen (any major drugstore will have them).</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but it is now fun to shave with Mekur Model 178.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a really tough beard; I can&#x27;t say for sure.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I hope this helps other guys who might be taking a look at the Merkur or other classic safety razors.  </li>
            <li> You can get a special shaving bowl, but a small ceramic cereal bowl oreven a cup works just as well.</li>
            <li> handle is a bit short, if you&#x27;ve large hands, I would suggest you consider getting the #180, which is the same basic no-frills design, just a longer handle.</li>
            <li> As I said earlier I sometimes skip a week or two of shaving and my nick name in high school was Teen Wolf.</li>
            <li> I tried soldering it and ended up with the head melting -- apparently it&#x27;s made of die-cast zinc, like a Tootsie Toy or Hotwheels.</li>
            <li> The 5th shave was \\&quot;very good\\&quot; with no nicks and not much</li>
            <li> &quot; They have stringent quality control and a product can only be marked with the \\&quot;Solingen\\&quot; name if it meets the criteria for quality set by the government.</li>
            <li> Apparently it goes under the name HD, 34C and 178 on the internet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s a bare minimum of what you will need.</li>
            <li> I suggest a badger hair brush with some traditional shave cream or soap like Geo F. Trumpers or Trufitt or Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy enough to be a problem.</li>
            <li> Try a single blade, with a decent brush &amp; soap.</li>
            <li> You may cut yourself if your not careful with this classic razor, but its expected to take your time.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have stated, you don&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure.</li>
            <li> the blades are so incredibly sharp that all you need to do is gently \\&quot;wipe\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all about patience - short, careful strokes with almost no pressure (let the weight of the razor do the work) and after the first pass, re-lather and make a second pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being 25 years old and far from financially wealthy, I became sick of paying so much for cartridge blades and looked into my grandpa&#x27;s way of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and wet shaving in general.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to another advantage of this razor: if you put off shaving for too long, this razor doesn&#x27;t pull out long hairs, like contemporary razors do, it cuts them off clean, which is a godsend for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice heavy feel so you don&#x27;t have to press hard on your face.</li>
            <li> I became confused when I noticed it was called the classic but the picture looked so much like the classic HD.</li>
            <li> What once was my most hated and dreaded of chores is now one of my favorite hobbies.</li>
            <li> i had about 4 days of beard growth, i took a shower before shaving, washed my face a few times, kept my face wet, lathered up with dial bar soap [using my hands], and had a nick free shave.</li>
            <li> When I first received this handle, I was a little upset that I had not gotten the longer handle version.</li>
            <li> i havent cut myself with a cartridge razor since i first started shaving, but i was still a little worried after reading reviews and warnings.     </li>
            <li> Edwin Jagger DE89-they&#x27;re a little more refined, less aggressive, and more expensive.</li>
            <li> Small easy strokes with absolutely no pressure except by the weight of this razor are the way to go.  </li>
            <li> A few minor nicks the first few times he used it, but quickly got the hang of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got the razor I intended, but anyone not wanting the heavier razor will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yes, you *WILL* cut yourself the first few times, if you are switching from a \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li> I cut myself the first few times shaving with it.</li>
            <li> I can now shave in 10 mins, but give yourself 30-45 mins for the first few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my older relatives kept their DE razors for many years  but when they went to check for me it turned out they had been thrown out or given away which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re constantly in a hurry to shave and be on your way, I don&#x27;t suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor for that matter.</li>
            <li> I used to get razor burn on my upper lip when using the 3-5 blade systems, but once I switched to this, I have gotten none of it; I can shave daily with no irritation, when with the &#x27;modern&#x27; razors, I would have to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> New to the safety razor arena, but the handle was shorter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use Proraso, but there are plenty of other high quality shaving creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont press down as you would a mach three, or disposable, as you&#x27;re working with the sheer face of a real razor against your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do note that the handle is not very long, at about 75mm total, with 50mm for the actual handle portion.</li>
            <li> The advertised picture on every website that sells the 178 is a little misleading; it appears bigger than it really is.      </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that I would be able to get a \\&quot;barber\\&quot; style shave with it, being an absolute novice with the handling of it.  </li>
            <li> By switching I have lost the terrible, scarring ingrown hairs, the patchy rough spots, the excessive expense of buying replacement cartridges, and instead gained smooth skin, a high quality piece of machined and chromed metal, and shaving has gone from daily chore to a great pleasure.</li>
            <li> Ok, well, it&#x27;s still kind of a chore, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need to stretch my razor blade&#x27;s life (thus cutting my face) because they are so expensive anymore.  </li>
            <li> &quot; What actually happened in these cities was that the public officials were bribed, excuse me, enticed, by the manufacturers of buses, tires and producers of gasoline to scrap all street cars and trollies and enter the 20th century.</li>
            <li> I have tough stubble: the kind that is dark again by 17:00, sticks in your finger like a metal bristle when it gets long enough, and tends to grow inwards, causing me constant ingrown hairs and other irritations at the neck, middle-cheek, and around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s much cheaper past the initial investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please be careful the razor and the brush are not too hot--dip in the hot water, wait a few seconds, test it, etc.</li>
            <li> Now, a few words about the Merkur Classic.</li>
            <li> This razor is built solidly and feels like it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had only one minor nick in 3 weeks, even as a beginner.)    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The proof of the pudding for me is how painless it is to shave long growth with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> It gives a close and long lasting shave.</li>
            <li> In addition, the blades are quite long lasting.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m getting another Murkur razor to replace this one, possibly with a long handle.</li>
            <li> why\\&quot; article at classicshaving.com, and as long as you take a couple extra minutes to shave, you shouldnt have a problem.</li>
            <li> I had hot lather all over my neck, went slow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little less long (half an inch) than the Edwin Jager but provides better grip when wet</li>
            <li> Since that item is missing, I tried the Merkur 178 to apply this new (to me) knowledge.  </li>
            <li> I just had too hard of a time finding blades for it, so I decided to try the Merkur double edge razor because it was highly recommended in several online reviews.</li>
            <li> We had a small fortune invested in the Mach razors - which never really worked except for the first shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn that when shaving off a beard, I had to push harder than expected--</li>
            <li> I had read-up on how to shave carefully, with the grain; tried countless different creams, foams, etc.; scrubbed, cleansed, loofah&#x27;d, etc.; took weekends off from shaving; and nothing ever improved it substantially, until I switched to this razor 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it usually takes me just a few minutes longer to shave if I&#x27;m doing a full lather.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the buying new razor blades for my Gillette Fusion at a high price.</li>
            <li> They no longer make single edge razors, but you can occasionally find the blades.</li>
            <li> Guys, there is a reason the single and double edged \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razors fell out of favor and style.  </li>
            <li> Their only advantage is that they make it almost impossible to cut yourself, and let you fly over chin and jaw without slowing down, but they do so by giving you a much duller blade and a worse shave.    </li>
            <li> Respect the razor, know the proper way to use a safety-razor and you will never want to go back to those other things again.     </li>
            <li> My second shave was on my chest as well - didn&#x27;t have any nicks that time but applied too much pressure and had serious razor burn.     </li>
            <li> The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Vibrator -</li>
            <li> Sadly, too few dads and grand dads have taught us how to shave properly so discovering this type of shaving is unnecessarily scary but don&#x27;t fear , just enjoy and be giddy with the results.</li>
            <li> Long Handle\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> So next step I decided to try wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> You will save money in the long run at the expense of about 5 minutes per shave.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any trouble changing blades, even when half-asleep in the early morning.  </li>
            <li> The lubricating strip on those $2-a-pop multi-blades makes it easier to shave semi-dry, so we forget about the basic physics, which is not really doing us any favors.    </li>
            <li> I expect I&#x27;ll be using this type as long as I shave.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say the shave has ever been without its faults and always having to go back to cover the rough spots: jawline, chin, under nose, neck area, side of neck, sideburns.</li>
            <li> I can also shave without fear of irritation or ingrown hairs, allowing me to do the unthinkable: shave with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain, resulting in the smoothest shave of my life.     </li>
            <li> The small size of this razor will feel different the first few times you shave but its weight makes disposables feel like toys.</li>
            <li> It took ~5 shaves to get comfortable with this style of shaving, but from day 1 I was getting a closer, smoother, and less irritating shave than I ever did with a cartridge.</li>
            <li> The fit and finish on the Merkur 178 is very poor.</li>
            <li> If you choose a different brand, I suggest you don&#x27;t put in the \\&quot;test\\&quot; blade and just start using the other brand from the get</li>
            <li> I used to shave every other day (and deal with stubble on day 2) to stretch my Fusion blades to 2 weeks, but now I shave daily with my $17, one-year&#x27;s supply of razor blades.    </li>
            <li> Yes, I cut myself maybe three times on the middle of my neck (where my beard is thickest) which is nothing compared to the fifteen cuts I got with the Fusion the other day.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Merkur after being rather less than thrilled with the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razors and the cost of replacement blades has gotten absolutely absurd!</li>
            <li> It almost looks like a factory second or third, and there are lots of nicks and the head of the razor looks warped and the blade exposure is uneven.</li>
            <li> I switched to a single edge safety razor a few months back and never looked back.</li>
            <li> started out with a single edge</li>
            <li> But after I placed my order Amazon suggested to me the \\&quot;Murker 180 long handle\\&quot; which doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much different but $10 less.</li>
            <li> Where you may have been forced to use pressure to hold the cartridge-razors of your youth close enough to your skin to actually give you a clean cut, this blade is not some pair of safety scissors - the mere weight of the metal on your skin is enough to close in on even the deepest of furs.    </li>
            <li> I would say I have slightly smaller than average hands for a guy, and if I had the chance to order again, I would go with the longer handle.</li>
            <li> This is probably not normal though.  </li>
            <li> I &#x27;feel&#x27; some stubble growing back the next day, but since I have a fairly slow beard growth rate and only shave twice a week</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t adjust to your face; so shaving takes forever, not because you&#x27;re getting a good shave, but simply because it&#x27;s too irritating and possibly dangerous.</li>
            <li> If you are sick of razor bump and paying wayyyy too much for mach 3 blades, then this is right for you.</li>
            <li> It is a razor that I prefer over my hand me down gillette from the same era.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor simply because I was tired of paying high dollar for the cartridge blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every single type of mass-market plastic razor, from single blade to five blade, none of them remotely compares to the Merkur in terms of functionality, aesthetics, or price.</li>
            <li> I got \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shave #2 with much less blood in about the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> This is the same razor as the 34C (not sure why they use two model numbers for the same razor).     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrics exclusively for the past 7-8 years, until recently my wife has gotten into couponing, and she picked me up a Gillette Fusion something-or-other for next to nothing, so I decided to give it whirl.  </li>
            <li> I feel a bit odd writing this review about a traditionally men&#x27;s product</li>
            <li> Wet shaving with a single blade is not a lost art.</li>
            <li> You have to be gentle, but not in a tedious or difficult way, you just have to take it easy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to be switching brands of blades too often -- blades are a little different.</li>
            <li> The shaves itself are so close that some care has to be taken initially as there is a little learning curve.</li>
            <li> I did cut myself a few times during that time, especially when I tried to shave in a hurry</li>
            <li> After about a month shaving with the #178, I&#x27;ve only noticed a few drawbacks:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took about a week of shaving to get adjusted, and after that not much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> It has been a truly transformative experience, and even easier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I always have to finish the rough spots with my Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> used to get a lot of irritation from shaving but ever since I began wet shaving, I have had no irritation or ingrown hairs at all.</li>
            <li> This razor and wet shaving all-together have introduced me to the \\&quot;lost art\\&quot; of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I exclusively used cartridge shavers for years and the Merkur shaving experience is a REVELATION.Good bye cartridges, forever!I think younger men have to read a few articles on \\&quot; how to shave\\&quot; then take the Merkur in hand with confidence.</li>
            <li> so they keep away from the spent blades.  </li>
            <li> Not light enough to impose the feeling of an inferior throw away razor.&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful to look at&lt;br /&gt;-Razor</li>
            <li> The weight of this helps avoid that predicament because it&#x27;s heavy enough to let it rest and then ride across your face without any added pressure to the razor itself.</li>
            <li> Decided to put this razor in my cabinet after getting tired of paying to much for cartidges that I don&#x27;t think are giving me as close a shave.</li>
            <li> If you are using the higher end razors and cartridges as I was, switch to the Merkur, you will break even in a year or less and be ahead the game for the rest of your life.     </li>
            <li> feel like I do with other shaving implements.</li>
            <li> The derby blades are so sharp the whiskers offer zero resistance.</li>
            <li> , like other reviewers have said, this isn&#x27;t for those of you in a rush.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers have said, there is a learning curve to using it.  </li>
            <li> It can shave extremely close.</li>
            <li> I cannot compare to other safety razors though.  </li>
            <li> Do one stroke with one side, another stroke with the other then rense.  </li>
            <li> The lifetime of the individual blades is usually about two weeks but depends on the brand you buy.</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are indeed sharp.  </li>
            <li> One of the hardest parts about wet shaving is learning to not press down on the razor.</li>
            <li> Note: you will have to get to know your face, you will have to unlearn the bad habits gained from disposable razors, you may shed a few drops of blood, but in the end you will change your life for the better.     </li>
            <li> just be careful because it is so sharp and heavy, if you aren&#x27;t paying attention it is easier to nick yourself than with plastic razors.</li>
            <li> Also, for some reason it was all but impossible to shave the neck clean (there always were some hairs left on the neck after shaving, no matter how hard I tried).</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before ordering this model, and the only negative ones that I read had to do with it&#x27;s length.  </li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re not worth the money.    </li>
            <li> I was never completely happy because I would nearly always get ingrown hairs and irritated skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> i havent found a beard thick enough to clog it yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy so far with this experience.</li>
            <li> But as the years went on and your facial hair became the thick forest of black cable that you currently have to fight off with a weedeater to remove, that Mach 3 Turbo slowly lost your faith.  </li>
            <li> You do not press down when you shave</li>
            <li> I tried everything, pre-shave ointments, steaming, creams, gels, different shaving lubricants, I mean everything.</li>
            <li> A few other things won&#x27;t go amiss:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Pack of 10 is less than $6</li>
            <li> Also, I am using the mirror less and less, instead relying on touch/feel and intuition.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another advantage is that the blades cost WAY less than Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re still shaving the same face, merely using a different tool for the job.  </li>
            <li> I had always used the typical schick and gillette multi blade models, I tried them all.</li>
            <li> The razor will typically come with a Merkur \\&quot;test\\&quot; blade.</li>
            <li> and I typically have to get all my things slightly oversized.</li>
            <li> , you let the razor glide across your skin while slightly changing the angle you hold it.</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out a DE, for much less money, and the merkur series caught my eye.     </li>
            <li> So long suckers.</li>
            <li> If you are a newbie to this type of razor, you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique.</li>
            <li> I have a little irritation on my cheeks, like a slight burn but no rash or cuts.</li>
            <li> It is so heavy that it shaves with just its weight gliding down the face.</li>
            <li> It DOES take a little longer to shave with it as you can&#x27;t just whip it about your face, but after a couple of goes you get the feel for it.    </li>
            <li> However, with a little bit of practice you will get shaves so close</li>
            <li> If you want to save some money and don&#x27;t mind the looks of the stumpy little razor hanging in your razor stand, then go for the 178.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric and all of the multi-blade versions over the years, but never got as close a shave with so little irritation.  </li>
            <li> The handle on this model was a little shorter than I anticipated so</li>
            <li> Today (I don&#x27;t shave everyday)</li>
            <li> A few things to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I came across a few articles on shaving with a safety razor and thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I received my razor today and tried it out a few hours ago.</li>
            <li> My son has a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> This number corresponds to the 34C or \\&quot;Heavy Duty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Just take it slow and check out some of the sites online dedicated to wet shaving for tips.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this product through amazon a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> That took me a few daysto notice.)    </li>
            <li> Still seems like a waste when all one needs it</li>
            <li> The benefit with this is that it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> But you just have to remember to be careful and go slowly.</li>
            <li> A few observations:       </li>
            <li> i read a few \\&quot;how to and why\\&quot; articles online about DE shaving before i attempted to shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my face and head with cartridge razors for the past 4 or 5 years every day, and I finally got sick of paying 25 bucks for 4  new razor heads.</li>
            <li> I was hasty and impatient and the first couple weeks of shaving (I&#x27;m not that hairy of a guy, I only need to shave every other day) were a bit dreadful.  </li>
            <li> The first shaves I had bad razor burn in a few spots.  </li>
            <li> I went from using a Mach 3 with standard shaving gel at the sink to shaving with this (usually with Gillette blades) and Shave Secret shaving oil in the shower.</li>
            <li> For nostalgic reasons, if for no other, I ordered this razor.  </li>
            <li> I am still lazy though, so I don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor nearly everyday for the past 6 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s taken me all these years to figure out that the \\&quot;old\\&quot; safety razors are better in virtually all respects to the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; expensive cartridge razors.     </li>
            <li> I have not experienced a single ingrown hair since switching to a DE kit.     </li>
            <li> Take your time, use a little common sense, and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream is a little easier to work into thick lather compared to shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It needs very little effort.</li>
            <li> never liked the waste of either plastic-encased blade assemblies or disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> As it arrived I was a bit shock how small the device was.</li>
            <li> I have medium-sized hands and the 178 was too small for them.  </li>
            <li> I usually get about a month out of each of my blades.    </li>
            <li> but once you get past that it becomes a pleasure to shave.</li>
            <li> This razor has a small learning curve.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be misleading, as I never got around to actually using it, but I&#x27;m writing the review I wished someone would have written earlier to save me some time and grief.  </li>
            <li> Finally no more ingrown hairs and no more razor burn!</li>
            <li> I almost gave up while using that dull, sticky, blade, and I&#x27;ll be severely disinclined to ever try a Merkur blade again.</li>
            <li> and I hardly had a learning curve moving to the safety razor.</li>
            <li> My wife had complained that my beard was like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may take a few tries to keep you from cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought my Merkur in the late 70&#x27;s, found on vacation.  </li>
            <li> Shaving still sucks.</li>
            <li> I really hate the multi-blade cartridge razors, and electric razors really irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> So, no more Mach 3 cartridges for me!</li>
            <li> Harken back to the days of &#x27;Mad Men&#x27; etc, no Quators for them</li>
            <li> My previous razor was the Trak II Gillette which is now quite difficult to find replacement cartridges, and when I do, they are so costly.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave as rarely as possible, because it was such a horrible process, but this, along with a shaving brush and soap, makes me not mind it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to shave in the shower, which was my previous method that I do like.</li>
            <li> Neither of the cuts were serious, about equivalent to a paper cut.    </li>
            <li> Finally I got fed up with having horrible razor burn and ingrown hairs, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> If you have to force it, your blade is either dull, or you are doing something very, very wrong (like cutting at a very aggressive angle).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken two of them by dropping them on hard surfaces.</li>
            <li> The 4th shave was \\&quot;good\\&quot; but nicked myself badly working a patch of hair on my neck that I just couldn&#x27;t get close enough.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick and dark beard like me you may be initially disappointed after you realize you are still unable to get every single hair.  </li>
            <li> I often skip a week or so of shaving and have no problem cutting it down with this setup (cuts through the beard without pulling).  </li>
            <li> These new crazy razers with 12 blades are just a bad joke.   </li>
            <li> the shave is extremely irritating and it&#x27;s not closer than a mach 3 or fusion shave.</li>
            <li> it comes with, as they&#x27;re known to be dull and just plain bad.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the very small learning curve then this razor is for you!</li>
            <li> I find that one out of 40 blades or thereabouts I get a lousy shave.</li>
            <li> The #178 is just some random number assigned by the distributor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
            <li> This design requires the blade to rest on the rod while the cover is placed, which unfortunately requires holding the blade while you insert the rod.</li>
            <li> i dont think ill buy another cartridge razor again.    </li>
            <li> My electronic razor is a disappointment compared to this.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want cold lather on your face, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because I was rooting for the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this</li>
            <li> Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still hate the repetition of it though.</li>
            <li> But the neck is burning, sore and bloody.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still just as time consuming and boring.</li>
            <li> After rinsing and drying my neck was tore up something awful to the point I am embarrassed to go out.</li>
            <li> I look awful.</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving, this has changed my perspective!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I like the shorter handle for control.  The blade is easy to change and I can get a nice, close shave with this unit.  It cleans up very quickly.  I&#x27;d certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of shaving systems: electric shavers (higher-end Braun and Norelco/Philips) and, of course, the ubiquitous multi-blade cartridge razors from Gillette. I was never completely happy because I would nearly always get ingrown hairs and irritated skin on my neck. Also, for some reason it was all but impossible to shave the neck clean (there always were some hairs left on the neck after shaving, no matter how hard I tried). Using irritation-fighting skin creams didn&#x27;t help a bit. Enter a double-edge Merkur razor... It took me about 2 weeks to get used to the new way of shaving. I did cut myself a few times during that time, especially when I tried to shave in a hurry (never do that with a razor like this!) Now, about 3 weeks later, I&#x27;m very happy. I can get a really smooth shave, closer than I&#x27;ve ever had, including in the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas like the neck. So, no more Mach 3 cartridges for me! I do spend more time shaving now, but hey, I enjoy it, and I know it&#x27;ll be the time well spent! Now, a few words about the Merkur Classic. It&#x27;s an extremely well-built razor, pretty heavy, with a great non-slip handle. It feels good just to hold it, unlike those modern plasticky shiny Gillette handles. And as any good tool, it \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; in your hand when you shave. I highly recommend this product. Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> This razor gives a satisfactory shave, but if you drop it in the sink the threaded portion will break off the head, and you&#x27;ll have no way of attaching the handle. There is no way I know of to repair it. I tried soldering it and ended up with the head melting -- apparently it&#x27;s made of die-cast zinc, like a Tootsie Toy or Hotwheels. Epoxy isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold.    I&#x27;ve broken two of them by dropping them on hard surfaces. So beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for 6 months now and am very pleased with it. To be honest, my main motivation was the sticker shock of dropping a pack of modern, 3 bladed cartridges into my shopping cart. \\&quot;$20-odd bucks for blades??? What a con. There are machines out there stamping these out by the thousand a hour\\&quot;. Men have been shaving for hundreds of years and they didn&#x27;t need to shell out that kind of money. Harken back to the days of &#x27;Mad Men&#x27; etc, no Quators for them and they got by ok.     To be honest, it does not shave as close as the modern cartridges, so technology has moved on. I &#x27;feel&#x27; some stubble growing back the next day, but since I have a fairly slow beard growth rate and only shave twice a week anyway it is not an issue. I did switch up to a cream-in-a-squeezy-bottle type shaving foam instead of a spray can, but skipped the badger hair brush etc. It DOES take a little longer to shave with it as you can&#x27;t just whip it about your face, but after a couple of goes you get the feel for it.    My (old school) barber was interested in my change, so I brought it in to show him the next haircut I had. He said the Merkur blades were the best out there. I did see one comment about others being better, but I can not comment on that as I have only used the German ones.    I like the heft of the razor and the build quality. I was surprised it was so reasonably priced, I was expecting to pay more. I also feel smug when out shopping and look at the prices of modern razors blades. Pack of 10 is less than $6 and I am only on my third blade. I figure it will pay for itself several times over it&#x27;s lifespan. So long suckers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because of all the positive reviews, got it a while back and I love using it, But after I placed my order Amazon suggested to me the \\&quot;Murker 180 long handle\\&quot; which doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much different but $10 less. All of the pictures of the long handle seem about right as far as height but I really can&#x27;t tell. The classic I ordered isn&#x27;t too short. I wish someone would have posted pictures of the two side by side and give a reason as to why one is better then the other or If it even matters. Could have saved me some time and money. Also it seems like the \\&quot;Long Handle\\&quot; would cost more then the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; because more material is used and its more of a specialty item but that is not the case, makes you wonder if the $40 price is inflated some.  This is the one I ordered  [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]  This is the \\&quot;Murker 180 Long Handle\\&quot;  [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> If you want a new shaver to pass to your grandchildren, this is a great choice. Wet shaving with a single blade is not a lost art. These new crazy razers with 12 blades are just a bad joke.   Want a smooth shave that won&#x27;t take off your face? Try a single blade, with a decent brush &amp; soap. You won&#x27;t go back to the goop in a can, and a face remover.  H  PS: If you want something passed along check out the e-bay auctions.</li>
            <li> Many decades ago in the USA streetcar tracks were ripped out in cities all across the country and replaced with buses. And it was called \\&quot;progress.\\&quot; What actually happened in these cities was that the public officials were bribed, excuse me, enticed, by the manufacturers of buses, tires and producers of gasoline to scrap all street cars and trollies and enter the 20th century. The product that replaced the street car was actually inferior. Same for the DE razor:  manufacturers discovered they could make more money with an inferior product but call it \\&quot;progress.\\&quot;    The first time I used my Merkur Classic was on my chest (my wife likes it smooth) and as it isn&#x27;t particularly hairy it wasn&#x27;t much of a challenge. Holding the razor lightly I only nicked myself twice around the collar bone. My second shave was on my chest as well - didn&#x27;t have any nicks that time but applied too much pressure and had serious razor burn.     The third shave was on my face and I rate that shave \\&quot;fair\\&quot; with no nicks. The 4th shave was \\&quot;good\\&quot; but nicked myself badly working a patch of hair on my neck that I just couldn&#x27;t get close enough. What made the 4th shave \\&quot;good\\&quot; was that I relaxed and trusted myself, actually closing my eyes and going by feel like I do with other shaving implements. The 5th shave was \\&quot;very good\\&quot; with no nicks and not much mirror time as I was in the zone. The only problem I have now isn&#x27;t with the Merkur or the blade but simply discovering the best was to get those 2-3 places on my neck and jaw line that aren&#x27;t easily shaved.    Update:  I got my first \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shave with this razor the other day. By \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; I mean superior to any 4 blade contraption or the latest from Braun or Norelco. It wasn&#x27;t bloodless however and it wasn&#x27;t quick. Today (I don&#x27;t shave everyday) I got \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shave #2 with much less blood in about the same amount of time. Also, I am using the mirror less and less, instead relying on touch/feel and intuition.    When I am satisfied I havegotten the ins and outs of this razor down pat I may upgrade to a Merkur Futur.    Another update:  I am continuing to get \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; shaves (better than I could from any other shaving modality I  have used) and can now do it bloodless! However, I would not recommend this product to everyone ... my brother for example, or anyone else who just couldn&#x27;t be bothered to take the time to gain skill at using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a year and a half. This is the same razor as the 34C (not sure why they use two model numbers for the same razor).     When I first started shaving in the 1970&#x27;s I used a Gillette adjustable safety razor. When I went off to college I was given a Gillette cartridge razor and was told this was \\&quot;new and better\\&quot;. It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s taken me all these years to figure out that the \\&quot;old\\&quot; safety razors are better in virtually all respects to the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; expensive cartridge razors.     A few things to keep in mind. After using something like a Mach 3, switching to the Merkur HD will take a week or so to get used to. You must be more careful using a classic razor as it is easier to cut your face by accident. However, with a little bit of practice you will get shaves so close you won&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible with this circa 1904 technology. Trust me, it&#x27;s true. You will get the best shave of your life.     Here are some tips. Use a good razor blade. I recommend the \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot;. They are very, very good; not too aggressive, just right. I find that one out of 40 blades or thereabouts I get a lousy shave. Probably a manufacturing glitch. Each blade lasts me about 6 shaves. You can buy a pack of 100 blades for about $14 or $15 on Amazon.com. So your total cost in blades for a whole year is about $7 to $8.     Also, buy yourself a good \\&quot;super badger\\&quot; shaving brush and some Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream. After you finish shaving rinse your face with cold water and finish by running an Alum Block (Bloc Osma is great) on your face. After a month or so of using these products your skin will look fantastic.</li>
            <li> After about a month shaving with the #178, I&#x27;ve only noticed a few drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a bit short, if you&#x27;ve large hands, I would suggest you consider getting the #180, which is the same basic no-frills design, just a longer handle. I would say I have slightly smaller than average hands for a guy, and if I had the chance to order again, I would go with the longer handle. The posture you&#x27;ll need to use the razor is a bit different than a disposable, but easy to get used to. The overall weight is good, heavier than a disposable system razor, but if you want something hefty, look for the HD models, which are a good deal heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to get a stand to hang the razor when not in use, as its generally not a great idea to have the razor&#x27;s edge so close to a hard surface, as it would be if you just laid the razor down on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #178 has a lot of great points though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rugged design, all stainless. Changing razors is a breeze, and with the screw down mechanism, you can feel confident the blade is not shifting, nor going anywhere. I would say that the learning curve switching from a modular disposable razor is short and easy to deal with. The available replacement blades are all generally sharper than in the disposables, but the design of the #178 allows for some lee-way, you&#x27;re not going to cut yourself as long as you use deliberate strokes and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally would recommend getting some Derby Extra DE blades [[ASIN:B0013RZ2ZM \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]], I find they are better than the Merkur blade that comes included, but that&#x27;s another review. Just know that there is a wide range of replacement blades, and it could mean the difference between a slightly better than average shave, and an exceptional shave.</li>
            <li> I was not in anyway dissapointed when I bought this product, in fact, I feel like I wasted so much money and effort on those Mach 3s.  Shaves very well, will only nick and scratch on your first time, but from that point on it is close shave after close shave.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and look of the razor a lot--it&#x27;s heavy, shiny, and the texturing on the handle looks and feels good. The handle isn&#x27;t too short for my rather average-sized hands.    I just used this razor to remove 3 weeks of beard--took me 1/2 hour or so. Having done the same exercise with gilette swivel-head razors, my face feels better after the Merkur (though the shave isn&#x27;t as close--I&#x27;m inexperienced).    The razor didn&#x27;t do as well as I had hoped regarding clogging--it still clogged when confronted with a beard. However, since there is a lot more room underneath the blade compared to common N-blade razors, I believe it can definitely cut more hair before it clogs.    I was surprised to learn that when shaving off a beard, I had to push harder than expected--plenty of advice floating around the internet says, \\&quot;Use no pressure, just let the razor&#x27;s weight do the work.\\&quot; However, that doesn&#x27;t work when attacking a beard.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]]    From Kimbo&#x27;s husband: The Fig Newton.  This is one fine razor!  My previous razor was the Trak II Gillette which is now quite difficult to find replacement cartridges, and when I do, they are so costly.  So, I began my research on the Internet and discovered the Merkur Classic Safety Razor.  I found one in an upscale shaving boutique store in one of Atlanta&#x27;s more prestigious malls in Buckhead.  There I managed to handle one and look it over.  Pleased with what I saw, I placed the order through Amazon saving a good 25% of the cost, even with shipping.  When it arrived at my home, I immediately began to use it.  Wow, what an amazing difference!  Precision engineered and beautifully crafted in Germany, this razor shines!  I love it.</li>
            <li> I admit, I used to use those multi-bladed razors. I just didn&#x27;t know any better. I came across a few articles on shaving with a safety razor and thought I would give it a shot. I love it!! Much better of a shave then the newer cartridge types!! Just take your time, rushing will lead to irritation and possibly cuts!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father. The quality and finish are great. The grip is comfortable and won&#x27;t slip. I had never bought anything from this brand before, but now would definitely do it again.</li>
            <li> If I had all the information on how to get a good shave with a single edge that is now available on the Internet, I would probably still be using my old Schick injector instead of abandoning it many years ago.  Since that item is missing, I tried the Merkur 178 to apply this new (to me) knowledge.  The heavy weight and handle length make it easy to get the right angle and pressure to learn the wet shaving method.  So far I have been able to learn with this one with only very minimal damage to my face.</li>
            <li> Being 25 years old and far from financially wealthy, I became sick of paying so much for cartridge blades and looked into my grandpa&#x27;s way of shaving.  After reading lots of reviews, I went with the Merkur Classic as my first safety razor and couldn&#x27;t be happier.      First off, there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.  I was hasty and impatient and the first couple weeks of shaving (I&#x27;m not that hairy of a guy, I only need to shave every other day) were a bit dreadful.  If you buy this razor, I really encourage you to take a few minutes to study the direction that your hairs grow.  I now make about two passes following the grain, then go back for one or two more passes against it.  I&#x27;m also using a badger hair brush ($25) and some shaving cream that I found at Bath &amp; Body Works (It&#x27;s in a green tube, cost about $10 for enough to last seemingly forever, and it works great!)    Be warned that these will take more time to shave with.  Whereas I could shave with my old Mach 3 in about 5 minutes, I now set aside about 20.  However, the closeness of the shave, the reduced irritation, and the warm badger hair brush definitely make it worth the extra time.    Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany    I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. My wife had complained that my beard was like sandpaper. I got a shaving brush,  shaving soap, and used my Safety Razor which worked but still not the  best.  Decided to order the above. I was worried about the plastic on the  razor I read about, but no one else talked about it and people stated they used the razor over 20 years and it is still like new. So I said, maybe they improved the razor.  The razor came in the mail and I could find no plastic or non metal part. The Merkur worked better than my old Safety Razor I have used since 1957.  This was with the same shaving brush and   shaving soap. The only change was with the razor. They have the razor  design right. I did test my American razor blades against the Merkur  blade and the Merkur blade did cut closer.  This may be my learning curve  with the new razor.  Again I am happy with Amazon reviewers and I am  one too.  My wife said my result is better.</li>
            <li> I received my razor today and tried it out a few hours ago. I have been using the Gillette razors for years and only recently discovered this whole world of \\&quot;classic shaving\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with a single edge Gem razor I found in an antique shop. They no longer make single edge razors, but you can occasionally find the blades. I just had too hard of a time finding blades for it, so I decided to try the Merkur double edge razor because it was highly recommended in several online reviews. I also ordered some Derby extra blades to use with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lathering up and assembling the razor with one of the Derby Extra blades, I had a very smooth and pleasant shaving experience. I am thoroughly pleased with it. The derby blades are so sharp the whiskers offer zero resistance. It glides through them as if they aren&#x27;t even there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers have stated, you don&#x27;t need to apply as much pressure. the blades are so incredibly sharp that all you need to do is gently \\&quot;wipe\\&quot; the lather off you face with the razor and the whiskers come off with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, like other reviewers have said, this isn&#x27;t for those of you in a rush. I&#x27;d still keep a modern razor handy for those times when you are in a hurry (or a lot of bandaids and styptic pencils). This is for those times when you want to really enjoy a great, close, careful shave. It&#x27;s like the man version of a bubble bath, a way to spoil yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another advantage is that the blades cost WAY less than Gillette cartridges. I got the 100 pack of derby blades for 15 dollars. Even if I only use each blade 4 times, I will still be able to shave for over a year with 100 blades. At 15 cents per blade that beats the heck out of the Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to treat yourself to a luxurious, traditional shave this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Once I started using water I had just boiled, shaving with this became a two minute pleasure with almost zero nicks. I just took an old electric kettle and put it in the bathroom. Just put the hot water in a shaving cup, dip in the brush, make your shaving foam, and use the hot water to dip your razor. Please be careful the razor and the brush are not too hot--dip in the hot water, wait a few seconds, test it, etc. This improved my ease of shaving with this merkur a ton. I use the derby blades, they work fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this after feeling the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; of paying twelve dollars for 5 of the multiblade replacements for the Gillette Sensor.  I&#x27;ve had the Merkur Classic and have been using it for a week now.  This product is very solid, well-made and will no doubt last a lifetime.  As some of the other reviewers have said, there is a learning curve to using it.  The first shaves I had bad razor burn in a few spots.  After learning to take my time and be more careful I discovered that the Merkur gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I don&#x27;t use a brush or shaving soap but shave wet with an almond oil-base shaving oil and it works great.   The solid metal of the razor stays warm from the water while shaving creating a luxurious and relaxing shaving experience.   Even better, you can find 100 \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; brand replacement blades online for around $15.  Considering I&#x27;m getting a week&#x27;s use per blade this is not bad for a five years supply!  I would recommend this, hands down,  to anyone looking for the best shave of their life and a huge cost savings over modern multiblade razors!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor. And a great beginner razor for those exploring DE wet shaving. Note this is really the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty. The #178 is just some random number assigned by the distributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a great shave, unlearn your Mach3/Fusion holds. Hold the razor as if you&#x27;re holding a dart (i.e. playing darts at a bar). Let the razors own weight do the shaving. To learn more on how to get a great shave from this razor, watch Mantic59&#x27;s series of videos on safety razor wet shaving techniques on YouTube.</li>
            <li> This is the razor of choice. Good German Engineering apparently applies to their razors also. The Merkur DE Safety razor does a good job of holding the blade in place for a wet shave. Have used it for nearly 6 months now and no complaints here.</li>
            <li> My son has a heavy beard. Multi blade razors keep cloging up while he&#x27;s trying to saving.  I decided to buy him a quality German safety razor for his birthday. I chose the Merkur Classic by the reviews, giving this product high marks.The delivery was timely. The razor meets the expectation. It&#x27;s of good quality steel,with a hefty feel. My son is very pleased with the effortless saving experience.  Considering what some multi blade razors cost, the purchase price of this quality German safety razor will be recovered in the savings, compairing the purchase price differential of safety razors vs. multi blade razors.  Merkur Clasic is a life time quality razor.</li>
            <li> Beautiful simplicity. Very satisfied with this after 6 months.</li>
            <li> This razor is great. I have tried many shaving systems and nothing beats this. It can shave extremely close. It is very comfortable.  And it is cheap to use. My electronic razor is a disappointment compared to this.  This is one luxuries razor that Gillett can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this razor and made my first foray into old-fashioned wet shaving.  I spent a good while researching the different types of razors available, and pondered long and hard on whether to get this one or Merkur&#x27;s \\&quot;Heavy Duty\\&quot; razor.  I&#x27;m glad I went with this one, as the weight of the head is just right and I got a nice, easy shave out of it the first time I tried.  I prefer the shorter-handle because it encourages me to hold the razor properly and the balance feels a little better than the long-handled ones, but that&#x27;s all personal preference.  On the whole, I love this razor and would buy it again in an instant; I&#x27;m not sure why it took me 15 years to try a DE razor, but I&#x27;m sure glad I finally did.  My Gillette Fusion ProGlide is going back into the medicine cabinet, never to return.</li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor, and while it gets the job done, there are much better razors out there. The [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]] for example, is of much higher quality and it&#x27;s actually cheaper than the Merkur 178/HD. The fit and finish on the Merkur 178 is very poor. It almost looks like a factory second or third, and there are lots of nicks and the head of the razor looks warped and the blade exposure is uneven. The Edwin Jagger does not suffer from these flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the Merkur 178 is a decent shaver on which I learned to shave with a safety razor. I like the short handle which makes it very easy to maneuver with, and the thick knurled handle provides excellent grip. Changing blades is easy because it&#x27;s a two piece razor, and you just have to unscrew the head by turning the knob on the bottom of the handle. However, it is not the smoothest shaver, and the Edwin Jagger beats the Merkur 178 in that aspect as well. And you might as well just throw out the Merkur blade it comes with, as they&#x27;re known to be dull and just plain bad.</li>
            <li> Quality product, great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur after reading lots of great reviews, and because I have a nostalgia for old fashioned things.  I used it for about a month, and then for comparison I switched back to my Sensor Excel.  No comparison.  For closeness and ease of shaving the sensor was just much, much better.  I was really disappointed because I was rooting for the Merkur.  In reality I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not, in some way, improved?  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a really tough beard; I can&#x27;t say for sure.  The one place where the Merkur came out ahead was that I noticed I never got any nicks or cuts while using it.  But again, I didn&#x27;t get a close shave either.  So, the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys (based on the reviews), but it isn&#x27;t for every beard.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I hope this helps other guys who might be taking a look at the Merkur or other classic safety razors.  Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, looks good. When I took it out of its box, I could immediately tell I was holding a tool that was made with pride. The finish was beautiful, everything fit precisely together. Think of going to wall-mart and buying a knockoff tool, and then comparing that same tool to a craftsman or other reputable tool maker. You can tell the difference by sight/weight/balance and feel. I also purchased a parker 22r gunmetal finish butterfly safety razor - I recommend the merkur. I learned Merkur is owned by Dovo - a reputable straight razor company located in Solingen, Germany known as the \\&quot;city of blades.\\&quot; They have stringent quality control and a product can only be marked with the \\&quot;Solingen\\&quot; name if it meets the criteria for quality set by the government. This merkur razor is branded Solingen. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: when I purchased this razor I did so thinking it was the HD (34C) version of this razor. I became confused when I noticed it was called the classic but the picture looked so much like the classic HD. Anyway, the razor arrived and the manufacturer item number on the box is 9034001. This number corresponds to the 34C or \\&quot;Heavy Duty\\&quot;. Apparently it goes under the name HD, 34C and 178 on the internet. I can&#x27;t say if this is a mistake on the part of the various vendors or if Merkur perhaps changed the name somewhere along the line? I&#x27;m happy I got the razor I intended, but anyone not wanting the heavier razor will be disappointed. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! Have had a few others and they were build cheap. This one is well crafted and made right so you actually can shave without worrying about razor cuts all over your face.</li>
            <li> The Merkur classic 178 is my first safety razor.  My father turned me onto double edged razor shaving, and once again, the old man proves wise.  I read the reviews before ordering this model, and the only negative ones that I read had to do with it&#x27;s length.  Granted, it is short, but the length provides accuracy I believe.  The weight of this instrument is great in the hand, and the build is impeccable.  The German&#x27;s really know how to craft a piece of steel, and I doubt it will ever wear out.  Upon my first shave with this razor I was a little skeptical that I would be able to get a \\&quot;barber\\&quot; style shave with it, being an absolute novice with the handling of it.  For the most part, I just let it slide, with it&#x27;s own weight on my face and the rest is history.  I went with the grain of the whiskers first, reapplied some shaving soap, with a boar brush, and then against the grain for the second pass.  Wow, how close and clean this razor performs!!  It takes almost no effort at all to be honest.  It does take a little more time though.  I will never go back to the disposable, plastic monstrosities that are on the market today.  The Merkur products are very cost effective, long lasting, and well made, plus the razor blades costs about 1.7 cents a piece.  Much cheaper than the cartridge type.  Buy this razor, you will thank yourself....</li>
            <li> Last year I finally got fed up with paying extortion prices to Gillette.  I tried an electric razor for about a month and that sucked (Braun).  So next step I decided to try wet shaving.  Purchased this razor, some blades, a cheap badger brush, and some shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street).     Everything has worked out great.  I have a giant beard that grows quickly.  I often skip a week or so of shaving and have no problem cutting it down with this setup (cuts through the beard without pulling).  Best shave I&#x27;ve every gotten and I wish I&#x27;d started this sooner.      I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing all this stuff, but it has worked out great.  Took about a week of shaving to get adjusted, and after that not much of a problem.  Just take it slow and check out some of the sites online dedicated to wet shaving for tips.     If you&#x27;re contemplating make the jump, do it! You will save money in the long run at the expense of about 5 minutes per shave.      I have dropped this razor without issue.  I have used it exclusively since November 2009.  I can only compare it to the cartridge razors I used before.  This has a much heavier feel.  I cannot compare to other safety razors though.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve owned, and may be the only one I&#x27;ll ever need.     Only problem I have ever had was the occasional clog.  Crank the water up or unscrew the bottom 1 turn and it&#x27;s gone.  This is probably not normal though.  As I said earlier I sometimes skip a week or two of shaving and my nick name in high school was Teen Wolf.</li>
            <li> Switched to a double edge (\\&quot;DE\\&quot;) razor after becoming fed up with the high price and inconsistent quality of cartridge-style razors from Gillete (the Atra, Sensor, etc.).  I chose the Merkur based its simple construction and favorable user comments.  I have been using this razor for about eight weeks and my first impressions are positive.    The razor itself is of very high quality.  You will feel the difference the second you pick it up.  The Merkur&#x27;s two-piece design is simple to open and it holds the blade evenly.  I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any trouble changing blades, even when half-asleep in the early morning.  The blade is perfectly aligned every time.  The guard is sized well and is very forgiving if you get impatient.    The shave quality is good, but temper your expectations.  You&#x27;re still shaving the same face, merely using a different tool for the job.  Your choice of blade and shaving cream or soap will have more to do with the quality of your shave than the razor itself (Derby Extra blades are my favorite).  I have not experienced a single ingrown hair since switching to a DE kit.     Overall, I am happy with this razor.  It does a fine job of holding the blade and is easy to handle.  When used with a quality blade and proper shave soap it will give you a shave closer than that of a 2/3/4/5-blade cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> First things first, this is really the Merkur 34C also known as the Merkur HD (Heavy Duty).  The 178 is just a number that the distributor gave it.    As they say, \\&quot;Good things come in small packages\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s small safety razor (roughly 3\\&quot; tall), with excellent weight and balance.  It&#x27;s a three piece, and you must unscrew it to replace blades.  It was recommended to me as a not very aggressive safety razor that you&#x27;ll be able to learn how to wet shave with much easier.  Overall a very popular safety razor that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do perfectly.</li>
            <li> You can hardly do better than a non-adjustible safety razor made by Merkur if you&#x27;re just starting out.  The only one that might be a better choice is the \\&quot;hefty\\&quot; variant of the Classic, but it costs a bit more, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for a year now and I really love it.  Remember: the blade you put in it is even more important than the razor!  Your milage may vary, but the Merkur blades are not the best.  Try Swedish Gillettes or Derbys, Israelis, or - my fav - the ninja-sharp Feathers from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember: no pressure when you shave with these!  Let the weight of the razor do the work, and make multiple passes, lathering each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through amazon a few weeks ago. It&#x27;s truly a piece of trash. the shave is extremely irritating and it&#x27;s not closer than a mach 3 or fusion shave. It doesn&#x27;t adjust to your face; so shaving takes forever, not because you&#x27;re getting a good shave, but simply because it&#x27;s too irritating and possibly dangerous. If you want a good, cheap shave. buy Target Brand razors. they are cheap and give you a great shave. thanks</li>
            <li> I shaved for 20 years with multi-blade razors and their ilk, and it was a huge waste. How did we ever get so brain-washed by Gillette? Their only advantage is that they make it almost impossible to cut yourself, and let you fly over chin and jaw without slowing down, but they do so by giving you a much duller blade and a worse shave.    I have tough stubble: the kind that is dark again by 17:00, sticks in your finger like a metal bristle when it gets long enough, and tends to grow inwards, causing me constant ingrown hairs and other irritations at the neck, middle-cheek, and around the mouth. I had read-up on how to shave carefully, with the grain; tried countless different creams, foams, etc.; scrubbed, cleansed, loofah&#x27;d, etc.; took weekends off from shaving; and nothing ever improved it substantially, until I switched to this razor 3 weeks ago. Suddenly: the irritations are gone, my shave lasts all day, my face is smoother, and I&#x27;m paying a fraction of the price for the blades. It has been a truly transformative experience, and even easier than I expected. (I&#x27;ve had only one minor nick in 3 weeks, even as a beginner.)    HOWEVER, there are some important things to learn for this to work. The first is that you should immediately trash the blade that comes with the razor. I almost gave up while using that dull, sticky, blade, and I&#x27;ll be severely disinclined to ever try a Merkur blade again. But then I got some nice Wilkinsons and the whole experience was transformed: smooth, quick, and effective.    Next, you absolutely must keep your face (not just the razor) nice and wet. I live in a dry climate, so this means patting on some more water once or twice while I&#x27;m finishing up. The lubricating strip on those $2-a-pop multi-blades makes it easier to shave semi-dry, so we forget about the basic physics, which is not really doing us any favors.    (Don&#x27;t forget to dispose of your blades safely by putting them into the back-side of the dispenser. That took me a few daysto notice.)    I can&#x27;t compare this razor to others like it yet. However, it&#x27;s very well made, of smooth stainless steel. The textured grip provides a rock-solid hold while you shave. The opening mechanism is machined perfectly, and is easy enough to work with, although I&#x27;m tempted to try one of the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; mechanisms some day, if they shave as well. I had thought about getting one with a longer handle, and was concerned about the length of this one at first; but as soon as you begin shaving with it, the short handle becomes a virtue, allowing you to spin, tilt and otherwise adjust your shaving angle quickly and easily.    Lastly, the whole experience is just much more satisfying. This nice hunk of stainless steel just feels solid and reliable in your hand, and isn&#x27;t going to degrade with time. I won&#x27;t be going back. I&#x27;ll change shaving technologies again when they invent the laser that does your whole face in one pass...</li>
            <li> I bought this razor simply because I was tired of paying high dollar for the cartridge blades.  This one takes the standard DE blade. The razor has a short handle, which is ok for me, but for some guys with larger mitts they would need the long handled razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a good solid feel and is well balanced, which is important when you are going to cut yourself, if it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may take a few tries to keep you from cutting yourself. Luckily, there is help out there. From books, to youtube videos and shaving blogs, help is at your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a nice addition to my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this quality razor for years to come.</li>
            <li> I started shaving in the very early 70&#x27;s.  My first razor was the Gillette Techmatic--anyone else remember these?  It used a razor strip rather than blades and one got a new surface by turning a wheel to get fresh blade surface.  My father was a Gillette double-edge user while I was growing up, and I ended up with one myself.  The kind that has the little hangar-type doors that open up for blade change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with those--they gum up the mechanism over time with accumulated shaving cream.  I bought my Merkur in the late 70&#x27;s, found on vacation.  I was fascinated by the mechanism--so much simpler and easier to keep clean.  To change blades, one simply unscrews the top surface which is attached to a long threaded screw inserted into the top of the handle.  Put the new blade in, put the top on and screw down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used my Merkur since I was in my 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now.  How many shaves would that be?  My razor could pass for new.  Periodically I can just brush the disassembled razor parts with some dish detergent and it looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never liked the waste of either plastic-encased blade assemblies or disposable razors.  Still seems like a waste when all one needs it just a new blade surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a blade snob.  I have happily used Gillette, Merkur, Personna, Walgreen&#x27;s, Wilkinson blades.  I have a relatively soft beard, not the Fred Flinstone type, but it grows fast.  It&#x27;s another thing I really like about a double-edge.  If you go on vacation and skip shaving a week or so it won&#x27;t--can&#x27;t--clog up like the multiblade systems.  I&#x27;ve ended up loaning mine to friends on camping trips when theirs can&#x27;t cut the mustard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these Merkur razors is an investment, as mine proves.  I am amazed when I see what replacement blades for these multiblade systems cost.  I expect I&#x27;ll be using this type as long as I shave.</li>
            <li> Hundredth review right now on this product! Cool!     Merkur 178 and 34C is the same razor. It&#x27;s just different codes by who is selling the razor.     This Merkur is very nice. The grip is wonderful and the razor length is kinda small and old school which is what attracted me in the first place. Bought this 4 months ago. Traded off and on with an Edwin Jager which my last review. The Edwin has nice plating and appearance. I prefer this shorter razor though. Not sure why. I&#x27;ve used 3 blades with it: generic Kroger, Feather, Wilkinson &#x27;Sword&#x27;. The blade is the biggest thing. I prefered the generic actually.     I ended up buying my first DE after being interested for a long time in the subject and seeing old second hand ones by the GEM brand for $5 at a local antique fair I went to one afternoon to abide some time. Walking out an hour later after buying nothing since there was so much to choose from that it became too overwhelming to make a choice. Seeing the razors made me want to buy one or two to try and see why everyone was raving about them. One of my older relatives kept their DE razors for many years  but when they went to check for me it turned out they had been thrown out or given away which was disappointing. They said they always used Gillette brand from the 1950s on and that GEM&#x27;s were the cheap brand of their day. It&#x27;s was a shame to realize a classic Fatboy or other DE razors may have been just thrown out and how they&#x27;re worth quite a bit of money today.    I shave every 2-3 days and I can&#x27;t say the shave has ever been without its faults and always having to go back to cover the rough spots: jawline, chin, under nose, neck area, side of neck, sideburns. It&#x27;s fun to shave with a DE razor. It still hurts and it&#x27;s never cut like butter like some people claim. I generally get a lot of cuts even with proper prep, good amount of soap on my face, water hydration. I always have to finish the rough spots with my Panasonic electric razor. Even 4-5 multiple good passes doesn&#x27;t get it smooth with the DE. And I still have to put on After Shave at the end before finishing the final touches with my electric which still burns!    This is a good razor overall. It&#x27;s just a little less long (half an inch) than the Edwin Jager but provides better grip when wet and I like the 2-piece design over the 3-piece design of the  Edwin Jager.    If you have bigger hands you might dig the Edwin more. If you have smaller hands or want a more classic design pick up the Merkur.  The shave is the same I feel. Some say Edwin is more gentle and Merkur is more aggressive. It doesn&#x27;t matter really. I can&#x27;t tell any difference. It&#x27;s more the blade you choose to use in the end and how many passes you do. You can also experiment with how many fingers you use to hold the razor. I&#x27;ve read 2-3 os all you need and to let the weight of the razor head so it&#x27;s job. I get tugging and uncomfortableness either way. You just have to put up with it if you want a good shave though and think about the end result.    You can&#x27;t go wrong either way. Pick up a good badger brush (best you have the money for), shave pucks if you need them and a few different blades and a stand to dry your brush correctly upside down so it doesn&#x27;t get smelly or rot. After these steps you&#x27;ll be on your way to a great shave and can put more time into shaving rather than reading about products! Good luck on your shaving journey.     Oh, the myth that DE shaving makes shaving fun or that you&#x27;ll want to do it every day more is bunk!! Shaving still sucks. It&#x27;s still just as time consuming and boring. You can get used to a shaved face feeling which can in effect make you want to shave more often though. You&#x27;ll still hate the repetition of it though.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.  I have found it easy to use and of good quality.</li>
            <li> After 15 years of shaving with Mach3 or its predecessors, I decided to give double-edged razors a try. The results are so much better! You have to be careful the first times, as there is a tendency to apply too much pressure when you&#x27;re used to M3. Since I started using this Merkur, six months ago, I haven&#x27;t had ingrown hairs, and when I get nicks, they&#x27;re much smaller and cleaner than those produced by multi-blade cartridges. &lt;br /&gt;The proof of the pudding for me is how painless it is to shave long growth with a double edge razor. If you&#x27;ve tried to shave a 7 day growth with a Mach3, you know what I&#x27;m talking about! &lt;br /&gt;A related recommendation is that you use real shaving soap or cream, not canned foam.</li>
            <li> After many years with the multiblade, titanium, battery powered, \\&quot;real man\\&quot; shaving systems who&#x27;s blades last 2 shaves I decided to try something new.  I must admit that I&#x27;ve never experienced a closer, more satisfying shave outside of an old fashioned barbershop.  This is a well made razor that will last for many years.  It&#x27;s simplistic design, solid construction, and quality finish is sure to make this my lifetime razor.  Thank you Merkur.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor that I have purchased and have loved it more than I thought I would. I use it 3-5 times a week depending on how often I need to be clean shaven. I&#x27;ve found that it usually takes me just a few minutes longer to shave if I&#x27;m doing a full lather. But if I&#x27;m in a rush and use shaving cream from a can, it takes me no longer than a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get a lot of irritation from shaving but ever since I began wet shaving, I have had no irritation or ingrown hairs at all. I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular razor again. Not to mention it&#x27;s much cheaper past the initial investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About once a month I will take the current blade out and wash the entire safety razor body with soap, water and a brush. This helps to remove any residue left from the Proraso I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the body feels good in your hands and I hardly had a learning curve moving to the safety razor. I highly recommend this product and wet shaving in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about a year now, and I&#x27;ll never go back to the triple and quadruple bladed razors that are all over the place. First of all, I no longer get the razor burn and ingrown hairs that I used to get with my old razor. I used to shave as rarely as possible, because it was such a horrible process, but this, along with a shaving brush and soap, makes me not mind it at all. I am still lazy though, so I don&#x27;t shave everyday. Which brings me to another advantage of this razor: if you put off shaving for too long, this razor doesn&#x27;t pull out long hairs, like contemporary razors do, it cuts them off clean, which is a godsend for lazy people like me. The learning curve is not as big as other people seem to think, just make sure not to rush your way through the first few times you shave with it.</li>
            <li> This was my first classic razor. I had always used the typical schick and gillette multi blade models, I tried them all. This one is so much better! You have to be gentle, but not in a tedious or difficult way, you just have to take it easy. People and websites say that it takes more time with a classic razor, but in my experience it is about the same. Mach 3 and all those razors would leave my skin really irritated and scratched up but these kind wont irritate your skin very much at all if you do it right. You can get expensive creams but the best I have found is an ordinary can of gillette cream. Not the gel the cream...that used with this razor will be a world of difference. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I like shiny metal objects that are built with care. This is certainly one of them.</li>
            <li> It took me two weeks to finally learn how to properly shave with this razor. I am not going to go over the finer points of dividing your face into zones for different angles and hair growth patterns, keeping plenty of lather on your face, etc. You can get a book or read plenty of stuff on the internet. Just Google for \\&quot;shaving with a safety razor\\&quot;. I will just say that my experience with this razor has been very, very positive once I somewhat mastered the technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are going to buy this, I recommend you also get these things:&lt;br /&gt;1. I recommend you get some good shaving cream. Shaving cream is a little easier to work into thick lather compared to shaving soap. I use Proraso, but there are plenty of other high quality shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;2. A good shaving brush (Kingsley is the brand I bought, genuine badger hair for a reasonable amount of money). You can get cheaper brushes at CVS or Walmart, but they are not going to be near as soft as a quality badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;3. A box of at least 10 more spare blades. Each blade lasts me about 1 week. The razor will typically come with a Merkur \\&quot;test\\&quot; blade. So if you use that one to start with, I suggest you continue on for a while with the same brand. You don&#x27;t want to be switching brands of blades too often -- blades are a little different. So get some Merkur spares for starters. If you choose a different brand, I suggest you don&#x27;t put in the \\&quot;test\\&quot; blade and just start using the other brand from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a bare minimum of what you will need. A few other things won&#x27;t go amiss:&lt;br /&gt;1. A shaving stand is nice and pretty, and it keeps everything organized and allows your brush to dry well.&lt;br /&gt;2. A shaving bowl. Some people like to create lather in a bowl and then apply it to their beard. I like to create lather on my beard itself. But I still need a place to put my wet brush down, so a bowl works nicely. You can get a special shaving bowl, but a small ceramic cereal bowl oreven a cup works just as well. Don&#x27;t get anything metal. Metal transfers the heat too well... you don&#x27;t want cold lather on your face, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;3. A good aftershave balm. I just use Nivea Sensitive, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind having something with a more natural smell. A lot of people think Proraso balm is nice.&lt;br /&gt;4. A styptic pen (any major drugstore will have them). Yes, you *WILL* cut yourself the first few times, if you are switching from a \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razor. A styptic pen stops the bleeding -- instantly. Don&#x27;t get scared, you will not cut your throat from ear to ear with a *safety* razor. But you will nick yourself here and there (Adam&#x27;s Apple area, most likely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this razor I was torn between this one and Merkur 180 (same thing, but with a longer handle). I&#x27;m a big guy (6&#x27; 3\\&quot;, shoe size 14) and I typically have to get all my things slightly oversized. However, I do not regret going for the shorter handle. As much as you have to adjust for all the angles of your face, I think I would have struggled with the longer handle. Besides, you will want to hold this razor with two fingers anyway, on the very tip, so why get a longer handle? This is not a backhoe. It needs very little effort. If you have to force it, your blade is either dull, or you are doing something very, very wrong (like cutting at a very aggressive angle).</li>
            <li> Ok, well, it&#x27;s still kind of a chore, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need to stretch my razor blade&#x27;s life (thus cutting my face) because they are so expensive anymore.  Like others before me, I was fed up with paying $25+ for a package of razor cartridges.  In fact, I was at Walmart, had Fusions in my cart and left them at the checkout when I realized it was going to cost me $25 for just 6 (or maybe 8) razors!  Instead, I opted to go ahead and spend the $35 on the razor and $17 on this [[ASIN:B001PZEHIK sample pack]] to get started.  Yes, I paid $50 to make the transition, but that would have been what I would have paid for 2 packages of Fusion blades that would only last at the most, 4 months.  The sampler pack alone will easily last me a year given that I use one blade per week.  I do have a favorite in the sampler, but I&#x27;ll wait til I&#x27;m running low to order a year&#x27;s supply of the one I like, and that will still only cost about $15.  But about the razor...      This razor is exactly what I had hoped for.  A solid, heavy-enough razor to use daily with inexpensive razor blades.  I did some searching around the net to find a recommended razor for a newbie to DE shaving.  This one came up in almost every recommendation.  I&#x27;m not a huge guy, but have bigger hands than some, and it fits perfectly in my hand and has enough weight to it that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to lose control.  The screw-on top secures the razor perfectly and lets me worry about my shaving skills and not about the blade coming loose.  It cleans up easily and nicely and I can lay it on my counter to dry without the blade making contact and eventually dulling.  This razor is built solidly and feels like it will last a very long time.  The shave you ask?  Oh, well I now get a shave that my old Fusion, or even Mach 3, couldn&#x27;t get close to.  The learning curve for this guy, or any DE razor, is about 5-10 shaves, but once I got that down, I get a close, smooth, no-cut shave in about 6 minutes.  And that&#x27;s from start (lather) to finish (rinse).  I don&#x27;t even think I could shave that close with no cuts in 10 minutes with my Fusion.  I used to shave every other day (and deal with stubble on day 2) to stretch my Fusion blades to 2 weeks, but now I shave daily with my $17, one-year&#x27;s supply of razor blades.    Whether your new to DE shaving, just shopping around for a new DE razor, or possibly wantiing to gift someone a razor, this is a great razor for any man.  Just make sure to get some blades for him as this only comes with one Merkur blade.  And if he travels a lot, it does not come with a case, so consider this [[ASIN:B001O8NCI4 leather travel case]] to secure his razor.  And because this is fulfilled by Amazon, packaging is great and shipping is fast, as always.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrics exclusively for the past 7-8 years, until recently my wife has gotten into couponing, and she picked me up a Gillette Fusion something-or-other for next to nothing, so I decided to give it whirl.  Well, that got me interested in wet shaving, which went out of popular style well before I was even conceived.  After much deliberation, I went with this Merkur and some Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Soap.  I just received the package a few hours ago and tried it out - Amazing shave!  Yes, I cut myself maybe three times on the middle of my neck (where my beard is thickest) which is nothing compared to the fifteen cuts I got with the Fusion the other day.  This razor and wet shaving all-together have introduced me to the \\&quot;lost art\\&quot; of shaving.  Also, the included Merkur blade is intensely sharp, but not too sharp as to not allow for a second pass against the grain (where I cut myself, lol).  It was a bit smaller than I expected, but I warmed up to it quickly.  All-in-all, this is a fantastic razor and the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It may be that I&#x27;m still getting used to using a safety razor, but I don&#x27;t feel it shaves as close as my old cheap blue target razors. That said you feel really cool and old fashioned shaving with one of these, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This razor has a small but important learning curve.  If you&#x27;re used to using something like a Mach 3 (as that was my first wet shave razor)or any of the multi-blades this will take some getting used to.  Small easy strokes with absolutely no pressure except by the weight of this razor are the way to go.  Do one stroke with one side, another stroke with the other then rense.  One pass with the grain for most is the way to go but if you desire a closer shave then I suggest re-lather, (which is important for wetshaving) and lightly shave across, not against the grain.  For those wanting a good shave, you will have to spend a little more time than using the multiblade razors.  I suggest a badger hair brush with some traditional shave cream or soap like Geo F. Trumpers or Trufitt or Taylor of Old Bond Street.  Plan on no less than five minutes for a good close shave from the start of lathering to toweling off.  I also suggest a skin food from Trumpers or some preshave oil from The Art of Shaving that will help the razor glide.  I enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade and I think any user who will take the time to learn to use it will to.  If you&#x27;re constantly in a hurry to shave and be on your way, I don&#x27;t suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor for that matter.</li>
            <li> When I first received this handle, I was a little upset that I had not gotten the longer handle version. However, after using it a few times I realized that the smaller handle is better as I feel I have more control and precision over the blade. I used to get razor burn on my upper lip when using the 3-5 blade systems, but once I switched to this, I have gotten none of it; I can shave daily with no irritation, when with the &#x27;modern&#x27; razors, I would have to shave every other day. I use the traditional shaving creams and not the new chemical-based ones; my preference is Taylor of Old Bond Street. I change blades weekly and have had no issues; if you go more than a week, you will find that the blades are rough and need to be changed lest you cut your face. I currently use the Merkur double edge razor blades with this model, but am going to switch to Feather as I have read they are very well made blades; have not had any issues with the Merkur blades, but want to try the others to compare.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had this razor and occasionally I would use it when I&#x27;d stay at his place. I absolutely fell in love with it. I know it&#x27;s a guys razor, but given that I&#x27;m a woman and as a woman, you basically shave everything, I was getting tired of razors that didn&#x27;t shave as smooth as they should....oh plus the fact I&#x27;d have to replace the razors that are made for women, whether it&#x27;s paying $30 for a new razor head, or just buying a new razor all together. Anyway, I decided to buy one for myself and I will never go back to cheap, disposable, plastic razors ever again. The benefit with this is that it&#x27;s heavy and you can change out the blade, which means it cuts close (which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how steady your hand is)and it shaves as smooth as fresh as the first time, every time (because you can change out the razor blades which come in huge packs at once for a reasonable price). This razor was worth every penny and I use it to shave everything- just be careful because it is so sharp and heavy, if you aren&#x27;t paying attention it is easier to nick yourself than with plastic razors. Either way, I would gladly recommend this razor to any friend, guy or girl. It&#x27;s so worth it- the feel, the positive results, the endless supplies of razor blades you can purchase aside from this, and the fact that it is just cool looking. Nice product indeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> The handle could be a bit longer, but this razor is absolutely wonderful.  Very well made with durable construction and should last a lifetime or even longer.</li>
            <li> this is the razor you should start with if you&#x27;re new to double edge shaving.  an inexpensive pack of merkur razors, and some good shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a thing newcomers may find our quickly is that this razor absolutely devours facial hair.  dont press down as you would a mach three, or disposable, as you&#x27;re working with the sheer face of a real razor against your skin.  i havent found a beard thick enough to clog it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blades are remarkably inexpensive, and extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a close shave and to keep that beard neat like barber did it.    M. White</li>
            <li> Like a lot of guys I was using the Mach 3 razor before and then I switched to the vibrating six blade razor (tag line: The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Vibrator - For Your Face). And then I took to the Zen simplicity of this safety razor. During my first few strokes I almost reached smooth skinned nirvana but then the cat knocked my badger brush over.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first shave with this razor and no cuts, no razor burn, and the closest smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, you have to pay a little bit more attention to what you are doing with this razor - also, you have to do it right with a badger brush and shaving soap (I used the $13 badger brush form Amazon and Col. conk&#x27;s shaving soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about patience - short, careful strokes with almost no pressure (let the weight of the razor do the work) and after the first pass, re-lather and make a second pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a little bit longer to shave, but this is easily the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had - it beats my Norelco Reflex to shreds, and is also better than the venerable Gilette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wanting a better shaving experience. But you just have to remember to be careful and go slowly. If you want to rush through shaving and just get it over with then stick with an electric that can&#x27;t take your face off like this thing can :-)</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re not worth the money.    First of all, to clear away any confusion, the #178 is the same razor as the 34c and the HD Classic/Hefty Classic. Like many people I did a lot of research before deciding to upgrade to using a double edged (DE) safety razor. I&#x27;ve used every single type of mass-market plastic razor, from single blade to five blade, none of them remotely compares to the Merkur in terms of functionality, aesthetics, or price. Many people who use DE razors buy shaving brushes and various products, which tend to intimidate people due to the time, expense, and technique necessary to use them. These products aren&#x27;t necessary, but they do add significantly to the pleasure of shaving. Just like with cheap plastic razors, I usually lather with plain soap in the shower and shave quickly. You do not press down when you shave, you let the razor glide across your skin while slightly changing the angle you hold it. This allows you to race across your face with practice. I can also shave without fear of irritation or ingrown hairs, allowing me to do the unthinkable: shave with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain, resulting in the smoothest shave of my life.     By switching I have lost the terrible, scarring ingrown hairs, the patchy rough spots, the excessive expense of buying replacement cartridges, and instead gained smooth skin, a high quality piece of machined and chromed metal, and shaving has gone from daily chore to a great pleasure. Note: you will have to get to know your face, you will have to unlearn the bad habits gained from disposable razors, you may shed a few drops of blood, but in the end you will change your life for the better.     If I haven&#x27;t convinced you to pay the upfront cost of getting this razor and a pack of 100 blades, I recommend buying an old Gillette Super Speed or Tech razor from an online auction or a Feather Portable razor, along with a blade sample pack from an online retailer. You might also want to consider the Muhle R89/Edwin Jagger DE89-they&#x27;re a little more refined, less aggressive, and more expensive. Make the switch!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.  I have been using Mach 3&#x27;s the majority of my shaving lifetime and recently switched to this razor and there is a big difference.  After just three shaves the skin on my neck is in much better condition then when using the Mach 3.  I no longer have any razor bumps which makes shaving easier every time.  This razor also has a much closer shave and leaves a smoother finish.  If you can handle the very small learning curve then this razor is for you!</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this razor, I decided to get one and found out that I was lucky to get the Merkur HD. The #178 is the model number given in another part of the globe. This is the same as the Merkur HD or 34c.    The razor is made with precision and finesse. It is so heavy that it shaves with just its weight gliding down the face. Very sturdy and it looks all set to last a lifetime.     The shaves itself are so close that some care has to be taken initially as there is a little learning curve. But it is a beautifully balanced razor. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have been researching wetshaving for approxiametly two months now.  I ordered this razor and shaved with it using some Taylor of Bond Street avocado cream along with a vulfix brush last night for the first time.  I love the feel of the razor and it makes me feel like a true gentleman.  You feel distinguished using this razor but I think I&#x27;m going to try some different blades.  The merkur blades were okay but I think I want a closer shave.  Overall, an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> First the razor: Excellent craftsmanship. All metal construction, looks very handsome, no slip handle, great angle of razor to skin for excellent shave. I was a bit concerned about not getting the Heavy Duty, longer handle, or adjustable; but those concerns are gone and I am very happy with my purchase!    No on DE shaving in general: This is my first experience with DE shaving and it has been great! I was, like many people looking into this, a skeptic. First the downsides of DE shaving in general (not this razor) are it&#x27;s slower because it necessitates much more concentration, but that is also a huge part of the enjoyment for me because it makes it much more of a methodical ritual with an even meditative quality. It&#x27;s also difficult to shave in the shower, which was my previous method that I do like. Now to the pluses. Very close shave even with one pass and no across or against the grain pass for me yet! Cost effective in the medium-long run with very nice blades (I used the 1 Merkur blade that came with it and some Derby Extras, which were both satisfactory) costing a tiny fraction of even cheap disposable razors, not to mention the outrageous cost of high-end models. This in-turn is much better on the enviroment with no plastic parts and lower amount of trash.</li>
            <li> Like most others, I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years, I had to buy the latest, greatest design in razors. With each new design, the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money. About a year ago, I bought a Merkur safey razor and have not regretted it. I believe it will last forever and the cost of the blades will save me a bundle. If you are a newbie to this type of razor, you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique. Then, enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was a bit spectacular about this razors. I looked at all reviews on amazon on all the razors and come to find out that the Merkur model is the best razor. I was getting tired of the buying new razor blades for my Gillette Fusion at a high price. So I figured I&#x27;ll give the Merkur razor a try and order it a week ago. As it arrived I was a bit shock how small the device was. I tried the razor immediately and wow did I feel the difference between my Fusion and the Merkur.  The only downside is that you have to patients with razor. You may cut yourself if your not careful with this classic razor, but its expected to take your time. I would highly recommend this or any Merkur model razor to anyone. If your still wondering about getting this, watch some videos on YouTube to see if its right for you.</li>
            <li> I started using this Razor in July with a wet shave and loved it. It was my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor (non-cartridge) and the hype matched the results. The razor provides an irritation free shave and has only caused two minor cuts... to be fair, I caused the cuts by speed shaving. Neither of the cuts were serious, about equivalent to a paper cut.    The inspiration for this review was the fact that I have a gillete razor at work for emergency shaving. Well, I had an important meeting earlier and had forgotten to shave this morning so I pulled out my shaving cream/razor and went to shave in the bathroom. It felt like the brand new blade was pulling the hairs, not cutting them. My face is still itching and I regret trading a quick cosmetic improvement for my face&#x27;s comfort.    Give a real razor a shot and you will never go back. I promise.    -------  Pros    1. Short handle but good heft.  2. Easy to transport.  3. Quality materials and well crafted.    Cons    1. No included accessories (carrying case, stand, etc.)</li>
            <li> Great solid razor. Comfortable in the hand. Well constructed. Good balance of comfort and closeness. Easy to load. Good for beginners or experienced.</li>
            <li> Got the Merkur 178, a badger brush and Proraso shave cream and I am not looking back.I exclusively used cartridge shavers for years and the Merkur shaving experience is a REVELATION.Good bye cartridges, forever!I think younger men have to read a few articles on \\&quot; how to shave\\&quot; then take the Merkur in hand with confidence. Sadly, too few dads and grand dads have taught us how to shave properly so discovering this type of shaving is unnecessarily scary but don&#x27;t fear , just enjoy and be giddy with the results.Now I actually look forward to shaving , thats a first for me.</li>
            <li> Do you remember the first time that you shaved with a Mach 3 Turbo?  You were young, perhaps, and the hair on your face was effeminate and soft.  As you slid the cartridge-razor over your youthful, silken face, the hair just seemed to glide away with the razor and you were very happy with that.  But as the years went on and your facial hair became the thick forest of black cable that you currently have to fight off with a weedeater to remove, that Mach 3 Turbo slowly lost your faith.  Perhaps you&#x27;ve even tried to convert to some other brand, hoping that even more razors crammed into a piece of plastic would do the trick.  Not so.    Your first shave with this simple, single-blade, stainless steel safety razor from Merkur will not be easy.  But it will change your life.  Where you may have been forced to use pressure to hold the cartridge-razors of your youth close enough to your skin to actually give you a clean cut, this blade is not some pair of safety scissors - the mere weight of the metal on your skin is enough to close in on even the deepest of furs.    Gentlemen, do your adult-face a favor and dump those sissy cartridges.  You&#x27;re a man now, so why not use a man&#x27;s razor?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, but the older I got, the more retro I started getting; at least with shaving. Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to (expensive) replacement cartridges. The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather&#x27;s old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave. I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic (more finally crafted than grandpa&#x27;s shaver) and have been extremely happy with the results. The initial cost may be more, but you will save money in the long run.    Be sure to get good blades. Merkur&#x27;s stainless steel blades work well. They are still 1/4 the price of the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I really hate the multi-blade cartridge razors, and electric razors really irritate my skin.  I decided to try wet-shaving using a safety razor, and after reading reviews, I went with the Merkur classic.      Although a little intimidating at first, the Merkur is actually very easy to use, and provides a nice, close shave.  The key is to just be patient while you shave, and to pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.  The single, straight edge makes shaping sideburns and facial hair pretty easy.  Combine with a decent blade, brush, and cream, and you&#x27;re on your way.  I bought the inexpensive Tweezerman brush, Tom&#x27;s of Maine cream, and the Derby blades, and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already. This is my first DE safety razor, and it has been great. Also, this is labeled #178... it is the same as the 34C.</li>
            <li> This was my first DE safety razor. I have fallen in love with it. The grip is steady, even with damp hands and the weight of the razor does all the work for you.    There is a slight learning curve. And I nicked myself a couple of times the first time. But each time was drastically easier than the last. Now, I get near perfect shaves every time.    What once was my most hated and dreaded of chores is now one of my favorite hobbies. And my girlfriend likes kissing me again.    But remember, the actual blades are just as-if not more-important to make sure you get the smooth, steady shave you are looking for.</li>
            <li> While not delivering on a super close shave, the Merkur Classic has the advantage of gliding across beard without tugging.  4 stars for it&#x27;s smoothness.</li>
            <li> This is one of three Merkur razors I have purchased - the first one was the long-handled version of this one - I purchased for my husband. We had a small fortune invested in the Mach razors - which never really worked except for the first shave. A few minor nicks the first few times he used it, but quickly got the hang of it and it gives him a very close, non-irritating shave (we also use natural goats milk soap rather than chemical \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot;). Then I purchased this one (short handle) for my teenage son. He loves it, too. I also purchased the 1904 replica for myself - I figured if it worked so well for the guys, it might work great for the girls. And it does. Nice close shave without stripping my skin. Respect the razor, know the proper way to use a safety-razor and you will never want to go back to those other things again.     The short-handled razors like this one are great for my small hands and my teenage son, but a man with large hands would probably prefer the long-handled razor (which is about the same length as a Mach razor). Also, the 1904 one has \\&quot;open\\&quot; teeth whereas this one does not. To me, both types give just as close a shave - I see no difference (neither does my husband). Perhaps those who allow their beard/hair to grow longer before they shave might find a difference.</li>
            <li> Got this after reading the great reviews. Also picked up some shave cream, a badger brush and some after shave balm. Been using the cream and brush with my Gillete Fusion with good results. I received this razor (merkur) and I lathered up. Since its been 3 days since I had a shave, I was excited to experience this close smooth nick free shave.     Took my time, shaved with one stroke, re-lathered and shaved again. No pressure as I let the weight of the razor do the job. After rinsing and drying my neck was tore up something awful to the point I am embarrassed to go out. My whole neck is cut up and red. I look awful. My face is OK, just one nick on my chin. But the neck is burning, sore and bloody.     I had hot lather all over my neck, went slow and this is what I get? My Gillette NEVER did this!     Not happy so far with this experience. Hopefully I will heal quick. I give 3 stars for the sturdy build and quality, not for the shave. I wanted os much to enjoy this product as I invested in the other accessories. ALl I can say is OUCH!    BTW, my face shave was no closer than with my gillette. I have a little irritation on my cheeks, like a slight burn but no rash or cuts.</li>
            <li> Ladies like this razor too! I feel a bit odd writing this review about a traditionally men&#x27;s product but I feel compelled to praise this excellent razor. I use this razor to shave my legs and I concur with many of the remarks made by the gentlemen. It gives a close and long lasting shave. There is a learning curve but I have never cut myself once in two years of use. Mainly because I just use the weight of the razor and I don&#x27;t apply pressure. I cannot say that about the many disposable and cartridge razors I have used over the years, too many cuts to count.  In addition, the blades are quite long lasting. Yes, the expense is upfront but the razor is well made and I fully expect it to last a lifetime.     I decided to try the Merkur after being rather less than thrilled with the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; razors and the cost of replacement blades has gotten absolutely absurd! If you are using the higher end razors and cartridges as I was, switch to the Merkur, you will break even in a year or less and be ahead the game for the rest of your life.     My husband has used this type of razor for twenty-five years and says that there is nothing better. Judging by his face and my legs, I agree.</li>
            <li> In an effort to save money I started into the DE razor market.  This is one of my first.  I really like it.  Well balanced and really good shave.  Now I own several DE&#x27;s.  Ok about 10 or so.  Don&#x27;t judge me.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for the first time this morning.  Once with the grain and then once more after relathering.  I only knicked myself once under my chin when I was going against the grain.  I&#x27;m not a master shaver or anything so I don&#x27;t know why so many people report having so much difficulty with this razor.  Take your time, use a little common sense, and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> Simple to use.  Solidly built.  Hefty in the hand.  No gimmicks.  No BS.  Just a great razor.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor nearly everyday for the past 6 years. I will NEVER go back to the multi-blade razors. It takes some getting accustomed to, but once you get it, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be misleading, as I never got around to actually using it, but I&#x27;m writing the review I wished someone would have written earlier to save me some time and grief.  The advertised picture on every website that sells the 178 is a little misleading; it appears bigger than it really is.      The razor arrived to my home, I giddily opened the packaging, and was rather dissapointed. The thing was weel-made, shiny and pristine, but...well, tiny.  I have medium-sized hands and the 178 was too small for them.  The handle, from the bottom of the head assembly to the hilt of the handle was about 3 inches.  My hand is about 4 inches at the widest part.  I just wanted something more substantial, so I sent it back for a refund and ordered a 38c \\&quot;barber pole,\\&quot; which is more to my expectations and liking.      The two razors have the same heads, so the only difference is the length and weight. Although I do enjoy my 38c, having shaved a couple of times with it, I can see why one would opt for the smaller 178.  Because it is smaller, I can see where the 178 may be a little more managable and agile.  It seems more \\&quot;strictly business\\&quot; than the more cosmetic 38c.  If you want to save some money and don&#x27;t mind the looks of the stumpy little razor hanging in your razor stand, then go for the 178.  If you want something more substantial and aesthetic, buy the 38c.  You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
            <li> Took a couple times to get used to, but I actually look forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used a classic safety razor.  It works great. I love it.  It gives a more enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> If you are sick of razor bump and paying wayyyy too much for mach 3 blades, then this is right for you. I bought this as my first blade to get me into wet shaving and must say I am VERY happy with my purchase.  I highly recommend this as a good start for a safety razor!</li>
            <li> Merkur is the only razor for me.  I liked this one so much, I also bought the slant version.  This puts my Gillette to shame.  It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 4 years now. I went from using a Mach 3 with standard shaving gel at the sink to shaving with this (usually with Gillette blades) and Shave Secret shaving oil in the shower. A few observations:       *Pros:    -I went from having a constant red razor burn rash on my neck to basically blemish free skin. I attribute this to GREATLY reduced irritation from shaving. I actually enjoy shaving now. This in and of itself makes this a worthy purchase in my eyes.     -I can and do shave against the grain with this thing, but only after making a first pass with the grain.    -Blades are incredibly cheaper. 10 blades for $5-10 dollars instead of 8 blades for $15. They last longer as well, which makes it an even better deal. I usually get about a month out of each of my blades.    *Cons:    -Learning curve is a bit steeper. You have to train yourself to vary how you hold the razor to follow the curves of your face, the razor won&#x27;t do it for you. I cut myself the first few times shaving with it. Get a good styptic pencil, and maybe some hydrocortison cream.    -After 4 years of using it in the shower mostly and not drying it off before storing it head down, the chrome has started to flake a bit on the top curved portion. I did ding that part up a little by dropping it a while back, so I&#x27;m going to say that&#x27;s mostly my fault. Still, it&#x27;s worth noting.    -Don&#x27;t go really cheap on blades. You can get a pack of 10 for around $3. Don&#x27;t do it. Trust me. Your face will curse you if you do.    *Bottom line: I&#x27;m getting another Murkur razor to replace this one, possibly with a long handle. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back to the latest fades in shaving. One blade is truly better than 3. Or 4. Or 5. Or 27...</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this razor and wrote a full review, complete with day by day descriptions, on my blog.  You can read the full account here:      [...]    Here are my main thoughts if you don&#x27;t want to read the whole thing:    -There is definitely a one to two week learning curve so plan appropriately.  It also takes about a week for your face to get used to the new razor so be prepared for some healthy razor burn at first.  -The razor is very good, but I think some of the reviewers may be overly influenced by their desire to believe the razor is better than it really is.  You can get a very good shave but it won&#x27;t be the greatest shave in the history of man.  If you have a thick and dark beard like me you may be initially disappointed after you realize you are still unable to get every single hair.  When using this razor (or any razor for that matter) it&#x27;s important to recognize the limits you can achieve, otherwise you&#x27;ll find yourself taking far more passes than would be advisable, especially when the razor burn kicks in.  In the end, it&#x27;s only a razor and there is only so much you can accomplish in terms of shaving.  -Using soap is great and probably the best part of the process.  It feels very good on your skin and is far preferable to canned shaving cream.    Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor and the associated products but it&#x27;s important to be realistic and objective in your assessment when deciding whether or not a safety razor is for you.</li>
            <li> nice solid construction, light years better than any disposable, and way closer and more comfortable shave. I used to hate shaving, this has changed my perspective!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver! I&#x27;m new to the true \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; process, and am hooked. I&#x27;ve been spending tons on the latest multi blade refills for years, roughly 2-3 bucks a refill!!! You&#x27;ll need to commit to some time.... my first shave took me almost 10 minutes and I had several nics(this is more about my inexperience, and less about the shaver/blade!) The shaver has a nice balance and is easy to handle. I highly recommend it.  Get a good badger hair shave brush and soap for the total experience! After shave is a must, and a good moisturizer afterwords makes you feel like you just left the barber shop. You can keep your Gilette Mach 24 vibrating, moisturizing, battery operated, turbo charged, multi-colored, shaver with replacement blades that cost more than a happy hour beer! I&#x27;m going old school... and this is a great shaver to do it with! Wait til the first time your lady friend feels the new shave and comments on your smoothness..... you&#x27;ll be hooked too!</li>
            <li> Razor&#x27;s holding stem is too short.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!</li>
            <li> Wow, this a great razor ! Very well made and a great investment ! I would recommend this razor to anyone !</li>
            <li> It is not the German quality you would expect Aside from being overpriced It really feels and it looks like a very well-made Chinese Product</li>
            <li> I bought this Razor and the screw inside snapped off inside the housing that holds the blade in place - no possible way to fix it.  $48.00 GONE...</li>
            <li> The razor is sturdy and well-made. It&#x27;s stainless steel with a solid weight to it. It shaves close, with no tug or pull even on my curly chin hairs. Compared to disposable razors, it&#x27;s like upgrading from a Pinto to a Mercedes. I shave with and against the grain with no cuts or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  One con of the razor is placing the blades though. The bottom unscrews to release the top cover (it&#x27;s a T-shape, covering the blade and then a rod goes into the shaft). This design requires the blade to rest on the rod while the cover is placed, which unfortunately requires holding the blade while you insert the rod. I haven&#x27;t personally cut myself doing this, but having to hold the blade in your hand each time is concerning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you are considering this as your first safety razor, please note that it&#x27;s significantly shorter than traditional disposable razors. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind. But some might prefer a longer-handled version (which Merkur also sells). Also, the razor includes one Merkur double-edged blade, which I would also recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this razor super close shave, just have to be carful, don&#x27;t apply pressure just let the weight of the razor do the job. Please at the office has stopped to ask me who do i get suck a clean shave.  Give it a try you wont regret it.  It also saves you money and is better for the environment.</li>
            <li> After decades of use with my old Merkur razor, I checked to see if this razor is still being made.  Imagine my surprise when I found it on this site!  I bought the same, identical replacement razor, which should tell you how much I believe in this razor.  I expect to get the same decades of use.  It&#x27;s built solid (it&#x27;s all metal construction gives it more weight than those plastic disposable razors I take with me on trips), still has that great easy surface grip handle, and with the Mekur blade is a joy to use.  I always get clean shaves without any nicks (what would you expect after years of practice?).</li>
            <li> Okay. I have been shaving my face and head with cartridge razors for the past 4 or 5 years every day, and I finally got sick of paying 25 bucks for 4  new razor heads. I suppose like most people that have decided to take this route instead. I first wanted to try a cut-throat razor, but after reading about it a bit I learned i had to learn how to sharpen it, buy a strop for 100 bucks, and the razor itself was over 100. I decided to try out a DE, for much less money, and the merkur series caught my eye.     i read a few \\&quot;how to and why\\&quot; articles online about DE shaving before i attempted to shave. i havent cut myself with a cartridge razor since i first started shaving, but i was still a little worried after reading reviews and warnings.     i had about 4 days of beard growth, i took a shower before shaving, washed my face a few times, kept my face wet, lathered up with dial bar soap [using my hands], and had a nick free shave. afterwards i applied some nivea after shave. it seems to be much smoother and more effective than a quatro or mach 3. i dont think ill buy another cartridge razor again.    so anyway, extremely high quality product. great shave. maybe read the \\&quot;how to and why\\&quot; article at classicshaving.com, and as long as you take a couple extra minutes to shave, you shouldnt have a problem.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor, it has exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;ve used electric and all of the multi-blade versions over the years, but never got as close a shave with so little irritation.  There is a little more technique involved using this razor, but the results are worth it.  For a simple device, it has a feel of substance and quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful first DE razor - not too aggressive and heavy for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve when it comes to shaving with this but once you get past that it becomes a pleasure to shave.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but it is now fun to shave with Mekur Model 178.  I wish I had this twenty-five years ago.  It is truly the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> New to the safety razor arena, but the handle was shorter than I expected.  It still works great for a guy with large hands.  It is such a smooth shave and so much cheaper than the five bladed shavers.  I am really happy with this shaver.  I would recommend buying a stand to hold it.  Maybe get a sharps container for the used blades, especially if you have kids so they keep away from the spent blades.  It comes with one blade from the manufacturer, but grab a multipack to see which ones you like best.  Like everything else, you will see the difference I quality in blades as well as the sharpness.</li>
            <li> The shave that you will receive using this safety razor is well worth the cost. Once you understand how to properly use this you will enjoy your shave if you don&#x27;t already. The small size of this razor will feel different the first few times you shave but its weight makes disposables feel like toys. Shaving with this safety razor may take longer(8 mins vs 2) but the shave afterwards is always better than any disposable can offer. The lifetime of the individual blades is usually about two weeks but depends on the brand you buy. I purchased a 100 pack of derby blades and have increased my changing interval to weekly since I still have 70 blades remaining. For the best shaving experience get a shaving brush and some soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool based on the necessity to find a cheap way to shave on a daily basis. With the initial cost of the safety razor, I was in the hole but after getting it I was delighted to see it in action. I bought for the way that the razor was placed inside of the handle and the elongated dowel screw. It is a razor that I prefer over my hand me down gillette from the same era. This a wonderful razor that I would recommend over and over again to my friends and family. If you are in the market for a fantastic razor look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Nice weight. Not heavy enough to be a problem. Not light enough to impose the feeling of an inferior throw away razor.&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful to look at&lt;br /&gt;-Razor Placement&lt;br /&gt;-Solid Craftsmanship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Not made for travel</li>
            <li> I just got a Merkur razor for Christmas and I had a great first shave with it.  I am really impressed with the shave.  As others have said, you want to apply light pressure and make multiple passes.  I would also like to add that I don&#x27;t normally shave upside down, but did with this razor and got a very close shave.  I did not cut myself and found it to be easy to learn to shave with.  I would recommend this razor and am throwing out my disposables.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some great things about safety razors. Read a ton of reviews. Everybody points to the Merkur as the top dog. I&#x27;ve used 2,3,5 bladed razors. Shave creams, gels, oils.... This razor has a small learning curve. Normally I have a heavy beard shadow by 11am, but with this I am baby smooth through the day, no irritation, just soft skin. I bought the merkur blades as well- though I haven&#x27;t tried others. I would also recommend Proraso shaving cream from florence italy. You can find that on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> The most basic razor ended up becoming my favorite. I have yet to use my contemporary five razor over this one. Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Went old school and decided to go for the Merkur Safety razor. Nice once you learn how to use it - if you are not familiar with safety razors.</li>
            <li> Excellent rendition of the classic safety razor. A solid and overall very well made product. A good safety razor is both functional and economical.</li>
            <li> Good and solid feel.  Could be a tad longer on the handle but that&#x27;s my fault for not praying attention to the details.  Excellent starter safety razor for the price.</li>
            <li> What separates this razor from others is the weight and length. The length is nice because so many razors these days act like massive squeegees. The shorter length allows you to manipulate the razor without bumping into your own hand. One of the hardest parts about wet shaving is learning to not press down on the razor. The weight of this helps avoid that predicament because it&#x27;s heavy enough to let it rest and then ride across your face without any added pressure to the razor itself. I always recommend this to people who want to get started with a double edge razor. Besides the purely practical aspects of the length and weight it&#x27;s a classy looking piece of metal.</li>
            <li> I first started shaving with one of these things many years ago.  For nostalgic reasons, if for no other, I ordered this razor.  After receiving and loading it with a blade, I became painfully aware of why these things are no longer commonly available on the market, and why I was so glad to see the banded razors come into play.  The Merkur blades are indeed sharp.  However, it still felt as though my beard was being pulled out one hair at a time.  Guys, there is a reason the single and double edged \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razors fell out of favor and style.  The term safety razor is an oxymoron. The primary reasons relate more to comfort than to blood loss, although both are valid concerns.  One thing about ownership of this thing; your wife won&#x27;t be borrowing it.  If she does, it will only be once.  Still, it does give a reasonably close shave, or as close as you dare.  With my banded razor, I could bear down on an area of my face that came out less than smooth after the first try.  If I try that with this straight edged thing, I&#x27;ll be going to the emergency room.  A few years ago, I got into straight edged razors.  Those things are also fine and will give you a reasonably close shave, providing you have the time to devote to shaving; God help you if you oversleep and look in the mirror with thoughts of doing this \\&quot;quickly.\\&quot;  The moral of all of this is, get the double edged razor if the rising cost of banded razors is your primary concern.  However, don&#x27;t throw away your banded razor and ensure you take your time with the double edged razor.  If you get in a hurry, or are otherwise heavy-handed, you will need plenty of towels, styptic sticks, and band-aids.</li>
            <li> Down right the best razor I could have purchased. Before purchasing the Merkur DE I was getting razor burn from the multi-blade cartridges. I tried everything, pre-shave ointments, steaming, creams, gels, different shaving lubricants, I mean everything. Finally I got fed up with having horrible razor burn and ingrown hairs, especially on my neck. I was originally going to go with a straight edged cut throat razor but the more research I did the more I wanted to purchase a Double Edge. I kept looking and this was the razor of choice. I use it with  \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades and its the more comfortable shave I can get. Still perfecting shaving against the grain and not just pulling the hair out but I&#x27;ll get there. The only con I can think of is the time it takes to learn to use a DE and the fact that I do have to shave a little more regularly since it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and then cut it like the multi-blade cartridges do. All in all more then I could have asked for, haven&#x27;t had any razor burn yet. And how can you beat 5+ shaves with a $0.20 blade!</li>
            <li> Old school, good look works very well. Sleek and stylish, thought it woulda been longer but it&#x27;s all about the feel</li>
            <li> I own an Edwin Jagger DE89 safety razor and decided to try the Merkur HD as well. For me, the quality of the shave from the HD is absolutely superb. It&#x60;s definitely a step up from the Edwin Jagger razor ( just my personal opinion - YMMV). When using the same blades in both razors, I find the Merkur HD a much smoother and a far better quality shave. Does seem to be slightly more aggressive, which seems to works well for my hard stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrome finish on the Edwin Jagger is definitely superior, but the finish on the Merkur is still good (time will tell). After all is said and done, I doubt very much that I&#x60;ll be using the Edwin Jagger DE89l razor again (packed away); the difference in the quality of the shave between the two is night and day for me. Thinking of perhaps maybe buying the HD gold version:)</li>
            <li> First and only double edged razor I own. It has a nice weight and feel to it. Looks great too</li>
            <li> Decided to put this razor in my cabinet after getting tired of paying to much for cartidges that I don&#x27;t think are giving me as close a shave. The handle on this model was a little shorter than I anticipated so if I had to make the purchase again I think I would go for  the model with the longer handle.</li>
            <li> I switched to a single edge safety razor a few months back and never looked back. For someone like me, whose beard grain swirls all over the place the single edge razor is much more effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face nearly as much.</li>
            <li> This classic way of shaving has been a perfect.  And this safety razor is godsend .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good weight, manufactured to last, and give good clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve saved a TON off $$$.  I&#x27;ve also reduced razor burn.  And it is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disposable razor industry sold us a bill of good.  Grandpa had it right all along!</li>
            <li> If you need a good, long lasting double edge razor then you need a Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;This one is &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; classic for a reason and while I like the razor (34C) I plan to get the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version (34C HD).&lt;br /&gt;It is a solid product, feels great, and shaves well.</li>
            <li> First of all, Merkur 178 &#x3D; Merkur 34C &#x3D; Merkur HD. These are various names and product numbers used interchangeably for the exact same razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving for about 12 years and switched 2 months ago to shaving with a safety razor. I am completely happy with this razor! It took ~5 shaves to get comfortable with this style of shaving, but from day 1 I was getting a closer, smoother, and less irritating shave than I ever did with a cartridge. Finally no more ingrown hairs and no more razor burn! These were both gone immediately with this razor. I can now shave in 10 mins, but give yourself 30-45 mins for the first few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a big favor and get a blade sampler pack to see which razor blade works best for you (I found that I like Feather the best), a good shaving brush (some good options here on Amazon - but I&#x27;d head over to WhippedDog and get a $26 silvertip badger!), a good shave soap/cream (I prefer Mike&#x27;s Natural Soaps and Taylor of Old Bond Street Coconut Cream), an alum block (to get rid of razor burn), and a good aftershave balm (like Nivea for sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son and he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband two years ago, who had never had a straight razor but wanted one. He loves it and uses it every morning. It has a really nice heavy feel so you don&#x27;t have to press hard on your face. He would never go back to disposables. A slightly longer handle might be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Four years later (bought in Apr 2010), it&#x27;s still going strong. It is my first DE razor and I&#x27;ve had it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has knurling, so you get a good grip even when wet. It has a nice weight to it, yet it&#x27;s not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently using it with Astra Superior Platinum DE blades, after using Derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that the handle is not very long, at about 75mm total, with 50mm for the actual handle portion. Merkur Model 180 has a longer handle. For me, the size of the model 178 is just fine</li>
            <li> Ive had this bad boy for 3 years now, its not going anywhere, blades are super cheap and environmentally this is a more responsible option than your standard supermarket options.</li>
