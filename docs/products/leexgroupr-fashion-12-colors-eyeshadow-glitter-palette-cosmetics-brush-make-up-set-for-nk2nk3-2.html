            <li>I am highly satisfied on how pigmented the colors are and how close it is to the real thing.</li>

            <li>At first glance you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>, i am aware that supposedly the mirror has a plastic</li>
            <li>, hopefully soon i can get the real Naked Smoky :)</li>

            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>I wish they had the original Naked palette.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this pallet.</li>
            <li>I wish i couldve gotten a brand new one</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just about any shade of gold/bronze/silvery pewter you could want and black, taupe and a couple really light colors for highlighting.</li>
            <li>Color selection is nice but quality is poor</li>

            <li> I love my palette it almost looks original really pigmented and it arrived way before time..im 1 happy camper lol</li>
            <li> I was very surprised and pleased with the quality of these Urban Decay knock off palettes! The colors are almost exact and highly pigmented! I received both palettes and am extremely happy! I recommend using your own brushes or buying some. The one that comes with is not the best. I wish they had the original Naked palette. Super fast shipping! You cannot beat the price or free shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product. Its a good dupe of the Naked 2 pallet by Urban Decay. At first glance you can&#x27;t tell the difference. The only thin is that 2 of the shadows look almost the same in color. If you an try to use a different brush, I say this because the hairs on one side fall out. Other than that I love this pallet. It&#x27;s a great price and it arrived on time and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Awesome dupe! I love it. Came quick too.</li>
            <li> OMG!! This is amazing, I have both and they are super close to the originals. they&#x27;re very pigmented and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail yesterday and used them today. I can&#x27;t believe how beautiful the colors are or how easily they were to apply and blend. They glide on like silk and stay put for more then 12 hours without a touch up. Very little creasing. My skin is on the oily side and I am 53.  I can easily make a dozen different looks with this palette of colors. Very pleased and will by again!</li>
            <li> Color selection is nice but quality is poor</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I am obsessed. Very pigmented on my skin tone. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied on how pigmented the colors are and how close it is to the real thing. Why pay $50 something dollars when you can get it for this price, you cant beat that!!!! I was dissapointed that the pallet looked used, the mirror is scratched up and the pallet just didnt look or feel brand new!!!!!! I wish i couldve gotten a brand new one, i am aware that supposedly the mirror has a plastic but i dont know how to take it off, other than that i love it!!!!!!! I am also waiting on the Naked 3 pallet! Im excited, hopefully soon i can get the real Naked Smoky :)</li>
            <li> i feel like i got a naked pallet</li>
            <li> pretty close to the real thing.. by glance you can&#x27;t tell.. colors are almost exact! stays better with primer. mirror is foggy but there&#x27;s a plastic film covering it &amp; it&#x27;s hard to get off. brush sucks but it&#x27;s ok I have plenty of my own.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and loved the colors but does stay better with primer :) but over all really happy</li>
            <li> Fantastic dupe! Really excited that the colors are a close match to the real thing and all of the labels are identical. Who needs to pay for the real deal when you can buy this? NOT TO MENTION that it was scheduled to arrive July 27th and it&#x27;s the 6th! So exciting!</li>
            <li> great palette  looks exactly like the naked 2 I have used it so much already I just ordered my naked 3 from this same buyer happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful. There&#x27;s just about any shade of gold/bronze/silvery pewter you could want and black, taupe and a couple really light colors for highlighting. The shimmers are not very pigmented, but the black is very pigmented. I usually contour with the black or the matte brown from my face contouring set and then lay over a couple colors of shimmer to make it pop. I really like this set. Especially when you compare the price! The little brush that comes with it works well too. The compact is not super sturdy, but I&#x27;m not concerned. It opens and closes, which is good enough for me. Mine arrived all in one piece.</li>
            <li> Love these colors and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay make up. Loved it</li>
            <li> Literally the same thing as naked. Absolutely love</li>
            <li> I love this compact. I use it almost everyday. I bought the other one as well. They arrived on time. You have to take the plastic of the mirror. I use my own brushes. I do use a eye primer before the shadow which helps with the pigment and helps it last longer.</li>
            <li> used with an eye primer this is a great product and definitely a great dupe for the $55 real thing.</li>
