            <li>The ladies just love it.</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>and this one moved up to the top three</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesnt react better on warmer days</li>
            <li>awesome product... lasts all day long</li>
            <li>Smells great anytime, and last longer than most Miyake scents.</li>
            <li>Unique ---everyone loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve received a number of compliments from people because it is unique.</li>
            <li>Mildly spicy/musky buy clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>i dont really understand top notes, etc in cologne.  </li>
            <li>Colognes in my top 20 colognes as  far as scent.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Appears to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance on this is strong and sweet so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>only issue with this and other Issey Miyake fragrances is although you can still smell it on your skin for 8hours or more</li>
            <li>Definitely the real deal, unlike some knock offs that are sold here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s traditionally masculine</li>
            <li>it doesnt projects very long -3-4hours and afer that it becomes an intimate skin</li>

            <li> Almost half the price of the stores around here and everyone says I smell great!</li>
            <li> got mine in the mail about 5 days after ordering and it looks good. I compared it to the .17oz sample of Nuit and it smelled the same to me.</li>
            <li> Could only find this on Amazon....great smelling mens cologne indeed.</li>
            <li> wow.  this is a very nice cologne.  i dont really understand top notes, etc in cologne.  i do understand when i get lots of compliments on how great i smell..  this is one of my favorite colognes.  i have about ten bottles and this one moved up to the top three and i have only had it a week.</li>
            <li> Another quality scent from this brand.  You cannot go wrong with whatever one you select.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described and ahead of promised date!</li>
            <li> One of my fav. Colognes in my top 20 colognes as  far as scent.&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of Burberry Brit Rhythm and YSL Nuit&lt;br /&gt;Great in any weather but best in spring fall weather.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this and other Issey Miyake fragrances is although you can still smell it on your skin for 8hours or more it doesnt projects very long -3-4hours and afer that it becomes an intimate skin scent.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt react better on warmer days however I just wish it project outward longer and that it didnt cling to my skin so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a wonderful scent However I dont think I will be buying it again unless they figure out how to make it last and projects longer.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  I went to the retail stores for this cologne and it retailed for $120.</li>
            <li> The fragrance on this is strong and sweet so a little goes a long way.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s traditionally masculine but I&#x27;ve received a number of compliments from people because it is unique.</li>
