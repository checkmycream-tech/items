            <li>that is what I like about it the best.  </li>
            <li>With just a hint of color and a beautiful sheen!  </li>
            <li>I always have to take a whiff when I apply, LOL.</li>
            <li>happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>But feels good not grease or sticky.</li>
            <li>It feels FABULOUS on my lips and an EXCELLENT price.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this gloss</li>
            <li>Good color</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, inexpensive warm nude lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Omg in love this is the most perfect nude gloss ever!</li>
            <li>I have paid so much more for products that are not as great as NYX products.  </li>
            <li>I love NYX products!</li>
            <li>amazing on and speedy delivery</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Fortune Cookie&amp;#34; is a warm, peachy nude.</li>
            <li>If you love nude lip products, this is a great, cheap find.</li>
            <li>,I&#x27;m almost positive it will look great on top of your favorite lipstick</li>
            <li>The best thing about this is that it is buildable, so you can get several looks out of this</li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>my favorite lipgloss ever</li>
            <li>I read a review on Amazon about these and had to try them out and am so glad I listened.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic nude shade for this pasty lady!</li>
            <li>great nude color highly recommend</li>
            <li>Super cute , but even better on top of a nude lipstick .</li>
            <li>just very sweet.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide smooth on the lips</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic too</li>
            <li>I reapply as needed (as with pretty much any lip gloss I own).</li>
            <li>This will always be in my makeup case, so far all of the butter colors are just beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>I am very, very picky about glosses.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Looks great with dark eye make-up, or if you&#x27;re just going for something natural with a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too light or cool where it gives a &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34; look, but actually complements my fair-medium complexion really well.</li>
            <li>The consistency isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and actually feels smooth and &amp;#34;butter-like.&amp;#34; And the smell is divine...</li>
            <li>Creamy and nice texture but does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>Love the color, just wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li>I wear it plain on my lips and love it</li>
            <li>very natural looking</li>
            <li>I will be getting either clear lip butter or maybe a soft pink</li>

            <li> my favorite can never go wrong</li>
            <li> Best color EVER and I can&#x27;t find it in any stores in Columbus! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have to use two coats to see the color. But feels good not grease or sticky. It doesn&#x27;t glide smooth on the lips but it is not a big issue.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it, reasons above</li>
            <li> amazing on and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> The best thing about this is that it is buildable, so you can get several looks out of this</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, inexpensive warm nude lip gloss. The consistency isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and actually feels smooth and &amp;#34;butter-like.&amp;#34; And the smell is divine... they all smell like cake batter or vanilla... just very sweet. I always have to take a whiff when I apply, LOL. &amp;#34;Fortune Cookie&amp;#34; is a warm, peachy nude. No shimmer or glitter. No grainy texture. It isn&#x27;t too light or cool where it gives a &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34; look, but actually complements my fair-medium complexion really well. I love how moisturizing it is. I reapply as needed (as with pretty much any lip gloss I own). If you love nude lip products, this is a great, cheap find.</li>
            <li> my favorite lipgloss ever</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nude shade!! I love NYX products!</li>
            <li> My friend recently gave me the NYX butter gloss. Yes, I have an awesome friend and this is an awesome gloss. I am very, very picky about glosses. This is non-sticky and the fortune cookie color is just a hint of color (the only thing I can wear for work). It feels FABULOUS on my lips and an EXCELLENT price. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> The color that I got was fortune cookie and for some reason it&#x27;s washes out my face. I will be getting either clear lip butter or maybe a soft pink</li>
            <li> I thought it would be ever so slightly pinker than it is. Creamy and nice texture but does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Love the color, just wish it lasted a little longer. I find myself reapplying it every 20 mins or so.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this gloss but everywhere I went it was sold out I wear it plain on my lips and love it,I&#x27;m almost positive it will look great on top of your favorite lipstick great nude color highly recommend</li>
            <li> Unbelievable color very natural looking that is what I like about it the best.  With just a hint of color and a beautiful sheen!  The price is fantastic too I have paid so much more for products that are not as great as NYX products.  I read a review on Amazon about these and had to try them out and am so glad I listened.  This will always be in my makeup case, so far all of the butter colors are just beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> Good color but makes my lips peel.</li>
            <li> Super cute , but even better on top of a nude lipstick . I definitely recommend this lip gloss</li>
            <li> Omg in love this is the most perfect nude gloss ever! Seriously buy it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic nude shade for this pasty lady! Looks great with dark eye make-up, or if you&#x27;re just going for something natural with a bit of shimmer.</li>
