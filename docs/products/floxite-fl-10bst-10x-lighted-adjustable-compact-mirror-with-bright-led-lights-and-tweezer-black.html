    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li>The magnification on it is great!</li>
            <li>If you pluck hairs before you go to bed (so you can sleep the swelling off), try it in a darkened room, that&#x27;s the best way I&#x27;ve found to use it.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for home and travel.  </li>
            <li>but with this it has been great.</li>
            <li>The lights -- when working -- were great.</li>
            <li>and they ever so kindly sent me two replacement mirrors!  </li>
            <li>The good news, I can do something about it.</li>
            <li>good light, nice shape, good price, great tweezer!</li>
            <li>I love this mirror!  </li>
            <li>hairs around my mouth look HUGE now, and are easy to pluck out- excellent magnification!</li>
            <li>This product is a nice idea.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice pair of tweezers .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s handy if you are in a bind i guess.  </li>
            <li>Bright light also makes your pupils contract, which allows you to focus better at close range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely and opens easily.    </li>
            <li>Make sure you look at the size before ordering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad ti fing it.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this again.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>You find many things you see with the magnifying mirror that you don&#x27;t see with your bathroom mirror.....</li>
            <li>I bought this for my travel kit and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I can see chin hairs or mustache hairs with the product, but more than two inches away from your face, there&#x27;s distortion...</li>
            <li>Even though I paid over $16 for this, I can&#x27;t imagine it costing more than $2 to produce, the bulk of the cost in labor and shipping.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure these would work when the batteries needed replacing.  </li>
            <li>The good news was after returning it, we received the replacement right away.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this was a good product.</li>
            <li>Nice size, well made, good strength, decent light.  </li>
            <li>The light is limiting and the distortion more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li>Not too bulky for travel adjust height wise very conveniently.</li>
            <li>He said the mirror size was perfect for travel and the magnification was powerful enough.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t recommend this product as a LIGHTED mirror, although if you just want a convenient size folding magnifying mirror, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a mirror with a light, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this size magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>Now, about 5 months after purchase, the light has stopped working.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t want a portable light up mirror.  </li>
            <li>It is compact and the lighting is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was perfect as usual.</li>
            <li>This is very important because you really need brighter light to see a magnified image.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble seeing what I need to see and the compact size is perfect, even when I only need to take my carry on suitcase.  </li>
            <li>So if you need a larger magnifying mirror with good light, I recommend the [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>Now I have four mirrors that I can use only in brightly lit rooms and</li>
            <li>The light is not always in the right place.</li>
            <li>shipped and refunded quickly.</li>
            <li>The new model solved this problem by using two brighter and more focused LED lights.</li>
            <li>the size was not bad, the 10X magnify was helpful but really wish the light was brighter.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a compact travel mirror for quite a while with strong magnification and decent lighting.  </li>
            <li>you need to put your face up close to it to see more clearly.  </li>
            <li>It is great for plucking eye brows but not so much for any other areas of the face (chin, etc).</li>
            <li>and you have to bring it right up to your face to see anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light was a little too bright, although sometimes useful, so I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these mirrors and liked it so much, I bought a second.  </li>
            <li>But I wanted the newer model mainly because it offers better</li>
            <li>finally need to replace the button cells after more than one year.</li>
            <li>finally need to replace the button cells after more than one year.</li>
            <li>After getting contacts for the first time, I bought this mirror to take on a trip, knowing that I could not put my contacts in without a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>Also, within the first week the on/off button stopped working.</li>
            <li>Then the lights died in the first mirror, so I tried changing the batteries.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed while it lasted.</li>
            <li>My first thought was batteries, so I replaced them to no avail.</li>
            <li>I tried putting in new batteries, even though I could tell that the switch wasn&#x27;t working right, since it&#x27;s mushy when I push on it.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The problem was it didn&#x27;t give enough light for his needs.</li>
            <li>She loves it and it really does the job for her very well.</li>
            <li>The new mirror comes with a pair of tweezers, which is exactly what I use this mirror for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good for very close work on a very small area.</li>
            <li>Cheaper plastic makes up this mirror, who&#x27;s design is rather good but falls short in the light being so weak</li>
            <li>The magnification was a little too much (since many of us don&#x27;t want to see every pore, hair, and defect on our face at 10 times its normal size!)</li>
            <li>I hope another brand will have lights that work with new batteries!</li>
            <li>as a replacement for an older model, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The light is really helpful in dark hotel rooms and bathrooms.</li>
            <li>I had it roughly five months when the light stopped working.</li>
            <li>The new mirror stands taller when fully extended&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first the lights do not come back on.</li>
            <li>At first the lights do not come back on.</li>
            <li>The new mirror allows a longer working distance of around 5\\&quot; between the mirror and my face (instead of just 4\\&quot; for the old mirror).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>older model uses two incandescent bulbs that give out very little light.</li>
            <li>The old mirror surface is a 3.8\\&quot; circle, with lower portion cut off for the lights.</li>
            <li>last thing I need to point out: this mirror, as the name suggests, is very compact.</li>
            <li>So far he hasn&#x27;t had a problem with this one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s correct that you can only literally see one spot and you have to get really really close.  </li>
            <li>The two LED lights that are on the bottom of this mirror just aren&#x27;t enough to illuminate the whole mirror.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I really don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s on a stand: it&#x27;s not tall enough to put on a vanity or a table to use without hunching over</li>
            <li>I had the old mirror in my office for the past ~5 years and found it very useful for emergency</li>
            <li>So I just stick a small piece of sponge on top of each cell, then close down the battery door.gests, is very compact.</li>
            <li>The new mirror is a 3.4\\&quot; square, which actually provides a larger reflective area.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some other differences between old and new models (see the photo I uploaded to &#x27;Customer Images&#x27; section):&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>So I just stick a small piece of sponge on top of each cell, then close down the battery door.</li>
            <li>In fact, the bulbs are so dim that I often accidentally left them on overnight until the batteries ran flat.</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;m now less likely to leave the light on accidentally, maybe the battery life is less of a concern.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t expect those batteries to give a very long runtime.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is small, also I am near sighted to start with-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not good enough for nearly 20$.  </li>
            <li> It is a little big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so frustrated because, other than this problem, I just love these mirrors.  </li>
            <li> I have to be extremely close to see anything.</li>
            <li> And it angles so you can use it standing up or sitting down.</li>

            <li> What I found is that the two button cells need to be pressed down slightly, in order to make electrical contact.</li>
            <li> By the way, when the batteries do run out, you can either send Floxite $6 for a set of two CR2032 cells, or you can serach Amazon and get them for less than 1/3</li>
            <li> Of course, there&#x27;s only a 90-day guarantee, so be wary if you buy this expecting a lighted mirror that will last even 6 months, let alone longer.</li>
            <li> For less than 10$ it will do for something to throw in your purse or overnight bag.    </li>
            <li> this is typical of high-magnification mirrors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: This has lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad mirror or badly made.  </li>
            <li> With restricted travel sizes and weights these days, every little bit counts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mirrors that are magnified 10xs and 20xs (unlit) in the past and paid $2 for one and $5 for the other.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who has trouble with her close-up vision, she wanted one to put on her eye make up.</li>
            <li> Still no light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably bought eight of the CR2032 batteries required and they&#x27;re not cheap.  </li>
            <li> It is small but still quite functional.</li>
            <li> Unless you can rewire small electric items, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> The light is an awful tint and its blinding since the mirror is small</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to do my eyebrows</li>

            <li> I love this mirror!  I had been looking for a compact travel mirror for quite a while with strong magnification and decent lighting.  This mirror surpassed my expectations.  I have no trouble seeing what I need to see and the compact size is perfect, even when I only need to take my carry on suitcase.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Make sure you look at the size before ordering. I have to be extremely close to see anything. The light is not always in the right place. I can only see one part of my eye brow. It is great for plucking eye brows but not so much for any other areas of the face (chin, etc).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 3 years ago and have been looking for another one for some time. I&#x27;m so glad ti fing it. I wear glasses and it&#x27;s hard to do my eyebrows but with this it has been great. So glad to find this again.</li>
            <li> good light, nice shape, good price, great tweezer! hairs around my mouth look HUGE now, and are easy to pluck out- excellent magnification! Yes, this product is small, also I am near sighted to start with- but this product surpassed my dreams!</li>
            <li> Cheaper plastic makes up this mirror, who&#x27;s design is rather good but falls short in the light being so weak you hardly know you turned it on.  If you are looking for a mirror with a light, look elsewhere.  I wish it was easier to send back,; I would have.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  I take it with me every time I travel.  I also have a spare and use it for checking my make up after it is applied.  You find many things you see with the magnifying mirror that you don&#x27;t see with your bathroom mirror.....</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this size magnifying mirror. Not too bulky for travel adjust height wise very conveniently. It is small but still quite functional.</li>
            <li> I bought this [[ASIN:B003NRVA5Q Floxite Fl-10bst 10x Lighted Adjustable Compact Mirror]] as a replacement for an older model, the [[ASIN:B001CCQ84C Floxite Lighted Adjustable Mirror]]. I had the old mirror in my office for the past ~5 years and found it very useful for emergency Do-It-Yourself eye surgery (I have problems with inward growing eyelash). But I wanted the newer model mainly because it offers better illumination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older model uses two incandescent bulbs that give out very little light. In fact, the bulbs are so dim that I often accidentally left them on overnight until the batteries ran flat. The new model solved this problem by using two brighter and more focused LED lights. This is very important because you really need brighter light to see a magnified image. Bright light also makes your pupils contract, which allows you to focus better at close range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other differences between old and new models (see the photo I uploaded to &#x27;Customer Images&#x27; section):&lt;br /&gt;- The old mirror surface is a 3.8\\&quot; circle, with lower portion cut off for the lights. The new mirror is a 3.4\\&quot; square, which actually provides a larger reflective area.&lt;br /&gt;- The new mirror stands taller when fully extended&lt;br /&gt;- The new mirror allows a longer working distance of around 5\\&quot; between the mirror and my face (instead of just 4\\&quot; for the old mirror).&lt;br /&gt;- The new mirror comes with a pair of tweezers, which is exactly what I use this mirror for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side: the LED lamps are powered by two CR2032 Lithium button cells. I don&#x27;t expect those batteries to give a very long runtime. But since I&#x27;m now less likely to leave the light on accidentally, maybe the battery life is less of a concern. By the way, when the batteries do run out, you can either send Floxite $6 for a set of two CR2032 cells, or you can serach Amazon and get them for less than 1/3 the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing I need to point out: this mirror, as the name suggests, is very compact. So if you need a larger magnifying mirror with good light, I recommend the [[ASIN:B001FS0HAY Floxite Daylight Vanity Mirror]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update on July 28, 2013]&lt;br /&gt;I finally need to replace the button cells after more than one year. At first the lights do not come back on. What I found is that the two button cells need to be pressed down slightly, in order to make electrical contact. So I just stick a small piece of sponge on top of each cell, then close down the battery door.gests, is very compact.

            <li> This is a handy little product. I use it when I travel (I have another much larger mirror I use at home).</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this was a good product. The magnification was a little too much (since many of us don&#x27;t want to see every pore, hair, and defect on our face at 10 times its normal size!) but helpful for plucking eyebrows, etc. The light was a little too bright, although sometimes useful, so I didn&#x27;t use it much. Now, about 5 months after purchase, the light has stopped working. I tried putting in new batteries, even though I could tell that the switch wasn&#x27;t working right, since it&#x27;s mushy when I push on it. So I can&#x27;t recommend this product as a LIGHTED mirror, although if you just want a convenient size folding magnifying mirror, it&#x27;s fine. Of course, there&#x27;s only a 90-day guarantee, so be wary if you buy this expecting a lighted mirror that will last even 6 months, let alone longer.</li>
            <li> This product is a nice idea.  Who wouldn&#x27;t want a portable light up mirror.  The light is an awful tint and its blinding since the mirror is small you need to put your face up close to it to see more clearly.  It comes with a nice pair of tweezers .</li>
            <li> Nice size, well made, good strength, decent light.  But yikes now I can see things I didn&#x27;t even know were there.  The good news, I can do something about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad mirror or badly made.  It&#x27;s just not good enough for nearly 20$.  For less than 10$ it will do for something to throw in your purse or overnight bag.    It is good for very close work on a very small area. It folds up nicely and opens easily.    The light is limiting and the distortion more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li> After getting contacts for the first time, I bought this mirror to take on a trip, knowing that I could not put my contacts in without a magnifying mirror.  It is compact and the lighting is fantastic.  The tweezers work well too.  Not only did I use it on my trip, I use it at home now every day too.  It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my travel kit and am glad I did. The magnification on it is great! In fact, I wish my at-home mirror magnified this well. The light is really helpful in dark hotel rooms and bathrooms. And it angles so you can use it standing up or sitting down. It is a little big and that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t rate it with 5 stars. With restricted travel sizes and weights these days, every little bit counts. But I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband, sold by Amazon. Amazon was perfect as usual. He said the mirror size was perfect for travel and the magnification was powerful enough. The problem was it didn&#x27;t give enough light for his needs. Also, within the first week the on/off button stopped working. The good news was after returning it, we received the replacement right away. We even received a call informing us that they were promptly taking care of it. So far he hasn&#x27;t had a problem with this one.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who has trouble with her close-up vision, she wanted one to put on her eye make up. She loves it and it really does the job for her very well.</li>
            <li> Broke after the third use. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> the size was not bad, the 10X magnify was helpful but really wish the light was brighter.  it&#x27;s correct that you can only literally see one spot and you have to get really really close.  but you are still sort of straining to see that one spot.  it&#x27;s handy if you are in a bind i guess.  but not for me.  returned it and got refund.  shipped and refunded quickly.</li>
            <li> I paid over sixteen dollars for this. It does the job, but for only having two lights, I think it&#x27;s pricey.  I&#x27;ve had mirrors that are magnified 10xs and 20xs (unlit) in the past and paid $2 for one and $5 for the other. The two LED lights that are on the bottom of this mirror just aren&#x27;t enough to illuminate the whole mirror.  Plus, the lights are pointed downwards. The tweezers have sharp edges, so I wouldn&#x27;t use them near your eyes.  I can see chin hairs or mustache hairs with the product, but more than two inches away from your face, there&#x27;s distortion...this is typical of high-magnification mirrors. If you want to do your eyebrows, you have to turn the mirror upside down so the lights won&#x27;t shine in your eyes.  I&#x27;ve found that the lights aren&#x27;t helpful during daytime.  If you pluck hairs before you go to bed (so you can sleep the swelling off), try it in a darkened room, that&#x27;s the best way I&#x27;ve found to use it.  Finally, I really don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s on a stand: it&#x27;s not tall enough to put on a vanity or a table to use without hunching over and you have to bring it right up to your face to see anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This has lasted less than a year. I only used it for about three months, then the wires at the hinges got stripped and shredded from the opening and closing of the compact, thus rendering the two, tiny lights inoperable. I took it apart to replace the wires and was disappointed to see the cheapness of the materials used and the sloppy soldering of the wires to the battery stations. Even though I paid over $16 for this, I can&#x27;t imagine it costing more than $2 to produce, the bulk of the cost in labor and shipping. Unless you can rewire small electric items, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these mirrors and liked it so much, I bought a second.  Then the lights died in the first mirror, so I tried changing the batteries. Still no light.  Same thing happened with the second mirror.  I wrote Floxite and they ever so kindly sent me two replacement mirrors!  I thought for sure these would work when the batteries needed replacing.  Nope.  Now I have four mirrors that I can use only in brightly lit rooms and even then I miss the lights on the mirrors themselves, and I can&#x27;t use them for travel where the lighting is poor.  I&#x27;ve probably bought eight of the CR2032 batteries required and they&#x27;re not cheap.  I&#x27;m so frustrated because, other than this problem, I just love these mirrors.  They&#x27;re perfect for home and travel.  The lights -- when working -- were great. I hope another brand will have lights that work with new batteries!</li>
            <li> Love it even though I got the wrong shape and color. Don&#x27;t care keeping it anyways</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed while it lasted. I had it roughly five months when the light stopped working. My first thought was batteries, so I replaced them to no avail. Upon closer inspection, I find the wires leading up from the switch in the base into the mirror/light cover have been severed by the hing in the mirror. They aren&#x27;t long enough for me to pull out and splice, so I guess this thing is toast.</li>
