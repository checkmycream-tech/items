            <li>a decade ago.... I loved it!!!</li>
            <li>I tried loreal man; and it was superb...</li>
            <li>Best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li>though - it is a perfect combination.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, this brush is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I have EVER used.</li>

            <li>LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li>Its the best mascara I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>coats each lash beautifully.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this product is great.</li>
            <li>the money you will save,you can go buy that great lipstick you always wanted.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any flaking either.</li>
            <li>I would be happy if this were called garbage can, or craptastic, or anything else, because it&#x27;s just that</li>
            <li>and Lancome has great, but pricey, mascaras.</li>
            <li>and it has great definition.</li>
            <li>My fave was Great Lash by Maybelline</li>
            <li>and that is still great</li>
            <li>and it just disappears so it is easier to remove than Great Lash as well.</li>
            <li>She was happy with it.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about Manga, so I went for it.</li>
            <li>Manga is very nice.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about buying this because of all the awesome ratings people gave it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to help make the eyes- the lashes more beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love it, its easy to apply and makes my lashes look &amp;#34;totally manga.&amp;#34; LOL!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>: Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this Mascara!</li>
            <li>Totally love it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I am always trying the latest mascaras, so of course I had to pick this one up!  </li>
            <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll love it also!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>but this product is amazing and everyone should know about it.  </li>
            <li>for the things I liked about the mascara. 1</li>
            <li>I liked the brush.</li>
            <li>Those kind don&#x27;t work for my lashes and I won&#x27;t purchase a mascara with a rubber brush</li>
            <li>This mascara had a bristle type brush with a narrower end that I liked.</li>
            <li>The brush is very springy as others have stated, and it works awesomely.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, based on the reviews - but it makes my eyelashes look incredible!</li>
            <li>My new FAVORITE mascara!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, it adds volume and length, almost as much as my Too Face &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34; mascara, and it does wash off.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing thing though, is that there are no clumps.at.all.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a suitable replacement.... for a lonnnnng time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It goes on beautifully and builds quickly for huge lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead, I have very light, almost translucent eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara- makes lashes very full even of first coat.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s on the lower end pricewise since I&#x27;ll be using it until it gets discontinued</li>
            <li>After that, it&#x27;s great for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Favorite mascara at the moment.</li>
            <li>2) it has too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>The closest I have come is Tarte Gifted Mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clumpy with more than one coat.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Have tried so many drugstore</li>
            <li>the mascara is okay.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
            <li>I was strolling thru Target and the packaging was adorable.</li>
            <li>I prefer the plastic applicators, my favorite being the butterfly mascara wand.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>But I LOVE THIS MASCARA.</li>
            <li>I looked up and they had it on the top top shelf.</li>
            <li>So glad I did....</li>
            <li>the marketing people over at Benefit better be shakin&#x27; in their boots, because this stuff makes my lashes look like falsies.</li>
            <li>Better keep looking, ma&#x27;am, because we are all out</li>
            <li>you want to try this magical lash potion?</li>
            <li>I can purchase three of these for what I was paying for one tube and this is even better than what I was using.  </li>
            <li>Awesome investment, and actually works as shown in the add.</li>
            <li>And I can coat on as many coats as I want and it never clumps.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>loads of volume, and length without being clumpy... love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Great item, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>More like a macys type of&lt;br /&gt;Mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this mascara.</li>
            <li>; mascara much more.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a huge selection and my Mom bought one of the manga line and liked it</li>
            <li>The formula is ok</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much better than the $25 mascara I was using from one of the beauty stores, so that says a lot.</li>
            <li>If the wand wasn&#x27;t as flexible I would like it way more.</li>
            <li>I am deeply madly in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>love this product.....</li>
            <li>I would say this mascara is more for length than volume for sure.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara~.</li>
            <li>Really love this mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest in saying that I initially bought this mascara because I thought it looked cute &amp; liked how &amp;#34;Manga&amp;#34; was written on it :p</li>
            <li>Works great, my new favorite</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, the formula is amazing!</li>
            <li>but this Miss Manga is pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you like a light, whisper coat of mascara you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing good about this product.</li>
            <li>so i had to seperate my lashes, but overall good product.!</li>
            <li>Great coverage, lowest price new, overall happy with the mascara-</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s inexpensive and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This mascara is easy to build up and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, stays on well</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend</li>
            <li>one is not the waterproof one but not get run easy w tears or swet.&lt;br /&gt;Backest black are the perfect for those fogy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super cheap in price!</li>
            <li>HUGE lashes.</li>
            <li>I generally use one coat for every day but two coats looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;Oréal.  </li>
            <li>I have really light colored lashes, heck</li>
            <li>but with this it was so even and smooth</li>
            <li>I can even wear the darker color if I use it lightly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are short and straight, and this is the perfect remedy.</li>
            <li>It preforms better than almost all the high end ones I&#x27;ve tried plus it has an adorable name.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras over the years from $3-$30, and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>Well I love anime and manga and always love the character&#x27;s big eyes and cute eyelashes.</li>
            <li>With one swipe of this, I became extremely excited.  </li>
            <li>I originally gave this two stars because I found it clumpy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several low-end and high-end mascaras and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything special about the mascara.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job, for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s possibly the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far, high end or drugstore.  </li>
            <li>It wears very light and is super smudge proof, and the price is great (in-store - as others have pointed out, it usually runs under $10 everywhere).  </li>
            <li>but I take my time to make sure it doesn&#x27;t look too much.</li>
            <li>I love it that much.</li>
            <li>And I can say, without a doubt, that all these glowing reviews are completely true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have full or lengthy lashes.</li>
            <li>Mascara has to be something super special for me to pay department store prices (I like the &#x27;tubing&#x27; technology)</li>
            <li>I love love love this mascara, hands down</li>
            <li>More pros than cons for this one, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it didn&#x27;t really create any sort of effect for me that makes it more than just a nice mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a mild clumps, gives some volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of L&#x27;oreal mascara and a lot of more expensive, department store brands, and this is THE BEST.  </li>
            <li>This was the type of mascara I dreamt of being able to find in high school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>but I do love how a new mascara brush looks and feels.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great black color.</li>
            <li>It doesnt clump and it really lasts all day without dripping or smudging and is easy to remove with my makeup remover at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>that It sticks really well to my lashes and it&#x27;s easily buildable.</li>
            <li>so of course that&#x27;s why I bought this, but hot damn!</li>
            <li>The flexible brush is quite nice, actually.</li>
            <li>I liked it, it&#x27;s definitely volumizing.!</li>
            <li>I really liked it upon initial application.  </li>
            <li>Not really manga style, but a good mascara still</li>
            <li>I like a more natural look.</li>
            <li>However, it is the kind of maxcara that one coat is enough with.</li>
            <li>My lashes were soooo long &amp; just with one coat, I could just imagine with more!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy cheap mascaras</li>
            <li>Of course I have to say I&#x27;m a mascara snob/fiend and the hot pink tube caught my eye first, good packaging choice</li>
            <li>nice mascara makes the lashes very long</li>
            <li>The brush part is actually great, it allows me to get to the inner lashes since its smaller from the tip; however, I do not like the wand itself, I know its suppose to be flexible</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay overall.</li>
            <li>It definitely defines and creates volume without clumping better than name brand products.</li>
            <li>But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get longer lashes, which is most of us(</li>
            <li>I really wish I could return it!</li>
            <li>I would like it better with a standard brush.</li>
            <li>U&#x27;ll just go about batting ur eyelashes at everybody and feeling pretty.</li>
            <li>Upon first seeing the commercials for Miss Manga Mascara, I thought- &amp;#34;There&#x27;s no way</li>
            <li>The commercial is cute though, and I am into anime and manga so why not try it?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>When falsies first came out, like ummmm....</li>
            <li>LOVE, i use it over another mascara for extra length, you do have to watch those can be clumpy</li>
            <li>I love how only one coat makes the biggest difference on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a lot more of this stuff in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have used so many different mascaras over the years,  including L&#x27;Oréal.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara, others claim to add length to your lashes this one definitely does the trick.</li>
            <li>I love Voluminous and wear it daily, but after years of use, I thought I might try something else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smearproof too!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that actually gives you volume and length make sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li>This worked super well, even prompting my mother to ask me when she first saw me the other day, &amp;#34;is that new mascara?&amp;#34; I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>The product is VERY clumpy right out of the packaging and the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; brush is counterproductive.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything special espesecially seeing how the brush applicator was ordinary.</li>
            <li>Then the little flexible part is great, because it moves through your lashes better than a stiff wand.</li>
            <li>My lashes are of average length, but somewhat light in color and fine.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said, you could easily go with one coat for this mascara; I use two for super length, but three makes it a bit clumpy and weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look super long and full.</li>
            <li>This mascara made my lashes look the longest and fullest than any other I&#x27;ve tried&amp;is so easy to apply, aftr two coats, my lashes are bomb!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, but the brush is weird...  </li>
            <li>lots of compliments and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really dislike that</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara...</li>
            <li>The price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have spent much more ( hello, Perversion mascara) and had poorer results than with this mascara.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product.</li>
            <li>I ask for any brand that will make my lashes really pop with volume, etc.</li>
            <li>The wand in the manga mascara is very flexible and I just didn&#x27;t think it would do much.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much from it since I always think commercials overhype results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clumpy and my lashes look so much longer.  </li>
            <li>However, the brush really detracts from this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have to worry that much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like a whole lot is in the bottle, but if you can find it in town</li>
            <li>It does give volume but the lashes are very spidery.</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal mascaras because...</li>
            <li>I still really like the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous</li>
            <li>It has a real bristle brush, NOT a silicone nubbed one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted the whole day and it didn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>I really like that my lashes didn&#x27;t clump together with this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not the mascara that really make you look manga for real.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; into the lash line.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this mascara is that the wand is like a flexible Christmas tree shape.</li>
            <li>I looked at it on Amazon and just couldn&#x27;t believe it would cost that much.</li>
            <li>I cant tell you too much about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Also removes really well.</li>
            <li>Really like the product, it lengthens and volumises.</li>
            <li>I am willing to take a chance on a new mascara if it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a month because it kind of dries out quicker than other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The main con is that it has a tendency to clump more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have the original version since I bought it as soon as I saw the commercial and</li>
            <li>and comes off easily by rubbing wet fingers together over it.</li>
            <li>however it goes quickly if used daily.</li>
            <li>buy the high end mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product and came out unimpressed.</li>
            <li>Overall really great, but I will probably go back to my old standby of LashBlast after this tube is empty.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Even tho the brush is a little flimsy, but it does bend to do the bottom lashes, the mascara goes on smooth and really does lengthen the lashes!</li>
            <li>It makes putting it on your bottom lashes kind of hard, because it bounces.  </li>
            <li>Happy to admit that I was TOTALLY wrong.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my eyelashes supper thick my kind of mascara.</li>
            <li>The only thing is when the mascara is about to end , it gets dry and flakes a bit&amp;takes more then one coat to make them look  </li>
            <li>(I got blackest black), very full, defined lashes.</li>
            <li>I am always trying new mascaras because I am a junkie.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought a new mascara in a while.</li>
            <li>I have found my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li>The mascara bottle is super cute, and the wand bends so you can get those extra hard lashes in the corner.</li>
            <li>It goes on kind of thick and wet but dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I bought special argan oil wet wipes just for that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pump the mascara or even use it very often and it barely lasted a month.</li>
            <li>It made my lashes longer and it separated my lashes even with the old mascara on them!</li>
            <li>Because after the first couple of tubes, it hasn&#x27;t been the same.</li>
            <li>Two stars for the color itself being vivid and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I have light colored everything, so I usually have to be super careful not to put too much mascara on</li>
            <li>Let me say right off the bat that I could not give a hoot less about anime, or manga, or whatever that whole thing is about.</li>
            <li>Huge long lashes in a few swipes and it lasts pretty well for the workday.</li>
            <li>My dream is to find a natural mascara that works.</li>
            <li>I like an old school fat bristly brush.</li>
            <li>Even after the first swipe my lashes were twice as long, and visibly thicker.  </li>
            <li>Actually il eat the whole damn pie.</li>
            <li>It really added an OOMF to my eyes and definitely finished off my eye look.</li>
            <li>I remove it with Lush&#x27;s 9-5 liquid cleanser</li>
            <li>It gives me doll eyes (wide and thick eyelashes) for a good price.</li>
            <li>This mascara, in spite of the silly name, is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many kinds, and have had so-so results with maybe one or two, but don&#x27;t really have any desire to use false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>However, the clumps were small and easy to get rid off.</li>
            <li>I just find that I need to be careful to not over apply as it gets dramatic in a hurry (which is great for evenings/weekend but not a work look in a conservative office).</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t clump so bad it would be pretty good</li>
            <li>I used a generic applicator that I bought at Sally Beauty Supply, to get the product to look halfway decent.</li>
            <li>(haven&#x27;t tried the waterproof, though), and gets those little tiny lashes that are so easy to miss.</li>
            <li>and I certainly plan in using it for as long as they continue making it!</li>
            <li>brush is way more springy than I expected even after reviews but as other people have pointed out in other places, that does allow the brush to really grab and comb through the lashes.</li>
            <li>Not these new rubber things with tiny spikes on the end.</li>
            <li>Irritated my eyes and dried out quickly.</li>
            <li>When I got home and saw that this arrived, I couldn&#x27;t even wait to have bare lashes to try it!</li>
            <li>The wand is tricky i&#x27;ll admit, but once you get the hang of this baby, put the right amount, comb thru, dry a bit, go back and repeat gently, wiggle wiggle and comb through, you&#x27;ll be cross eyed with shock staring at your lush eyelashes one eye after the other.</li>
            <li>formula is more wet than I usually use</li>
            <li>Is ok but not great , nothing that manga tv efect (</li>
            <li>I understand the need for companies to change things up to stay trendy, but this stuff is just weird.</li>
            <li>It took a little time to get used to the flexible wand, but once I did I had better application with less clumping.  </li>
            <li>I no longer use Urban Decay, bombshell or the other types of double layer mascaras with a white plumper layer then black top coat.</li>
            <li>This makes my short lashes look glam fast without wet smears or a department store price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other pricey high end mascara</li>
            <li>Why on earth would anyone pay so much when you can get it at the local drug store for so much less.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I have average length in my lashes, average thickness, and they&#x27;re straight.</li>

            <li> I would be happy if this were called garbage can, or craptastic, or anything else, because it&#x27;s just that</li>
            <li> and Lancome has great, but pricey, mascaras.</li>
            <li> and it has great definition.</li>
            <li> My fave was Great Lash by Maybelline</li>
            <li> and that is still great</li>
            <li> and it just disappears so it is easier to remove than Great Lash as well.</li>
            <li> She was happy with it.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about Manga, so I went for it.</li>
            <li> Manga is very nice.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about buying this because of all the awesome ratings people gave it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to help make the eyes- the lashes more beautifully.</li>

            <li> Totally love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I am always trying the latest mascaras, so of course I had to pick this one up!  </li>
            <li> Try it and you&#x27;ll love it also!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> but this product is amazing and everyone should know about it.  </li>
            <li> for the things I liked about the mascara. 1</li>
            <li> I liked the brush.</li>
            <li> Those kind don&#x27;t work for my lashes and I won&#x27;t purchase a mascara with a rubber brush</li>
            <li> This mascara had a bristle type brush with a narrower end that I liked.</li>
            <li> The brush is very springy as others have stated, and it works awesomely.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, based on the reviews - but it makes my eyelashes look incredible!</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE mascara!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, it adds volume and length, almost as much as my Too Face &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34; mascara, and it does wash off.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing thing though, is that there are no clumps.at.all.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a suitable replacement.... for a lonnnnng time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It goes on beautifully and builds quickly for huge lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, I have very light, almost translucent eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Great mascara- makes lashes very full even of first coat.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> So glad it&#x27;s on the lower end pricewise since I&#x27;ll be using it until it gets discontinued</li>
            <li> After that, it&#x27;s great for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara at the moment.</li>
            <li> 2) it has too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> The closest I have come is Tarte Gifted Mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy with more than one coat.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Have tried so many drugstore</li>
            <li> the mascara is okay.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
            <li> I was strolling thru Target and the packaging was adorable.</li>
            <li> I prefer the plastic applicators, my favorite being the butterfly mascara wand.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> But I LOVE THIS MASCARA.</li>
            <li> I looked up and they had it on the top top shelf.</li>
            <li> So glad I did....</li>
            <li> the marketing people over at Benefit better be shakin&#x27; in their boots, because this stuff makes my lashes look like falsies.</li>
            <li> Better keep looking, ma&#x27;am, because we are all out</li>
            <li> you want to try this magical lash potion?</li>
            <li> I can purchase three of these for what I was paying for one tube and this is even better than what I was using.  </li>
            <li> Awesome investment, and actually works as shown in the add.</li>
            <li> And I can coat on as many coats as I want and it never clumps.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> loads of volume, and length without being clumpy... love.</li>
            <li> love.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Great item, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> More like a macys type of&lt;br /&gt;Mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this mascara.</li>
            <li> ; mascara much more.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a huge selection and my Mom bought one of the manga line and liked it</li>
            <li> The formula is ok</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much better than the $25 mascara I was using from one of the beauty stores, so that says a lot.</li>
            <li> If the wand wasn&#x27;t as flexible I would like it way more.</li>
            <li> I am deeply madly in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> love this product.....</li>
            <li> I would say this mascara is more for length than volume for sure.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara~.</li>
            <li> Really love this mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest in saying that I initially bought this mascara because I thought it looked cute &amp; liked how &amp;#34;Manga&amp;#34; was written on it :p</li>
            <li> Works great, my new favorite</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, the formula is amazing!</li>
            <li> but this Miss Manga is pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you like a light, whisper coat of mascara you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely nothing good about this product.</li>
            <li> so i had to seperate my lashes, but overall good product.!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, lowest price new, overall happy with the mascara-</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s inexpensive and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to build up and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, stays on well</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend</li>
            <li> one is not the waterproof one but not get run easy w tears or swet.&lt;br /&gt;Backest black are the perfect for those fogy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super cheap in price!</li>
            <li> HUGE lashes.</li>
            <li> I generally use one coat for every day but two coats looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;Oréal.  </li>
            <li> I have really light colored lashes, heck</li>
            <li> but with this it was so even and smooth</li>
            <li> I can even wear the darker color if I use it lightly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are short and straight, and this is the perfect remedy.</li>
            <li> It preforms better than almost all the high end ones I&#x27;ve tried plus it has an adorable name.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras over the years from $3-$30, and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> Well I love anime and manga and always love the character&#x27;s big eyes and cute eyelashes.</li>
            <li> With one swipe of this, I became extremely excited.  </li>
            <li> I originally gave this two stars because I found it clumpy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several low-end and high-end mascaras and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about the mascara.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job, for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s possibly the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far, high end or drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It wears very light and is super smudge proof, and the price is great (in-store - as others have pointed out, it usually runs under $10 everywhere).  </li>
            <li> but I take my time to make sure it doesn&#x27;t look too much.</li>
            <li> I love it that much.</li>
            <li> And I can say, without a doubt, that all these glowing reviews are completely true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have full or lengthy lashes.</li>
            <li> Mascara has to be something super special for me to pay department store prices (I like the &#x27;tubing&#x27; technology)</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara, hands down</li>
            <li> More pros than cons for this one, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it didn&#x27;t really create any sort of effect for me that makes it more than just a nice mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a mild clumps, gives some volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of L&#x27;oreal mascara and a lot of more expensive, department store brands, and this is THE BEST.  </li>
            <li> This was the type of mascara I dreamt of being able to find in high school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> but I do love how a new mascara brush looks and feels.</li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great black color.</li>
            <li> It doesnt clump and it really lasts all day without dripping or smudging and is easy to remove with my makeup remover at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> that It sticks really well to my lashes and it&#x27;s easily buildable.</li>
            <li> so of course that&#x27;s why I bought this, but hot damn!</li>
            <li> The flexible brush is quite nice, actually.</li>
            <li> I liked it, it&#x27;s definitely volumizing.!</li>
            <li> I really liked it upon initial application.  </li>
            <li> Not really manga style, but a good mascara still</li>
            <li> I like a more natural look.</li>
            <li> However, it is the kind of maxcara that one coat is enough with.</li>
            <li> My lashes were soooo long &amp; just with one coat, I could just imagine with more!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy cheap mascaras</li>
            <li> Of course I have to say I&#x27;m a mascara snob/fiend and the hot pink tube caught my eye first, good packaging choice</li>
            <li> nice mascara makes the lashes very long</li>
            <li> The brush part is actually great, it allows me to get to the inner lashes since its smaller from the tip; however, I do not like the wand itself, I know its suppose to be flexible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay overall.</li>
            <li> It definitely defines and creates volume without clumping better than name brand products.</li>
            <li> But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get longer lashes, which is most of us(</li>
            <li> I really wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> I would like it better with a standard brush.</li>
            <li> U&#x27;ll just go about batting ur eyelashes at everybody and feeling pretty.</li>
            <li> Upon first seeing the commercials for Miss Manga Mascara, I thought- &amp;#34;There&#x27;s no way</li>
            <li> The commercial is cute though, and I am into anime and manga so why not try it?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When falsies first came out, like ummmm....</li>
            <li> LOVE, i use it over another mascara for extra length, you do have to watch those can be clumpy</li>
            <li> I love how only one coat makes the biggest difference on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a lot more of this stuff in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used so many different mascaras over the years,  including L&#x27;Oréal.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara, others claim to add length to your lashes this one definitely does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love Voluminous and wear it daily, but after years of use, I thought I might try something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smearproof too!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that actually gives you volume and length make sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li> This worked super well, even prompting my mother to ask me when she first saw me the other day, &amp;#34;is that new mascara?&amp;#34; I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> The product is VERY clumpy right out of the packaging and the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; brush is counterproductive.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything special espesecially seeing how the brush applicator was ordinary.</li>
            <li> Then the little flexible part is great, because it moves through your lashes better than a stiff wand.</li>
            <li> My lashes are of average length, but somewhat light in color and fine.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, you could easily go with one coat for this mascara; I use two for super length, but three makes it a bit clumpy and weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look super long and full.</li>
            <li> This mascara made my lashes look the longest and fullest than any other I&#x27;ve tried&amp;is so easy to apply, aftr two coats, my lashes are bomb!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, but the brush is weird...  </li>
            <li> lots of compliments and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really dislike that</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara...</li>
            <li> The price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have spent much more ( hello, Perversion mascara) and had poorer results than with this mascara.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product.</li>
            <li> I ask for any brand that will make my lashes really pop with volume, etc.</li>
            <li> The wand in the manga mascara is very flexible and I just didn&#x27;t think it would do much.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much from it since I always think commercials overhype results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clumpy and my lashes look so much longer.  </li>
            <li> However, the brush really detracts from this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have to worry that much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like a whole lot is in the bottle, but if you can find it in town</li>
            <li> It does give volume but the lashes are very spidery.</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal mascaras because...</li>
            <li> I still really like the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous</li>
            <li> It has a real bristle brush, NOT a silicone nubbed one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted the whole day and it didn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> I really like that my lashes didn&#x27;t clump together with this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not the mascara that really make you look manga for real.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; into the lash line.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this mascara is that the wand is like a flexible Christmas tree shape.</li>
            <li> I looked at it on Amazon and just couldn&#x27;t believe it would cost that much.</li>
            <li> I cant tell you too much about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Also removes really well.</li>
            <li> Really like the product, it lengthens and volumises.</li>
            <li> I am willing to take a chance on a new mascara if it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a month because it kind of dries out quicker than other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The main con is that it has a tendency to clump more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have the original version since I bought it as soon as I saw the commercial and</li>
            <li> and comes off easily by rubbing wet fingers together over it.</li>
            <li> however it goes quickly if used daily.</li>
            <li> buy the high end mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product and came out unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Overall really great, but I will probably go back to my old standby of LashBlast after this tube is empty.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Even tho the brush is a little flimsy, but it does bend to do the bottom lashes, the mascara goes on smooth and really does lengthen the lashes!</li>
            <li> It makes putting it on your bottom lashes kind of hard, because it bounces.  </li>
            <li> Happy to admit that I was TOTALLY wrong.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my eyelashes supper thick my kind of mascara.</li>
            <li> The only thing is when the mascara is about to end , it gets dry and flakes a bit&amp;takes more then one coat to make them look  </li>
            <li> (I got blackest black), very full, defined lashes.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new mascaras because I am a junkie.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new mascara in a while.</li>
            <li> I have found my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara bottle is super cute, and the wand bends so you can get those extra hard lashes in the corner.</li>
            <li> It goes on kind of thick and wet but dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I bought special argan oil wet wipes just for that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pump the mascara or even use it very often and it barely lasted a month.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes longer and it separated my lashes even with the old mascara on them!</li>
            <li> Because after the first couple of tubes, it hasn&#x27;t been the same.</li>
            <li> Two stars for the color itself being vivid and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have light colored everything, so I usually have to be super careful not to put too much mascara on</li>
            <li> Let me say right off the bat that I could not give a hoot less about anime, or manga, or whatever that whole thing is about.</li>
            <li> Huge long lashes in a few swipes and it lasts pretty well for the workday.</li>
            <li> My dream is to find a natural mascara that works.</li>
            <li> I like an old school fat bristly brush.</li>
            <li> Even after the first swipe my lashes were twice as long, and visibly thicker.  </li>
            <li> Actually il eat the whole damn pie.</li>
            <li> It really added an OOMF to my eyes and definitely finished off my eye look.</li>
            <li> I remove it with Lush&#x27;s 9-5 liquid cleanser</li>
            <li> It gives me doll eyes (wide and thick eyelashes) for a good price.</li>
            <li> This mascara, in spite of the silly name, is really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many kinds, and have had so-so results with maybe one or two, but don&#x27;t really have any desire to use false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> However, the clumps were small and easy to get rid off.</li>
            <li> I just find that I need to be careful to not over apply as it gets dramatic in a hurry (which is great for evenings/weekend but not a work look in a conservative office).</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t clump so bad it would be pretty good</li>
            <li> I used a generic applicator that I bought at Sally Beauty Supply, to get the product to look halfway decent.</li>
            <li> (haven&#x27;t tried the waterproof, though), and gets those little tiny lashes that are so easy to miss.</li>
            <li> and I certainly plan in using it for as long as they continue making it!</li>
            <li> brush is way more springy than I expected even after reviews but as other people have pointed out in other places, that does allow the brush to really grab and comb through the lashes.</li>
            <li> Not these new rubber things with tiny spikes on the end.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes and dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> When I got home and saw that this arrived, I couldn&#x27;t even wait to have bare lashes to try it!</li>
            <li> The wand is tricky i&#x27;ll admit, but once you get the hang of this baby, put the right amount, comb thru, dry a bit, go back and repeat gently, wiggle wiggle and comb through, you&#x27;ll be cross eyed with shock staring at your lush eyelashes one eye after the other.</li>
            <li> formula is more wet than I usually use</li>
            <li> Is ok but not great , nothing that manga tv efect (</li>
            <li> I understand the need for companies to change things up to stay trendy, but this stuff is just weird.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to get used to the flexible wand, but once I did I had better application with less clumping.  </li>
            <li> I no longer use Urban Decay, bombshell or the other types of double layer mascaras with a white plumper layer then black top coat.</li>
            <li> This makes my short lashes look glam fast without wet smears or a department store price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pricey high end mascara</li>
            <li> Why on earth would anyone pay so much when you can get it at the local drug store for so much less.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I have average length in my lashes, average thickness, and they&#x27;re straight.</li>
            <li> Picture that one person in your life with the most enviable, long, thick, dark lashes.</li>
            <li> It turned my long, curly, plentiful lashes into 3-4 massive clumps of lashes.</li>
            <li> I am a one coat, let dry, second coat, let dry, third, fourth, sometimes fifth coat gal.</li>
            <li> I thought it was gimmicky until I realized that it allows for a softer application, with less wrist strain (first world problem, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just could not find a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t do that and wasn&#x27;t waterproof, as it really hurts my eyelashes since it is so hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Needs to be wiped with Qtip or you look strange.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but always want thickness.</li>
            <li> my lashes look nothing like the pictures,i should have stuck with my maybelline big pink tube</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just wet enough</li>
            <li> I picked this up this morning on a whim because my old stuff had dried out</li>
            <li> This brush is not too stiff and not too soft.</li>
            <li> &gt; One coat and my lashes are soft and defined-not sooty or stiff or spiked.</li>
            <li> My lashes did extend very long but it was clumpy spider legs long.</li>
            <li> if you want long eye lashes, buy this mascara!</li>
            <li> However, I will say I saw this at my local Target for $7 the other day.</li>
            <li> I am never happy to spend a lot of money and get a really wet sloppy mascara that seems to coat everything but my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have naturally longer thicker lashes I think you will be pleased with this formula.</li>
            <li> But they do look very long.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t touch it for lk a minute so it can dry.</li>
            <li> For somebody with thin, short, straight ones, it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I will be heading back tomorrow to hoard a few extra tubes.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with, but was looking for a little something extra, to add oomph to my evening look.</li>
            <li> I like it but for several dollars less</li>
            <li> so I usually go through a variety of drugstore brands because mascara has such a short hygenic lifespan</li>
            <li> I like the formula, it&#x27;s not to dry or wet.</li>
            <li> mus got a lot of lashes and natural tiker for a real mega black tiker fake lashes efect.</li>
            <li> I guess my only complaint was that it clumped a bit after only a week of using it.</li>
            <li> The bendy wand is just a gimmick and is see no real benefit to it.</li>
            <li> Not much of a volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too flexible making it harder for me to apply it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try a different wand to apply it so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit wet and with my short lashes a wetter formula has trouble sticking a building to them.</li>
            <li> and I wear mascara every single day with my black liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes very long, but not necessarily voluminous or thick by any means.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit old school and a little boring to be honest.  </li>
            <li> I have other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras in my possession that make my lashes longer, thicker, and darker.  </li>
            <li> I literally need to pick my eyelashes apart from each other after putting this mascara on.</li>
            <li> Is nothing from the other world.</li>
            <li> You do notice the dark color from one coat of mascara with this formula.</li>
            <li> This was not worth the hype, the price, or the wait.</li>
            <li> coat and BAM - extremely dark</li>
            <li> Or at least Amazon to pay, because I might not be going back to anything else!</li>
            <li> It makes it really difficult to really get the product into my lashes.</li>
            <li> Some black mascara I put on and they never seem to tint the lashes dark and I have to keep trying to coat my lashes to get the dark color to show up and make a difference on my lashes.</li>
            <li> This get all the way down to the roots.  </li>
            <li> Also I noticed black flakes in that area while the mascara claims it&#x27;s non-flaky...</li>
            <li> I like &#x27;em long, thick and dark (insert pervy joke</li>
            <li> to my surprise, this wasn&#x27;t like the typical mascara I buy that ends up doing about half of what they show in commercials.  </li>
            <li> stick with L&#x27;Oreal Carbon Black Voluminous or Lancome.</li>
            <li> Less than half the price.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and thick with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s 14$ on amazon, it can be found at Target and other places for half the price.</li>
            <li> I just hate easy clumps.</li>
            <li> i just found that it clumped up a little</li>
            <li> So, it is small on one end and fat on the the other.</li>
            <li> I actually find that I get a lot less mascara in the wrong place with Miss Manga than I have with any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also looks like its missing bristles.</li>
            <li> Since you are supposed to change out your mascara a few times a year</li>
            <li> it became kinda a game in trying different makeup brands of their mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baaaack to eat a slice of humble pie.</li>
            <li> messy</li>
            <li> I have short thin disappointing eyelashes and this stuff really pulled out a level of length</li>
            <li> This mascara is a little thick buuuut</li>
            <li> Usually I buy mascara at the department store, pay oodles of money and....</li>
            <li> I think I get a better look from L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions or Maybelline&#x27;s The Falsies..</li>
            <li> I usually prefer silicone bristles but the bristles on this one are perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look no more.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am usually allergic to eye makeup</li>
            <li> I have this on subscription as I usually throw my mascara away after 3  months.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Usually I use two coats, but I can get away with one coat with this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> and I still had to rub really hard.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate that the brush isn&#x27;t one of the hard plastic variety, though.</li>
            <li> to throw away&amp;#34; Now this little beauty comes along and knocks them&lt;br /&gt;all &amp;#34;Out of the park!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: After putting it on, don&#x27;t touch anywhere around your eye for at least 5 minutes while it dries or you&#x27;ll smear it.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t bow to the marketing, but it was too late.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s plenty thick</li>
            <li> and you wouldn&#x27;t want a thick formula with a brush like this one.</li>
            <li> It really serves no purpose, it&#x27;s just annoying.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s barely anything in the tube and the brush is just so bad.</li>
            <li> Layer this with waterproof mascara if you have insanely curly lashes like me, and you&#x27;ll have the full fan come hither</li>
            <li> would seriously recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I actually thought I had a bad product until I looked online and saw it was intentional.</li>
            <li> Every day is a battle just to try to get mascara on them without making it look weird because there&#x27;s so few eyelashes for it to cling to.  </li>
            <li> But the wand is so weak and flexible (engineered that way)</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my lashes look, but gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it flakes off into my contacts a bit during the day, which is irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> If like me, you want people to roll their eyes at you because they think you are wearing false lashes at noon..  </li>
            <li> Like false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The applicator on this particular product is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> and it was not the dramatic look I was hoping to achieve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird though....</li>
            <li> Sorry, but don&#x27;t plan on getting this one again.</li>
            <li> The weird, flaccid wand prevents you from having any control, and the brush applies the mascara in a gloppy, clumpy way.</li>
            <li> It looks fake.</li>
            <li> and I had the false eyelash look happening!</li>
            <li> This was a horrible mascara the brush made it very hard to apply the product and made the lashes just look bad in general.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the head and appreciate that it&#x27;s not one of those stubby spiky horrible rubber heads that are too sharp and pokey.</li>
            <li> Saw this on TV, went crazy looking for it in stores, ended up ordering it here and drooled in an anticipation of its arrival.&lt;br</li>
            <li> n annoying</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> The boyfriend thought I had fake eyelashes!!!</li>
            <li> This is nasty mascara.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Clumps like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> This is just awful.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that it flakes after like two hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> But this mascara gave me the worst allergic reaction I could&#x27;ve imagined.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Performs like a department store mascara at a fraction of the price. HUGE lashes. My daughters and I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> lots of compliments and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara, hands down it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve come across in 2014. It lengthens and darkens and gets all my tiny lashes fanned out for a falsies look. Plus it&#x27;s inexpensive and washes off easily. I no longer use Urban Decay, bombshell or the other types of double layer mascaras with a white plumper layer then black top coat. This makes my short lashes look glam fast without wet smears or a department store price!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! I love it, its easy to apply and makes my lashes look &amp;#34;totally manga.&amp;#34; LOL! But they do look very long. I also like that it takes a lot of layers for it to start to clump together.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara. It gives me doll eyes (wide and thick eyelashes) for a good price. Stays on well (no flaking!) and comes off easily by rubbing wet fingers together over it. I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras over the years from $3-$30, and this is my favorite! So glad it&#x27;s on the lower end pricewise since I&#x27;ll be using it until it gets discontinued (hopefully never).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: After putting it on, don&#x27;t touch anywhere around your eye for at least 5 minutes while it dries or you&#x27;ll smear it. After that, it&#x27;s great for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Leaves my eyelashes supper thick my kind of mascara.</li>
            <li> This does make lashes longer and doesn&#x27;t irritate my contacts.</li>
            <li> This is nasty mascara. I&#x27;m not picky with mascara but I do love how a new mascara brush looks and feels. This product robbed me from that. The product is VERY clumpy right out of the packaging and the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; brush is counterproductive. It also looks like its missing bristles. I actually thought I had a bad product until I looked online and saw it was intentional. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, the formula is amazing! It leaves my eyelashes thicker and longer looking. It doesnt clump and it really lasts all day without dripping or smudging and is easy to remove with my makeup remover at the end of the day. The only con for me is the brush, I do like the brush itself but it is so flimsy. I really dislike that and it makes coating all my lashes take longer and sometimes the flimsyness causes me to get mascara on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> nice mascara makes the lashes very long</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara...only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a month because it kind of dries out quicker than other mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. I like the way it goes on. You could build it up with no effort, but within 3 hrs you have to check as it smudges under the bottom lid even though I don&#x27;t wear any mascara on my bottom lashes. Needs to be wiped with Qtip or you look strange.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about the mascara. I have seen a mild clumps, gives some volume. It&#x27;s okay overall.</li>
            <li> This was way too clumpy for me. My lashes did extend very long but it was clumpy spider legs long.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara at the moment.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Doesn&#x27;t smudge. I don&#x27;t have to worry about raccoon eyes at the end of the work day. It definitely defines and creates volume without clumping better than name brand products. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I am giving this mascara a 3 star rating for the following reasons. 1) I prefer a dryer mascara. This one is a bit wet and with my short lashes a wetter formula has trouble sticking a building to them. 2) it has too many chemicals. My dream is to find a natural mascara that works. The closest I have come is Tarte Gifted Mascara. 3) The bendy wand is just a gimmick and is see no real benefit to it. 4) It&#x27;s clumpy with more than one coat. I tried to put on several coats to build up my short lashes and I just got clumpy spiky lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the things I liked about the mascara. 1) I liked the brush. I like an old school fat bristly brush. Not these new rubber things with tiny spikes on the end. Those kind don&#x27;t work for my lashes and I won&#x27;t purchase a mascara with a rubber brush end again. This mascara had a bristle type brush with a narrower end that I liked. 2) it&#x27;s a great black color. Some black mascara I put on and they never seem to tint the lashes dark and I have to keep trying to coat my lashes to get the dark color to show up and make a difference on my lashes. You do notice the dark color from one coat of mascara with this formula. 3) The price is really reasonable. I am willing to take a chance on a new mascara if it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I have spent much more ( hello, Perversion mascara) and had poorer results than with this mascara. I am never happy to spend a lot of money and get a really wet sloppy mascara that seems to coat everything but my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have naturally longer thicker lashes I think you will be pleased with this formula. For somebody with thin, short, straight ones, it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, lowest price new, overall happy with the mascara- however it goes quickly if used daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big manga dweeb so of course that&#x27;s why I bought this, but hot damn! This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve bought in years. I don&#x27;t normally buy cheap mascaras but this one has blown me away.</li>
            <li> Buy this from a store, not from amazon. It is only $8 elsewhere. Anyways, this product is great. I&#x27;ve been a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal for years and they never disappoint. This brush is not too stiff and not too soft. It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much product. It gives your eye a cat-eye look - in which the outer corners get bigger and thicker looking with this mascara. This mascara is easy to build up and easy to take off. It lasts all day. Love love love.</li>
            <li> SHOCKED!!!😨😨😲😲..!!I buy the high end mascara&#x27;s.Have tried so many drugstore&lt;br /&gt;brand&#x27;s. .&amp;#34;Only to throw away&amp;#34; Now this little beauty comes along and knocks them&lt;br /&gt;all &amp;#34;Out of the park!! I&#x27;m  so picky about how I want my eyelashe&#x27;s to look!!!.I have been asked&lt;br /&gt;where do you get you eyelashes done at??😆😀😀😉&amp;#34;Need I say more.!!!.&lt;br /&gt;With the money you will save,you can go buy that great lipstick you always wanted. .lol.&lt;br /&gt;Roberta Bell</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes longer and thicker without clumping. I haven&#x27;t experienced any flaking either.</li>
            <li> If I could, I&#x27;d give this no stars. I was so excited about buying this because of all the awesome ratings people gave it. It turned my long, curly, plentiful lashes into 3-4 massive clumps of lashes. Terrible! I am so disappointed! Never buying this again!</li>
            <li> Usually I buy mascara at the department store, pay oodles of money and....the mascara is okay. I ask for any brand that will make my lashes really pop with volume, etc. and I think I&#x27;ve tried most of them. Since you are supposed to change out your mascara a few times a year it became kinda a game in trying different makeup brands of their mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By chance I was strolling thru Target and the packaging was adorable. I know I shouldn&#x27;t bow to the marketing, but it was too late. It was in my basket. When I got home I tried it out and was amazed! The mascara came out perfect and stayed on until I took it off that night (Almay remover pads are the bestest!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest in saying that I initially bought this mascara because I thought it looked cute &amp; liked how &amp;#34;Manga&amp;#34; was written on it :p I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything special espesecially seeing how the brush applicator was ordinary. But when I put one coat of it on my lashes...whoa! My lashes were soooo long &amp; just with one coat, I could just imagine with more! I will say that one con about it is that it can be a bit clumpy but I take my time to make sure it doesn&#x27;t look too much. But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to get longer lashes, which is most of us(: Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> WHOA.  I am always trying new mascaras because I am a junkie.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like this when I saw the brush.  It&#x27;s a bit old school and a little boring to be honest.  I prefer the plastic applicators, my favorite being the butterfly mascara wand.  The wand in the manga mascara is very flexible and I just didn&#x27;t think it would do much.  Happy to admit that I was TOTALLY wrong.  Even after the first swipe my lashes were twice as long, and visibly thicker.  I love this stuff, it&#x27;s possibly the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far, high end or drugstore.  The only gripe I have is the smell, as soon as I opened it I could smell the chemicals.  However, it&#x27;s totally worth it!  I love this stuff and I hope they keep it around.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really hard to wash off. I bought special argan oil wet wipes just for that and I still had to rub really hard. The skin under my eyes ended up irritated - it still hurts. Also I noticed black flakes in that area while the mascara claims it&#x27;s non-flaky... I really wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> This was a horrible mascara the brush made it very hard to apply the product and made the lashes just look bad in general.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new mascara in a while. Well I love anime and manga and always love the character&#x27;s big eyes and cute eyelashes. Didn&#x27;t expect much from it since I always think commercials overhype results. But I LOVE THIS MASCARA. I have long lashes but always want thickness. The mascara bottle is super cute, and the wand bends so you can get those extra hard lashes in the corner. It goes on kind of thick and wet but dries pretty fast. My eyes POP when I have this on. It&#x27;s weird though....at Rite Aid they didn&#x27;t have it out on display. I looked up and they had it on the top top shelf. I had to get someone to get on a ladder and get it for me. So glad I did....it&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> I have practically non-existent eyelashes.  Every day is a battle just to try to get mascara on them without making it look weird because there&#x27;s so few eyelashes for it to cling to.  I have tried SO many kinds, and have had so-so results with maybe one or two, but don&#x27;t really have any desire to use false eyelashes. With one swipe of this, I became extremely excited.  I have eyelashes!!! Beautiful ones!!! It&#x27;s not clumpy and my lashes look so much longer.  The brush is very springy as others have stated, and it works awesomely.  I&#x27;m going to go out and buy it in a different color now- I love it that much.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my lashes look, but gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it flakes off into my contacts a bit during the day, which is irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Saw this on TV, went crazy looking for it in stores, ended up ordering it here and drooled in an anticipation of its arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good, but nothing special.  I have other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras in my possession that make my lashes longer, thicker, and darker.  I will say this brush keeps lashes separated, but it does not promise the results the advertising delivered.  I like it but for several dollars less I think I get a better look from L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic Shocking Extensions or Maybelline&#x27;s The Falsies..both under $9 and I always have coupons to use at the drugstore.  This was not worth the hype, the price, or the wait.</li>
            <li> Let me say right off the bat that I could not give a hoot less about anime, or manga, or whatever that whole thing is about. I would be happy if this were called garbage can, or craptastic, or anything else, because it&#x27;s just that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One coat and BAM - extremely dark (I got blackest black), very full, defined lashes. ONE COAT, PEOPLE. And I am not a one coat girl. I am a one coat, let dry, second coat, let dry, third, fourth, sometimes fifth coat gal. I like &#x27;em long, thick and dark (insert pervy joke here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three coats in, and the marketing people over at Benefit better be shakin&#x27; in their boots, because this stuff makes my lashes look like falsies. I am not kidding. The most amazing thing though, is that there are no clumps.at.all. Looking for clumps? Better keep looking, ma&#x27;am, because we are all out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tapered end of the brush allows you to get all of those teeny tiny lashes in the inner corners, and you can use the tip to enhance your outer flare, too. The flexible brush is quite nice, actually. I thought it was gimmicky until I realized that it allows for a softer application, with less wrist strain (first world problem, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to try this magical lash potion? Then get thee to Ulta, because it is currently 40% off until July 5! I will be heading back tomorrow to hoard a few extra tubes. If L&#x27;Oreal ever discontinues this, there will be hell to pay. Or at least Amazon to pay, because I might not be going back to anything else!</li>
            <li> my lashes look nothing like the pictures,i should have stuck with my maybelline big pink tube</li>
            <li> I had read about this mascara in review blogs and I thought I would try it out. I always want the longest lashes humanly possible and the pictures I had seen seemed to show this would do that.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is one of the best I have ever tried. My big problem is getting raccoon eyes and I just could not find a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t do that and wasn&#x27;t waterproof, as it really hurts my eyelashes since it is so hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does not budge. I wear it all day and it doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes or flake or anything. It keeps the curl in my lashes well also. Like other reviewers said, you could easily go with one coat for this mascara; I use two for super length, but three makes it a bit clumpy and weird.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is way more springy than I expected even after reviews but as other people have pointed out in other places, that does allow the brush to really grab and comb through the lashes. I usually prefer silicone bristles but the bristles on this one are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is more wet than I usually use but it&#x27;s plenty thick and you wouldn&#x27;t want a thick formula with a brush like this one. I actually find that I get a lot less mascara in the wrong place with Miss Manga than I have with any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I would seriously recommend this mascara. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used and I certainly plan in using it for as long as they continue making it!</li>
            <li> More pros than cons for this one, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it didn&#x27;t really create any sort of effect for me that makes it more than just a nice mascara.  It took a little time to get used to the flexible wand, but once I did I had better application with less clumping.  It wears very light and is super smudge proof, and the price is great (in-store - as others have pointed out, it usually runs under $10 everywhere).  The main con is that it has a tendency to clump more than I expected.  Will probably buy it again, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t be one of my makeup drawer staples.</li>
            <li> Clumps like crazy!!! I literally need to pick my eyelashes apart from each other after putting this mascara on. If it didn&#x27;t clump so bad it would be pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, but the brush is weird...  It doesn&#x27;t bend and stay bent, like a pipe cleaner, like it does in the commercial.  It just bends, flimsily, and bounces back.  It makes putting it on your bottom lashes kind of hard, because it bounces.  The mascara transfers on the bottom lashes.  It&#x27;s very good, it adds volume and length, almost as much as my Too Face &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34; mascara, and it does wash off.  However, the brush really detracts from this mascara.  I would like it better with a standard brush.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome mascara! I have really light colored lashes, heck I have light colored everything, so I usually have to be super careful not to put too much mascara on but with this it was so even and smooth I didn&#x27;t really have to worry that much. I can even wear the darker color if I use it lightly.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara! Even tho the brush is a little flimsy, but it does bend to do the bottom lashes, the mascara goes on smooth and really does lengthen the lashes! I would definitely recommend and will continue to buy this mascara!</li>
            <li> This was the best mascara ever. Totally love it!</li>
            <li> I have puny lashes and this mascara definitely makes them look longer and stand out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting all the hype about this mascara.  I put it on and you can&#x27;t even tell that I have eyelashes!  I had high expectations for this product and came out unimpressed. Booooooo</li>
            <li> This product tends to clump!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baaaack to eat a slice of humble pie. Actually il eat the whole damn pie. I originally gave this two stars because I found it clumpy n annoying n messy n just not my my friend. After ignoring it as promised for over a month, I went back to it. N let me tell ya people, I was blown out of this world. The wand is tricky i&#x27;ll admit, but once you get the hang of this baby, put the right amount, comb thru, dry a bit, go back and repeat gently, wiggle wiggle and comb through, you&#x27;ll be cross eyed with shock staring at your lush eyelashes one eye after the other. The boyfriend thought I had fake eyelashes!!! He had to see me do it to believe me. Layer this with waterproof mascara if you have insanely curly lashes like me, and you&#x27;ll have the full fan come hither effect! U&#x27;ll just go about batting ur eyelashes at everybody and feeling pretty. Try it, and if you already have, try it again. Including you about to bin it, STOP THIS MINUTE!</li>
            <li> This is great mascara!</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes and dried out quickly. I don&#x27;t pump the mascara or even use it very often and it barely lasted a month.</li>
            <li> I will never use another mascara again.  It&#x27;s amazing.  L&#x27;oreal, you have a winner here.  Please never quit making it.  I have been using department store mascara for years.  I can purchase three of these for what I was paying for one tube and this is even better than what I was using.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Upon first seeing the commercials for Miss Manga Mascara, I thought- &amp;#34;There&#x27;s no way this can be work like it&#x27;s shown. The commercial is cute though, and I am into anime and manga so why not try it?&amp;#34;. I proceeded to go to my local Target and buy it for $6.99. (In MT, so no sales tax). Best. Decision. Ever! This was the type of mascara I dreamt of being able to find in high school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, this wasn&#x27;t like the typical mascara I buy that ends up doing about half of what they show in commercials.  This worked super well, even prompting my mother to ask me when she first saw me the other day, &amp;#34;is that new mascara?&amp;#34; I love this mascara! Hopefully it stays in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s line up for a while. If not, I&#x27;ll have to invest in buying the rest of the town out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short- if you want long eye lashes, buy this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t seem like a whole lot is in the bottle, but if you can find it in town it&#x27;s relatively cheap. Awesome investment, and actually works as shown in the add. A+ for L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> I liked it, it&#x27;s definitely volumizing.! i just found that it clumped up a little so i had to seperate my lashes, but overall good product.!</li>
            <li> When I got home and saw that this arrived, I couldn&#x27;t even wait to have bare lashes to try it! I put it on over my mascara I&#x27;ve been wearing through the day and I was amazed. It made my lashes longer and it separated my lashes even with the old mascara on them! Strongly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and I wear mascara every single day with my black liquid eyeliner. This mascara made my lashes look the longest and fullest than any other I&#x27;ve tried&amp;is so easy to apply, aftr two coats, my lashes are bomb!. The only thing is when the mascara is about to end , it gets dry and flakes a bit&amp;takes more then one coat to make them look  full.guess it&#x27;s about time to get another tube.</li>
            <li> This is just awful. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing good about this product. There&#x27;s barely anything in the tube and the brush is just so bad. It applies chunky and looks gross. My eyelashes stick together and lumps. Does nothing for me. Never buying again.</li>
            <li> It does give volume but the lashes are very spidery. But the worst part is that it flakes after like two hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of L&#x27;oreal mascara and a lot of more expensive, department store brands, and this is THE BEST.  I&#x27;m a redhead, I have very light, almost translucent eyelashes.  This get all the way down to the roots.  And I can coat on as many coats as I want and it never clumps.  I never leave reviews but this product is amazing and everyone should know about it.  My lashes are long and thick with this mascara.  I wear contacts too, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are of average length, but somewhat light in color and fine.  I need a mascara that gives volume for them to look their best.  This isn&#x27;t it.  It is visibly clumpy on the brush and goes on clumpy.  My lashes just end up looking rather stringy and stuck together.  I do appreciate that the brush isn&#x27;t one of the hard plastic variety, though.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara! I found this in South Africa and the UK when I was traveling. I was sad when my stock ran out, so I ordered more here. The mascara creates length and volume without clumping! However, I will say I saw this at my local Target for $7 the other day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. When falsies first came out, like ummmm.... a decade ago.... I loved it!!! I used it all the time. The formula must have changed. Because after the first couple of tubes, it hasn&#x27;t been the same. I have been looking for a suitable replacement.... for a lonnnnng time. Look no more. I&#x27;ve dropped big bucks, on big names. Not satisfied. THIS. IS. IT. loads of volume, and length without being clumpy... love. love. love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just mascara.  Not the manga-thick glory everyone said it would be.</li>
            <li> I tried loreal man; and it was superb... Great item, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works great, my new favorite</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, based on the reviews - but it makes my eyelashes look incredible! They look super long and full. I also use latisse, though - it is a perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal mascaras because...I think they borrow from Lancome (owned by the same parent company) and Lancome has great, but pricey, mascaras. Mascara has to be something super special for me to pay department store prices (I like the &#x27;tubing&#x27; technology) so I usually go through a variety of drugstore brands because mascara has such a short hygenic lifespan and because I have it in my gym bag, my desk, my purse, etc. I still really like the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous but this Miss Manga is pretty good. It&#x27;s similar (but NOT the same) as the Lancome doll mascara. It has a real bristle brush, NOT a silicone nubbed one.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t splatter when it went on and it has great definition. Yes, the flexible wand takes a bit of getting used to but I did feel it helped me get all my lashes.&lt;br /&gt; It lasted the whole day and it didn&#x27;t flake. I&#x27;m a contact lens wearer and it didn&#x27;t bother my lenses at all.&lt;br /&gt; One coat and my lashes are soft and defined-not sooty or stiff or spiked. I really like that my lashes didn&#x27;t clump together with this brush.</li>
            <li> Great mascara- makes lashes very full even of first coat. More like a macys type of&lt;br /&gt;Mascara.</li>
            <li> This Mascara is clumpy!!  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again...</li>
            <li> I am always trying the latest mascaras, so of course I had to pick this one up!  It goes on beautifully and builds quickly for huge lashes.  I really liked it upon initial application.  However - by the end of the day this mascara is always under my eyes.  Overall really great, but I will probably go back to my old standby of LashBlast after this tube is empty.</li>
            <li> LOVE, i use it over another mascara for extra length, you do have to watch those can be clumpy</li>
            <li> Is nothing from the other world. I tink u must got a big lashes for a big efect. Is ok but not great , nothing that manga tv efect ( nothing close for) thats why i said that may be this is for big lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;This one is not the waterproof one but not get run easy w tears or swet.&lt;br /&gt;Backest black are the perfect for those fogy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the mascara that really make you look manga for real.&lt;br /&gt;You mus got a lot of lashes and natural tiker for a real mega black tiker fake lashes efect.</li>
            <li> Like all L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, this brush is awesome. But the wand is so weak and flexible (engineered that way) that you can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; into the lash line. If you like a light, whisper coat of mascara you&#x27;ll love this. If like me, you want people to roll their eyes at you because they think you are wearing false lashes at noon..  stick with L&#x27;Oreal Carbon Black Voluminous or Lancome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this mascara. It goes on well and doesn&#x27;t seem to clump my lashes at all. What I really like about this mascara is that the wand is like a flexible Christmas tree shape. So, it is small on one end and fat on the the other. Then the little flexible part is great, because it moves through your lashes better than a stiff wand.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t make it to Alta to get your &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; brand, this brand will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this. I purchased the Waterproof version, &amp;#34;Blackest Black&amp;#34;. I did not care for the flexible brush. It did not seem to grasp my lashes well enough and I needed multiple swipes to look like I had put anything on! My eyelashes did not look anything like the images that the company portrays you can get with this mascara and it was not the dramatic look I was hoping to achieve. I like their &amp;#34;Butterfly Effect&amp;#34; mascara much more.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Alco. There wasn&#x27;t a huge selection and my Mom bought one of the manga line and liked it so I thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. Well, I shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve. The applicator on this particular product is HORRIBLE! I don&#x27;t like how it is so bendy. It makes it really difficult to really get the product into my lashes. The formula is ok I guess. I used a generic applicator that I bought at Sally Beauty Supply, to get the product to look halfway decent. The formula when on lumpy and made my eye lashes clumpy. I will NOT be repurchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a little thick buuuut I have short thin disappointing eyelashes and this stuff really pulled out a level of length I&#x27;ve never seen out of a mascara before. I put it on over the mascara I&#x27;ve been wearing all day and it still lengthened separated and added volume.  That wand tho.....  the bendy bendy weirdo no grip wand is total suckage, I&#x27;m going to put some electrical tape on that joint so that it won&#x27;t be all floppy and wiggly. I like the shape of the head and appreciate that it&#x27;s not one of those stubby spiky horrible rubber heads that are too sharp and pokey.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. It really added an OOMF to my eyes and definitely finished off my eye look. I guess my only complaint was that it clumped a bit after only a week of using it. However, the clumps were small and easy to get rid off. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not much of a volumizing mascara. Wand feels flimsy. God news is no clumping!</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE mascara!!! I love how only one coat makes the biggest difference on my eyelashes. I don&#x27;t know why L&#x27;Oreal didn&#x27;t come out with this sooner. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This mascara, in spite of the silly name, is really good stuff. Goes on easily, stays on well (haven&#x27;t tried the waterproof, though), and gets those little tiny lashes that are so easy to miss. It really does a good job, for a decent price. And I will buy it again, it&#x27;s much better than the $25 mascara I was using from one of the beauty stores, so that says a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have EVER used. Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years. My eyelashes are short and straight, and this is the perfect remedy. Picture that one person in your life with the most enviable, long, thick, dark lashes. That is what this mascara will give you. It&#x27;s just wet enough that It sticks really well to my lashes and it&#x27;s easily buildable. I picked this up this morning on a whim because my old stuff had dried out, I hadn&#x27;t read any reviews until after I tried it. And I can say, without a doubt, that all these glowing reviews are completely true. I&#x27;ve tried several low-end and high-end mascaras and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be buying a lot more of this stuff in the future.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever. I looked at it on Amazon and just couldn&#x27;t believe it would cost that much. So, I went to CVS. Less than half the price. Why on earth would anyone pay so much when you can get it at the local drug store for so much less. Back to the product. I get comments every time I wear it and I always wore mascara before. My fave was Great Lash by Maybelline and that is still great but unless they discontinue Miss Manga I doubt I will use it again. I remove it with Lush&#x27;s 9-5 liquid cleanser and it just disappears so it is easier to remove than Great Lash as well. I generally use one coat for every day but two coats looks amazing! Like false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I like the formula, it&#x27;s not to dry or wet. The brush part is actually great, it allows me to get to the inner lashes since its smaller from the tip; however, I do not like the wand itself, I know its suppose to be flexible but it&#x27;s too flexible making it harder for me to apply it. If the wand wasn&#x27;t as flexible I would like it way more. It does not give me that &amp;#34;manga&amp;#34; effect as they claim it does but I do like the mascara since it did not clump up. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s 14$ on amazon, it can be found at Target and other places for half the price. I would not call this my go-to mascara, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase it again; however I do not regret buying this mascara.</li>
            <li> I am deeply madly in love with this mascara. I don&#x27;t have full or lengthy lashes. But with this mascara I do! I have found my new go to mascara. I&#x27;ve tried other pricey high end mascara but nothing compares. Try it and you&#x27;ll love it also! Oh and NO clumping!!</li>
            <li> I am a man. I cant tell you too much about the quality of this product. This was a Christmas present for our daughter. She was happy with it. Seller got it to me on time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> love this product.....</li>
            <li> Manga is very nice. I always put on a double amount. I will buy this again. I recommend it to help make the eyes- the lashes more beautifully.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of curiosity,  and I was taken back by the wand, but I could&#x27;ve gotten over that. I have used so many different mascaras over the years,  including L&#x27;Oréal.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;Oréal.  But this mascara gave me the worst allergic reaction I could&#x27;ve imagined. My eyes swelled shut for two days with hives covering them.  I thought this was hypoallergenic?  Sorry, but don&#x27;t plan on getting this one again.</li>
            <li> Not really manga style, but a good mascara still</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, others claim to add length to your lashes this one definitely does the trick. I am usually allergic to eye makeup but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have this on subscription as I usually throw my mascara away after 3  months.&lt;br /&gt;If you have not tried it you should you will be amazed.  Also removes really well.</li>
            <li> I would say this mascara is more for length than volume for sure. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, coats each lash beautifully. A bit tricky to use on the opposite eye since its a tapered brush. Makes your lashes very long, but not necessarily voluminous or thick by any means.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara. Huge long lashes in a few swipes and it lasts pretty well for the workday. I just find that I need to be careful to not over apply as it gets dramatic in a hurry (which is great for evenings/weekend but not a work look in a conservative office).</li>
            <li> I love Voluminous and wear it daily, but after years of use, I thought I might try something else. I heard great things about Manga, so I went for it. I have long lashes to begin with, but was looking for a little something extra, to add oomph to my evening look. My initial reaction was just... Confusion. What on earth were they thinking? The weird, flaccid wand prevents you from having any control, and the brush applies the mascara in a gloppy, clumpy way. Two stars for the color itself being vivid and sturdy. I think I&#x27;ll try a different wand to apply it so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste. I understand the need for companies to change things up to stay trendy, but this stuff is just weird. Why does anyone like this???</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!! I&#x27;m a freakin makeup addict and I saw the commercIal for this and had to have it! Its the best mascara I&#x27;ve used! Just don&#x27;t touch it for lk a minute so it can dry. It&#x27;s really smearproof too! I have the original version since I bought it as soon as I saw the commercial and my only problem was that it ran when my eyes watered, but now there&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
            <li> Miss Manga where have you been all my life?? Of course I have to say I&#x27;m a mascara snob/fiend and the hot pink tube caught my eye first, good packaging choice L&#x27;oreal! I read the comments about the flexible brush, don&#x27;t let it scare you away it took me just seconds to get used to it! 2 coats and I had the false eyelash look happening! No smudging, no smears no streaking!  Miss Manga you rock the mascara world!</li>
            <li> Naturally, I have average length in my lashes, average thickness, and they&#x27;re straight. This mascara gives my lashes definition, volume, and length. Usually I use two coats, but I can get away with one coat with this mascara. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara~. It preforms better than almost all the high end ones I&#x27;ve tried plus it has an adorable name. If you&#x27;re looking for something that actually gives you volume and length make sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Really love this mascara and it&#x27;s super cheap in price! Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Really like the product, it lengthens and volumises. Shame about the bendy wand. It really serves no purpose, it&#x27;s just annoying.</li>
            <li> It looks fake. I like a more natural look. I know, I know, it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;manga&amp;#34;. I just hate easy clumps. However, it is the kind of maxcara that one coat is enough with.</li>
