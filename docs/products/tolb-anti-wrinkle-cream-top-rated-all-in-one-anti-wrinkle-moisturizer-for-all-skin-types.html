            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free, with the promise to leave my honest, unbiased thoughts on it.</li>

            <li>I am seeing results and have fallen in love with this product.</li>
            <li>but I still need more time to decide.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many things to love about this cream.  </li>
            <li>and yet it gave me better results.  </li>
            <li>When I went to purchase the Retinol, and received the Rejuvenating Cream, I contacted the company and they replaced it for me, free of charge!</li>
            <li>and then I still  apply a moisturizer on top of that as well.</li>
            <li>and I love the way I can&#x27;t see so many of those lines around my mouth.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many face cream</li>
            <li>Just some scheme in order to make us pay more money for products we don&#x27;t need.  </li>

            <li>The price is also better than good for the results I get so overall</li>

            <li>And I&#x27;m excited to try the Scar Cream on my acne scars on my face</li>

            <li>has over 700 Published Studies showing its significant Anti Aging effects.</li>
            <li>I will just use it under my original face cream</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m impressed that I saw such noticeable results in a very short time period.</li>
            <li>I used this - Super Skin Rejuvenation Cream, Retinol Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid, Anti-aging Cream with Matrixyl, and Vitamin C Eye Gel- all from Tree of Life.  </li>
            <li>So, far I don&#x27;t see to much of a result except it feels good on my skin</li>

            <li>I am 38 years old, I have been using this cream morning and evening for more than two months</li>
            <li>My face looks so radiant and fresh</li>
            <li>I think this product can be worth a shot</li>
            <li>For someone who is not even 30 yet, some may laugh at my desire to use a product that claims to be an anti-wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much to reach the desired effect, and I can go all day with my skin looking (and feeling) fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>A rare find in today&#x27;s sociaty.</li>
            <li>Now, I consider skincare a \\&quot;fun thing\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>and I honestly did a double take.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found myself getting more serious about sticking to a good skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I use it right before I apply my sunblock during the day.</li>
            <li>I usually use this in the morning as part of my makeup routine and it works great under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look more fresh and dewy instantly.  </li>

            <li>I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  </li>
            <li>All-Natural ingredients help restore your skin&#x27;s youthful feel and texture and help your face keep its smooth, natural look while you age gracefully and elegantly&lt;br /&gt;-With</li>
            <li>In my later 60&#x27;s I have tried many products that claim to rejuvenate my skin but have not done that for my skin..</li>
            <li>I want to keep my skin as healthy as possible as I continue to age and Tree of Life Beauty</li>
            <li>This review was first published on Sassy Gal Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first had the pleasure and opportunity to try their Retinol Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even aware at the time that their were \\&quot;night-time\\&quot; moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I used to pass the skincare by, heading straight to the \\&quot;Fun stuff\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>But I look a heck of a lot better than I did prior to using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>felt the difference right away in how much tighter my face felt.</li>
            <li>I never contacted them with any issues or concerns since I didn&#x27;t have any, but they did send me several e-mails a few weeks apart to make sure I was satisfied with the product and that it met my expectations with the opening if at any time for any reason I had any issues to contact them.&lt;br /&gt;Another major plus cruelty free which is a huge factor in my purchasing decisions</li>
            <li>This stuff seems pretty good, but difficult to tell if it&#x27;s much better than regular over the counter hydrating creams available at Target, etc.</li>
            <li>Anytime I have had to contact them, they are super quick to get back to me.  </li>
            <li>Anytime I have had to contact them, they are super quick to get back to me.  </li>
            <li>After using it for about 2 months, my skin seems firmer, less fine lines, and overall feels better!</li>
            <li>I will certainly re order this</li>
            <li>Whatever observable benefits may be to the softening provided purely by the moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>I had strangers as well as co-workers comment on how I certainly didn&#x27;t look my age (58).</li>
            <li>The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot.</li>
            <li>My face would drink this in and my skin seemed to come back to life, it helped a lot with dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>The obvious signs that you notice right away, is the super creamy texture to the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients sound good, but for me the consistency is like toothpaste &amp; equally difficult to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>have noticed a huge difference since starting the rejuvenating cream.  </li>
            <li>I did notice my skin felt very hydrated, soft and overall healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and yet very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I got this for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with this stuff--it really works.</li>
            <li>All of these products felt fresh and natural and within 2-3 weeks I was seeing results.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Smells a bit unusual but it seems to work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with consistency, my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with consistency, my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product four out of five stars because I&#x27;m still in the evaluation process, and I hope that with the passing of time and continued use it will really work and show gradual results.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old, eat healthy and exercise regularly.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and refreshed which is different than how it normally feels in the winter.  </li>
            <li>In the evening before bed, I cleanse and apply eye cream and twice a week, I use a face mask to deep clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Products generally work better when you combine them with complimentary products so that they can I guess kinda communicate and help each other.  </li>
            <li>The pump dispenses very small amounts, which is good given the high price of the lotion and its effectiveness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the hopes to prevent some premature aging from my lack of sleep and general exhaustion from working in-home while caring for my child, I have been striving to discover a routine that would help to revitalize my skin, keeping it fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a cream from Trader Joes that is half the price and is a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife is still getting older.</li>
            <li>Even at 27, I look much older than I am.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft right away and is still soft and radiant in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and line to everyone trying to achieve what I am.</li>
            <li>I have even noticed the dark circles under my eyes starting to look better!</li>
            <li>I found that the product was a little oily for my skin, however the samples worked better with my skin.</li>
            <li>It increases skin cell turnover which gives the skin that fresh brightness as well as deep hydration.</li>
            <li>But I can imagine I would have success preventing wrinkles for the future by continuing my use of it.  </li>
            <li>In case your like me and have NO clue why we need collagen:  Collagen helps to keep your skin nice and tight (NO BALLOON EYELIDS) and when you get older your body stops producing collagen, making it ESSENTIAL for any skincare</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is soft and smooth unlike some products that are either too dry or oily.</li>
            <li>I have always looked for the right product to not only protect my skin but to help reverse some of the damage that had already been done.  </li>
            <li>and it looks like wrinkles are becoming less noticeable</li>
            <li>It is non irritating and seems to smooth out fine lines an wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This is my new holy grail cream</li>
            <li>ingredients help fight fine lines, crows feet, dark spots, and wrinkles BEFORE THEY BEGIN, helping you retain your youthful look as you age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never experienced such GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li>With the Retinol Moisturizer (and most all their products) they send little samples (a months&#x27; supply!)  </li>
            <li>It smells very natural (no added scents/toxins) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  </li>
            <li>Although the first thing I observed (and liked) about this was actually the design of the bottle (it looks very sleek and expensive)</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and not all dried out (which is a real problem for me this time of year).</li>
            <li>My fine lines have diminished and my complexion is looking brighter and healthier everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and have darker under the eye circles and my eyes are starting to get some real crows feet.</li>
            <li>Although skin feels smoother, there is no change as far as wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>It claims to be natural</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much maybe 3-4 pumps to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also become conscious to the fact that I should soon start to think about using anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products.</li>
            <li>However, as the mother of a toddler (with another baby on the way), I remain conscious of my skin and often-haggard appearance when I roll out of bed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>being said, it truly does leave my skin feeling soft and supple after application.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and not greasy at all</li>
            <li>OLD SUCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve really had to start not only taking care of my skin, but being proactive.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li>I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  </li>
            <li>Not wild about the smell and have not used it long enough to judge it but based on other reviews am using it faithfully to give it an honest try.</li>
            <li>I really needed rejuvenation for my dry sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li>I used this cream in the morning and evening for a week and didn&#x27;t see any major difference</li>
            <li>far as the anti-wrinkle portion of my skin, I can&#x27;t testify to that yet as I&#x27;m not currently battling wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My skin appeared brighter, not loose.</li>
            <li>it’s not dry)</li>
            <li>Absolutely no long term &amp;#34;wrinkle reduction&amp;#34; however.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of time in the sun and have lived in New Zealand for 13 years where there is no O-zone layer.  </li>
            <li>If after only a few weeks of a regular skincare regimen, I can only imagine if I continue to be consistent with my skincare</li>
            <li>It takes off all of the dead skin, revealing a fresher, clean, less wrinkled face and chest.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many face cream</li>

            <li> I used this - Super Skin Rejuvenation Cream, Retinol Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid, Anti-aging Cream with Matrixyl, and Vitamin C Eye Gel- all from Tree of Life.  </li>

            <li> My face looks so radiant and fresh</li>
            <li> I think this product can be worth a shot</li>
            <li> For someone who is not even 30 yet, some may laugh at my desire to use a product that claims to be an anti-wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much to reach the desired effect, and I can go all day with my skin looking (and feeling) fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li> A rare find in today&#x27;s sociaty.</li>
            <li> Now, I consider skincare a \\&quot;fun thing\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> and I honestly did a double take.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found myself getting more serious about sticking to a good skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I use it right before I apply my sunblock during the day.</li>
            <li> I usually use this in the morning as part of my makeup routine and it works great under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look more fresh and dewy instantly.  </li>
            <li> This cream is noce, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple by morning.</li>
            <li> Will wait to see results after the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  </li>

            <li> In my later 60&#x27;s I have tried many products that claim to rejuvenate my skin but have not done that for my skin..</li>
            <li> I want to keep my skin as healthy as possible as I continue to age and Tree of Life Beauty</li>
            <li> This review was first published on Sassy Gal Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first had the pleasure and opportunity to try their Retinol Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware at the time that their were \\&quot;night-time\\&quot; moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I used to pass the skincare by, heading straight to the \\&quot;Fun stuff\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> But I look a heck of a lot better than I did prior to using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> felt the difference right away in how much tighter my face felt.</li>
            <li> I never contacted them with any issues or concerns since I didn&#x27;t have any, but they did send me several e-mails a few weeks apart to make sure I was satisfied with the product and that it met my expectations with the opening if at any time for any reason I had any issues to contact them.&lt;br /&gt;Another major plus cruelty free which is a huge factor in my purchasing decisions</li>
            <li> This stuff seems pretty good, but difficult to tell if it&#x27;s much better than regular over the counter hydrating creams available at Target, etc.</li>
            <li> Anytime I have had to contact them, they are super quick to get back to me.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I have had to contact them, they are super quick to get back to me.  </li>
            <li> After using it for about 2 months, my skin seems firmer, less fine lines, and overall feels better!</li>
            <li> I will certainly re order this</li>
            <li> Whatever observable benefits may be to the softening provided purely by the moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> I had strangers as well as co-workers comment on how I certainly didn&#x27;t look my age (58).</li>
            <li> The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot.</li>
            <li> My face would drink this in and my skin seemed to come back to life, it helped a lot with dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> The obvious signs that you notice right away, is the super creamy texture to the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients sound good, but for me the consistency is like toothpaste &amp; equally difficult to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> have noticed a huge difference since starting the rejuvenating cream.  </li>
            <li> I did notice my skin felt very hydrated, soft and overall healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and yet very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this stuff--it really works.</li>
            <li> All of these products felt fresh and natural and within 2-3 weeks I was seeing results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Smells a bit unusual but it seems to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with consistency, my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with consistency, my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product four out of five stars because I&#x27;m still in the evaluation process, and I hope that with the passing of time and continued use it will really work and show gradual results.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old, eat healthy and exercise regularly.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and refreshed which is different than how it normally feels in the winter.  </li>
            <li> In the evening before bed, I cleanse and apply eye cream and twice a week, I use a face mask to deep clean my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Products generally work better when you combine them with complimentary products so that they can I guess kinda communicate and help each other.  </li>
            <li> The pump dispenses very small amounts, which is good given the high price of the lotion and its effectiveness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the hopes to prevent some premature aging from my lack of sleep and general exhaustion from working in-home while caring for my child, I have been striving to discover a routine that would help to revitalize my skin, keeping it fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a cream from Trader Joes that is half the price and is a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife is still getting older.</li>
            <li> Even at 27, I look much older than I am.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft right away and is still soft and radiant in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and line to everyone trying to achieve what I am.</li>
            <li> I have even noticed the dark circles under my eyes starting to look better!</li>
            <li> I found that the product was a little oily for my skin, however the samples worked better with my skin.</li>
            <li> It increases skin cell turnover which gives the skin that fresh brightness as well as deep hydration.</li>
            <li> But I can imagine I would have success preventing wrinkles for the future by continuing my use of it.  </li>
            <li> In case your like me and have NO clue why we need collagen:  Collagen helps to keep your skin nice and tight (NO BALLOON EYELIDS) and when you get older your body stops producing collagen, making it ESSENTIAL for any skincare</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is soft and smooth unlike some products that are either too dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I have always looked for the right product to not only protect my skin but to help reverse some of the damage that had already been done.  </li>
            <li> and it looks like wrinkles are becoming less noticeable</li>
            <li> It is non irritating and seems to smooth out fine lines an wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is my new holy grail cream</li>
            <li> ingredients help fight fine lines, crows feet, dark spots, and wrinkles BEFORE THEY BEGIN, helping you retain your youthful look as you age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced such GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li> With the Retinol Moisturizer (and most all their products) they send little samples (a months&#x27; supply!)  </li>
            <li> It smells very natural (no added scents/toxins) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  </li>
            <li> Although the first thing I observed (and liked) about this was actually the design of the bottle (it looks very sleek and expensive)</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and not all dried out (which is a real problem for me this time of year).</li>
            <li> My fine lines have diminished and my complexion is looking brighter and healthier everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have darker under the eye circles and my eyes are starting to get some real crows feet.</li>
            <li> Although skin feels smoother, there is no change as far as wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> It claims to be natural</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much maybe 3-4 pumps to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also become conscious to the fact that I should soon start to think about using anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products.</li>
            <li> However, as the mother of a toddler (with another baby on the way), I remain conscious of my skin and often-haggard appearance when I roll out of bed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> being said, it truly does leave my skin feeling soft and supple after application.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and not greasy at all</li>
            <li> OLD SUCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve really had to start not only taking care of my skin, but being proactive.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li> I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  </li>
            <li> Not wild about the smell and have not used it long enough to judge it but based on other reviews am using it faithfully to give it an honest try.</li>
            <li> I really needed rejuvenation for my dry sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I used this cream in the morning and evening for a week and didn&#x27;t see any major difference</li>
            <li> far as the anti-wrinkle portion of my skin, I can&#x27;t testify to that yet as I&#x27;m not currently battling wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My skin appeared brighter, not loose.</li>
            <li> it’s not dry)</li>
            <li> Absolutely no long term &amp;#34;wrinkle reduction&amp;#34; however.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of time in the sun and have lived in New Zealand for 13 years where there is no O-zone layer.  </li>
            <li> If after only a few weeks of a regular skincare regimen, I can only imagine if I continue to be consistent with my skincare</li>
            <li> It takes off all of the dead skin, revealing a fresher, clean, less wrinkled face and chest.</li>
            <li> still am no EXPERT, but I so would like to learn more about how to find the key to eternal youth, or at least to make my skin appear at least ten years younger.  </li>
            <li> Being involved in performance art, I find myself many times in heavy makeup for hours and removing that makeup can leave your skin feeling tight and dried out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy buying a product and having to use half the bottle in a week, just because my skin sucks in the cream like a sponge.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning after I cleanse and tone my skin and the results last all day long.  </li>
            <li> I had two small lines on the inner corner of my eyebrows and the starting of crows feet on the outside of my eyes that are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I actually mix a bit of it with the Retinol Moisturizer, which tends to be a bit dry on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind admitting when I was wrong, I actually take pride when I&#x27;m wrong, because it so rarely happens :)</li>
            <li> During this time of year my face is very dry especially in my t-zone.  </li>
            <li> I have not use ot for a long time</li>
            <li> Lately, it seems as if my eyelids have suddenly formed little balloons right below the brow line...  </li>
            <li> so I purchased the other 3 products now in regular size, so altogether I am using 4 products (two at night and two in the morning)  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, this does not help it.</li>
            <li> Thankfully that hasn&#x27;t been an issue with this product, despite my skin being rather dry</li>
            <li> My skin started appearing hallow and dry patches started appearing.  </li>
            <li> A younger, fresher, less wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li> This has really helped with my new wrinkles that were starting to get bad.</li>
            <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.........</li>
            <li> So for me, even liking the brand, this was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> The only slight problem is the pump that dispenses it sometimes gets a little clogged</li>
            <li> it seems to make my face feel to tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and the other 3 I am using.</li>
            <li> I started with the Retinol with Hyaluronic acid cream and received 3 other samples.</li>
            <li> The tree of life anti-wrinkle cream is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue like the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Instead of spending $100&#x27;s, why not try something that is a fraction of the price yet gives the same, if not better results.  </li>
            <li> I found that you can&#x27;t use a lot of other products, as it makes them cakey and looks as though your skin is peeling.</li>
            <li> Like the other Tree of Life products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin feeling greasy or clog my pores like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I will say that I would not buy this product in the future because I did not like the smell of it, and when I put it on it seemed very heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> For one, a little bit goes a long way -- which makes me feel a lot less wasteful.  </li>
            <li> All together these cost me less than 1 of some of the other names</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in dark spots, I have seen improvement in my skins elasticity, it seems tighter and perkier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid to late twenties now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retinol Moisturizer:  As previously stated I mix a bit of my Rejuvenating cream&lt;br /&gt;Whatever products you choose to use</li>
            <li> I was little hesitant in buying the product since I have never tried their products before.</li>
            <li> package came with three small samples of other products, which I haven&#x27;t used or tested.</li>
            <li> I like to test my products out for a couple weeks before I write a review or bother to recommend them, I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shows how little I knew.  </li>
            <li> It seems that with the little bit of use</li>
            <li> , it seems to be helping a little bit.</li>
            <li> I was sent this for review purposes and they asked for a review within a few days.</li>
            <li> This lotion was not cheap and now I can&#x27;t finish using it.</li>
            <li> Twice a week I exfoliate to get rid of any dead skin</li>
            <li> I also have a few patches of blotched skin,</li>
            <li> and I’ve had a few compliments already.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Not sure product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to say the the feel and scent of the lotion is a bit like almond, but I&#x27;m not sure that that is the official description by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy it again</li>
            <li> No better than drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I can say that using it everyday does make my face look less tired</li>
            <li> I was disappointed but also not completely surprised for the price just bumbed after such rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I hate it sitting on my fresser and no one wants it.  </li>
            <li> That mean anyone can put anything in them.</li>
            <li> Subtle results after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The one thing that keeps me from not using it anymore is definitely the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell really bad</li>
            <li> I had some deeper lines (not quite wrinkles, or maybe I didn&#x27;t want to admit they were wrinkles) on my forehead that have dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried the cream, but I am always skeptical of bottles that come unsealed.</li>
            <li> However, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been so skeptical of anti-aging beauty products.  </li>
            <li> It stinks..</li>
            <li> I told her I was not wanting to pay money for something that would fail me yet again!</li>
            <li> mr sick</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Although skin feels smoother, there is no change as far as wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my new holy grail cream</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for review purposes.  I started using it about a week ago and so far I like it.  The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and my skin absorbs it very well.  My face feels smooth and refreshed which is different than how it normally feels in the winter.  During this time of year my face is very dry especially in my t-zone.  I am definitely going to keep using this in my daily regime.</li>
            <li> I was little hesitant in buying the product since I have never tried their products before. I like the fact that it is soft and smooth unlike some products that are either too dry or oily. I can see the changes in my skin, the roughness has disappeared and my skin feels great. Love it and recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried the cream, but I am always skeptical of bottles that come unsealed. That mean anyone can put anything in them. Had I known that, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great service, item arrived on time, clean and neatly packaged with 3 additional samples and explanatory brochure. The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot. I would recommend this and the other 3 I am using. I started with the Retinol with Hyaluronic acid cream and received 3 other samples. After using it for just a week I started to see visible difference in my skin appearance. Samples ran out so I purchased the other 3 products now in regular size, so altogether I am using 4 products (two at night and two in the morning)  and I can&#x27;t be happier with the results. It claims to be natural (what I&#x27;ve been looking for) so I am hoping I will settle with this product and would not  have to be on a lookout for another one for a while. The price is also better than good for the results I get so overall I had a very good experience with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I found that the product was a little oily for my skin, however the samples worked better with my skin. My skin is wrinkle free and I do however look younger than my 35 years....Thank you</li>
            <li> does not absorb into skin. I have dry skin, this does not help it. I use a cream from Trader Joes that is half the price and is a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old, I have been using this cream morning and evening for more than two months and I do not see any difference at all ... my personal experience maybe it works for others.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great product. I do see visible results on the texture of my skin. One customer I was dealing with estimated my age as 11 years younger than I actually am. Started using this lotion about three weeks ago. I&#x27;m tempted to say the the feel and scent of the lotion is a bit like almond, but I&#x27;m not sure that that is the official description by the manufacturer. The packaging is flawless and has a luxury product feel. The pump dispenses very small amounts, which is good given the high price of the lotion and its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;The package came with three small samples of other products, which I haven&#x27;t used or tested.</li>
            <li> I love the Tree of life Anti wrinkle cream. My face looks so radiant and fresh which is great.</li>
            <li> This cream is noce, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple by morning. I have been using it every night for 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in dark spots, I have seen improvement in my skins elasticity, it seems tighter and perkier. Overall good product. Not sure I will buy it again but I haven&#x27;t officially decided not to either. Will wait to see results after the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this moisturizer,my skin feels very soft and moisturized after each use.I use it right before I apply my sunblock during the day.It is very light which I really like and blends well with my makeup.I love the bottle design and how easy it is to dispense the cream into my hands.I don&#x27;t have to use much maybe 3-4 pumps to cover my entire face.This cream makes me look more youthful in my 37 years and I look forward to continuing to use it for my time to come.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion on it. My thoughts on this product are my own, and I was in no way compensated or reimbursed.</li>
            <li> I love the Tree of Life product line!  Erases MY lines!</li>
            <li> i have using anti- age cream for two weeks and it looks like wrinkles are becoming less noticeable</li>
            <li> First off I love Tree Of Life products they are great quality skincare products. I did notice my skin felt very hydrated, soft and overall healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream. It&#x27;s lightweight and yet very hydrating. My make-up goes on flawlessly on top of this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service of the company is outstanding. I never contacted them with any issues or concerns since I didn&#x27;t have any, but they did send me several e-mails a few weeks apart to make sure I was satisfied with the product and that it met my expectations with the opening if at any time for any reason I had any issues to contact them.&lt;br /&gt;Another major plus cruelty free which is a huge factor in my purchasing decisions</li>
            <li> This is one of or perhaps the best cream I have used and I have used A LOT. After about a week I am noticing fine lines disappearing and my face having a more velvety feel. I will certainly re order this it is better than any expensive cream I have used and I have a graveyard of night creams. The only slight problem is the pump that dispenses it sometimes gets a little clogged so you have to re adjust it. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the raving reviews. I used it till it was gone knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t be an instant fix. I&#x27;m 30 years old and have darker under the eye circles and my eyes are starting to get some real crows feet. Along with the creases on my forehead and between my eyes. These were my target area. I used morning and night and got no results at all. I took before and after pictures and there was no difference at all. I was disappointed but also not completely surprised for the price just bumbed after such rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems pretty good, but difficult to tell if it&#x27;s much better than regular over the counter hydrating creams available at Target, etc.</li>
            <li> I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  The serums are my favorite.  And I&#x27;m excited to try the Scar Cream on my acne scars on my face and I want to see if it works for my strech marks on my belly from my prenancies.  I started using all of these products on my belly a couple of days ago to see if they help reduce the appearance of my stretch marks and help the sagging belly skin from my pregnancies as well.  I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  I can almost go out without any face powder cover up now.  My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  Best skin care I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had acne prone skin that has a lot of texture and that gets super oily.  I took accutane as a teenager but I still get hormonal acne and I&#x27;ll be 40 next year!  I started getting age spots as well and deep wrinkels in my forehead (expression lines) that I wasn&#x27;t too happy about on top of the acne.  This whole skin care line is so great and makes my skin look and feel amazing!  I LOVE it and am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> It stinks.. The smkell is rotted feet.  I hate it sitting on my fresser and no one wants it.  I thought their was a money back guarantee,  or id this like the supple i otlrdered,  mske mr sick but because customwr sercvice sat on there thumbs till the 31st dat then suddenly. I get stuck with 1/2 a case and a big 3 times quoted.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look more fresh and dewy instantly.  It smells very natural (no added scents/toxins) and my make-up goes on very easily over it.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to smooth out skin without any irritation.  Subtle results after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife is still getting older. If they think it works, thats all that matters.</li>
            <li> This cream is a winner! I really needed rejuvenation for my dry sun damaged skin. My face would drink this in and my skin seemed to come back to life, it helped a lot with dryness and fine lines. Having such an inexpensive excellent product shipped right to me takes all the pressure of trying to pick through all of the looser products at the store. YOU WILL LIKE THIS!</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it. It makes her look years younger! I recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li> I used this cream in the morning and evening for a week and didn&#x27;t see any major difference then what I am currently using.  I will say that I would not buy this product in the future because I did not like the smell of it, and when I put it on it seemed very heavy on my skin.  The one thing that keeps me from not using it anymore is definitely the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell really bad but it doesn&#x27;t have a nice cream smell like others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product for free but this is my opinion on the product and no one is paying me for it!</li>
            <li> It lives up to its name.  Super Rejuvenation .  I love how bright my skin looks and feels.  Goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel.  really happy with this.</li>
            <li> This product is light and creamy with a breezy light scent.  I love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC. This is LOVELY, velvety. It increases skin cell turnover which gives the skin that fresh brightness as well as deep hydration. It&#x27;s a must for any regimen at this price!</li>
            <li> Another great product from this line! I received many compliments on how good my skin was looking while sampling this product.</li>
            <li> This is truly a beautiful cream. It is non irritating and seems to smooth out fine lines an wrinkles. I have not use ot for a long time but I suspect that I will see results. Many thanks</li>
            <li> This product goes on nice, but I have extremely sensitive skin and it started to burn. It might be ok for those of you who don&#x27;t have skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Not wild about the smell and have not used it long enough to judge it but based on other reviews am using it faithfully to give it an honest try. Will update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid to late twenties now and I&#x27;ve found myself getting more serious about sticking to a good skin care regimen. I&#x27;ve also become conscious to the fact that I should soon start to think about using anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products. Knowing this, part of me still wondered if anti-aging cream would actually work for me. After trying this product, I&#x27;m sold on the idea. I&#x27;ve used this cream for about 2 weeks now with great results. My skin feels super soft and not all dried out (which is a real problem for me this time of year). I have even noticed the dark circles under my eyes starting to look better! Although the first thing I observed (and liked) about this was actually the design of the bottle (it looks very sleek and expensive) and I really loved that Tree of Life sends you a bunch of good size samples free with your order. I&#x27;m impressed that I saw such noticeable results in a very short time period.I will absolutely recommend this product because I feel confident it&#x27;s going to be a great addition to my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> This product ended up drying out my skin. I did end up returning this back to the seller. I received a full refund which was great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now.  It was recommended by a friend and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  I notice an improved skin texture and by face looks younger!  I&#x27;m sticking with this stuff--it really works.</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-aging products that claim to be #1, this is the first time that I can agree that this product is truly #1. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now. I use it in the morning and at night. Since using it, I have seen a decrease in my fine lines and wrinkles. I had two small lines on the inner corner of my eyebrows and the starting of crows feet on the outside of my eyes that are completely gone. I had some deeper lines (not quite wrinkles, or maybe I didn&#x27;t want to admit they were wrinkles) on my forehead that have dramatically decreased. You can still see the lines, but they&#x27;re not nearly as deep as they were. I did receive this product for free, with the promise to leave my honest, unbiased thoughts on it. I am not being compensated in any way for leaving this review. I can honestly say that this is the best anti-aging cream I have used. I&#x27;m excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum. It does not require that a lot be used. A dab will do you. After using it for about 2 months, my skin seems firmer, less fine lines, and overall feels better! It has a light, pleasant scent, not overwhelming in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The specs: 8 REASONS to Purchase Our Superior &amp;#34;Super Skin&amp;#34; Anti Aging Cream Today:&lt;br /&gt;-AESTHETICIAN RECOMMENDED, and excellent for use as a Day Cream or Night Cream&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth, light, and fast-absorbing, our Super Skin Anti Wrinkle Moisturizer will leave your face feeling fresh and rejuvenated the moment you use it, every time&lt;br /&gt;-Retinol has over 700 Published Studies showing its significant Anti Aging effects.

            <li> I am a mother to four children and I am always on the look out for something to reduce the stress lines on my face. Even at 27, I look much older than I am. I have tried several different products only to be left devastated. My grandmother heard me ranting and told me she bought this awesome product right here on Amazon. I told her I was not wanting to pay money for something that would fail me yet again! So she gave me her extra container and after two weeks of use I am proud to say this stuff works. The tree of life anti-wrinkle cream is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue like the other products I have tried. I am seeing results and have fallen in love with this product. As soon as my container runs out, I will be purchasing my own. I will never use a different cream again!</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice product but I did not have enough time to try it before I could give a legit review. I was sent this for review purposes and they asked for a review within a few days. I think it feels fine for the days I&#x27;ve tried it but I do need more time to actually make a good decision. I think this product can be worth a shot but I still need more time to decide.</li>
            <li> For someone who is not even 30 yet, some may laugh at my desire to use a product that claims to be an anti-wrinkle cream.  However, as the mother of a toddler (with another baby on the way), I remain conscious of my skin and often-haggard appearance when I roll out of bed in the morning.  In the hopes to prevent some premature aging from my lack of sleep and general exhaustion from working in-home while caring for my child, I have been striving to discover a routine that would help to revitalize my skin, keeping it fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many things to love about this cream.  For one, a little bit goes a long way -- which makes me feel a lot less wasteful.  I don&#x27;t enjoy buying a product and having to use half the bottle in a week, just because my skin sucks in the cream like a sponge.  Thankfully that hasn&#x27;t been an issue with this product, despite my skin being rather dry this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it truly does leave my skin feeling soft and supple after application.  I don&#x27;t need much to reach the desired effect, and I can go all day with my skin looking (and feeling) fresh and smooth.  I use it in the morning after I cleanse and tone my skin and the results last all day long.  In the evening before bed, I cleanse and apply eye cream and twice a week, I use a face mask to deep clean my skin.  This routine has been working well for me for weeks now, and I plan to continue with it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the anti-wrinkle portion of my skin, I can&#x27;t testify to that yet as I&#x27;m not currently battling wrinkles.  But I can imagine I would have success preventing wrinkles for the future by continuing my use of it.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results as time progresses!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this works great for that. It is so creamy and silky when I put it on my face! I like to test my products out for a couple weeks before I write a review or bother to recommend them, I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt the difference right away in how much tighter my face felt. My fine lines have diminished and my complexion is looking brighter and healthier everyday. I usually use this in the morning as part of my makeup routine and it works great under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review!</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of time in the sun and have lived in New Zealand for 13 years where there is no O-zone layer.  I have always looked for the right product to not only protect my skin but to help reverse some of the damage that had already been done.  Instead of spending $100&#x27;s, why not try something that is a fraction of the price yet gives the same, if not better results.  I am so happy with this product and the other products I&#x27;ve used together from Tree of Life.  I used this - Super Skin Rejuvenation Cream, Retinol Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid, Anti-aging Cream with Matrixyl, and Vitamin C Eye Gel- all from Tree of Life.  All together these cost me less than 1 of some of the other names and yet it gave me better results.  All of these products felt fresh and natural and within 2-3 weeks I was seeing results. This seller was fantastic to deal with and quick to deliver. I would highly recommend the product and the seller. I will definitely be back.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake as I had put their line in my wish list. When I went to purchase the Retinol, and received the Rejuvenating Cream, I contacted the company and they replaced it for me, free of charge! I had told them that it was my mistake, but that didn&#x27;t matter, they wanted me to be happy. I&#x27;ve never experienced such GREAT customer service. They sent me full size trial samples to try also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product. It says to use during the day, which I did. I found that you can&#x27;t use a lot of other products, as it makes them cakey and looks as though your skin is peeling. When used alone, it is great! It takes off all of the dead skin, revealing a fresher, clean, less wrinkled face and chest. I would highly recommend this product and line to everyone trying to achieve what I am. A younger, fresher, less wrinkled skin. Plus, if you have any issues, you will be treated like you are the most important person. A rare find in today&#x27;s sociaty.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and use it everyday. So, far I don&#x27;t see to much of a result except it feels good on my skin and then I still  apply a moisturizer on top of that as well. I can say that using it everyday does make my face look less tired and I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it. So, I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well for me. May work well for others, just not me.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and provides quick light moisturizing. Absolutely no long term &amp;#34;wrinkle reduction&amp;#34; however. Whatever observable benefits may be to the softening provided purely by the moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> it seems to make my face feel to tight and dry.I will just use it under my original face cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 10 days and I love the way I can&#x27;t see so many of those lines around my mouth.  I&#x27;m hoping they disappear all together.  Love the way that it absorbs immediately and I don&#x27;t have to worry about oily residue.</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it says!! In my later 60&#x27;s I have tried many products that claim to rejuvenate my skin but have not done that for my skin.. I have not found any that have rejuvenated my skin like Tree of Life. It has helped my skin return to a softness and healthy glow that I had many years ago. My skin soaks up the cream where many others leave a sticky residue or&lt;br /&gt;feel greasy. If you want healthy, youthful skin. I recommend all of Tree of Life products, especially the Rejuvenating cream.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, I use it once a week. The bottle has now started to malfunction. I would like to contact someone and email pictures. This lotion was not cheap and now I can&#x27;t finish using it. Totally disappointed</li>
            <li> Being involved in performance art, I find myself many times in heavy makeup for hours and removing that makeup can leave your skin feeling tight and dried out.  With this product, I felt my skin softening and more elastic.  I also noticed my forehead wrinkles had a more softened look and the pores to my skin shrinking. I had strangers as well as co-workers comment on how I certainly didn&#x27;t look my age (58). A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Like the other Tree of Life products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does not disappoint.  My skin feels soft right away and is still soft and radiant in the morning.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> No better than drugstore brands. Not very moisturizing.........</li>
            <li> This company (Tree of Life Beauty) raises the bar on customer service and excellent products. I am 54 years old, eat healthy and exercise regularly. I want to keep my skin as healthy as possible as I continue to age and Tree of Life Beauty is making that visibly possible. Every product feels great on my skin and I&#x27;m watching them perform wonders.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!!!!  I will have no problem ordering it again when I run out.  My face is so soft and not greasy at all</li>
            <li> Tree of Life Beauty 5 out of 5 &amp;#34;Oh my Gosh! This cream is amazing it&#x27;s so rich and feels so nice on your face, I love it. I&#x27;ve tried so many face cream and this one is by far the very best I have tried, it has changed my moisture level on my face and it has reduce some wrinkles as a bonus!&amp;#34; July 25, 2014</li>
            <li> Smells a bit unusual but it seems to work.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> The ingredients sound good, but for me the consistency is like toothpaste &amp; equally difficult to absorb into the skin. I have to rub it purposefully into my skin over &amp; over to get it to emulsify enough to disappear. So for me, even liking the brand, this was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This review was first published on Sassy Gal Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  I was given this product to review in exchange for AN HONEST REVIEW.  The opinions expressed here are MY OWN.  I was not compensated in anyway for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first had the pleasure and opportunity to try their Retinol Moisturizer.  I wasn&#x27;t even aware at the time that their were \\&quot;night-time\\&quot; moisturizers.  Shows how little I knew.  With the Retinol Moisturizer (and most all their products) they send little samples (a months&#x27; supply!)  So, I had already had the luxury of trying out this fabulous Rejuvenating Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GETTING OLD SUCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was one of those 20 year olds that still looked as if she were 14 or 15.  I got carded all of the time, often to my deep frustration.  (Oh, what I wouldn&#x27;t give to be carded today)....  One day it was like fifteen years had caught up to me.  My skin started appearing hallow and dry patches started appearing.  Lately, it seems as if my eyelids have suddenly formed little balloons right below the brow line...  What!  Where did that come from????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve really had to start not only taking care of my skin, but being proactive. I used to pass the skincare by, heading straight to the \\&quot;Fun stuff\\&quot;.  Now, I consider skincare a \\&quot;fun thing\\&quot;, what my skin might have looked like had I started younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly, have always considered skincare products a joke.  Just some scheme in order to make us pay more money for products we don&#x27;t need.  However, I was wrong.  I don&#x27;t mind admitting when I was wrong, I actually take pride when I&#x27;m wrong, because it so rarely happens :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a huge difference since starting the rejuvenating cream.  The obvious signs that you notice right away, is the super creamy texture to the moisturizer.  It&#x27;s so silky smooth.  I actually mix a bit of it with the Retinol Moisturizer, which tends to be a bit dry on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was passing by the mirror and caught a glimpse of myself and I honestly did a double take.  My skin appeared brighter, not loose. It was like looking at me in rewind.  Now, do I look like I&#x27;m twenty???  Absolutely not.  But I look a heck of a lot better than I did prior to using it.  I keep going back to Collagen. A year ago I didn&#x27;t even realize we needed collagen, I thought that was the stuff they injected in those rich women that made them have funny smiles. I didn&#x27;t know that our skin actually NEEDED collagen. However, I&#x27;ve since been educated!  In case your like me and have NO clue why we need collagen:  Collagen helps to keep your skin nice and tight (NO BALLOON EYELIDS) and when you get older your body stops producing collagen, making it ESSENTIAL for any skincare regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still am no EXPERT, but I so would like to learn more about how to find the key to eternal youth, or at least to make my skin appear at least ten years younger.  If after only a few weeks of a regular skincare regimen, I can only imagine if I continue to be consistent with my skincare how great my skin will appear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Regimen:  We ALL need one!  Even in your teens and twenties!  I&#x27;ve even been teaching my son and my daughter to start now.  After all, it&#x27;s our job as parents to try to keep our kids from making the same mistakes we made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products generally work better when you combine them with complimentary products so that they can I guess kinda communicate and help each other.  It&#x27;s kinda like your car, your motor can be running, but if the transmission is missing, your not going nowhere fast....  This is what I&#x27;m currently doing for my skincare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORNING Routine:&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSING: I use a cleansing oil, which is what I&#x27;ve found best for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;TONER&lt;br /&gt;EYE CREAM&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvenating Cream!&lt;br /&gt;NIGHT Routine:&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSING:  Yes, AGAIN!  LOL  washing away impurities is essential&lt;br /&gt;TONER&lt;br /&gt;EXFOLIATE:  Twice a week I exfoliate to get rid of any dead skin&lt;br /&gt;EYE CREAM&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Moisturizer:  As previously stated I mix a bit of my Rejuvenating cream&lt;br /&gt;Whatever products you choose to use, it&#x27;s important to be consistent.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with consistency, my whole life.  But consistency is important to get the best results from any skincare program you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite product I&#x27;ve tried in awhile.  It&#x27;s a definite 5 star!!  I was so thrilled that I was given the opportunity to review this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also LOVE their company.  Anytime I have had to contact them, they are super quick to get back to me.  No matter how petty the question, they are there in a flash!  Customer Service is ESSENTIAL to any good company.  Afterall, who wants to spend money then never be able to get a hold of them after??  They score 5 stars for Customer Service as well!!s important to be consistent.

            <li> Appears to be doing my face good  Have noticed a great difference yet</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and my wrinkles and saggy eyes are firming up and my skin is so soft and my fine lines are almost gone. I received this to review and this is my honest opion. The packaging is also very appealing and makes the product look very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that this product is all natural!  This is very important to me.  I&#x27;ve always been so skeptical of anti-aging beauty products.  It seems that with the little bit of use I&#x27;ve had so far, it seems to be helping a little bit. The fragrance is quite pleasant too, so that&#x27;s a plus.  I gave this product four out of five stars because I&#x27;m still in the evaluation process, and I hope that with the passing of time and continued use it will really work and show gradual results.</li>
            <li> This anti-wrinkle cream is amazing. I’m getting “of age” and although I have a nice skin texture (still a bit on the oily side, but thank goodness it’s not dry) I’m developing more wrinkles than I care to see. I also have a few patches of blotched skin, I’m assuming from being in the sun gardening all day. This doesn’t feel greasy, which is an added plus for me since I already have oily skin. I wear light makeup, but my makeup isn’t smearing or clumping with it. I’ve only used this for about 2 weeks and I’m seeing a difference. My skin is getting even in complexion and I’ve had a few compliments already.</li>
            <li> I have been using this anti-aging cream for awhile now and I am happy with the results so far. It comes out easy. It rubs in great. I like that it is light on my skin. My skin feels great since using. Skin is very soft and has a healthy glow to it now. This has really helped with my new wrinkles that were starting to get bad. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy or clog my pores like other products I have used. I received to review and all opinions are my own. I will be recommending to others.</li>
