            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I ended up using them for another painting project, and they worked better than brushes made for the job!</li>

            <li>The brushes work very nice and can be cleaned fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks braun and bzzagent for letting me try this awesome product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these make nice lines.</li>
            <li>I say nice because they have a price that can&#x27;t be beat and</li>
            <li>My brushes came in a reasonable amount of time, and they were very nice!</li>
            <li>worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They aren&#x27;t hard to clean with brush cleaner or acetone.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t the best brushes ever created but pretty awesome at an awesome price and they arrived before the estimated time frame</li>
            <li>They are adorable and so easy to use!</li>
            <li>very cheap and</li>
            <li>I use these brushes with acrylic paint and they are very smooth to work with.</li>
            <li>I was gonna be able to make nice and easy lines and designs</li>
            <li>and I like them although I need to practice more with them.</li>
            <li>Thought for sure</li>

            <li>love it</li>

            <li>The brushes are okay.</li>
            <li>Overall great for the price!</li>
            <li>Invest your money one something better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine you finding a better deal.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them on nails yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re going to be amazing!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the set is a good set, ideal for manicure.</li>
            <li>use acrylic paint for art work, so just a rinse in warm water gets them clean.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived within the expected time frame so that was great!</li>
            <li>I got these brushes to create manicures on my nails, the only reason I gave it four stars is because at this time I have atnother pair that I am still using, however these ones are really nice looking and are nice quality too!  </li>
            <li>This came a week early which was great.</li>
            <li>Also they are so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Easy to fix, but still.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product like this before but it is easy to maneuver around with or without experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The hairs from the bush fall off easily.</li>
            <li>they are easy to maneuver when trying to do designs on nails.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Finding a good deal is exciting and these seemed to be such a good deal.</li>
            <li>but,these are good if u just wanna try something new with ur nails.</li>
            <li>They were super cheap, which is great if your new to nail art like myself and don&#x27;t want to splurge.</li>
            <li>These are fine.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this brushes because since they are not the quality bushes like the others this brushes are just as good as ordinary brushes and I had no problems using them.</li>
            <li>The handle is huge and bulbous.</li>
            <li>Construction of brushes is sound....</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for nail art, and for the price, they are a definite must have for your arsenal!</li>
            <li>but they were really cheap</li>
            <li>The manufactures need to make sure the brushes are extra secure and every part is of good quality.</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth and I like the shorter wider handle.</li>
            <li>I have received this product from bzzagent to try and i have been using it for awhile and really enjoy it</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described and so far work great.</li>
            <li>These brushes are reall fun to use and easy to clean...</li>
            <li>These brushes were ok for the price guess you can&#x27;t expect to much out of something that is cheap.</li>
            <li>Not a sturdy brush, doesn&#x27;t make clean lines.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s hard to get them just perfect</li>
            <li>i love really them.</li>
            <li>tip),the paint was chipping, and they are very wobbly at the top when using them.</li>
            <li>So far so good, they were as described and seem to do the job well, appear pretty sturdy to me</li>
            <li>and they came quickly too.</li>
            <li>Not bad, worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, these brushes are fun as you can create a lot of designs with them.</li>
            <li>These brushes are decent for the price, if I did it all over again, or next time I&#x27;ll spend a tad bit more and get better quality brushes...</li>
            <li>The chrome bezels that hold the brush in place slip right off, had to glue them all on so they would stay in place.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t clean up very well</li>
            <li>However, I took the plastic tip off of the first brush, and the whole head came off!!</li>
            <li>These work great, however, for small details in nail painting.</li>
            <li>However, if you are a pro, or want better quality, consider spending a little more on nicer brushes.</li>
            <li>and they are eazy to clean super wow</li>
            <li>I like this item very much</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was my first set of nail art brushes.</li>
            <li>Ive only used one of the brushes it was ok havnt used it since.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>they r simple &amp; Cute, ty.   </li>
            <li>Considering I&#x27;m no pro, these are fine with me and I will try to work with them a little more.</li>
            <li>have very tiny bristles which make them good foregoing the tiny designs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So good for those little details on finger nails and toes!  </li>
            <li>thanks you very much for this item.</li>
            <li>They were very well constructed and were exactly what was depicted at amazon.com.</li>
            <li>but it was easy to put back on.</li>
            <li>The brushes are smaller than in the picture, but they work fine.</li>
            <li>However, the first and main brush I need to use fell off the handle.</li>
            <li>These work really well for diy at home.</li>
            <li>Works very well does not shed there was a lot of work put into the product.</li>
            <li>When I got these brushes the lengths varied but not as much as I would have wanted like what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Very upset but can&#x27;t be upset with the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>alright if you&#x27;re not looking for anything precise but within a week, the metal part was coming off (i just reglued them back on).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing is the whole thing from inside the bubble envelope to the packaging and</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hands immediately and threw the whole delivery in a plastic bag and put it in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve painted cheetah print, straight lines, chevrons, and even palm</li>
            <li>I would absolutely shop with amazon.com and this seller again.</li>
            <li>Metal part seems a bit flimsy but is should hold up to gentle use with the nail art.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re very well made for the price, too.</li>
            <li>They re e perfect size so that you can make those tedious designs!</li>
            <li>Really like this product, decent quality.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in texture between them and another high quality brush I purchased from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>no worries about the metal part coming off easily as can happen w some other wood handle brushes.  </li>
            <li>they haven&#x27;t broke off but they are kind off hard to do designs with.</li>
            <li>If you want a true striper (the long ones), these are not for you.</li>
            <li>Pain has disinergrated to normal usage.  </li>
            <li>but hey, two bucks only gets you so much right?</li>
            <li>a week early arrival, good price for what u usually see like..higher price yet same quality.  </li>
            <li>You can barely draw a straight line without redoing it, which makes it wider and thicker.</li>
            <li>After nearly a month of waiting for them to arrive, I received them damaged!  </li>
            <li>The brushes in the image looked thin and perfect for the nail art that I usually do.</li>
            <li>I have used them once so far, and they are ok, but if I want to do anything really small</li>
            <li>especially the exfoliating body and facial scrubs to renews my skin and is very rejuvenating on the skin!!  </li>
            <li>When they arrived they were much thicker and smaller than I expected and are almost too big to do the fine detail work that I get into.</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper than actual model brushes and equivalent quality.</li>
            <li>Came early.</li>
            <li>They are very pliable -- they go where you want them to go, making very specific curves.</li>
            <li>so surprised..</li>
            <li>Would only recommend for play not for real clients</li>
            <li>the length that I got was the shortest length which I will NEVER use, I use the longer ones to make the nice thin lines</li>
            <li>Shipped out right away &amp; got them weeks before the expected delivery dates.</li>
            <li>GREAT CONDITIONS didnt come broken!!</li>
            <li>I am not sure how to clean the ail polish off though........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them twice so far</li>
            <li>They drag too much for sharper lines.</li>
            <li>The tiny brush will work well for any sort of nail art and some small clean up.</li>
            <li>They  are much easier to work than other brushes.</li>
            <li>the nail polish won&#x27;t clean of the brush and it makes the brush hard.</li>
            <li>The brushes weren&#x27;t really meant for nails, they didn&#x27;t really go on straight and the nail polish stuck to th hairs no matter how hard I tried to wash off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job the brush may seem a bit to stiff at first</li>
            <li>And just the right size for small hands too.</li>
            <li>so I need thicker handle so my hands don&#x27;t get tired easily.</li>

            <li> The bristles are smooth and I like the shorter wider handle.</li>
            <li> I have received this product from bzzagent to try and i have been using it for awhile and really enjoy it</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described and so far work great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are reall fun to use and easy to clean...</li>
            <li> These brushes were ok for the price guess you can&#x27;t expect to much out of something that is cheap.</li>
            <li> Not a sturdy brush, doesn&#x27;t make clean lines.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s hard to get them just perfect</li>
            <li> i love really them.</li>
            <li> tip),the paint was chipping, and they are very wobbly at the top when using them.</li>
            <li> So far so good, they were as described and seem to do the job well, appear pretty sturdy to me</li>
            <li> and they came quickly too.</li>
            <li> Not bad, worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, these brushes are fun as you can create a lot of designs with them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent for the price, if I did it all over again, or next time I&#x27;ll spend a tad bit more and get better quality brushes...</li>
            <li> The chrome bezels that hold the brush in place slip right off, had to glue them all on so they would stay in place.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t clean up very well</li>
            <li> However, I took the plastic tip off of the first brush, and the whole head came off!!</li>
            <li> These work great, however, for small details in nail painting.</li>
            <li> However, if you are a pro, or want better quality, consider spending a little more on nicer brushes.</li>
            <li> and they are eazy to clean super wow</li>
            <li> I like this item very much</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was my first set of nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> Ive only used one of the brushes it was ok havnt used it since.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> they r simple &amp; Cute, ty.   </li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;m no pro, these are fine with me and I will try to work with them a little more.</li>
            <li> have very tiny bristles which make them good foregoing the tiny designs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So good for those little details on finger nails and toes!  </li>
            <li> thanks you very much for this item.</li>
            <li> They were very well constructed and were exactly what was depicted at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> but it was easy to put back on.</li>
            <li> The brushes are smaller than in the picture, but they work fine.</li>
            <li> However, the first and main brush I need to use fell off the handle.</li>
            <li> These work really well for diy at home.</li>
            <li> Works very well does not shed there was a lot of work put into the product.</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes the lengths varied but not as much as I would have wanted like what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Very upset but can&#x27;t be upset with the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> alright if you&#x27;re not looking for anything precise but within a week, the metal part was coming off (i just reglued them back on).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is the whole thing from inside the bubble envelope to the packaging and</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hands immediately and threw the whole delivery in a plastic bag and put it in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve painted cheetah print, straight lines, chevrons, and even palm</li>
            <li> I would absolutely shop with amazon.com and this seller again.</li>
            <li> Metal part seems a bit flimsy but is should hold up to gentle use with the nail art.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re very well made for the price, too.</li>
            <li> They re e perfect size so that you can make those tedious designs!</li>
            <li> Really like this product, decent quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in texture between them and another high quality brush I purchased from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> no worries about the metal part coming off easily as can happen w some other wood handle brushes.  </li>
            <li> they haven&#x27;t broke off but they are kind off hard to do designs with.</li>
            <li> If you want a true striper (the long ones), these are not for you.</li>
            <li> Pain has disinergrated to normal usage.  </li>
            <li> but hey, two bucks only gets you so much right?</li>
            <li> a week early arrival, good price for what u usually see like..higher price yet same quality.  </li>
            <li> You can barely draw a straight line without redoing it, which makes it wider and thicker.</li>
            <li> After nearly a month of waiting for them to arrive, I received them damaged!  </li>
            <li> The brushes in the image looked thin and perfect for the nail art that I usually do.</li>
            <li> I have used them once so far, and they are ok, but if I want to do anything really small</li>
            <li> especially the exfoliating body and facial scrubs to renews my skin and is very rejuvenating on the skin!!  </li>
            <li> When they arrived they were much thicker and smaller than I expected and are almost too big to do the fine detail work that I get into.</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than actual model brushes and equivalent quality.</li>
            <li> Came early.</li>
            <li> They are very pliable -- they go where you want them to go, making very specific curves.</li>
            <li> so surprised..</li>
            <li> Would only recommend for play not for real clients</li>
            <li> the length that I got was the shortest length which I will NEVER use, I use the longer ones to make the nice thin lines</li>
            <li> Shipped out right away &amp; got them weeks before the expected delivery dates.</li>
            <li> GREAT CONDITIONS didnt come broken!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to clean the ail polish off though........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them twice so far</li>
            <li> They drag too much for sharper lines.</li>
            <li> The tiny brush will work well for any sort of nail art and some small clean up.</li>
            <li> They  are much easier to work than other brushes.</li>
            <li> the nail polish won&#x27;t clean of the brush and it makes the brush hard.</li>
            <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t really meant for nails, they didn&#x27;t really go on straight and the nail polish stuck to th hairs no matter how hard I tried to wash off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job the brush may seem a bit to stiff at first</li>
            <li> And just the right size for small hands too.</li>
            <li> so I need thicker handle so my hands don&#x27;t get tired easily.</li>
            <li> The Striper is not so long, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed with the longest brush because it is NOT that long.</li>
            <li> so well you have to wait a long time for it to come in</li>
            <li> And they came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> After using them once, the bristles are already splayed out, rougher, and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get them clean.</li>
            <li> but I believe the loose hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> She got these to use when practicing putting makeup on other people both in and out of school for cosmetology</li>
            <li> They are not professional brushes, a few hairs do stick out of one of the three, but they are what I need for my job</li>
            <li> These worked really well when I thin out the polish,  As I used them a few hairs would work loose and were hard to get out of the way will be used.  </li>
            <li> I have only used these a few times, and my only complaint is that the bristles are not more stiff.</li>
            <li> Not real stripers, in my opinion, but rather small paint brushes.</li>
            <li> but they are a little thicker than what I need for nail design.  </li>
            <li> Gets a little messy at times</li>
            <li> if you expecting a lot out of a brush don&#x27;t waste your money on these ones</li>
            <li> I may have to trim a few bristles to achieve a narrow line.</li>
            <li> Mine broke within a few days.</li>
            <li> The tips are stiff, which I softened with a little water.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush were too stiff.</li>
            <li> The packaging was so tightly glued, I couldn&#x27;t open the flap , so I cut off a bit of the wrong end of the shipping manila</li>
            <li> The only reason why they got 4 stars is because the portion where you hold on to them (like you would a pencil), is very thin that it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow but couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Both the longer stripers are a little thick.</li>
            <li> Bought them for use on small models and panel lining.</li>
            <li> so I can look past it.</li>
            <li> They are so hard to use because they ate a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too thick.</li>
            <li> Since I have very small nails, I needed to trim the striping brush so I can make intricate details.</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes but for the amount of money not bad.</li>
            <li> For how little I spent, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> Not good for nail art</li>
            <li> But it is bad so much so that I got a little sick from it.</li>
            <li> they were poor quality they did not work for me</li>
            <li> The bristles would fall off and the brush would break to two separate piece like if it was poorly glued</li>
            <li> Brushes are really thin.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This also might be because I have especially small fingers.</li>
            <li> the brushes themselves smell weird, like smoke or ?????</li>
            <li> but how could i go wrong...</li>
            <li> Very poor packaging.</li>
            <li> so have that in mind but for the price range it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> If i use them &amp; hate them i will share that.</li>

            <li> GREAT CONDITIONS didnt come broken!! Perfect</li>
            <li> they were poor quality they did not work for me did not like them would not purchase again at all</li>
            <li> These work really well for diy at home.</li>
            <li> Not got good for stripes...</li>
            <li> THe Pen burush serves its purpose! Works very well does not shed there was a lot of work put into the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes in the image looked thin and perfect for the nail art that I usually do. When they arrived they were much thicker and smaller than I expected and are almost too big to do the fine detail work that I get into. I have used them once so far, and they are ok, but if I want to do anything really small I have a smaller brush that I go to instead.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim. They  are much easier to work than other brushes. The price is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I am really happy with these brushes. They work well for practicing nail art and they came quickly too.</li>
            <li> She got these to use when practicing putting makeup on other people both in and out of school for cosmetology</li>
            <li> I love them!  Easy to use, great quality.  So good for those little details on finger nails and toes!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought them for use on small models and panel lining. MUCH cheaper than actual model brushes and equivalent quality. Worth it. Came within 2 weeks of order even though from China.</li>
            <li> This was my first set of nail art brushes. I&#x27;ve only used them twice so far and I like them although I need to practice more with them.</li>
            <li> Brushes look good and good quality but they are a little thicker than what I need for nail design.  I thought they would be thinner by the look of the picture.  I had to trim some of the bristles to get the as thins as I wanted them</li>
            <li> I have only used these a few times, and my only complaint is that the bristles are not more stiff. They drag too much for sharper lines.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price. Not real stripers, in my opinion, but rather small paint brushes. If you want a true striper (the long ones), these are not for you. These work great, however, for small details in nail painting. Construction of brushes is sound....no worries about the metal part coming off easily as can happen w some other wood handle brushes.  Shipping was a little slow but couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Would order again.</li>
            <li> When I got these brushes the lengths varied but not as much as I would have wanted like what is shown in the picture. The longest and second longest brush did not even come close to the ones pictured. Also, these brushes do not stay pointed, the bristles fray but hey, two bucks only gets you so much right?</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for nail art, and for the price, they are a definite must have for your arsenal!</li>
            <li> These brushes are reall fun to use and easy to clean... And just the right size for small hands too.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, decent quality. Worked well for my nail art. Of course not quality of a more expensive pair, but still recommend it.</li>
            <li> These came all the same length, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t return this..but they are still in my nail bag unused and the length that I got was the shortest length which I will NEVER use, I use the longer ones to make the nice thin lines so I need to shop for nail art brushes.#disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product. Thought for sure I was gonna be able to make nice and easy lines and designs but I was wrong. Very upset but can&#x27;t be upset with the price. I basically got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I docked off two stars because one of the brushes fell apart when I took off its protector cap. Easy to fix, but still. Other than that, the set is a good set, ideal for manicure. The Striper is not so long, but it does the job. I ordered it from a US seller and it came without incident in the time frame.</li>
            <li> Shipped out right away &amp; got them weeks before the expected delivery dates. They work great.</li>
            <li> These brushes were ok for the price guess you can&#x27;t expect to much out of something that is cheap. The bristles would fall off and the brush would break to two separate piece like if it was poorly glued if you expecting a lot out of a brush don&#x27;t waste your money on these ones</li>
            <li> I love them they are the brush I use to write on nails and they are eazy to clean super wow</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before but it is easy to maneuver around with or without experience.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> These are fine. They don&#x27;t clean up very well but they were really cheap so I can look past it.</li>
            <li> excellent for the price.  I bought these for practice and for my middle school art club who is learning nail art.</li>
            <li> Some info on which brush is best for what would be handy, but I did some snowflakes on my nails and they turned out pretty awesome for my first try. Was very happy!</li>
            <li> This paint brushed did what I wanted them to do.  However, the first and main brush I need to use fell off the handle. I had to glue the brush back on the handle. The manufactures need to make sure the brushes are extra secure and every part is of good quality. Thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to make designs in her nails.  These tools allow her to make dots, stripes... you name it!  She loves them and I love seeing the many creative designs that she comes up with. :)</li>
            <li> These are okay I thought, I thought I could make stripes with these &amp; it&#x27;s hard to get them just perfect soo...I&#x27;ll keep trying with these but,these are good if u just wanna try something new with ur nails.</li>
            <li> I waited for a month and I have to say I don&#x27;t like them. They are so hard to use because they ate a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> This is not the best product but it does it&#x27;s job the brush may seem a bit to stiff at first so have that in mind but for the price range it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> Ive only used one of the brushes it was ok havnt used it since. you cant beat the price on these id buy them again.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected. They are exactly as described and so far work great. The only thing I would change is the handle is short for my preference</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this set of brushes for the longer nail striper. They were super cheap, which is great if your new to nail art like myself and don&#x27;t want to splurge. The brushes are okay. After using them once, the bristles are already splayed out, rougher, and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get them clean. I was dissapointed with the longest brush because it is NOT that long. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a striper. I&#x27;m going to look around and buy another brush/set. However, for the price, I would reccomend this set for nail art beginners.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is great. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in texture between them and another high quality brush I purchased from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. The bristles are smooth and I like the shorter wider handle. The tiny brush will work well for any sort of nail art and some small clean up. Both the longer stripers are a little thick. I may have to trim a few bristles to achieve a narrow line. This also might be because I have especially small fingers. Overall great for the price!</li>
            <li> very cheap and alright if you&#x27;re not looking for anything precise but within a week, the metal part was coming off (i just reglued them back on).</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived within the expected time frame so that was great! Upon arrival I opened the package and was pleased to see a very nice set of 3 brushes! However, I took the plastic tip off of the first brush, and the whole head came off!! Thankfully I could just put it back on so it wasn&#x27;t a problem. The brushes work very nice and can be cleaned fairly easily. For the price paid, the brushes are very good ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> Mine broke within a few days. The brushes weren&#x27;t really meant for nails, they didn&#x27;t really go on straight and the nail polish stuck to th hairs no matter how hard I tried to wash off.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush were too stiff. Didn&#x27;t work well, either messed up my nail polish or the design, or both. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Did not get the item shown in the picture. The quality is garbage. The bush tip is thicker than in the image all the same size. The hairs from the bush fall off easily. Took forever to receive. Would not recommend. Invest your money one something better.</li>
            <li> Came early. In 2 weeks it shipped thro usps. The glue did come off the stick but it was easy to put back on. Its pretty good. The hairs on the brushes don&#x27;t separate while ur designing  which is great</li>
            <li> I have received this product from bzzagent to try and i have been using it for awhile and really enjoy it especially the exfoliating body and facial scrubs to renews my skin and is very rejuvenating on the skin!!  My skin feels amazing and the epilator keeps my skin feeling smooth to the touch!! Pain has disinergrated to normal usage.  Thanks braun and bzzagent for letting me try this awesome product!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes to create manicures on my nails, the only reason I gave it four stars is because at this time I have atnother pair that I am still using, however these ones are really nice looking and are nice quality too!  Good buy.</li>
            <li> good product. does its job and helped with what i needed. for those looking for something similar i would recommend this,</li>
            <li> worth the price!!! i love really them. but when i received them one was cracked but it still works perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could make stripes with the nail polish I already had, instead of buying separate bottles of striper polishes. The brushes are smaller than in the picture, but they work fine. I am not sure how to clean the ail polish off though........</li>
            <li> The brushes are too thick. You can barely draw a straight line without redoing it, which makes it wider and thicker. The handle is huge and bulbous. Should have gone with the 15 piece set...</li>
            <li> So far so good, they were as described and seem to do the job well, appear pretty sturdy to me</li>
            <li> This thing sucked the one of the brushes brush came out, this doesn&#x27;t wor I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> These brushes are the cheapest items I have ever ordered. After nearly a month of waiting for them to arrive, I received them damaged!  All brushes were injured from the handle, caps were off the brushes, brushes were spread everywhere and were unusable. I don&#x27;t understand as they were in a plastic package but that&#x27;s how they arrived. I guess for the price what do I expect but they had to have seen them damaged and just sent them anyway unless they actually put them on the packaging themselves but either way they had to have seen them damaged. It does not look like they were damaged in shipping as the bubble envelope was intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is the whole thing from inside the bubble envelope to the packaging and the brushes themselves smell weird, like smoke or ????? But it is bad so much so that I got a little sick from it. I had to wash my hands immediately and threw the whole delivery in a plastic bag and put it in the garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote them to ask for a refund as I&#x27;m not waiting another 3-4 weeks for another set.</li>
            <li> This came a week early which was great. they haven&#x27;t broke off but they are kind off hard to do designs with.</li>
            <li> all is great..they have a purpose and i am using them for the holidays.so we will see then. but how could i go wrong...</li>
            <li> I use the smaller brush all the time for nail art. I&#x27;ve painted cheetah print, straight lines, chevrons, and even palm trees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use acrylic paint for art work, so just a rinse in warm water gets them clean. I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Very poor packaging. All three brushes were bent!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my friend for christmas. She says she loves them.. You can&#x27;t really go wrong, they were so cheap! She loves doing her nails, so I thought this would be a great gift for her :-)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are adorable and so easy to use! Also they are so easy to clean! They re e perfect size so that you can make those tedious designs! Love them! And they came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Dot this and they have worked out for me the price is great and the size is too. I do my kids nails so I am very happy with this but</li>
            <li> No flow.....wont move!</li>
            <li> I like this item very much and i will recommend for people to buy it... good price and good to used them.... thanks you very much for this item. I will put it to good used.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent for the price, if I did it all over again, or next time I&#x27;ll spend a tad bit more and get better quality brushes... The chrome bezels that hold the brush in place slip right off, had to glue them all on so they would stay in place.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price.  I can&#x27;t imagine you finding a better deal.  They are not professional brushes, a few hairs do stick out of one of the three, but they are what I need for my job and I didn&#x27;t pay a fortune for them.</li>
            <li> These worked really well when I thin out the polish,  As I used them a few hairs would work loose and were hard to get out of the way will be used.  Gets a little messy at times but I believe the loose hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> Not good for nail art the nail polish won&#x27;t clean of the brush and it makes the brush hard. As well as the brush paint start chipping</li>
            <li> I bought a set of three nail art brushes from amazon recently, and it was a no fuss no muss experience. My brushes came in a reasonable amount of time, and they were very nice! Exactly what I wanted. They were very well constructed and were exactly what was depicted at amazon.com. I am very pleased with both my purchase and the buying experience. I would absolutely shop with amazon.com and this seller again.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes with acrylic paint and they are very smooth to work with.They are very pliable -- they go where you want them to go, making very specific curves. Since I have very small nails, I needed to trim the striping brush so I can make intricate details. They are great brushes to work with. The only reason why they got 4 stars is because the portion where you hold on to them (like you would a pencil), is very thin that it takes a little getting used to. I have carpal tunnel so I need thicker handle so my hands don&#x27;t get tired easily. But otherwise, these brushes are fun as you can create a lot of designs with them.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really thin. Metal part seems a bit flimsy but is should hold up to gentle use with the nail art.</li>
            <li> works so well you have to wait a long time for it to come in but overall it got the job done</li>
            <li> these worked great! quite happy with the stripes these brushes allowed me to put on my nails! I now have tiger stripe nails!</li>
            <li> Great nail art brush and multi sizes.</li>
            <li> they are not the best product but they are affordable. the brushes  do work. I am happy with this brushes because since they are not the quality bushes like the others this brushes are just as good as ordinary brushes and I had no problems using them.</li>
            <li> I ended up using them for another painting project, and they worked better than brushes made for the job! I haven&#x27;t used them on nails yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re going to be amazing!  I think they&#x27;re very well made for the price, too.</li>
            <li> Finding a good deal is exciting and these seemed to be such a good deal. However, Upon trying it out, one of the metal tips came off and I had to glue it back on to the wooden handle. The tips are stiff, which I softened with a little water. I don&#x27;t think these make nice lines. For how little I spent, it&#x27;s not so bad. Considering I&#x27;m no pro, these are fine with me and I will try to work with them a little more. However, if you are a pro, or want better quality, consider spending a little more on nicer brushes. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was broken(had no brush tip),the paint was chipping, and they are very wobbly at the top when using them. good shipping though!</li>
            <li> so surprised..a week early arrival, good price for what u usually see like..higher price yet same quality.  they r simple &amp; Cute, ty.   If i use them &amp; hate them i will share that. smiles &amp; Peace. Philly.xo  ps. for home use.</li>
            <li> The packaging was so tightly glued, I couldn&#x27;t open the flap , so I cut off a bit of the wrong end of the shipping manila envelope.&lt;br /&gt;.......and 1/2 of the liner brush bristles....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never know if it was a good liner brush or no...</li>
            <li> I bought these for nail art. It&#x27;s a hobby of mine. Works just like I needed it to. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes but for the amount of money not bad. Would only recommend for play not for real clients</li>
            <li> I say nice because they have a price that can&#x27;t be beat and they are easy to maneuver when trying to do designs on nails.&lt;br /&gt;They have very tiny bristles which make them good foregoing the tiny designs.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t hard to clean with brush cleaner or acetone.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t the best brushes ever created but pretty awesome at an awesome price and they arrived before the estimated time frame so there&#x27;s a plus there too.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my hand painted nail art and they work great. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a sturdy brush, doesn&#x27;t make clean lines.</li>
            <li> Not bad, worth the price.  I assumed the longest strand brush was longer than what it actually is but either way i like it.  Works pretty good considering the price.</li>
