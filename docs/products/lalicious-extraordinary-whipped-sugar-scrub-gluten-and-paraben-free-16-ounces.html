            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feel so soft, smooth, and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is Paraben Free &amp; has a fantastic fragrance that sticks with me throughout the day.  </li>

            <li>The smell of this scrub is lovely and you will carry it with you for the whole day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it should not be that way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definetley worth the price!</li>
            <li>Also, the many scents I&#x27;ve tried have been wonderful, and they are long lasting.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li>The sugary, sweet smell makes you feel like you&#x27;re indulging yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user of LaLicious Brown Sugar Body Scrub.</li>
            <li>Unlike most body scrubs - this is made with actual sugar that melts when lathered on, thus making the whole body scrub process enjoyable (instead of a chore)!</li>
            <li>I wanted to eat it when I first opened the jar because it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different scrubs in my search for one that moisturizes while still being easy to apply and absorb.</li>
            <li>Not only does this scrub smell amazing, it works to exfoliate and moisturize.  </li>
            <li>You smell and feel so fresh after using it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price, since the scrub lasts months.  </li>
            <li>This brown sugar scrub applies easily onto your skin as the sugar melts and is absorbed quickly without you actually needing to work it in.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>So much for the relaxing gift!</li>
            <li>I love body scrubs and have tried several.</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave your skin feeling so soft, but I&#x27;m a new mommy and the delicious smell totally lifts your spirits.</li>
            <li>coconut oil is  listed as very very high on the comedogenic scale.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Charlye</li>
            <li>Real downer.  </li>
            <li>I got really into it after buying it on impulse when I was at Costco quite some time ago.</li>
            <li>It comes wrapped nicely in a plastic package (be careful when you open it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using it once a week is more than enough for me personally</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Before committing to this scrub I highly suggest shopping around.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates yourn skin leaving it so soft!</li>
            <li>Although I did find one ariticle that said that extra virgin coconut oil was not comedogenic, I really hesitate to believe that processing is what makes the difference.  </li>
            <li>The scrub is all natural and feels soft and buttery on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this item for my Mother for her Mother&#x27;s day gift, only to find it was very dry and course to her skin unlike the coconut cream</li>
            <li>So user be aware of that little glitch and rinse really well with soap, I guess.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this not only for the results it gives, but also as a pick me up for those trying times.</li>
            <li>The various sugar sources (brown and white sugars, honey) nourishes the skin and the sugar crystals apparently are incompletely dissolved and exfoliate the skin (no other item listed that would &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>I use this product on my very sensitive skin and it actually improves its appearance.</li>
            <li>This doubles as an all-over moisturizer because all of the oils don&#x27;t completey wash off in the shower, leaving your skin with a slick feel and a sweet scent.  </li>

            <li> A hot bath or shower and this wonderful product keeps my skin glowing! I adore this product. The competition can just not compare.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this item for my Mother for her Mother&#x27;s day gift, only to find it was very dry and course to her skin unlike the coconut cream I also purchased. I have submitted (2) emails in reference to the harsh item and I have not been responded to..so I do not recommend this item..although it had a wonderful aroma...Thanks Charlye</li>
            <li> This brown sugar body scrub leaves your skin silky smooth and smelling of brown sugar. The texture is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen in a body scrub. I&#x27;m a loyal user of LaLicious Brown Sugar Body Scrub. I use this product on my very sensitive skin and it actually improves its appearance.</li>
            <li> Lovely Vanilla scent. The various sugar sources (brown and white sugars, honey) nourishes the skin and the sugar crystals apparently are incompletely dissolved and exfoliate the skin (no other item listed that would &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34;)  Rinses easily with water and the coconut oil leaves a super smooth, moist and luxurious softness without the oily shine.  However, consumer beware, and here is the reason I gave only 3 stars:  coconut oil is  listed as very very high on the comedogenic scale.  That means pore clogging.  Real downer.  So user be aware of that little glitch and rinse really well with soap, I guess.  I only use it rarely and hope that my pores can handle just one jar of this great smelling and wonderful feeling beautification product.  I am really honestly disappointed, since I found out about coconut oil&#x27;s comedogenic property only after I used the product.  Although I did find one ariticle that said that extra virgin coconut oil was not comedogenic, I really hesitate to believe that processing is what makes the difference.  Everything else said it was comedogenic.  Plus, the label does not indicate how the coconut oil was processed.</li>
            <li> This smells UNBELIEVABLE.  The brown sugar is truly invigorating and smells like sugar cookies.  The scrub is all natural and feels soft and buttery on the skin.  This doubles as an all-over moisturizer because all of the oils don&#x27;t completey wash off in the shower, leaving your skin with a slick feel and a sweet scent.  People with very oily skin may have a problem, but I absolutely LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this scrub at the salon I go to, they used it during a pedicure.  I loved it so much I just had to have some at home.  I could not be happier with it.  The smell is wonderful, and it makes my skin so incredibly smooth.  A+ and I&#x27;ll keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I have used many different scrubs in my search for one that moisturizes while still being easy to apply and absorb. This brown sugar scrub applies easily onto your skin as the sugar melts and is absorbed quickly without you actually needing to work it in. I would recommend that you use a bath brush however to get rid of any dead skin cells. It comes wrapped nicely in a plastic package (be careful when you open it the scrub might have leaked a little bit especially if you are ordering in the summer). The smell of this scrub is lovely and you will carry it with you for the whole day! Now the down side (for some), is that the moisturizing oil in this scrub leaves your skin (and your loofah) feeling quite slippery so don&#x27;t use this if you intend to get any waxing etc done on the same day. I&#x27;ve found that using it once a week is more than enough for me personally and I tend to have dry skin. This medium-sized tub lasts for atleast two months for me. I use Lalicious&#x27; sugar kiss body butter afterwards and my skin remains perfectly moisturized during the Northeast&#x27;s dry winters! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Not only does it leave your skin feeling so soft, but I&#x27;m a new mommy and the delicious smell totally lifts your spirits. I guess you could say it&#x27;s like aromatherapy! :) The sugary, sweet smell makes you feel like you&#x27;re indulging yourself. I highly recommend this not only for the results it gives, but also as a pick me up for those trying times.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this product. It leaves your skin feel so soft, smooth, and smelling great. Will re-purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect stuff to use before shaving! Nothing works quite like it. I got really into it after buying it on impulse when I was at Costco quite some time ago. The thing that bums me out though is that I bought it at Costco for $5/16 oz tub. FIVE DOLLARS! I bought three and then they were gone from Costco. So, when I went to buy some online, I was shocked to find out that it was sooooo much more expensive. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so dang expensive. But, the product is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only makes your skin feel better, it smells heavenly!!  And it stays with you for a bit instead of going away as soon as you step out of the shower.  Really good stuff.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best stuff ever made.  it smells awesome, feels awesome.  I will use this stuff the rest of my life</li>
            <li> Wow!  Not only does this scrub smell amazing, it works to exfoliate and moisturize.  No need to re-mix grains and oil.  The texture feel fab on your skin!  It&#x27;s like a miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li> I was actually just writing a review to find out if anyone knew if this was supposed to be soft (as a souffle would suggest) or hard as a rock?  This was to be a gift for someone and when I opened it, it seems as though it should be used as a weapon instead.  It&#x27;s 1 solid mass of stalagmite type material.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it should not be that way.  So much for the relaxing gift!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft and smells amazing and you feel amazing after using it I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This scrub is so perfect! It exfoliates yourn skin leaving it so soft! It&#x27;s definetley worth the price! For smooth legs, try using this after you shave! Jessica.</li>
            <li> love love the smell of this body scrub.  You smell and feel so fresh after using it.  I have bought several and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> i just bought this, but at costco. it is less there. $14.00. i hope they don&#x27;s stop carrying it anytime soon. it is definitely what i have been looking for. by far the best scrub i have used.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product// easy to use/ beautifully packaged/ great gift/makes your skin feel like silk glad I purchased it will reorder.</li>
            <li> LaLicious Brown Sugar Souffle scrub is incredible! The smell evokes a sense of comfort and ease. Unlike most body scrubs - this is made with actual sugar that melts when lathered on, thus making the whole body scrub process enjoyable (instead of a chore)! I must also recommend using LaLicious&#x27;s Vanilla Shea Butter Cream afterwards. It is a true simple joy to make the stress and troubles of this world melt away. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding for smooth skin. I will contine to purchase LaLicious for myself and as a a gift.</li>
            <li> Since I bought a basket of LaLicious products in a silent auction last year I have been hooked.  I literally won&#x27;t use anything else at this time.  I also love that it is Paraben Free &amp; has a fantastic fragrance that sticks with me throughout the day.  My skin is the softest it has ever been.  Well worth the price, since the scrub lasts months.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to polish my skin tone. I wanted to eat it when I first opened the jar because it smells fantastic.  This product worked. But since using it I have found other products that work just as well if not better for far less. Before committing to this scrub I highly suggest shopping around.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t scrape any dead skin off. just smells nice and is oily but i wanted a scrub with purpose. not going to buy again</li>
            <li> I love body scrubs and have tried several. LaLicious is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized. In fact, I don&#x27;t have to use body lotion after using this product. I have also found it to be non-irritating; for instance, it&#x27;s never turned my skin red. Also, the many scents I&#x27;ve tried have been wonderful, and they are long lasting. Your skin will love you for trying this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing in every way.</li>
