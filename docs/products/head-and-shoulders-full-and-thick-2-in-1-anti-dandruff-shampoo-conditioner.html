            <li>This shampoo has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Dad was very pleased with it, mostly because it lathered well.  </li>
            <li>Dad was very pleased with it, mostly because it lathered well.  </li>
            <li>I can tell a difference, we will continue to buy this product he is so much more confident!</li>
            <li>Very cheap, effective, I like it</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light, not medicinal, and thankfully not girly!</li>
            <li>Easy transaction !</li>
            <li>This Head and Shoulders Men&#x27;s Shampoo + Conditioner has a mild pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>great seller , fast shipping.</li>
            <li>son and husband LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of having Shampoo and Conditioner in one bottle.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say...</li>
            <li>I love H&amp;S, I never tried the men version until now.</li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Also, Head and Shoulders has been around many years, ever since I was a child.  </li>
            <li>Also, Head and Shoulders has been around many years, ever since I was a child.  </li>
            <li>Using it was more like pouring medicine on your head.</li>
            <li>It feels smoother while under the shower but takes more rinsing to finish it off.  </li>
            <li>I have used Head and Shoulders for many years.</li>
            <li>It has a more tolerable scent now.</li>
            <li>What could be more manly than a shampoo/conditioner combo?  </li>
            <li>also found it interesting reading the instructions that it suggests using this after every time you shampoo which seems to defeat the purpose of buying a 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>My hair has more body.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels when I get finished washing it.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>It just seems to get in my eyes more often.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned it being more watery, which may explain this.</li>
            <li>My husband has had dandruff since I met him many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>So this has done better for him.</li>
            <li>I guess what is also implied here is that it is ok to use another shampoo more than this one and just use this if one experiences dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to be trying any Head and Shoulder product and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and clean like after a shampoo,</li>
            <li>If it makes your hair ”fuller” then great, but don’t get your hopes up too high.</li>
            <li>The first thing you notice with a new shampoo is the smell and the latest Head and Shoulders product may have the best scent that has ever come out of a shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li>It works great and really leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>He is fine now.  </li>
            <li>so its fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem but with this product you are covered.</li>
            <li>Its always taken care of the light dandruff I get.</li>
            <li>I am cheap.  </li>
            <li>But remember, I am comparing it with cheap bar soap.  </li>
            <li>Important to me, it did NOT seem to leave any aroma, perfume, or smell in my hair.</li>
            <li>for me, I liked it because even though I am a woman, it was still gentle on my hair when I did use it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything about it that would make it more suitable for men -- it smelled nice but not particularly &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re always happy to go back to our tried and true, Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is decently sized (many drugstore products have been downsizing in my experience) and easy to grip in the shower.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable thickening of his thinning hair but it works well for dandruff and gets his hair clean.  </li>
            <li>my short/medium length hair really giving it a fuller appearance with enhanced vitality (the effects are even more pronounced if blow-drying is used).</li>
            <li>This shampoo had a pleasant, almost herbal scent and an appealing, slightly green color.  </li>
            <li>one works well and smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I like the mild scent and the conditioner</li>
            <li>Without having the heavy medicine smell of many competitor brand dandruff shampoos, Head and shoulders provides a very nice lather, clean feel, and nice results regarding dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>it works very well!!</li>
            <li>It would be like me thinking that the right amount of make-up could make me look like a super model.</li>
            <li>Overall, Head and Shoulders have provided a good product over the years that brings about a good wash with little effort.</li>
            <li>Made my hair smell fantastic and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, however must be purchased as part of a qualifying order as an add on to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Nothing too exciting here.</li>
            <li>I love the masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>It also says you can use it more, but the use of this product really depends on how much dandruff one has.  </li>
            <li>That is a pretty bold claim.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have very fine, thinning hair and avoid daily shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff as a rule, but I do have moments where I get dry spots on my scalp, and a dandruff shampoo can be extremely effective in clearing those spots up.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I am very brand loyal to Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, fresh scent, which is different from normal Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>My husband used this product and he tells me that the Full and Thick 2 in 1 Head and Shoulders have a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work fine for my thinning (getting old) hair.</li>
            <li>No one ever became bald but they got pretty close.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is thick and does a great job of cleaning hair and relieving itching and flakes.</li>
            <li>It does not contain any natural ingredients (nor does it claim to), so if that is important to you, stay away from this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this!</li>
            <li>Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li>This is the first Head &amp; Shoulders product that specifically states it is for men that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The first wash?</li>
            <li>Only shampoo I use... Smells great and really work to get rid of that minor case of dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulders shampoo for dry, itchy scalp for years, and after several uses this seems to work just as well, and is perfect for my last-minute morning showers where saving even just a couple minutes by not having to use conditioner -- which involves an extra rinse and application -- is a life-saver.</li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The scent is better as it is more subtle.  </li>
            <li>The label claims new fresh scent technology and</li>
            <li>If the company did not test on animals - and there are a large number of companies that do not</li>
            <li>and I would certainly purchase again to kill two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li>It certainly isn’t floral or fruity so manly, it is.</li>
            <li>The bottle top is easy to open when wet and doesn&#x27;t tip over in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, it is very convenient when traveling to carry both shampoo and conditioner in one bottle in lieu of separate ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it is very convenient when traveling to carry both shampoo and conditioner in one bottle in lieu of separate ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I really like is it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical odor to it.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to save time in applying shampoo and conditioner separately.  </li>
            <li>Those cheap products do sometimes leave me scratching my head a couple of hours later.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and conditions my hair very well, and helps alleviate the dryness in my scalp.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that it did much to thicken his hair</li>
            <li>And this really takes care of our itchy scalps.</li>
            <li>But I guess another way to look at it, this shampoo really has nothing feminine about it as well.  </li>
            <li>My son really likes the Head and Shoulders for Men line and although I am a woman, I like to use it as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, my son really likes it and has already told me, &amp;#34;Get</li>
            <li>Like my son, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shampoo as frequently as my hair remained more presentable for at least a day more.</li>
            <li>For someone with dandruff problems all my life, using this product has really changed my life.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>My husband has thinning hair and this shampoo really didn’t make any difference in fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This &#x27;Head &amp; Shoulders&#x27; product adds a couple of new features to their standard dandruff shampoo with the inclusions of volumizing effects (hence the &#x27;full &amp; thick&#x27;) and conditioner making this a great, all purpose all in one hair</li>
            <li>My version was simply the original Head and Shoulder</li>
            <li>It seems to be a bit more watery than other shampoos I have used</li>
            <li>Hair feels squeaky clean and full, and it works as advertised for calming down any dandruff.</li>
            <li>This is a LARGE bottle of shampoo and a better price than at the local big box store.</li>
            <li>texture of the shampoo itself is different from other ones, and the after result is more refreshing than the other products, leaving a long lasting scent of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I was sent an older bottle of the Head and Shoulder shampoo 2 and 1</li>
            <li>Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner works well to control dandruff, which is my main concern.</li>
            <li>I told my 80-year old dad about the new line of Head and Shoulders 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners, but he wasn&#x27;t interested.  </li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>A high quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 30 year old boyfriend who is very subconious about going bald.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my hair is left thick, manageable and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only negative I can think of is that it really burns when it gets in your eyes, but this is true for most dandruff/dry scalp shampoos.</li>
            <li>I think this helps keep his scalp from getting super dry.</li>
            <li>The cap is easy to flip open, a real plus when handling a bottle this size with wet hands.</li>
            <li>Extra Volume 2-in-1 is an advanced formula that cleans and conditions my hair, leaving it feeling soft; it actually gives my hair the appearance of being thicker.  </li>
            <li>He has used Head and Shoulders for years and likes this version as well as the ones he has used in the past though he likes the fragrance better in this version.</li>
            <li>and I have found it to wash out easily after application with little residue or frustration.</li>
            <li>This is a product that I wish I could give a higher rating to, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t due to ethical factors.</li>
            <li>I find such claims to be nothing but bunk, pure snake oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He now doesn&#x27;t have to worry about dandruff and his hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I just think he&#x27;s getting finicky and crotchety in his old age.  </li>
            <li>Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners for men, like me, who have thinning hair, whether it is from MPB or old age.  </li>
            <li>I just think he&#x27;s getting finicky and crotchety in his old age.  </li>
            <li>Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners for men, like me, who have thinning hair, whether it is from MPB or old age.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, not overpowering, and soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This 2 in 1 shampoo offers 7 benefits, granted one is &amp;</li>
            <li>Have to admit my hair is thinning and have I&#x27;ve recently developed  dandruff .</li>
            <li>I have very curly but short hair</li>
            <li>It only has so much to work with.</li>
            <li>I really don’t think there is anything drastically masculine about it, the shampoo is a mint green and has fresh, mint-like scent.  </li>
            <li>But this is the first time that i tried their Men&#x27;s Full &amp; Thick Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner product.</li>
            <li>product description says: “Full &amp; Thick Shampoo cleans to restore fullness to thinning hair from the first wash”.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;full &amp; thick&#x27; feature really does work on</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the entire line of Head and Shoulders 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the entire line of Head and Shoulders 2-in-1</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have too much of a dandruff issue but he prefers the Head and Shoulders line because he can go a few days without washing his hair (as long as it is non-workout days) whereas with other shampoos, he has to shampoo more frequently.</li>
            <li>Because I am older, my hair is starting thin and be more brittle, but this 2-in-1 did make the hair look thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might be a little pricier than some other shampoos (although a quick glance at Amazon&#x27;s price is very reasonable to me), but we will definitely be putting it on the shopping list because my household likes it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair dandruff free for me at least.</li>
            <li>when possible I try to buy things at The Body Shop because they are adamant in their no testing on animals policies).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a combo shampoo and conditioner and apparently for men.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t such a manly man I would have literally sat down in the bath tub and had a little cry due to the burning sensation, but I persevered and gave it a good wash nevertheless.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient for dandruff control is a gentle 1% pyrithione zinc.</li>
            <li>The company has been the target of several animal rights groups for its policy, and while I am not a member of PETA or any similar group, I agree completely with their targeting Proctor &amp; Gamble for criticism.</li>
            <li>This being a &#x27;men&#x27;s&#x27; formulated product there is the inclusion of a &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent reminiscent of your standard, mass marketed fragrances (eg - &#x27;Axe&#x27;).</li>
            <li>At this stage in our civilization there is no excuse for testing soaps and shampoos on animals.</li>
            <li>Amazon Vine offered me the opportunity to review the Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li>B00GD854L8 Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li>I took him some items to cheer him up and one was this Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li>Mom bathed him and promised me she would use the Full &amp; Thick on his hair.  </li>
            <li>However, he did take a shine to the Full &amp; Thick from Head and Shoulders.  </li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions to their products.  </li>
            <li> Smells and works great.</li>
            <li> I have used for a week or so and its done a great job getting rid of the dandruff.</li>
            <li> Great scent and fights dryness are two others which are as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I chose this item .</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders makes a great line of dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don’t want to drop it as your toes won’t be happy if they get clunked by the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have always had great experiences with Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I also know that using this shampoo is great for reducing and eliminating dandruff.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> It also seems very effective in stopping dandruff.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a really pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It lathers surprisingly well for a 2-In-1 shampoo + conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a really good 2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good smell.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and works good to.</li>
            <li> It lathered up well and did a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Both smell great, lather well, and rinse out easily without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li> Plus it makes his hair smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I was offered from Amazon Vine the Head and Shoulders</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Dad was very pleased with it, mostly because it lathered well.  </li>
            <li> Dad was very pleased with it, mostly because it lathered well.  </li>
            <li> I can tell a difference, we will continue to buy this product he is so much more confident!</li>
            <li> Very cheap, effective, I like it</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light, not medicinal, and thankfully not girly!</li>
            <li> Easy transaction !</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulders Men&#x27;s Shampoo + Conditioner has a mild pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Overall, though, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> great seller , fast shipping.</li>
            <li> son and husband LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of having Shampoo and Conditioner in one bottle.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say...</li>
            <li> I love H&amp;S, I never tried the men version until now.</li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Also, Head and Shoulders has been around many years, ever since I was a child.  </li>
            <li> Also, Head and Shoulders has been around many years, ever since I was a child.  </li>
            <li> Using it was more like pouring medicine on your head.</li>
            <li> It feels smoother while under the shower but takes more rinsing to finish it off.  </li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders for many years.</li>
            <li> It has a more tolerable scent now.</li>
            <li> What could be more manly than a shampoo/conditioner combo?  </li>
            <li> also found it interesting reading the instructions that it suggests using this after every time you shampoo which seems to defeat the purpose of buying a 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> My hair has more body.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels when I get finished washing it.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> It just seems to get in my eyes more often.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned it being more watery, which may explain this.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dandruff since I met him many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> So this has done better for him.</li>
            <li> I guess what is also implied here is that it is ok to use another shampoo more than this one and just use this if one experiences dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to be trying any Head and Shoulder product and this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My hair felt nice and clean like after a shampoo,</li>
            <li> If it makes your hair ”fuller” then great, but don’t get your hopes up too high.</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice with a new shampoo is the smell and the latest Head and Shoulders product may have the best scent that has ever come out of a shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li> It works great and really leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> He is fine now.  </li>
            <li> so its fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem but with this product you are covered.</li>
            <li> Its always taken care of the light dandruff I get.</li>
            <li> I am cheap.  </li>
            <li> But remember, I am comparing it with cheap bar soap.  </li>
            <li> Important to me, it did NOT seem to leave any aroma, perfume, or smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> for me, I liked it because even though I am a woman, it was still gentle on my hair when I did use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything about it that would make it more suitable for men -- it smelled nice but not particularly &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re always happy to go back to our tried and true, Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is decently sized (many drugstore products have been downsizing in my experience) and easy to grip in the shower.</li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable thickening of his thinning hair but it works well for dandruff and gets his hair clean.  </li>
            <li> my short/medium length hair really giving it a fuller appearance with enhanced vitality (the effects are even more pronounced if blow-drying is used).</li>
            <li> This shampoo had a pleasant, almost herbal scent and an appealing, slightly green color.  </li>
            <li> one works well and smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I like the mild scent and the conditioner</li>
            <li> Without having the heavy medicine smell of many competitor brand dandruff shampoos, Head and shoulders provides a very nice lather, clean feel, and nice results regarding dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> it works very well!!</li>
            <li> It would be like me thinking that the right amount of make-up could make me look like a super model.</li>
            <li> Overall, Head and Shoulders have provided a good product over the years that brings about a good wash with little effort.</li>
            <li> Made my hair smell fantastic and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, however must be purchased as part of a qualifying order as an add on to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Nothing too exciting here.</li>
            <li> I love the masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> It also says you can use it more, but the use of this product really depends on how much dandruff one has.  </li>
            <li> That is a pretty bold claim.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have very fine, thinning hair and avoid daily shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff as a rule, but I do have moments where I get dry spots on my scalp, and a dandruff shampoo can be extremely effective in clearing those spots up.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am very brand loyal to Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice, fresh scent, which is different from normal Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and he tells me that the Full and Thick 2 in 1 Head and Shoulders have a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work fine for my thinning (getting old) hair.</li>
            <li> No one ever became bald but they got pretty close.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and does a great job of cleaning hair and relieving itching and flakes.</li>
            <li> It does not contain any natural ingredients (nor does it claim to), so if that is important to you, stay away from this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this!</li>
            <li> Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li> This is the first Head &amp; Shoulders product that specifically states it is for men that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The first wash?</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I use... Smells great and really work to get rid of that minor case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulders shampoo for dry, itchy scalp for years, and after several uses this seems to work just as well, and is perfect for my last-minute morning showers where saving even just a couple minutes by not having to use conditioner -- which involves an extra rinse and application -- is a life-saver.</li>
            <li> thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The scent is better as it is more subtle.  </li>
            <li> The label claims new fresh scent technology and</li>
            <li> If the company did not test on animals - and there are a large number of companies that do not</li>
            <li> and I would certainly purchase again to kill two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn’t floral or fruity so manly, it is.</li>
            <li> The bottle top is easy to open when wet and doesn&#x27;t tip over in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it is very convenient when traveling to carry both shampoo and conditioner in one bottle in lieu of separate ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it is very convenient when traveling to carry both shampoo and conditioner in one bottle in lieu of separate ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I really like is it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical odor to it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to save time in applying shampoo and conditioner separately.  </li>
            <li> Those cheap products do sometimes leave me scratching my head a couple of hours later.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and conditions my hair very well, and helps alleviate the dryness in my scalp.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that it did much to thicken his hair</li>
            <li> And this really takes care of our itchy scalps.</li>
            <li> But I guess another way to look at it, this shampoo really has nothing feminine about it as well.  </li>
            <li> My son really likes the Head and Shoulders for Men line and although I am a woman, I like to use it as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, my son really likes it and has already told me, &amp;#34;Get</li>
            <li> Like my son, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shampoo as frequently as my hair remained more presentable for at least a day more.</li>
            <li> For someone with dandruff problems all my life, using this product has really changed my life.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> My husband has thinning hair and this shampoo really didn’t make any difference in fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Head &amp; Shoulders&#x27; product adds a couple of new features to their standard dandruff shampoo with the inclusions of volumizing effects (hence the &#x27;full &amp; thick&#x27;) and conditioner making this a great, all purpose all in one hair</li>
            <li> My version was simply the original Head and Shoulder</li>
            <li> It seems to be a bit more watery than other shampoos I have used</li>
            <li> Hair feels squeaky clean and full, and it works as advertised for calming down any dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is a LARGE bottle of shampoo and a better price than at the local big box store.</li>
            <li> texture of the shampoo itself is different from other ones, and the after result is more refreshing than the other products, leaving a long lasting scent of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I was sent an older bottle of the Head and Shoulder shampoo 2 and 1</li>
            <li> Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner works well to control dandruff, which is my main concern.</li>
            <li> I told my 80-year old dad about the new line of Head and Shoulders 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners, but he wasn&#x27;t interested.  </li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> A high quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 30 year old boyfriend who is very subconious about going bald.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my hair is left thick, manageable and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that it really burns when it gets in your eyes, but this is true for most dandruff/dry scalp shampoos.</li>
            <li> I think this helps keep his scalp from getting super dry.</li>
            <li> The cap is easy to flip open, a real plus when handling a bottle this size with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Extra Volume 2-in-1 is an advanced formula that cleans and conditions my hair, leaving it feeling soft; it actually gives my hair the appearance of being thicker.  </li>
            <li> He has used Head and Shoulders for years and likes this version as well as the ones he has used in the past though he likes the fragrance better in this version.</li>
            <li> and I have found it to wash out easily after application with little residue or frustration.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I wish I could give a higher rating to, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t due to ethical factors.</li>
            <li> I find such claims to be nothing but bunk, pure snake oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He now doesn&#x27;t have to worry about dandruff and his hair is soft.</li>
            <li> I just think he&#x27;s getting finicky and crotchety in his old age.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners for men, like me, who have thinning hair, whether it is from MPB or old age.  </li>
            <li> I just think he&#x27;s getting finicky and crotchety in his old age.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners for men, like me, who have thinning hair, whether it is from MPB or old age.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, not overpowering, and soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This 2 in 1 shampoo offers 7 benefits, granted one is &amp;</li>
            <li> Have to admit my hair is thinning and have I&#x27;ve recently developed  dandruff .</li>
            <li> I have very curly but short hair</li>
            <li> It only has so much to work with.</li>
            <li> I really don’t think there is anything drastically masculine about it, the shampoo is a mint green and has fresh, mint-like scent.  </li>
            <li> But this is the first time that i tried their Men&#x27;s Full &amp; Thick Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner product.</li>
            <li> product description says: “Full &amp; Thick Shampoo cleans to restore fullness to thinning hair from the first wash”.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;full &amp; thick&#x27; feature really does work on</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the entire line of Head and Shoulders 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the entire line of Head and Shoulders 2-in-1</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have too much of a dandruff issue but he prefers the Head and Shoulders line because he can go a few days without washing his hair (as long as it is non-workout days) whereas with other shampoos, he has to shampoo more frequently.</li>
            <li> Because I am older, my hair is starting thin and be more brittle, but this 2-in-1 did make the hair look thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might be a little pricier than some other shampoos (although a quick glance at Amazon&#x27;s price is very reasonable to me), but we will definitely be putting it on the shopping list because my household likes it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair dandruff free for me at least.</li>
            <li> when possible I try to buy things at The Body Shop because they are adamant in their no testing on animals policies).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a combo shampoo and conditioner and apparently for men.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t such a manly man I would have literally sat down in the bath tub and had a little cry due to the burning sensation, but I persevered and gave it a good wash nevertheless.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient for dandruff control is a gentle 1% pyrithione zinc.</li>
            <li> The company has been the target of several animal rights groups for its policy, and while I am not a member of PETA or any similar group, I agree completely with their targeting Proctor &amp; Gamble for criticism.</li>
            <li> This being a &#x27;men&#x27;s&#x27; formulated product there is the inclusion of a &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent reminiscent of your standard, mass marketed fragrances (eg - &#x27;Axe&#x27;).</li>
            <li> At this stage in our civilization there is no excuse for testing soaps and shampoos on animals.</li>
            <li> Amazon Vine offered me the opportunity to review the Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li> B00GD854L8 Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li> I took him some items to cheer him up and one was this Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li> Mom bathed him and promised me she would use the Full &amp; Thick on his hair.  </li>
            <li> However, he did take a shine to the Full &amp; Thick from Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosbathed him and promised me she would use the Full &amp; Thick on his hair.  </li>
            <li> However, he did take a shine to the Full &amp; Thick from Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick</li>
            <li> He has been using Full &amp; Thick for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> While I was visiting my Dad in Maryville, Tennessee, I rushed out to one of the local grocery stores and bought him the Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> While I was visiting my Dad in Maryville, Tennessee, I rushed out to one of the local grocery stores and bought him the Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mess around much with my hair.  </li>
            <li> dandruff shampoos to see if we could save a little money, but they really don&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> The spots that were blonde are starting to get a little darker to match his normal hair color and the hair itself is also getting thicker.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, and it is the practice of P&amp;G to test shampoos and other products by placing it directly onto the eyes of rabbits.</li>
            <li> I tried the Full &amp; Thick for a few weeks and it worked the same as the Extra Volume.  </li>
            <li> My only other minor complaint is that this shampoo is prone to getting in my eyes at a significantly higher rate.</li>
            <li> This is a long standing brand and a quality product.</li>
            <li> so I am not able to comment on the new update to the line.</li>
            <li> His scalp used to be so dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> In the summer I tend to get some flakes on my scalp from the heat and dry air.</li>
            <li> You can see a big difference in how his hair looks compared to the previous shampoo he was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And you only have to use it a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adding conditioner to shampoo never really made sense to me anyway.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The other four are tied to dandruff: removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation, and reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine like other H&amp;S products.</li>
            <li> Like other Head and Shoulders shampoos, this lathers up well and rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Afterward, it seemed a bit harder to rinse off my skin where it had run down from my head.</li>
            <li> He also complained that the Axe shower gel left a greasy ring around the shower stall.  </li>
            <li> He also complained that the Axe shower gel left a greasy ring around the shower stall.  </li>
            <li> I really do believe that our products need to be embedded in a system of morality, and on that score this product fails abysmally.</li>
            <li> It is your typical Head and Shoulder shampoo with the added conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a conditioner, but my hair does seem to have less snarls and stayed combed.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans well, is not drying, and left my hair thick and fluffy.</li>
            <li> He is of the mindset that they are too harsh for his hair, which is beginning to thin because of old age.  </li>
            <li> So having both a dandruff shampoo and the hope of thickening what little hair he has was a wonder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very thick and creamy white liquid.</li>
            <li> I stopped using Head and Shoulders products years ago because the beauticians convinced me it was too harsh to use on my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for the past few days now</li>
            <li> He, unlike me, has always had thick, dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, he works outside and New England winters are brutal.</li>
            <li> No more dryness or flakes.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it rinses out of my hair without leaving it feeling sticky, slick or cruddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve used head &amp; shoulders in the past you know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I usually wash it every day when I take a shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t had dandruff in years!</li>
            <li> but im lazy</li>
            <li> His hair is a dark medium brown, and was randomly turning blonde in spots getting so thin</li>
            <li> even used it once because I ran out of my shampoo and forgot about it until it was too late.</li>
            <li> I agree with what it says on the bottle that the shampoo should be used at least twice a week for dandruff control.  </li>
            <li> And for now, he has thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have used other products for my thinning hair and had to purchase them from expensive beauty salons, high-end department stores, or on-line shops.  </li>

            <li> ; which is a little silly.</li>
            <li> My one complaint with the product is do not get this shampoo in your eyes!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed the hair growing in where I was developing a thin patch.</li>
            <li> I figure then the scent is manly, but it’s very subtle to me.</li>

            <li> Easy transaction ! great seller , fast shipping. will definitely do business with again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my son and husband LOVE this shampoo. finally bought something they both like and agree on!! smells and works great on both of their hair types... thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Very cheap, effective, I like it</li>
            <li> Great item for a great price.  Love the convenience of having Shampoo and Conditioner in one bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this, and he&#x27;s never had dandruff so there&#x27;s that. Also, he works outside and New England winters are brutal. I think this helps keep his scalp from getting super dry.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. What more is there to say...</li>
            <li> I love H&amp;S, I never tried the men version until now. In stores it&#x27;s expensive but I got a great deal here.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my hubby. His scalp used to be so dry and flakey. Since using this  shampoo, his scalp is now healthier than ever. No more dryness or flakes.  Plus it makes his hair smell amazing.  Definitely give it 2 thumbs up! We will continue to buy this shampoo. Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Best there is for dandruff!</li>
            <li> Son loves this shampoo; it does everything it claims to do.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I got when they on sale! It was great! I recommend!</li>
            <li> My oldest son was having an issue with dandruff. That is until we used the Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner. He now doesn&#x27;t have to worry about dandruff and his hair is soft. You can see a big difference in how his hair looks compared to the previous shampoo he was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used it once because I ran out of my shampoo and forgot about it until it was too late. I have to say I was tempted to get some for myself! This is a really great shampoo/conditioner that does the job. I definitely want to stock up.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine for my thinning (getting old) hair. Nothing too exciting here. The bottle itself is decently sized (many drugstore products have been downsizing in my experience) and easy to grip in the shower.</li>
            <li> no snow on the mountains</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I was offered from Amazon Vine the Head and Shoulders Extra Volume 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner ([[ASIN:B00FIZGLAA Head and Shoulders Extra Volume 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 14.2 Fl Oz]]).  I stopped using Head and Shoulders products years ago because the beauticians convinced me it was too harsh to use on my thinning hair.  I suffer from Male Pattern Baldness (MPB).  The Head and Shoulders Extra Volume 2-in-1 is an advanced formula that cleans and conditions my hair, leaving it feeling soft; it actually gives my hair the appearance of being thicker.  It lathers surprisingly well for a 2-In-1 shampoo + conditioner.  Most of them don&#x27;t.  I love the masculine scent.  Furthermore, it rinses out of my hair without leaving it feeling sticky, slick or cruddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I told my 80-year old dad about the new line of Head and Shoulders 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners, but he wasn&#x27;t interested.  He is of the mindset that they are too harsh for his hair, which is beginning to thin because of old age.  He, unlike me, has always had thick, dark hair.  I, unfortunately, took after my mom&#x27;s side of the family.  No one ever became bald but they got pretty close.  Amazon Vine offered me the opportunity to review the Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner ([[ASIN:B00GD854L8 Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 14.2 Fl Oz]]).  I tried the Full &amp; Thick for a few weeks and it worked the same as the Extra Volume.  Both smell great, lather well, and rinse out easily without leaving a residue.  Most importantly, my hair is left thick, manageable and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Recently, I traveled home to see Dad because he had emergency surgery.  One of the discs in his lower back ruptured, hit a nerve and paralyzed him.  He is fine now.  I took him some items to cheer him up and one was this Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner.  Mom bathed him and promised me she would use the Full &amp; Thick on his hair.  Dad was very pleased with it, mostly because it lathered well.  He didn&#x27;t like the Axe Shampoo + Conditioner I had bought him for Christmas because it wouldn&#x27;t lather.  He also complained that the Axe shower gel left a greasy ring around the shower stall.  I just think he&#x27;s getting finicky and crotchety in his old age.  However, he did take a shine to the Full &amp; Thick from Head and Shoulders.  Miracles can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend the entire line of Head and Shoulders 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoos + Conditioners for men, like me, who have thinning hair, whether it is from MPB or old age.  While I was visiting my Dad in Maryville, Tennessee, I rushed out to one of the local grocery stores and bought him the Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner.  Head and Shoulders products can be found everywhere.  I have used other products for my thinning hair and had to purchase them from expensive beauty salons, high-end department stores, or on-line shops.  Also, Head and Shoulders has been around many years, ever since I was a child.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions to their products.  I trust them not to use chemicals that will harm me.  Furthermore, it is very convenient when traveling to carry both shampoo and conditioner in one bottle in lieu of separate ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

            <li> I have been using Head and Shoulder products since my dad introduced them to me as a kid. Not because of the Dandruff quality(although as a kid I probably needed it) but because of the smell and fullness that it made his hair feel like. I was very excited to be trying any Head and Shoulder product and this one did not disappoint. Made my hair smell fantastic and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I wish I could give a higher rating to, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t due to ethical factors. I don&#x27;t have dandruff as a rule, but I do have moments where I get dry spots on my scalp, and a dandruff shampoo can be extremely effective in clearing those spots up. Now, this is a vastly improved Head and Shoulders. The shampoo of 30 or 40 years ago was ghastly. Using it was more like pouring medicine on your head. This shampoo has a really pleasant smell. It also claims to thicken thinning hair. I find such claims to be nothing but bunk, pure snake oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I really do believe that our products need to be embedded in a system of morality, and on that score this product fails abysmally. Head and Shoulders is owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, and it is the practice of P&amp;G to test shampoos and other products by placing it directly onto the eyes of rabbits. The company has been the target of several animal rights groups for its policy, and while I am not a member of PETA or any similar group, I agree completely with their targeting Proctor &amp; Gamble for criticism. At this stage in our civilization there is no excuse for testing soaps and shampoos on animals. If the company did not test on animals - and there are a large number of companies that do not (Google the Internet for lists of companies that do not test on animals - when possible I try to buy things at The Body Shop because they are adamant in their no testing on animals policies). If Head and Shoulders did not test on animals, I would bump this product to a 4.</li>
            <li> It is your typical Head and Shoulder shampoo with the added conditioner.  The scent is better as it is more subtle.  It feels smoother while under the shower but takes more rinsing to finish it off.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff but sometimes some shampoo gives me an itch after drying off.  The H&amp;S feels like a soothing oatmeal treatment on your head.</li>
            <li> This shampoo dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> In the summer I tend to get some flakes on my scalp from the heat and dry air.I have used Head and Shoulders for many years.Its always taken care of the light dandruff I get.This type has conditioner already in it and works just as well as always.I have used for a week or so and its done a great job getting rid of the dandruff.One thing I really like is it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical odor to it.It has a more tolerable scent now.This product has worked well for me and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was sent an older bottle of the Head and Shoulder shampoo 2 and 1 so I am not able to comment on the new update to the line. My version was simply the original Head and Shoulder so the scent was basic and uncomplicated. I have been using the shampoo for the past few days now and I have found it to wash out easily after application with little residue or frustration. My one complaint with the product is do not get this shampoo in your eyes! If I wasn&#x27;t such a manly man I would have literally sat down in the bath tub and had a little cry due to the burning sensation, but I persevered and gave it a good wash nevertheless. Overall, Head and Shoulders have provided a good product over the years that brings about a good wash with little effort. I do not suffer with flakes or dandruff so I cannot comment on the products ability to enact change on my scalp condition. I am reviewing this product solely as a 2 and 1 shampoo and conditioner and I find it to do a very good job.</li>
            <li> What could be more manly than a shampoo/conditioner combo?  Anyway, I have very fine, thinning hair and avoid daily shampooing.  This does seem to add body and I find my hair easier to manage afterwards.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Head &amp; Shoulders&#x27; product adds a couple of new features to their standard dandruff shampoo with the inclusions of volumizing effects (hence the &#x27;full &amp; thick&#x27;) and conditioner making this a great, all purpose all in one hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used head &amp; shoulders in the past you know what to expect. The active ingredient for dandruff control is a gentle 1% pyrithione zinc. This being a &#x27;men&#x27;s&#x27; formulated product there is the inclusion of a &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent reminiscent of your standard, mass marketed fragrances (eg - &#x27;Axe&#x27;). The &#x27;full &amp; thick&#x27; feature really does work on my short/medium length hair really giving it a fuller appearance with enhanced vitality (the effects are even more pronounced if blow-drying is used).</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice with a new shampoo is the smell and the latest Head and Shoulders product may have the best scent that has ever come out of a shampoo bottle. It is soft, not overpowering, and soothing. The label claims new fresh scent technology and whatever they did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best smelling shampoo does not matter if it does not work. Thankfully this shampoo works almost as well as it smells. My hair does feel fuller after using this though I have used others that made it feel fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2 in 1 shampoo offers 7 benefits, granted one is &amp;#34;leaves hair looking awesome&amp;#34; which is a little silly. Great scent and fights dryness are two others which are as advertised. The other four are tied to dandruff: removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation, and reduces redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it interesting reading the instructions that it suggests using this after every time you shampoo which seems to defeat the purpose of buying a 2 in 1. My only other minor complaint is that this shampoo is prone to getting in my eyes at a significantly higher rate. It seems to be a bit more watery than other shampoos I have used so I wonder if that is the cause. Otherwise this is a really good 2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner.</li>
            <li> Have to admit my hair is thinning and have I&#x27;ve recently developed  dandruff . Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo does what it purports to do. My scalp feels cleaner . My hair has more body.  I&#x27;m happy I chose this item . It&#x27;s reasonably priced, however must be purchased as part of a qualifying order as an add on to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to save time in applying shampoo and conditioner separately.  It also seems very effective in stopping dandruff.  A little goes a long way and I would certainly purchase again to kill two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand of shampoos and conditions. It does what it says it will do. I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem but with this product you are covered. I love the way my hair feels when I get finished washing it. Clean. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> OK.  4 stars because I like it.  What am I comparing it with?  Bar soap and generic dandruff shampoo from Wallys.  I am cheap.  I don&#x27;t mess around much with my hair.  I usually wash it every day when I take a shower.  I have very curly but short hair and it is getting thinner.  Those cheap products do sometimes leave me scratching my head a couple of hours later.  No dandruff, but it does itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of that with this one. I have never used a conditioner, but my hair does seem to have less snarls and stayed combed.  When using, my scalp did tangle so it must be doing something.  Afterward, it seemed a bit harder to rinse off my skin where it had run down from my head. But remember, I am comparing it with cheap bar soap.  Important to me, it did NOT seem to leave any aroma, perfume, or smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulders Men&#x27;s Shampoo + Conditioner has a mild pleasant scent.  It cleans and conditions my hair very well, and helps alleviate the dryness in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulders shampoo for dry, itchy scalp for years, and after several uses this seems to work just as well, and is perfect for my last-minute morning showers where saving even just a couple minutes by not having to use conditioner -- which involves an extra rinse and application -- is a life-saver. The conditioner seems to work rather well for a 2-in-one-type shampoo. It also has a nice, fresh scent, which is different from normal Head and Shoulders. The only negative I can think of is that it really burns when it gets in your eyes, but this is true for most dandruff/dry scalp shampoos. It just seems to get in my eyes more often. Another reviewer mentioned it being more watery, which may explain this. Overall, though, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dandruff since I met him many, many years ago. And now he doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair to wash either. So having both a dandruff shampoo and the hope of thickening what little hair he has was a wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that it did much to thicken his hair but that is probably not the fault of the shampoo. It only has so much to work with. It would be like me thinking that the right amount of make-up could make me look like a super model. It will never happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders has been a standard for dandruff control in our house for quite awhile and it seems that my son also has need of it. And for now, he has thick hair. So this has done better for him.</li>
            <li> What a great product! The scent is nice and light, not medicinal, and thankfully not girly! The shampoo is thick and does a great job of cleaning hair and relieving itching and flakes. This is a LARGE bottle of shampoo and a better price than at the local big box store. The cap is easy to flip open, a real plus when handling a bottle this size with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders makes a great line of dandruff shampoos.  We&#x27;ve tried some store brand 2-in-1 dandruff shampoos to see if we could save a little money, but they really don&#x27;t work as well and we&#x27;re always happy to go back to our tried and true, Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works well and smells clean and fresh.  The bottle top is easy to open when wet and doesn&#x27;t tip over in the shower.  And this really takes care of our itchy scalps.</li>
            <li> Good smell. Leaves hair feeling clean. After about a month of use, hair actually does feel fuller. Would use again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! This is a newer version of hair endurance.  It cleans well and works good to. Shampoo &amp; conditioner is a plus.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and he tells me that the Full and Thick 2 in 1 Head and Shoulders have a nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger after a shower.  He didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable thickening of his thinning hair but it works well for dandruff and gets his hair clean.  He has used Head and Shoulders for years and likes this version as well as the ones he has used in the past though he likes the fragrance better in this version.</li>
            <li> Hair feels squeaky clean and full, and it works as advertised for calming down any dandruff. It does not contain any natural ingredients (nor does it claim to), so if that is important to you, stay away from this shampoo. It definitely has a soapy scent, so if you don&#x27;t like your head to smell like detergent, stay away from this shampoo. Otherwise, since you are reading this review, I suspect this might be just the shampoo you have been looking for.</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner works well to control dandruff, which is my main concern. I like the mild scent and the conditioner does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am very brand loyal to Head and Shoulders. But this is the first time that i tried their Men&#x27;s Full &amp; Thick Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner product. And I was not disappointed. Without having the heavy medicine smell of many competitor brand dandruff shampoos, Head and shoulders provides a very nice lather, clean feel, and nice results regarding dry scalp. I have been using this product for about a month now and don&#x27;t see changing back to the regular Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is doing well for me.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Men Full &amp; Thick 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 14.2 Fl Oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a combo shampoo and conditioner and apparently for men. I figure then the scent is manly, but it’s very subtle to me. It certainly isn’t floral or fruity so manly, it is. It is a very thick and creamy white liquid. The bottle is plastic and squeezable so it won’t break. You don’t want to drop it as your toes won’t be happy if they get clunked by the bottle. It lathered up well and did a good job cleaning. My hair felt nice and clean like after a shampoo, what else? Since it’s a combo you save one step in your shower regimen. This is a long standing brand and a quality product. I’m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo I use... Smells great and really work to get rid of that minor case of dandruff. I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t had dandruff in years!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 30 year old boyfriend who is very subconious about going bald. His hair is a dark medium brown, and was randomly turning blonde in spots getting so thin it looked like he had no hair there. He refuseed to use products like Rogain because of the up keep and chemicals. He has been using Full &amp; Thick for 2 weeks now. The spots that were blonde are starting to get a little darker to match his normal hair color and the hair itself is also getting thicker. I can tell a difference, we will continue to buy this product he is so much more confident!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this! it works very well!! will definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li> I have always had great experiences with Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoos.  I agree with what it says on the bottle that the shampoo should be used at least twice a week for dandruff control.  It also says you can use it more, but the use of this product really depends on how much dandruff one has.  I guess what is also implied here is that it is ok to use another shampoo more than this one and just use this if one experiences dandruff.  This is the first Head &amp; Shoulders product that specifically states it is for men that I have tried.  I really don’t think there is anything drastically masculine about it, the shampoo is a mint green and has fresh, mint-like scent.  But I guess another way to look at it, this shampoo really has nothing feminine about it as well.  It works great and really leaves my hair feeling clean.  I also know that using this shampoo is great for reducing and eliminating dandruff.</li>
            <li> This product says it is for men but I admit, I am using it! I LOVE the smell of this product. It has an earthy, woodsy scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine like other H&amp;S products. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I have noticed the hair growing in where I was developing a thin patch.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Keeps my hair dandruff free for me at least. Its a 2 in 1. Not the same as using separate conditioner but im lazy so its fine.</li>
            <li> My son really likes the Head and Shoulders for Men line and although I am a woman, I like to use it as well although I have another preferred shampoo. But anyway, when I saw this 2-in-1 item, I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, my son really likes it and has already told me, &amp;#34;Get this one again.&amp;#34; He likes that it isn&#x27;t overly fragranced. He doesn&#x27;t have too much of a dandruff issue but he prefers the Head and Shoulders line because he can go a few days without washing his hair (as long as it is non-workout days) whereas with other shampoos, he has to shampoo more frequently. He likes this 2-in-1 because he did notice the feel of his hair once it dries is smoother and doesn&#x27;t look as flyaway as the shampoo only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I liked it because even though I am a woman, it was still gentle on my hair when I did use it. Like my son, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to shampoo as frequently as my hair remained more presentable for at least a day more. Because I am older, my hair is starting thin and be more brittle, but this 2-in-1 did make the hair look thicker and healthier. Not younger looking hair, but definitely healthier looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be a little pricier than some other shampoos (although a quick glance at Amazon&#x27;s price is very reasonable to me), but we will definitely be putting it on the shopping list because my household likes it.</li>
            <li> A high quality shampoo. For someone with dandruff problems all my life, using this product has really changed my life. It really does work. And you only have to use it a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the shampoo itself is different from other ones, and the after result is more refreshing than the other products, leaving a long lasting scent of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> This shampoo had a pleasant, almost herbal scent and an appealing, slightly green color.  I didn&#x27;t find anything about it that would make it more suitable for men -- it smelled nice but not particularly &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;  The shampoo cleans well, is not drying, and left my hair thick and fluffy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice fragrance. Like other Head and Shoulders shampoos, this lathers up well and rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;My husband used this shampoo and it dried out his hair and the added conditioner didn’t really seem to condition his hair.Adding conditioner to shampoo never really made sense to me anyway. The conditioner just gets washed out.  Would you shampoo your hair after applying conditioner?  No, because you would need to condition your hair again. Well, mixing them together just seems useless.&lt;br /&gt;The product description says: “Full &amp; Thick Shampoo cleans to restore fullness to thinning hair from the first wash”. The first wash? Really? That is a pretty bold claim. My husband has thinning hair and this shampoo really didn’t make any difference in fullness.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good dandruff shampoo. If it makes your hair ”fuller” then great, but don’t get your hopes up too high.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hubby got it for a very cheap price!</li>
