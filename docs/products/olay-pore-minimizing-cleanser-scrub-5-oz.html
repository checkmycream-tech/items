            <li>I use this with a light exfoliating sponge every morning and skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>that said, this cleanser + scrub combo is amazing.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing dirt and makeup and my skin now feels so smooth and touchable.</li>
            <li>This is a nice face cleanser for the money but does not minimize your pores.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel SO nice after I&#x27;m done washing it.</li>
            <li>It has some kind of spring inside it.</li>
            <li>this product works fast and great!</li>
            <li>Nothing else makes my face feel so clean and initially it greatly improved my acne.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and clean!</li>
            <li>I have mild acne on oil/combination skin - (indian skin) and this helps clean my face perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I have used many face washes searching for the perfect one and this is by far that absolute best.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facewash, the price was great, and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>Its mild, pleasant, and works well.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Then I found Olay pore minimizing scrub - love it.</li>
            <li>The real benefit is that it smells great.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the price.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>More info: http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/19/3659921/tiny-plastic-microbeads-getting-banned-in-numerous-states/</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love how Olay has packaged this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was doing some online research and found this cleanser to be on the top five cleansers list</li>
            <li>I have been using this product about a year ago, I really do love it, every morning I use this product.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite exfoliating cleanser for years.</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE the smell of the wash.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li>It has complemented my daily beauty regimen perfectly.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it a Costco over a year ago, and really liked it, but no longer at Costco, so looking for it and then saw here -</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>The new cells look, well, newer (lol) and better as well.</li>
            <li>The cleanser smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first found this product, I loved it.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild, pleasant scent and pretty color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It rinses very easily, leaving your face feeling really clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling so clean!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean all day!</li>
            <li>It has a crisp clean smell, it lathers up so nice and my face feels amazing after use.  </li>
            <li>people with normal/unreactive skin, this seems like a great product; however, I would caution those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works very nicely for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for something easy to use, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of facial cleansers but this does exactly what I want and for a great price!</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>The smell and gritty texture is great, does it work?  </li>
            <li>I always use a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>When this became available on Amazon, I started using it again and broke out.</li>
            <li>So happy they brought this product back!</li>
            <li>I saw almost instant results and would recommend it to anyone trying to reduce the appearance of their pores or just a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li>But I feel like it is very strong and makes my skin more sensitive.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very fresh and clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t seen any significant progress in minimizing my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>products leave me with a rash or my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>Always makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>After months of use, it still made my face feel clean, but my acne had worsened, even with washing my face</li>
            <li>Smell is light and refreshing, exfoliating grit is gentle but affective.</li>
            <li>This is all I use to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>This stuff seems to brighten my skin and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li>There are microbeads that fell nice and not harsh.</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as much as she is.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and think that it works better with the scrubber than without</li>
            <li>I now have about 10 pimples at a time, and my cheeks and chin are FULL of blackheads.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I called Olay and the customer service reps were very helpful, allowing me to exchange this product for something better suited for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I never stop using it, since I started using it.</li>
            <li>but today, you can&#x27;t really see MOST pores on my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the scrubby bits in it - a gentle dermabrasion every day.</li>
            <li>It has a light floral-apple smell and just the right amount of exfoliating beads.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the replaced package came in god condition.</li>
            <li>My face stays clean much longer and my pores look smaller, The face wash smells nice too!</li>
            <li>Some have complained about the fragrance, but I think it&#x27;s very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I would say that I saw an instant difference in my skin after using this product and although I was very pleased, I soon realized that there were some undeniable side effects.</li>
            <li>(he&#x27;s very picky and cautious about skin products because he breaks out easily).  </li>
            <li>I constantly have so many pimples, and blackheads EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and leave a smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it really minimizes pores at all, but it&#x27;s a good daily cleanser</li>
            <li>So I was hoping that this \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; product would have better results and clear up my pimples/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for about 2 weeks so far, and it seems okay.</li>
            <li>None of that is worth poisoning the water supply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, fits into a normal skin care regimen and inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li>shipped super fast as well!</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and love it!!  </li>
            <li>The dispenser pumps out just the right amount each time.</li>
            <li>They should stop that practice right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser, something that would be gentle on my skin, but also clean the gunk that builds up from working outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if any one else has experienced this</li>
            <li>It is equally effective for young and not so young ladies!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores anymore, so I started using clean and clear products and while I don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling from them, my acne is virtually gone.</li>
            <li>It is far gentler than my old scrub, has rounded micro beads that really do a nice job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, and I find it&#x27;s perfect for the complexion that still randomly gets a pimple every now and again.</li>
            <li>The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that water would some how inter through the top and be inside the pump and that grossed me out.</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to this facewash when it was being sold at costco.  </li>
            <li>and I can attest her skin as baby smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It really does shrink your pores!</li>
            <li>you only need to use a small amount each time which is great!</li>
            <li>I am so glad they brought it back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as environmentally aware as I probably should be - but</li>
            <li>At first I was in denial because it was working so well but after</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and my skin is under control for the first time since I became a teenager.</li>
            <li>Part of good skin care is exfoliation, removing the layer of dead skin cells to increase cell replacement.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face so good, gets rid of this Afghanistan dirt and dust, without being harsh as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>My skin not only feels clean, but it looks clean afterward.</li>
            <li>The plastic bottle might easily get unattached from its top, once I let it fall and wasted some.</li>
            <li>and I finally have significant pore minimizing results!</li>
            <li>It most definitely helps reduce that, and leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>It has just enough scrub to exfoliate and keep pimples at bay, and the foam leaves my face super clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser because it does exfoliate, but it is still gentle enough for me to use both morning and night!</li>
            <li>It is a light scrub, very small yet effective granules in it.</li>
            <li>I have used Olay&#x27;s dual-Action Cleanser + Toner in the past which I loved (used it for 4 years)</li>
            <li>These products are okay in terms of my overall skin and breakouts, but didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>u will definitely feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many different kinds of acne soaps but this one is by far my fav!!</li>
            <li>I really like Olay products, and after reading other reviews, I thought this would be a great daily</li>
            <li>I usually use a really cheap, off brand apricot scrub and it does ok, but I still break out a bit.</li>
            <li>It did minimize my large pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that large pores are genetic.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin and have reactions to many facial products.  </li>
            <li>The smell is clean but not overwhelming, so if you have issues with perfumed products, this should be okay.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement with my larger pores around my nose.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates daily and makes my skin smooth, have been using this for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliation is gentle and it does have a pore minimizing effect as it claims.</li>
            <li>She enjoys this product as it is gentle on her skin yet cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>I use this product every day and really do like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to try to find this product.</li>
            <li>I switch face wash a lot, i never can find one that i really really like.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and soft after I use this.  </li>
            <li>As many of you have done, I have spent a lot of money on products for my face.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my pores, but after using it my face feels really clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very acne prone.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend who has REALLY oily skin has used this as well and really like it</li>
            <li>but I continue to buy this because it is at least as good</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with very nice skin with the occasional blemish (I&#x27;m 37 y/o white female).  </li>
            <li>This product has more exfoliating beads than other brands I&#x27;ve tried and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Deep Action Cream Cleanser, 6.5 Ounce  (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B002BWPXFW Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Cleansing Mask, 4 Ounce (Pack of 3)]], [[ASIN:B004DJRJ1W Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Skin Brightening Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce]], among others.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also my favorite over the other Olay cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When I got it I was so excited to open it</li>
            <li>I got this product originally because I needed facial wash</li>
            <li>This is a great product, gentle enough to use daily and won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It smelled particularly clean, but definitely had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, Doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, Skin feels soft immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily exfoliator because it has a little bit of grain to it, but isn&#x27;t as coarse as St Ives apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job washing off my eyeliner, mascara and concealer with out making my face to tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>The little beads are like fine sand grains and its gentle on your face.</li>
            <li>Finding the right cleanser has been a big challenge for me.  </li>
            <li>Third, the protective cap on its container can be flipped off with only one hand free.</li>
            <li>it was always hard to find good products to keep my face clean with speding hours cleaning my face everyday!</li>
            <li>First, it actually works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I got this pretty much only because I needed to spend $10 on something to get an Olay rebate, but I do sort of like the product.  </li>
            <li>The pump dispenses the cleanser in a way that shows you how much you have left and doesn&#x27;t go fast which happens a lot with the clear dispensing products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(oh yeah I have combination skin) and most of all no more breakeouts for me.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive oily skin</li>
            <li>I love this product for at least three reasons.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line.....if you have sensitive skin or dry/combo skin and don&#x27;t moisturize after cleansing, you probably don&#x27;t want to use this.</li>
            <li>plus there is no waste with the pump</li>
            <li>Olay is the closest by far.</li>
            <li>HAVE SOFT SKIN AROUND BY NOSE</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I only use it twice a week and have much clearer skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every product under the sun for my face.  </li>
            <li>A bottle lasts me at least 2 months or more.</li>
            <li>Second, it is entirely free of the skin-irritating, sharp-edged and oversized particles found in some other products.  </li>
            <li>I ended up salvaging a lot of it, but it was really messy to clean up.</li>
            <li>The few times I&#x27;ve run out or used something else, I notice immediately that my skin is not as clean as when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use it during the shower everyday and it keeps my face clean and after a few weeks using it every day my pores look clean and not opened...</li>
            <li>She follows up using regular classic Olay</li>
            <li>I usually follow-up with a light layer of moisturizer to feel completely refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stop using it, I hope my face goes back to normal soon.</li>
            <li>I would notice when I used my toner afterwards that I would be left with such a large amount of make-up and the like on my cotton</li>
            <li>This product has one major, unacceptable, fatal flaw: microbeads.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>face feels really clean after I used it, sure, but it&#x27;s making me break out so badly.</li>
            <li>The result is a heavy cleaner with just enough abrasive power to clean without harming your face.</li>
            <li>This scrub is really above the quality so far your surprise is not only unexpected but it isn&#x27;t a reaction you would dream coming from anything that costs under $12.00.</li>
            <li>I wash my face twice a day and used this product on my nose (3 scrubs total so far).  </li>
            <li>As a side note it really annoys me when Amazon or Amazon sellers edit out other brands mentioned in reviews.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser is a great pump that has a wide base and large pump head, so it can be operated one</li>
            <li>I always wash my face at least twice, once to remove make-up, dirt and oil, and then a second time to get that really clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>But i bought these last year and use it every other day and still have one whole bottle left.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available on Amazon, at least for now!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to make a drastic product change and have my sensitive, extremely dry skin suffer!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> that said, this cleanser + scrub combo is amazing.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of removing dirt and makeup and my skin now feels so smooth and touchable.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face cleanser for the money but does not minimize your pores.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel SO nice after I&#x27;m done washing it.</li>
            <li> It has some kind of spring inside it.</li>
            <li> this product works fast and great!</li>
            <li> Nothing else makes my face feel so clean and initially it greatly improved my acne.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and clean!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne on oil/combination skin - (indian skin) and this helps clean my face perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I have used many face washes searching for the perfect one and this is by far that absolute best.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facewash, the price was great, and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> Its mild, pleasant, and works well.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Then I found Olay pore minimizing scrub - love it.</li>
            <li> The real benefit is that it smells great.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the price.  </li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> More info: http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/19/3659921/tiny-plastic-microbeads-getting-banned-in-numerous-states/</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love how Olay has packaged this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was doing some online research and found this cleanser to be on the top five cleansers list</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about a year ago, I really do love it, every morning I use this product.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite exfoliating cleanser for years.</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE the smell of the wash.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li> It has complemented my daily beauty regimen perfectly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it a Costco over a year ago, and really liked it, but no longer at Costco, so looking for it and then saw here -</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> The new cells look, well, newer (lol) and better as well.</li>
            <li> The cleanser smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first found this product, I loved it.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild, pleasant scent and pretty color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It rinses very easily, leaving your face feeling really clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling so clean!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean all day!</li>
            <li> It has a crisp clean smell, it lathers up so nice and my face feels amazing after use.  </li>
            <li> people with normal/unreactive skin, this seems like a great product; however, I would caution those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for something easy to use, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of facial cleansers but this does exactly what I want and for a great price!</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> The smell and gritty texture is great, does it work?  </li>
            <li> I always use a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> When this became available on Amazon, I started using it again and broke out.</li>
            <li> So happy they brought this product back!</li>
            <li> I saw almost instant results and would recommend it to anyone trying to reduce the appearance of their pores or just a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> But I feel like it is very strong and makes my skin more sensitive.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very fresh and clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t seen any significant progress in minimizing my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> products leave me with a rash or my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> Always makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> After months of use, it still made my face feel clean, but my acne had worsened, even with washing my face</li>
            <li> Smell is light and refreshing, exfoliating grit is gentle but affective.</li>
            <li> This is all I use to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> This stuff seems to brighten my skin and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li> There are microbeads that fell nice and not harsh.</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as much as she is.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and think that it works better with the scrubber than without</li>
            <li> I now have about 10 pimples at a time, and my cheeks and chin are FULL of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I called Olay and the customer service reps were very helpful, allowing me to exchange this product for something better suited for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I never stop using it, since I started using it.</li>
            <li> but today, you can&#x27;t really see MOST pores on my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the scrubby bits in it - a gentle dermabrasion every day.</li>
            <li> It has a light floral-apple smell and just the right amount of exfoliating beads.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the replaced package came in god condition.</li>
            <li> My face stays clean much longer and my pores look smaller, The face wash smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the fragrance, but I think it&#x27;s very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I would say that I saw an instant difference in my skin after using this product and although I was very pleased, I soon realized that there were some undeniable side effects.</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s very picky and cautious about skin products because he breaks out easily).  </li>
            <li> I constantly have so many pimples, and blackheads EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates and leave a smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it really minimizes pores at all, but it&#x27;s a good daily cleanser</li>
            <li> So I was hoping that this \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; product would have better results and clear up my pimples/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for about 2 weeks so far, and it seems okay.</li>
            <li> None of that is worth poisoning the water supply.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, fits into a normal skin care regimen and inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> shipped super fast as well!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and love it!!  </li>
            <li> The dispenser pumps out just the right amount each time.</li>
            <li> They should stop that practice right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser, something that would be gentle on my skin, but also clean the gunk that builds up from working outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if any one else has experienced this</li>
            <li> It is equally effective for young and not so young ladies!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores anymore, so I started using clean and clear products and while I don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling from them, my acne is virtually gone.</li>
            <li> It is far gentler than my old scrub, has rounded micro beads that really do a nice job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, and I find it&#x27;s perfect for the complexion that still randomly gets a pimple every now and again.</li>
            <li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that water would some how inter through the top and be inside the pump and that grossed me out.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to this facewash when it was being sold at costco.  </li>
            <li> and I can attest her skin as baby smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It really does shrink your pores!</li>
            <li> you only need to use a small amount each time which is great!</li>
            <li> I am so glad they brought it back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as environmentally aware as I probably should be - but</li>
            <li> At first I was in denial because it was working so well but after</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and my skin is under control for the first time since I became a teenager.</li>
            <li> Part of good skin care is exfoliation, removing the layer of dead skin cells to increase cell replacement.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face so good, gets rid of this Afghanistan dirt and dust, without being harsh as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> My skin not only feels clean, but it looks clean afterward.</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle might easily get unattached from its top, once I let it fall and wasted some.</li>
            <li> and I finally have significant pore minimizing results!</li>
            <li> It most definitely helps reduce that, and leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> It has just enough scrub to exfoliate and keep pimples at bay, and the foam leaves my face super clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it does exfoliate, but it is still gentle enough for me to use both morning and night!</li>
            <li> It is a light scrub, very small yet effective granules in it.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay&#x27;s dual-Action Cleanser + Toner in the past which I loved (used it for 4 years)</li>
            <li> These products are okay in terms of my overall skin and breakouts, but didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> u will definitely feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many different kinds of acne soaps but this one is by far my fav!!</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products, and after reading other reviews, I thought this would be a great daily</li>
            <li> I usually use a really cheap, off brand apricot scrub and it does ok, but I still break out a bit.</li>
            <li> It did minimize my large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that large pores are genetic.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin and have reactions to many facial products.  </li>
            <li> The smell is clean but not overwhelming, so if you have issues with perfumed products, this should be okay.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement with my larger pores around my nose.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates daily and makes my skin smooth, have been using this for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliation is gentle and it does have a pore minimizing effect as it claims.</li>
            <li> She enjoys this product as it is gentle on her skin yet cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every day and really do like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like that I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to try to find this product.</li>
            <li> I switch face wash a lot, i never can find one that i really really like.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh and soft after I use this.  </li>
            <li> As many of you have done, I have spent a lot of money on products for my face.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my pores, but after using it my face feels really clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am very acne prone.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend who has REALLY oily skin has used this as well and really like it</li>
            <li> but I continue to buy this because it is at least as good</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with very nice skin with the occasional blemish (I&#x27;m 37 y/o white female).  </li>
            <li> This product has more exfoliating beads than other brands I&#x27;ve tried and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Deep Action Cream Cleanser, 6.5 Ounce  (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B002BWPXFW Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Cleansing Mask, 4 Ounce (Pack of 3)]], [[ASIN:B004DJRJ1W Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Skin Brightening Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce]], among others.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also my favorite over the other Olay cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When I got it I was so excited to open it</li>
            <li> I got this product originally because I needed facial wash</li>
            <li> This is a great product, gentle enough to use daily and won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It smelled particularly clean, but definitely had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, Doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, Skin feels soft immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily exfoliator because it has a little bit of grain to it, but isn&#x27;t as coarse as St Ives apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job washing off my eyeliner, mascara and concealer with out making my face to tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> The little beads are like fine sand grains and its gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> Finding the right cleanser has been a big challenge for me.  </li>
            <li> Third, the protective cap on its container can be flipped off with only one hand free.</li>
            <li> it was always hard to find good products to keep my face clean with speding hours cleaning my face everyday!</li>
            <li> First, it actually works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I got this pretty much only because I needed to spend $10 on something to get an Olay rebate, but I do sort of like the product.  </li>
            <li> The pump dispenses the cleanser in a way that shows you how much you have left and doesn&#x27;t go fast which happens a lot with the clear dispensing products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (oh yeah I have combination skin) and most of all no more breakeouts for me.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive oily skin</li>
            <li> I love this product for at least three reasons.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line.....if you have sensitive skin or dry/combo skin and don&#x27;t moisturize after cleansing, you probably don&#x27;t want to use this.</li>
            <li> plus there is no waste with the pump</li>
            <li> Olay is the closest by far.</li>
            <li> HAVE SOFT SKIN AROUND BY NOSE</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week and have much clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every product under the sun for my face.  </li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me at least 2 months or more.</li>
            <li> Second, it is entirely free of the skin-irritating, sharp-edged and oversized particles found in some other products.  </li>
            <li> I ended up salvaging a lot of it, but it was really messy to clean up.</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve run out or used something else, I notice immediately that my skin is not as clean as when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use it during the shower everyday and it keeps my face clean and after a few weeks using it every day my pores look clean and not opened...</li>
            <li> She follows up using regular classic Olay</li>
            <li> I usually follow-up with a light layer of moisturizer to feel completely refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stop using it, I hope my face goes back to normal soon.</li>
            <li> I would notice when I used my toner afterwards that I would be left with such a large amount of make-up and the like on my cotton</li>
            <li> This product has one major, unacceptable, fatal flaw: microbeads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> face feels really clean after I used it, sure, but it&#x27;s making me break out so badly.</li>
            <li> The result is a heavy cleaner with just enough abrasive power to clean without harming your face.</li>
            <li> This scrub is really above the quality so far your surprise is not only unexpected but it isn&#x27;t a reaction you would dream coming from anything that costs under $12.00.</li>
            <li> I wash my face twice a day and used this product on my nose (3 scrubs total so far).  </li>
            <li> As a side note it really annoys me when Amazon or Amazon sellers edit out other brands mentioned in reviews.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser is a great pump that has a wide base and large pump head, so it can be operated one</li>
            <li> I always wash my face at least twice, once to remove make-up, dirt and oil, and then a second time to get that really clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> But i bought these last year and use it every other day and still have one whole bottle left.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still available on Amazon, at least for now!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to make a drastic product change and have my sensitive, extremely dry skin suffer!</li>
            <li> to how sensitive my skin tends to be, I have NOT used this product on my face anywhere other than the nose.  </li>
            <li> I typically have a slightly pink and somewhat blotchy nose, so I don&#x27;t help the situation much by applying foundation and concealer all over my nose every day.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates, cleanses and does really minimize your pores which believe it or not; most product that are \\&quot;pore minimizing,\\&quot; don&#x27;t minimize at all.</li>
            <li> Ordinarily, my pores are very visible even under my makeup</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I can only use this cleaner a few times a week unless I want red bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually  dry combo type, and I always moisturize daily.</li>
            <li> It does really dry your skin out too, but I always moisturize anyway after I cleanse, so it is not that big of a deal for me.  </li>
            <li> It has exfoliating grit of some sort in it which clearly would help remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin, so it is not easy to find a product to suit my skin.</li>
            <li> (I usually have very clear skin, not prone to breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin really dry after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular one for at least 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores and this product makes a dramatic difference after using on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and am prone to small breakouts in my chin area.</li>
            <li> It smells like pears--no floral perfume smell, just a faint sweet smell of fruit.</li>
            <li> usually buy only Neutrogena products; however, the way my face feels after using this, Olay cleaners will be added to my regimen, especially this one.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> The exfoliate beads aren&#x27;t too rough and seems to help to minimize pores and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Not much fragrance.</li>
            <li> product is a series of green and white layers, which mix when dispensed.</li>
            <li> I have used other products -</li>
            <li> However, until using this product I was washing my face three and four times with other face cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I cannot provide any insight as to its impact on other areas or skin types.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect yet - I still have small spots where pores are still visible - specifically on the sides near the nostrils and around the crack between my nose and my cheeks, but as I said I&#x27;ve only scrubbed 3 times.  </li>
            <li> It does give me a slight &#x27;pulling&#x27; sensation to my skin, I would think that this would be the minimizing of my pores.</li>
            <li> and I use a lot less.</li>
            <li> They took this off the shelves for a year about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have black heads and normally don&#x27;t get them, but I found a couple after using this product, which was weird.</li>
            <li> Morning and night you wet your skin, rub &#x27;Pore Minimizing Cleanser in&#x27; and apply it in small circles.</li>
            <li> and when I did it was a mess.</li>
            <li> I have seen a little bit of an improvement in my skin, and I also like to follow this up once a week with Biore Nose Strips.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it and my face has yet to break into a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about twice a day now for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> few weeks of continuously breaking out I couldn&#x27;t ignore it anymore.</li>
            <li> As I use it the bottom plate or whatever comes up and that way I don&#x27;t waste any of this product.</li>
            <li> It has some grittiness to it but not enough to feel like you are scratching and irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can usually get it on Amazon for about three and a half bucks per bottle.</li>
            <li> When I have tried other washes my face tends to look dull and feel like I am not getting it all off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually have 1 or 2 pimples at a time, and a blackhead or two.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use it because I&#x27;ve run out I notice an increase in small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have oily large pored skin :(.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the &amp;#34;minimizing&amp;#34; pores that they claim, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog or enlarge them at least.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the shelf time at costco was limited.  </li>
            <li> my wife loves this product and it is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have very little, if any residual make-up or anything else for that matter remaining on my cotton  pad after using my toner!  </li>
            <li> Besides, not a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I used this product one week on/one week off for a month to test it out, and ended up with progressively worse breakouts every time I used it</li>
            <li> but unfortunately  it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I got angry</li>
            <li> and I was not happy!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> bad part is the packaging!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is such a great product. I use this at night and in the morning. I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, and I find it&#x27;s perfect for the complexion that still randomly gets a pimple every now and again. It most definitely helps reduce that, and leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me! It made my skin really dry after using this product. So sad!I bought it after reading all reviews, and they said this product is great for skin. But I feel like it is very strong and makes my skin more sensitive.</li>
            <li> The smell and gritty texture is great, does it work?  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  It is cheaper from Amazon than in retail stores.</li>
            <li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that water would some how inter through the top and be inside the pump and that grossed me out. But i bought these last year and use it every other day and still have one whole bottle left. It makes my skin fell GREAT! I will buy it again when mine runs out! Also this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> Exfoliates daily and makes my skin smooth, have been using this for 2 years.  I use this with a light exfoliating sponge every morning and skin feels great.  I have used other products - but I still keep coming back to this product and I have also subscribed and saved every 3 months.  I have mild acne on oil/combination skin - (indian skin) and this helps clean my face perfectly.  There are microbeads that fell nice and not harsh.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  I have been using it for a couple years and have no desire to switch.</li>
            <li> Part of good skin care is exfoliation, removing the layer of dead skin cells to increase cell replacement. The new cells look, well, newer (lol) and better as well. If you&#x27;re already using an exfoliator and you like it stick with it, but if you are looking for something easy to use, this is for you. Morning and night you wet your skin, rub &#x27;Pore Minimizing Cleanser in&#x27; and apply it in small circles. It has exfoliating grit of some sort in it which clearly would help remove dead skin. Easy to use, fits into a normal skin care regimen and inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this product and it is hard to find in stores.  I am very happy with the price and the product.&lt;br /&gt;I should set up subscription.  Hummm.....</li>
            <li> I grabbed this product from one of my local Club Warehouses and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser, something that would be gentle on my skin, but also clean the gunk that builds up from working outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most products leave me with a rash or my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean after use. I do have sensitive oily skin and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and even products designed for skin like mine leave me with rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, this cleanser + scrub combo is amazing. (Plus it smells like granny smith apples!) My skin not only feels clean, but it looks clean afterward. It does give me a slight &#x27;pulling&#x27; sensation to my skin, I would think that this would be the minimizing of my pores. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it and my face has yet to break into a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: December 8&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a month, I haven&#x27;t seen any significant progress in minimizing my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: January 12, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Two months of using this product and I finally have significant pore minimizing results! The pores on my cheeks have shrunk, as have the pores on my nose (no change with my chin and forehead). The change took a while, but I can definitely see the results.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser morning and night for about 2 months and I like it better than other brands I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s also my favorite over the other Olay cleansers I&#x27;ve tried. The exfoliation is gentle and it does have a pore minimizing effect as it claims. It has a very mild, pleasant scent and pretty color. The dispenser pumps out just the right amount each time. When it foams up, it feels good on my face and cleanses well. This is so pleasant to use. The Amazon price is the best I&#x27;ve found so I set up a recurring shipment.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin, so it is not easy to find a product to suit my skin. I have used Olay&#x27;s dual-Action Cleanser + Toner in the past which I loved (used it for 4 years) but unfortunately  it was discontinued. I tried couple of product after but none worked for me. Then I found Olay pore minimizing scrub - love it. My skin feels very fresh and clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> Always makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to this facewash when it was being sold at costco.  Sadly, the shelf time at costco was limited.  It lasts longer than squeeze tubes because I don&#x27;t over pump.  One pump is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn buyers that when I received this item I opened the package to find that the tubes had been damaged in transit and had exploded all over the bag.  It smelled particularly clean, but definitely had to be replaced.  Luckily, the replaced package came in god condition.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and the price had here on Amazon is great using Subscribe and Save.  She enjoys this product as it is gentle on her skin yet cleans very well.  She follows up using regular classic Olay and I can attest her skin as baby smooth and soft.  Give it a try and I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as much as she is.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 months to give it a chance to work. I have not seen any difference in my pores. Not only that, but it made my skin very dry. My skin is usually  dry combo type, and I always moisturize daily. But with this face wash, even with moisturizing daily, my skin was drier than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and really do like it.  The exfoliate beads aren&#x27;t too rough and seems to help to minimize pores and blackheads.  Not much fragrance.</li>
            <li> This face wash works great for my oily skin. It has just enough scrub to exfoliate and keep pimples at bay, and the foam leaves my face super clean with no residue. I always use a light moisturizer so dryness is never an issue. It really does shrink your pores! I have noticed a huge improvement with my larger pores around my nose. I think this is one of the best face washes you can get at a drugstore. I have tried more expensive brands from sephora but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face cleanser for the money but does not minimize your pores. The quality is okay and the price is great.  Doesnt do what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It is far gentler than my old scrub, has rounded micro beads that really do a nice job of exfoliating.  The real benefit is that it smells great.  I have used this now for 2 months and am very satisfied.  Olay products are the way to go as I use their moisturizer daily too.</li>
            <li> I use this with my clarisonic. I really like this product and think that it works better with the scrubber than without and I use a lot less.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily exfoliator because it has a little bit of grain to it, but isn&#x27;t as coarse as St Ives apricot scrub.  I can&#x27;t say that it really minimizes pores at all, but it&#x27;s a good daily cleanser and I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling so clean!  I usually follow-up with a light layer of moisturizer to feel completely refreshed.</li>
            <li> my favorite face wash great price for two. shipped super fast as well!</li>
            <li> Good quantity for the price</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for more than a year. I find it gets the make up off and polishes my skin to perfection.</li>
            <li> I love this product for at least three reasons.  First, it actually works as advertised.  Second, it is entirely free of the skin-irritating, sharp-edged and oversized particles found in some other products.  Third, the protective cap on its container can be flipped off with only one hand free.</li>
            <li> The items came opened and leaking all over. I got angry so i refused to return as i was out of tiwn</li>
            <li> I got this pretty much only because I needed to spend $10 on something to get an Olay rebate, but I do sort of like the product.  I have sensitive skin, so I can only use this cleaner a few times a week unless I want red bumps on my face.  It does really dry your skin out too, but I always moisturize anyway after I cleanse, so it is not that big of a deal for me.  The cleanser smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.....if you have sensitive skin or dry/combo skin and don&#x27;t moisturize after cleansing, you probably don&#x27;t want to use this.</li>
            <li> I have used many face washes searching for the perfect one and this is by far that absolute best. It has sandy particles that exfoliate so no need for a face wash cloth unless you want that extra exfoliated. I recommend to everyone i know. plus there is no waste with the pump it is in and no cap to get open, Just pump and wash.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in pore size without it drying my skin.  It was an excellent bargain getting two products for what one would cost at the store.  I will definately use it again.</li>
            <li> When I first found this product, I loved it. Nothing else makes my face feel so clean and initially it greatly improved my acne. After months of use, it still made my face feel clean, but my acne had worsened, even with washing my face 3+ times a day. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores anymore, so I started using clean and clear products and while I don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling from them, my acne is virtually gone. When this became available on Amazon, I started using it again and broke out. I&#x27;m not sure about this product any longer. Also I never noticed any pore refining results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a year and love it. Smell is light and refreshing, exfoliating grit is gentle but affective. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessarily better than the facial soaps I have used in the past but I continue to buy this because it is at least as good and I can usually get it on Amazon for about three and a half bucks per bottle. Time your purchase to coupon clip and you can&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love the price.  I really like that I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to try to find this product.</li>
            <li> I switch face wash a lot, i never can find one that i really really like. Olay is the closest by far. I have oily large pored skin :(. This product help a great amount with both. My face stays clean much longer and my pores look smaller, The face wash smells nice too! you only need to use a small amount each time which is great! I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh and soft after I use this.  Sometimes I use it w my Clarisonic, for extra pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser but it did nothing to my pores. The plastic bottle might easily get unattached from its top, once I let it fall and wasted some.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you are trying to reduce your pores.  It has a crisp clean smell, it lathers up so nice and my face feels amazing after use.  I saw almost instant results and would recommend it to anyone trying to reduce the appearance of their pores or just a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to see this offered on Amazon.  I originally bought it a Costco over a year ago, and really liked it, but no longer at Costco, so looking for it and then saw here - so very happy to be using again.  It is a light scrub, very small yet effective granules in it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facewash, the price was great, and it came quickly. The only problem was the packaging when I opened it theshredded paper went everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many different kinds of acne soaps but this one is by far my fav!! Leaves my face feeling clean all day! Without drying it out! I recommend everyone to atleast try it!</li>
            <li> I got this on sale so I gave it a try. I usually use a really cheap, off brand apricot scrub and it does ok, but I still break out a bit. I&#x27;ll usually have 1 or 2 pimples at a time, and a blackhead or two. So I was hoping that this \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; product would have better results and clear up my pimples/blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope! I have been using it for about a month now, I wanted to give it time to work. But I can&#x27;t take it any more. I constantly have so many pimples, and blackheads EVERYWHERE! I now have about 10 pimples at a time, and my cheeks and chin are FULL of blackheads. UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels really clean after I used it, sure, but it&#x27;s making me break out so badly. I&#x27;m going to stop using it, I hope my face goes back to normal soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about twice a day now for a few weeks.  It does a good job washing off my eyeliner, mascara and concealer with out making my face to tight and dry.  It has a light floral-apple smell and just the right amount of exfoliating beads.  Gets the job done.  I pair it with pr o activ toner and pr o activ drying lotion.  As a side note it really annoys me when Amazon or Amazon sellers edit out other brands mentioned in reviews.  They should stop that practice right away.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I had no expectations regarding this product. I bought it because there was a P&amp;G coupon here on Amazon. I must say I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a series of green and white layers, which mix when dispensed. The result is a heavy cleaner with just enough abrasive power to clean without harming your face. The dispenser is a great pump that has a wide base and large pump head, so it can be operated one handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses very easily, leaving your face feeling really clean and refreshed. The smell is clean but not overwhelming, so if you have issues with perfumed products, this should be okay.  Note that this product is only 5 ounces, so take that into account when doing a cost comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy only Neutrogena products; however, the way my face feels after using this, Olay cleaners will be added to my regimen, especially this one. It is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. I had to hold my breath while washing this stuff off.  Besides, not a great exfoliator. I guess you get what you pay for. Going back to Dr. Brandt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This scrub is really above the quality so far your surprise is not only unexpected but it isn&#x27;t a reaction you would dream coming from anything that costs under $12.00. It exfoliates, cleanses and does really minimize your pores which believe it or not; most product that are \\&quot;pore minimizing,\\&quot; don&#x27;t minimize at all. This one does! They took this off the shelves for a year about a year and a half ago and I was not happy! I am so glad they brought it back! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. The pump dispenses the cleanser in a way that shows you how much you have left and doesn&#x27;t go fast which happens a lot with the clear dispensing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, feels great, no residue.</li>
            <li> As many of you have done, I have spent a lot of money on products for my face.  Finding the right cleanser has been a big challenge for me.  I always wash my face at least twice, once to remove make-up, dirt and oil, and then a second time to get that really clean feeling.  However, until using this product I was washing my face three and four times with other face cleansers.  I would notice when I used my toner afterwards that I would be left with such a large amount of make-up and the like on my cotton pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I was twice and that&#x27;s it!  I have very little, if any residual make-up or anything else for that matter remaining on my cotton  pad after using my toner!  I couldn&#x27;t b e happier!  I have tried a number of facial cleansers but this does exactly what I want and for a great price!</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE CLEANSER AND&lt;br /&gt;SCRUB FROM OLAY  -  IT DID MINIMIZING&lt;br /&gt;MY PORES AROUND BY NOSE  -  NOW&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE SOFT SKIN AROUND BY NOSE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for about 2 weeks so far, and it seems okay. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my pores, but after using it my face feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is the packaging! When I got it I was so excited to open it and when I did it was a mess. The lids of the bottles had come off in the shipment and there was product everywhere. I ended up salvaging a lot of it, but it was really messy to clean up. The only reason I did not send it back was because I did not feel like going through all of the hassle.</li>
            <li> Smells great, never drying.  I use it every morning and night without any problems.  Leaves skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Superb...go for it....love this. It works great.....i m happy with my purchase. I  highly recommend this product. 5 star rating..</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products, and after reading other reviews, I thought this would be a great daily cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the bat, here are the Pros: Smells great, Doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, Skin feels soft immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I found it to be too rough for my sensitive skin. I used this product one week on/one week off for a month to test it out, and ended up with progressively worse breakouts every time I used it (I usually have very clear skin, not prone to breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with normal/unreactive skin, this seems like a great product; however, I would caution those with sensitive skin. I called Olay and the customer service reps were very helpful, allowing me to exchange this product for something better suited for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Great item great price</li>
            <li> This product has one major, unacceptable, fatal flaw: microbeads.  Microbeads are tiny plastic beads and are harmful to your body, the water and the ecosystem.  Microbeads can&#x27;t be filtered out of the water supply through standard methods.  I&#x27;m not as environmentally aware as I probably should be - but something that can&#x27;t even be filtered out to stop its harmful effects, no way.  This product was otherwise perfect, felt wonderful, great for sensitive skin, helped minimize my pores.  None of that is worth poisoning the water supply.  More info: http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/19/3659921/tiny-plastic-microbeads-getting-banned-in-numerous-states/</li>
            <li> Because this product works. I only use it twice a week and have much clearer skin. Reuced breakouts and NO blackheads around my nose. Love it. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever! I&#x27;ve always struggled with large pores and this product makes a dramatic difference after using on a regular basis.  The few times I&#x27;ve run out or used something else, I notice immediately that my skin is not as clean as when I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the fragrance, but I think it&#x27;s very pleasant.  It works fine and I like the dispenser.  I have rosacea and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought as a requested gift for someone so she must like. Don&#x27;t have any specific opinion on the product myself</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t work for me. It made me break out and I&#x27;m afraid to use it again. I also don&#x27;t have black heads and normally don&#x27;t get them, but I found a couple after using this product, which was weird. I also didn&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I would say that I saw an instant difference in my skin after using this product and although I was very pleased, I soon realized that there were some undeniable side effects. I&#x27;m not sure if any one else has experienced this but this pore reducer made both my wife and I break out. At first I was in denial because it was working so well but after&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks of continuously breaking out I couldn&#x27;t ignore it anymore.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel SO nice after I&#x27;m done washing it. I have seen a little bit of an improvement in my skin, and I also like to follow this up once a week with Biore Nose Strips.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I never stop using it, since I started using it. This is the only product that I use as a face cleanser, scrub. I love how Olay has packaged this product. It has some kind of spring inside it. As I use it the bottom plate or whatever comes up and that way I don&#x27;t waste any of this product. It did what its suppose to do. It did minimize my large pores. It doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin (oh yeah I have combination skin) and most of all no more breakeouts for me. It is cheaper on Amazon and sometime they have coupons and then it is even cheaper. I get two jars in price of one (is it a jar or a bottle? can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a combination of both I guess). I love it. Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a facial cleanser &amp; exfoliator; I have been a faithful Olay facial product user so I didn&#x27;t want to make a drastic product change and have my sensitive, extremely dry skin suffer! I was doing some online research and found this cleanser to be on the top five cleansers list, I ended up purchasing it and I am in LOVE! It cleans my face so good, gets rid of this Afghanistan dirt and dust, without being harsh as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost always had oily/combination skin and I am very acne prone. I also bought this on the recommendation of a beauty guru online. I have been using it for a month and my skin is under control for the first time since I became a teenager. It does a great job of removing dirt and makeup and my skin now feels so smooth and touchable. Even my boyfriend noticed and in 7 years he never commented on the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. It smells like pears--no floral perfume smell, just a faint sweet smell of fruit. It works very nicely for my sensitive skin. I dont have to SCRUB my face for this stuff to work. Its mild, pleasant, and works well.</li>
            <li> This is all I use to clean my face.  Although it&#x27;s a scrub, it&#x27;s not so abrasive that it hurts your face or turns it red.  Use it everyday and love it!!  Hightly recommend</li>
            <li> This product has more exfoliating beads than other brands I&#x27;ve tried and cleans very well.  Very refreshing. Pores did seem smaller for a while, then as the day went on, they went back to their regular size.  I guess that&#x27;s just nature -- I&#x27;ve heard that large pores are genetic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about a year ago, I really do love it, every morning I use this product. The little beads are like fine sand grains and its gentle on your face. It cleans your face and minimizes the pores, after using it u will definitely feel clean and fresh. Try it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite exfoliating cleanser for years. You can use it daily and it is not too aggressive towards your skin. It is equally effective for young and not so young ladies!</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every product under the sun for my face.  I have very sensitive, \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin and have reactions to many facial products.  I have been searching for a product that could reduce the size of my pores and combat blackheads specifically on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address this issue, I have tried [[ASIN:B005BJ69V4 Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Deep Action Cream Cleanser, 6.5 Ounce  (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B002BWPXFW Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Cleansing Mask, 4 Ounce (Pack of 3)]], [[ASIN:B004DJRJ1W Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Skin Brightening Facial Scrub, 5 Ounce]], among others.  These products are okay in terms of my overall skin and breakouts, but didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Olay scrub LITERALLY yesterday.  I wash my face twice a day and used this product on my nose (3 scrubs total so far).  Today the blackheads are reduced and my pores are DRAMATICALLY smaller.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I typically have a slightly pink and somewhat blotchy nose, so I don&#x27;t help the situation much by applying foundation and concealer all over my nose every day.  Ordinarily, my pores are very visible even under my makeup but today, you can&#x27;t really see MOST pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect yet - I still have small spots where pores are still visible - specifically on the sides near the nostrils and around the crack between my nose and my cheeks, but as I said I&#x27;ve only scrubbed 3 times.  I am amazed by this product!  I wish I could show you a before and after photo because you&#x27;d have to see it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to how sensitive my skin tends to be, I have NOT used this product on my face anywhere other than the nose.  I cannot provide any insight as to its impact on other areas or skin types.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it does exfoliate, but it is still gentle enough for me to use both morning and night!</li>
            <li> I always had problems with blackheads and oil on my face! it was always hard to find good products to keep my face clean with speding hours cleaning my face everyday! this product works fast and great! I use it during the shower everyday and it keeps my face clean and after a few weeks using it every day my pores look clean and not opened...</li>
            <li> I got this product originally because I needed facial wash and I thought it was a bonus because of the pore-minimizing aspect. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 /12 - 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in size of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, not that disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE the smell of the wash. It smells so good and clean! I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of face washes over the years. I have been using this particular one for at least 4 years. I have sensitive, combination skin and am prone to small breakouts in my chin area. When I have tried other washes my face tends to look dull and feel like I am not getting it all off. This stuff seems to brighten my skin and rinses off cleanly. It has some grittiness to it but not enough to feel like you are scratching and irritating your skin.  It does not seem to clog pores. Not sure about the &amp;#34;minimizing&amp;#34; pores that they claim, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog or enlarge them at least. Nice clean smell but not overpowering at all. I use about a dime size amount and that is all I need to get all my makeup off, including eye makeup. A bottle lasts me at least 2 months or more. I cannot seem to find it in the stores anymore so am wondering if Olay has quit making it? Glad it&#x27;s still available on Amazon, at least for now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS and I love it!  It gently exfoliates and leave a smooth skin.  I have been blessed with very nice skin with the occasional blemish (I&#x27;m 37 y/o white female).  When I don&#x27;t use it because I&#x27;ve run out I notice an increase in small blemishes.  My boyfriend who has REALLY oily skin has used this as well and really like it (he&#x27;s very picky and cautious about skin products because he breaks out easily).  He likes this product and works well for him, but occasionally he needs something stronger (that has salicylic acid) especially in the summer.  I have a 13 y/o boy who is starting to get break-outs and I have noticed an improvement in his skin as well when he uses this.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it and it is cheaper on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash ever. I love the scrubby bits in it - a gentle dermabrasion every day. So happy they brought this product back!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, gentle enough to use daily and won&#x27;t dry out your skin. It has complemented my daily beauty regimen perfectly.</li>
