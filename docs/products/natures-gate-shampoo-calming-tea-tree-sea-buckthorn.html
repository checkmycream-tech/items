            <li>Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos, even unscented, and nothing worked as good on my hair and scalp</li>
            <li>It worked better for me than the coal tar shampoos; plus it smells way better!</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo ever for a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>Abes was very nice and got me replacement right away.</li>
            <li>Organic and smells good, lathers nicely, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves your hair clean smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>No animal testing is very important to me.</li>
            <li>and I love the refreshing feeling</li>
            <li>I use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate tea tree conditioner and love it.  </li>
            <li>My scalp stays cleaner, longer, the more often I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>- they&#x27;re thicker in consistency, lather better, and have a stronger scent.</li>
            <li>Love it and so does the rest of my family.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo I have</li>
            <li>Will order more if this works for either family member....</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells greats and I love the scalp tingle from the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>But on top of that they are also Eco-conscious, environmentally friendly, and philanthropists (partners with Water Aid, and aligning with charitable organizations).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great shampoo for the price for anyone with oily hair.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo - but, not near as good as Paul Mitchell Tea Tree.</li>
            <li>w o drying my hair out or having too strong of a smell.  </li>
            <li>Not as strong as I would like to be and did not keep my scalp from flaking.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to get a large bottle at such a great price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a pleasant smell and seems to do a decent job of keeping my hair clean, but isn&#x27;t up to par when it comes to calming my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and if you use conditioner, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but the container pump top broke after the first time it got knocked over.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it so much, we already need more!</li>
            <li>This is the best natural shampoo so far I have found.</li>
            <li>It did calm my scalp some but was hoping to feel more of the tea tree.</li>
            <li>My hair looks clean and bouncy after I use this</li>
            <li>and they go right on these bottles fine.  </li>
            <li>Smells lovely, very soothing.</li>
            <li>The smaller sizes seem more potent</li>
            <li>I have tried many differ shampoos in many different price ranges.</li>
            <li>I love the new, improved formula.</li>
            <li>I buy Nature&#x27;s Gate brand whenever possible mostly because they are a cruelty free company.</li>
            <li>The price was right for the 32 oz.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and cooling sensation dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Bought this shampoo because of other buyers positive reviews and we are very glad that we tried it.  </li>
            <li>This time however, the top was not tightened properly at all and about a quarter of the product leaked into the packaging!</li>
            <li>It smells really fresh, lathers like a champ, and more importantly for me, has made my itchy scalp issues a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I have tried other shampoos thinking that a change would be nice</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it myself and it made my hair feel so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product when I bought it before in a smaller bottle, but it seems this bottle is different.</li>
            <li>With many choices of products to buy, why not give your money to such a responsible company.</li>
            <li>Long time user and extremely satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve used Nature&#x27;s Gate before and really loved the smell, texture, and how my hair felt after use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s environmentally friendly, free from harsh chemicals and toxins, and (at this size) economical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands of tea tree shampoo to help treat my scalp psoriasis and gotten pretty favorable results with most.  </li>
            <li>Dries out my hair a bit too much.</li>
            <li>The seller was prompt, shipping the product much sooner than the estimate</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase again</li>
            <li>Really like this I use on my kids to help keep lice away.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it not only helps keep my hair managable, it also keeps my scalp clear.</li>
            <li>(I mean it DOES say 32 oz) but its good to have.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, thick, wavy hair and this shampoo made it so my hair stayed clean longer than most.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that gets my oily hair really clean without provoking my allergies.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t say more good about this product other than twice now, we have received it in poor packaging.</li>
            <li>My daughter has huge issues with dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>Not cheap price wise and a decent product overall.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Better than the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, so far.</li>
            <li>Miso far this one is working really well.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Having dealt with Tea Tree oil products in the past I was worried this would make my hair smell overwhelmingly like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been oily but this shampoo , has been the only one that controls it really well, also leaves it very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is also not very thick; it&#x27;s quite watery.  </li>
            <li>but now it is creamy and luxurious instead of just a clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>It still prevents my dandruff just as well as the old formula</li>
            <li>Plus it is made by Nature&#x27;s Gate, a company I trust, using quality, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have a scalp that produces a lot of sebum naturally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually cleared up a very stubborn case.</li>
            <li>Her skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>I appreciate the pump dispenser to not waste it.  </li>
            <li>Exact same product, but the shampoo is different.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but I must admit that I have fallen in love with the brand.</li>
            <li>I have good straight hair (never dyed hair and hardly used hair products or blow dryer) and I have to alternate the Tea Tree Calming Shampoo with other shampoos ( such as Aveeno nourish/moisturize shampoo)</li>
            <li>However, I was very pleasantly surprised that it does not and only leaves my hair smelling clean and with a very slight hint of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, I believe it contains less tea tree oil than my previous brand - barely any scalp tingling and doesn&#x27;t completely wipe out flaky scalp - but it&#x27;s the best replacement I&#x27;ve found for my usual brand.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shampoos, but cleans really well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised this was such a big bottle</li>
            <li>his scalp has gone from yellow and white scales and flakes all over, to being able to wear dark colored shirts and only slightly raised reddish skin.</li>
            <li>I have coarse curly hair and a dry scalp, so this shampoo helps treat my dry scalp without making my hair more frizzy then usual.</li>
            <li>the tea tree oil really does make it feel a little tingly,  </li>

            <li> It works for my minor flaky condition but I can&#x27;t speak to chronic dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as I have used several other Tea Tree shampoos for my flaky scalp.  </li>

            <li> That&#x27;s not really the case with Nature&#x27;s Gate.  </li>
            <li> A little  goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have to wash it every other day with this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy hair which just got frizzier when I moved into my new house, heated by a coal stove.</li>
            <li> Tried several other common brand shampoos but never helped until I used Natures Gate.</li>
            <li> Took only 1 week to solve the issue and I had been using this everyday for the past ~2 years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this! I usually have oily hair but this stuff cleans all the residue and excess oils. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and I love the refreshing feeling it gives you with the tea tree scent. Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love the new, improved formula. It still prevents my dandruff just as well as the old formula but now it is creamy and luxurious instead of just a clear shampoo. My hair looks great after using it. Plus it is made by Nature&#x27;s Gate, a company I trust, using quality, natural ingredients. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that gets my oily hair really clean without provoking my allergies.</li>
            <li> If your looking to try a Tea Tree soap or shampoo this is a great place to start. I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now and I am very pleased with it. One pump does my hair (two if you have long hair I suppose). I still have half the bottle left. I also use it on my face to treat rosecea and it realy seems to help. I will buy another when this is out so I guess that says it all.</li>
            <li> Smells great&amp; cleans hair good</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I was a Wen user, but when I decided to go gray, Wen was no longer working. I love this non-sulfate shampoo! It even lathers! My hair is soft, clean and shiny. I don&#x27;t mind going gray now.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, thick, wavy hair and this shampoo made it so my hair stayed clean longer than most. I have to wash it every other day with this shampoo I could almost go an additional day.  It leaves my hair very soft and manageable. I use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate tea tree conditioner and love it.  So far I have not even had to switch it out regularly with another shampoo which I usually have to do.  I highly recommend this great shampoo for the price for anyone with oily hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product when I bought it before in a smaller bottle, but it seems this bottle is different. Exact same product, but the shampoo is different.</li>
            <li> Tends to dry out my hair.  I am 75 so I probably shouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have a scalp that produces a lot of sebum naturally. My scalp stays cleaner, longer, the more often I use this shampoo. It works.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, but do need a conditioner with it.  Nice smell.  Hair if fuller.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo but the spring for the bottle doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> I buy Nature&#x27;s Gate brand whenever possible mostly because they are a cruelty free company. No animal testing is very important to me. But on top of that they are also Eco-conscious, environmentally friendly, and philanthropists (partners with Water Aid, and aligning with charitable organizations).  With many choices of products to buy, why not give your money to such a responsible company.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have severe plaque psoriasis and this shampoo works great! It worked better for me than the coal tar shampoos; plus it smells way better! I&#x27;m definitely going to get the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to keep the lice  away when there&#x27;s an outbreak at school.  I decided to try it myself and it made my hair feel so soft and clean. I put some on my body the other day to help keep the black flies away, our hairdresser told me about this little trick as well. It works.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this brand as a replacement to the one I usually buy. It&#x27;s difficult for me to make it to the one place in my area that sells my favorite brand of tea tree oil shampoo.  After a few weeks of use, I believe it contains less tea tree oil than my previous brand - barely any scalp tingling and doesn&#x27;t completely wipe out flaky scalp - but it&#x27;s the best replacement I&#x27;ve found for my usual brand. I would buy this again if needed. The seller was prompt, shipping the product much sooner than the estimate and it arrived faster than expected. Great seller.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he complained that it stripped his hair and dried it out. I tried it and if you use conditioner, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> It smells great, leaves your hair clean smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this shampoo.  The price was right for the 32 oz. bottle.  I will purchase this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy hair which just got frizzier when I moved into my new house, heated by a coal stove. To avoid frizz, I cut out conditioner but needed something to mouisterize my scalp as I regularly have itch and flaking. This shampoo is great! It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shampoos, but cleans really well. My frizz is non existent most days, so that is also great!! And since I began using, I have no itchy flaky scalp.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used Nature&#x27;s Gate before and really loved the smell, texture, and how my hair felt after use. The only thing that kept me from buying Nature&#x27;s Gate all the time was the price for the amount of product. Well, during these past Fall/Winter months, I had a little bit of that pesky itchy scalp that some other people experience. I never saw any sign of dandruff so, I didn&#x27;t want to use something that was medicated or would be really harsh for my hair and scalp..I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this! It smells really fresh, lathers like a champ, and more importantly for me, has made my itchy scalp issues a thing of the past. My hair looks clean and bouncy after I use this and I love that.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems diluted with a lot of water in this size. The smaller sizes seem more potent - they&#x27;re thicker in consistency, lather better, and have a stronger scent. Stick to the smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> My scalp used to itch a lot whenever it was the dry season. Tried several other common brand shampoos but never helped until I used Natures Gate. Took only 1 week to solve the issue and I had been using this everyday for the past ~2 years. The itch never came back and my scalp is definitely less oily than it was. Thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> great seller, great product</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has severe scalp psoriasis and for the last year now we have switched him to this shampoo, he won&#x27;t go back! I believe it&#x27;s the tea tree in this that does wonders for any skin condition (I also get eczema on my hands occasionally) his scalp has gone from yellow and white scales and flakes all over, to being able to wear dark colored shirts and only slightly raised reddish skin. We can&#x27;t say more good about this product other than twice now, we have received it in poor packaging. Once, it was the pump that was broken off. This time however, the top was not tightened properly at all and about a quarter of the product leaked into the packaging! Please work on your packaging guys, we want to continue purchasing your shampoo!</li>
            <li> The product was off the market for a while and was missed. Long time user and extremely satisfied with results. Keep stocking this item! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for inexpensive shampoo that would help ridding of my seasonal dandruff; this shampoo showed results within a couple of washes. It works for my minor flaky condition but I can&#x27;t speak to chronic dandruff issue. However, this is not my daily shampoo. I have good straight hair (never dyed hair and hardly used hair products or blow dryer) and I have to alternate the Tea Tree Calming Shampoo with other shampoos ( such as Aveeno nourish/moisturize shampoo) otherwise my hair loses its natural shine. The shampoo lathers, which I like. Not a fan of the fragrance. Great product over all for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Love it and so does the rest of my family.  A little  goes a long way.  Will absolutely purchase again</li>
            <li> Really loved the customer service and great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for my psoriasis. It&#x27;s actually cleared up a very stubborn case. Nice to be able to get a large bottle at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell! Cleans well and my hair looks and feels so healthy! I love this shampoo I have r- bought this and plan to do so again!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the container pump top broke after the first time it got knocked over.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo - but, not near as good as Paul Mitchell Tea Tree. Doesn&#x27;t leave that tingling sensation or have that Tea Tree smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever for a sensitive scalp.  I have tried other shampoos thinking that a change would be nice and I keep coming back to this shampoo.  My dermatologist also approved of it.  My scalp is no longer itchy and the tea tree oil really does make it feel a little tingly,  It smells nice too. I advise that you keep it out of your eyes as it could irritate.</li>
            <li> Better than the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, so far. I may try the conditioner next to see if it has synergy.</li>
            <li> Ok. Not cheap price wise and a decent product overall. Nice smell and cooling sensation dry scalp. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of tea tree shampoo to help treat my scalp psoriasis and gotten pretty favorable results with most.  That&#x27;s not really the case with Nature&#x27;s Gate.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell and seems to do a decent job of keeping my hair clean, but isn&#x27;t up to par when it comes to calming my psoriasis.  The shampoo is also not very thick; it&#x27;s quite watery.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo because of other buyers positive reviews and we are very glad that we tried it.  The shampoo works great!</li>
            <li> My daughter has huge issues with dry scalp.  I have tried many differ shampoos in many different price ranges. Miso far this one is working really well.  My husband will also be trying it.  Will order more if this works for either family member....</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it so much, we already need more! Her skin is so sensitive so i was worried but it works great with no issues!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it not only helps keep my hair managable, it also keeps my scalp clear. I have tried many shampoos, even unscented, and nothing worked as good on my hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I must admit that I have fallen in love with the brand. This shampoo smells greats and I love the scalp tingle from the tea tree oil. It&#x27;s environmentally friendly, free from harsh chemicals and toxins, and (at this size) economical.</li>
            <li> Really like this I use on my kids to help keep lice away.  I have added a few drops of tea tree oil as well to bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The pump is awful quality.  I save my Alba pumps and they go right on these bottles fine.  one shipment the product had leaked everwhere when i opened box.  Abes was very nice and got me replacement right away.</li>
            <li> switched my hubby (who has itchy scalp) and my son age 6  (cradle cap type of flakes) both to this and it works great. I appreciate the pump dispenser to not waste it.  My hubby used to use head and shoulders and said this works well as a replacement....and I like that it is safer for my son than Head and Shoulders</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo before.  Its great.  I was surprised this was such a big bottle (I mean it DOES say 32 oz) but its good to have.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural shampoo so far I have found. Everyone in the family uses it.</li>
            <li> It did calm my scalp some but was hoping to feel more of the tea tree.</li>
            <li> Found this shampoo very effective w o drying my hair out or having too strong of a smell.  Ir&#x27;s a good product and I would recommend it.  I.didn&#x27;t think it would be comparable to another, but it did surprise me after all!!</li>
            <li> Having dealt with Tea Tree oil products in the past I was worried this would make my hair smell overwhelmingly like tea tree oil. However, I was very pleasantly surprised that it does not and only leaves my hair smelling clean and with a very slight hint of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been oily but this shampoo , has been the only one that controls it really well, also leaves it very soft and shiny! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly hair and a dry scalp, so this shampoo helps treat my dry scalp without making my hair more frizzy then usual. Plus it feels really good. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Organic and smells good, lathers nicely, and the price is right.  And Cutting Edge sent it to me without charge for shipping!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would like to be and did not keep my scalp from flaking.  I decided to try this as I have used several other Tea Tree shampoos for my flaky scalp.  It may have worked for others, but did not for me.  I ended up using it as a body wash instead.</li>
