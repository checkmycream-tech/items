            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>but it seems my joints are feeling better.</li>
            <li>Pine Bark is my favorite supplement.</li>

            <li>Easy to digest.</li>
            <li>So Wham this huge bottle for the price you cannot beat it</li>
            <li>good product good deal not much more to say</li>
            <li>, I take 1 pill a day so this investment is awesome, my skin looks great its firmer and the wrinkles have been kept at bay, I only have very small lines under my eyes and they are lessening, for being 43 fixing to be 44</li>
            <li>Received fairly quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have taken it for several months and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>They are also not too large so easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>so I would guess that this specific brand provides some benefit, maybe just not as potent or perhaps not the best source of raw ingredient or what not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Definitely works in helping skin stay nice and pliable.</li>
            <li>This just proves you do not have to buy name brand to get results</li>
            <li>take a multi-vitamin because I understand it is good for me, but don&#x27;t really feel a difference from day-to-day, but with pine bark extract, I can actually feel the difference.</li>
            <li>According to the American Cancer Society, this stuff has been used by humans for health purposes for more than 500 years.  </li>
            <li>It may work exactly as claimed, but it didn&#x27;t have any effect on my cholesterol, so I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I think this is helping with my hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and love the results.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this supplement and didn&#x27;t want to pay as much as the higher priced name.  </li>
            <li>Still though, I&#x27;m ok with paying more but seeing actual results as compared to spending less and not knowing if a product is doing anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say I noticed a differance with this product, but will keep taking it till it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>THANKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>it took months to really start noticing the difference...</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the way that I feel.</li>
            <li>I do not think that this brand of pine bark is effective and will be going back to my other (higher priced) NOW pycnogenol.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and have benefited from using it since i got it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was afraid this price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>had much better luck and results with the Proanthrocyanidin Complex from CountryLife and Pycnogenol from TwinLabs or Nature&#x27;s Way</li>
            <li>it beat out the others considerably.</li>
            <li>Too early for skin and Tinnitus effects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please don&#x27;t ask me technical questions, or questions that the seller should answer, I&#x27;ll just direct you to the seller.</li>

            <li> I have only had to use topical steroids on a few patches; the entire scalp and all the leg guttate spots have calmed down SO much!</li>
            <li> but this year, I&#x27;ve only had a few flares that quickly die down after a few days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any effect on spider veins (1 month is too short time), but it made me extremely fatigue.</li>
            <li> Pyc is expensive, but worth the extra dollars in my opinion.</li>
            <li> went through the entire bottle, but never really saw the results that I would get when taking other Pine Bark extracts or formulas</li>
            <li> I stopped taking it, and in a few days, I stopped having such feelings.</li>
            <li> , you want me to use this with other supplements to get what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> Not sure if product contains Pycnogenol, a patented water extract from the bark of specific type of pine tree in southwestern France,</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t taking any other supplements at that time.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice, about a year apart, and each time I ended up with a kidney infection that was hard to heal, and these are the only kidney infections I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> have less mucus now that I take it</li>
            <li> and they could not not even find my order much less</li>
            <li> , get you some pine bark give it a few weeks and check the mirror</li>
            <li> Recommend 1mg per pound of body weight or double it if you&#x27;re feeling sick or have asthma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d feel as if I was going to faint, or get my head spin.</li>
            <li> Usually I get really awful flares in the winter, and this winter has been particularly brutal (I&#x27;m in Chicago)...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> According to the American Cancer Society, this stuff has been used by humans for health purposes for more than 500 years.  I have put it in my cancer-fighting anti-oxidant repertoire along with Turmeric capsules and Astaxanthin capsules (for internal sunburn protection).</li>
            <li> Strictly going by the numbers I would say this is a good product. If you look at the dosage you are getting of Pine Bark Extract it seems to be a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I went through the entire bottle, but never really saw the results that I would get when taking other Pine Bark extracts or formulas so I would guess that this specific brand provides some benefit, maybe just not as potent or perhaps not the best source of raw ingredient or what not.&lt;br /&gt;I had much better luck and results with the Proanthrocyanidin Complex from CountryLife and Pycnogenol from TwinLabs or Nature&#x27;s Way but of course those products are more expensive than this Vitacost one. Still though, I&#x27;m ok with paying more but seeing actual results as compared to spending less and not knowing if a product is doing anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on re-purchasing the Vitacost Pine Bark Extract. I&#x27;ll just stick to the ones I&#x27;ve known to work for me and show results.</li>
            <li> I do not think that this brand of pine bark is effective and will be going back to my other (higher priced) NOW pycnogenol.  I was afraid this price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say I noticed a differance with this product, but will keep taking it till it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> we are grateful to be able to find this product at this great price!  it beat out the others considerably.</li>
            <li> good product good deal not much more to say, you want me to use this with other supplements to get what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> I think it has helped my nerve issues.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT. THANKS SO MUCH. iT DOES THE JOB AND MY SKIN LOOKS RADIANT.THIS WILL LAST ME SEVERAL MONTHS .</li>
            <li> Although had better quality, the quantity makes up for it</li>
            <li> Definitely works in helping skin stay nice and pliable.</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. Someone told me this product was good for pain, and while it did not help my pain, I am happy&lt;br /&gt;it helps others.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing, the are the cheaper way to go if your looking for the phytoceramides, but don&#x27;t want to pay the name brand price. From researching, I learned that the ingredient is Pycnogenol, which is found in Pine Bark extract. So Wham this huge bottle for the price you cannot beat it, I take 1 pill a day so this investment is awesome, my skin looks great its firmer and the wrinkles have been kept at bay, I only have very small lines under my eyes and they are lessening, for being 43 fixing to be 44 I am a happy girl! This just proves you do not have to buy name brand to get results, get you some pine bark give it a few weeks and check the mirror</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. Nothing.  All of our bodies are different and react differently to vitamins.  Might work for you but didn&#x27;t do anything for me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Pycnogenol is the US registered trademark name for a product derived from the pine bark of a tree known as Pinus pinaster aka French Maritime Pine Tree.  Standardized to contain 95% Polyphenols (95mg) per capsule with 300 servings per container.  Contains substances that might improve blood flow, also stimulate the immune system and has antioxidant effects.  Recommend 1mg per pound of body weight or double it if you&#x27;re feeling sick or have asthma.</li>
            <li> Easy to digest.Too early for skin and Tinnitus effects.</li>
            <li> I was looking for nutritional support to bolster my immune system after a series of chronic infections, and saw that pine bark was good for this. After I started taking it, I also found out that it is in trials for easing psoriasis, which I also have... it&#x27;s true! While I also credit reishi for helping stave off the infections, I&#x27;m sticking with the pine bark for the psoriasis management. Usually I get really awful flares in the winter, and this winter has been particularly brutal (I&#x27;m in Chicago)... but this year, I&#x27;ve only had a few flares that quickly die down after a few days. I have only had to use topical steroids on a few patches; the entire scalp and all the leg guttate spots have calmed down SO much! It&#x27;s a long-term thing... it took months to really start noticing the difference... but there are no side effects that I know of, so I figured I had nothing to lose. This is also the best price you&#x27;ll find for this substance. If you are struggling with some kind of chronic inflammatory issue (eczema, psoriasis, arthritis, colitis, etc.), I&#x27;d say give this a go. You might be very happy you did!</li>
            <li> but if you are prone to getting urinary tract infections, or even if you&#x27;ve never had one before, this could push you over the edge. I tried it twice, about a year apart, and each time I ended up with a kidney infection that was hard to heal, and these are the only kidney infections I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. I have since learned that phenols can cause UTI, and that&#x27;s what is product is, phenols extracted from pine bark. It may work exactly as claimed, but it didn&#x27;t have any effect on my cholesterol, so I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ask me technical questions, or questions that the seller should answer, I&#x27;ll just direct you to the seller. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if product contains Pycnogenol, a patented water extract from the bark of specific type of pine tree in southwestern France,</li>
            <li> good product and seller</li>
            <li> Great customer service. Quality product.</li>
            <li> The verdict is not in yet.  My relative swears by it.  It is supposed to reduce peripheral neuropathy caused by chemo..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the way that I feel. I&#x27;ve been taking one cap per day. I will start taking 2/day shortly</li>
            <li> It does a great job as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I’d give this 5 stars if it didn’t have magnesium stearate in it.  It isn’t good for absorption in the intestine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Vitamin C.  I&#x27;ll use it until the bottle is finished and see if there&#x27;s any improvement.</li>
            <li> Just started them but a great price.  Received fairly quickly and as advertised.  They are also not too large so easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I was taking Pine Bark for about 1 month. I read somewhere it helps prevent spider veins. I didn&#x27;t feel any effect on spider veins (1 month is too short time), but it made me extremely fatigue. I&#x27;d feel as if I was going to faint, or get my head spin. I stopped taking it, and in a few days, I stopped having such feelings. I wasn&#x27;t taking any other supplements at that time. I may still take 1 capsule from time to time, but I&#x27;ll never start taking it regularly again. Maybe this information helps others, who will decide taking Pine Bark capsules on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just like the more expensive versions. I will buy it again! It has madea difference in my appearance! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I think this is helping with my hot flashes.  They don&#x27;t seem to be as often.  72 and still fanning myself.</li>
            <li> Taking as a preventative measure from Dr Oz show to reduce inflammation for prevention of cancer.  Seems to work well have less mucus now that I take it</li>
            <li> great deal on a good product!  I highly recommend this and have benefited from using it since i got it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this supplement and didn&#x27;t want to pay as much as the higher priced name.  I have only taken it for a couple of weeks but it seems my joints are feeling better. My spider veins also  seem to be lighter.</li>
            <li> My physician suggested I take this supplement twice a day.  It has lots of antioxidants and has a mood elevating effect as well.  I have taken it for several months and am very pleased.  The product is safely packaged, well-labelled, and has great purity.</li>
            <li> Great for work out pumps , helps my concentration and helps ease arthritic pain.  I have it my neck from some trama some years ago</li>
            <li> Pine Bark is my favorite supplement. I take 200 mg a day and give it to my elderly dogs too.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good anti-inflamatory.  It helps with my arthritis and my breathing, has improved my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;I take a multi-vitamin because I understand it is good for me, but don&#x27;t really feel a difference from day-to-day, but with pine bark extract, I can actually feel the difference. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and the product arrived in a timely manner. He appears to like it since he takes it daily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works as well as the pycnogenol tabs I bought these as a substitute for. Pyc is expensive, but worth the extra dollars in my opinion.</li>
            <li> seems to addressing the issuewill now more in 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This is the best value for Pine Bark extract that I&#x27;ve found. I have been noticing some improvement in the condition of my skin since I started taking it.</li>
            <li> I am sending my bottle back.  It does not say what it is but I think t is  Pycnogenol.  I even called VitalCost and they could not not even find my order much less tell me what it was.</li>
            <li> This is a good antioxidant very similiar to pycnogenol but at a better price. I am on my second bottle and love the results.</li>
