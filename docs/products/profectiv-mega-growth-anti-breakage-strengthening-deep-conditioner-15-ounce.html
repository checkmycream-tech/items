            <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner for the price.  </li>
            <li>but instead I paired with a Keracare detaingling shampoo that also had good reviews.</li>
            <li>it smells absolutely amazing, i have never had a conditioner, let alone hair product that has smelled so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair product there is, and while I have yet to find many (if any!)</li>
            <li>I went on my own search to restore my damaged hair and find products to use at home.</li>
            <li>and I was able to comb through after a wash for the FIRST TIME!!!!</li>
            <li>I got the product fast and at a very good price.  </li>

            <li>but I am confident I will have long and beautiful hair again with this product.</li>
            <li>WEll Worth the 6 bucks:)</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with the Keracare and afterwards it was tangle free</li>
            <li>Rinse it out and my hair was smooth, silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not new to this product, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>My hair is super silky and so easy to comb through</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all good and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great for black hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I have noticed more elasticity using this product.</li>
            <li>However it is worth the money and restores your hair after using a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I continued the use in spite of the results because I thought my stylist was right.</li>
            <li>It also has a fruity scent (May come off as strong if you&#x27;re very sensitive).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, creamy and makes my hair so silky soft and the comb goes right through!</li>
            <li>Smells great, I use it as a deep conditioner, keeping it on for over ten mins.</li>
            <li>I had even gone to my stylist before putting in the weave to get her to put in a deep conditioner and to my surprise after the weave I lost more</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have the ability to cause hair to pick up more dirt/etc than normal, and in that case Sulfate-based shampoos are the easy solution to rid of the extra oil (Sulfates are surfactants, so used on dry hair will dry it out more!</li>
            <li>I will forever recommend this product as well as purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available on the shelves!</li>
            <li>I have extraordinarily damaged hair that is extremely dry and brittle on the top layer and naturally wavy on the under layer.  </li>
            <li>It just gets it that much under control.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner...</li>
            <li>I felt like I lost so much hair after a wash and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and i really havent seen any change in the hair</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product I spent some time looking for a good shampoo and deep conditioner for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>petroleum and mineral oil are the very FIRST ingredients listed on the back of the jar</li>
            <li>in the morning after it dries it is silky, soft and straight, then when I use my heat tools, it is protected.</li>
            <li>product is a nice, relatively thick conditioner that does stick to the hair shaft, which helps keep it where it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>what new growth?</li>
            <li>the product- Petrolatum in particular is NOT Petroleum like the jelly you put on your lips/skin; Petrolatum is all natural purified and distilled Petroleum.</li>
            <li>I follow up with Profectiv Mega Growth Daily Leave-In Strengthener and a dab of Profectiv Mega Growth Moisturizing Growth Lotion, then I wrap my hair, With Ease, thanks to Profectiv!</li>
            <li>Currently transitioning, used this for the first time</li>
            <li>I am going right back to the store tomorrow to buy another tub, and I would reccommend this to anyone with dry or damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;**As for the review that stated that the *Second*(Not the first) two ingredients, Mineral Oil and Petrolatum, ruin</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair to the roots and leaves it so soft and silky after about 20 mins under the dryer.</li>
            <li>Only use when the hair is really dirty/oily.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>; products, I have found several that I really do like.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my hair extremely soft and manageable, as well as making it healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li>After a deep conditioning, my hair felt very soft and stronger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product is designed for a different hair texture than mine, it works well for my hair because it is designed for dry and brittle hair, which is exactly what</li>
            <li>me start with details about my hair: I am African American and transitioning from relaxed to natural, with about 2in of curly/kinky new growth and 10in of relaxed</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are, as some other reviewers have pointed out, some heavy chemicals in this conditioner, it also contains healthy oils such as olive oil, avocado oil, Argan oil, and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, as well as other products by this brand.</li>

            <li> The con is my hair is so long that I can only get</li>
            <li> My long time hair stylist uses Design Essential Products on my hair and suggest that I use the products at home for self-care.</li>
            <li> Only issue is i wish it came in a bigger size because i have a lot of long thick hair and use almost the whole jar in 1 wash.</li>
            <li> However, the shampoo and conditioner left my hair tangled, dry and matted.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and shoulder length, previously relaxed and texterized, this is the miracle conditioner!</li>
            <li> Leaving the conditioner on the hair for 10-60 minutes before rinsing helps it fully soften the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that this conditioner DOES leave my hair looking shinier and DOES leave it softer, but my hair is still crazy dry on top.  </li>
            <li> deep conditioner blew my mind; after washing my hair, it is almost always left a tangled and stringy mess.</li>
            <li> Ladies of color, this is a must have when your hair is feeling dry and needs a moisture boost.</li>
            <li> it worked miracles for my dry damaged hair!</li>
            <li> -THE FIRST INGREDIENTS LISTED ARE NO GOOD FOR YOUR HAIR.!</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no breakage at all.</li>
            <li> Not only did I find this at Walmart for less than half the price listed here, but in one go it has become my HOLY GRAIL hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t Permed my hair in 2 and a half years, and I must say in addition to less damage to my follicles from the chemicals, this product helped my hair down to a length I&#x27;ve been trying to get for ten years.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 30 minutes to blow dry my hair because it is so unmanageable but after using this product I could comb it out with no problem.</li>
            <li> After I washed it out I blow dried.</li>
            <li> My hair is short due to using the wrong products</li>
            <li> but it was not as much as I usually had after a wash.</li>
            <li> It helps me to detangle my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> whiich by the way is not good for trying to grow hair..</li>
            <li> The last time I used these products after taking out a weave the breakage was WORST.</li>

            <li> -THE FIRST INGREDIENTS LISTED ARE NO GOOD FOR YOUR HAIR.! petroleum and mineral oil are the very FIRST ingredients listed on the back of the jar &gt;&#x3D;( whiich by the way is not good for trying to grow hair.. ihate ididnt do my research on this sooner before ibought it -__-</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner seems to be the ONLY thing that can help my hair when I&#x27;m trying to stretch my perms. It conditions my hair to the roots and leaves it so soft and silky after about 20 mins under the dryer. My hair is super silky and so easy to comb through it&#x27;s like....what new growth? It just gets it that much under control. Ladies of color, this is a must have when your hair is feeling dry and needs a moisture boost. It&#x27;s forever a staple, I can never be without this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and shoulder length, previously relaxed and texterized, this is the miracle conditioner! It helps me to detangle my thick curly hair. It&#x27;s rich, creamy and makes my hair so silky soft and the comb goes right through! I follow up with Profectiv Mega Growth Daily Leave-In Strengthener and a dab of Profectiv Mega Growth Moisturizing Growth Lotion, then I wrap my hair, With Ease, thanks to Profectiv! in the morning after it dries it is silky, soft and straight, then when I use my heat tools, it is protected. The ingredients are all good and it smells terrific! I will forever recommend this product as well as purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available on the shelves! And I hope that&#x27;s forver! WEll Worth the 6 bucks:)</li>
            <li> OMG I love this product and so does my hair. After a deep conditioning, my hair felt very soft and stronger. The con is my hair is so long that I can only get about 2-2.5 uses out of one jar.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner...It&#x27;s one of the few conditioners that really leaves my dry relaxed hair very silky and shiny without the heavy build-up!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner for the price.  My hair is natural and I have noticed more elasticity using this product.</li>
            <li> If you have short, damaged, thinning hair like I do - this is the product for you.  This product works and does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Not only did I find this at Walmart for less than half the price listed here, but in one go it has become my HOLY GRAIL hair product!&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with details about my hair: I am African American and transitioning from relaxed to natural, with about 2in of curly/kinky new growth and 10in of relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;This deep conditioner blew my mind; after washing my hair, it is almost always left a tangled and stringy mess. SECONDS after applying the conditioner to my hair, I could run my hands through it! It also has a fruity scent (May come off as strong if you&#x27;re very sensitive). I am going right back to the store tomorrow to buy another tub, and I would reccommend this to anyone with dry or damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;**As for the review that stated that the *Second*(Not the first) two ingredients, Mineral Oil and Petrolatum, ruin the product- Petrolatum in particular is NOT Petroleum like the jelly you put on your lips/skin; Petrolatum is all natural purified and distilled Petroleum. Mineral oil acts the same way in locking in moisture. Yes, some people can have allergic reactons to these, just like some people can have reactions to peanuts/etc. Yes, it does have the ability to cause hair to pick up more dirt/etc than normal, and in that case Sulfate-based shampoos are the easy solution to rid of the extra oil (Sulfates are surfactants, so used on dry hair will dry it out more! Only use when the hair is really dirty/oily.)&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, my hair loves this stuff, but do your research and decide for yourself. :)**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: (extended names were omitted ie: Butyrospermum Parkii Fruit &#x3D; Shea Butter)&lt;br /&gt;Aqua,Mineral Oil, Petrolatum, Propylene Glycol, Polyquatemium 37, Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Olea Europea Fruit Oil/Olive Oil, Shea Butter, Avocado Oil, Wheat Protein, Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Oat Protein, Argan Oil, Coconut Oil, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hydrolysed Vegetable Protein, PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Soybean Oil, Dimethicone, Steareth-2, Steareth-20, Phenyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1, Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Citral,d-Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Lilial, Linalool.Dimethicone, Steareth-2, Steareth-20, Phenyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1, Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Citral,d-Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Lilial, Linalool.</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily damaged hair that is extremely dry and brittle on the top layer and naturally wavy on the under layer.  That combination is the perfect recipe for FRIZZ!  I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair product there is, and while I have yet to find many (if any!) truly &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; products, I have found several that I really do like.  This Profectiv Mega Growth Deep Conditioner is one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product is designed for a different hair texture than mine, it works well for my hair because it is designed for dry and brittle hair, which is exactly what my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are, as some other reviewers have pointed out, some heavy chemicals in this conditioner, it also contains healthy oils such as olive oil, avocado oil, Argan oil, and coconut oil.  It smells DELICIOUS due to the coconut oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a nice, relatively thick conditioner that does stick to the hair shaft, which helps keep it where it is supposed to be.  Leaving the conditioner on the hair for 10-60 minutes before rinsing helps it fully soften the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that this conditioner DOES leave my hair looking shinier and DOES leave it softer, but my hair is still crazy dry on top.  It can&#x27;t fix everything!</li>
            <li> My hair used to be brittle a lot. But when I start using mega growth product everybody keep asking me thats your hair. My hair silk and shine  Now  I get every one of them</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for black hair. The longer you leave it in, the better. I always leave it in for like two  hours when i take out my braids or weaves. Only issue is i wish it came in a bigger size because i have a lot of long thick hair and use almost the whole jar in 1 wash. However it is worth the money and restores your hair after using a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> it smells absolutely amazing, i have never had a conditioner, let alone hair product that has smelled so good. it leaves my hair extremely soft and manageable, as well as making it healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li> Love there products and this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I spent some time looking for a good shampoo and deep conditioner for ethnic hair. I decided to go with this product for a deep conditioner because I was impressed with the reviews. I did not go with the shampoo for this product because it was not sulfur-free but instead I paired with a Keracare detaingling shampoo that also had good reviews. My long time hair stylist uses Design Essential Products on my hair and suggest that I use the products at home for self-care. However, the shampoo and conditioner left my hair tangled, dry and matted. I would comb my hair out and it would be all over the sink and floor. I felt like I lost so much hair after a wash and conditioner. I continued the use in spite of the results because I thought my stylist was right. The last time I used these products after taking out a weave the breakage was WORST. I had even gone to my stylist before putting in the weave to get her to put in a deep conditioner and to my surprise after the weave I lost more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fed up and done salon care and Design Essentials. I went on my own search to restore my damaged hair and find products to use at home. I washed my hair with the Keracare and afterwards it was tangle free and I was able to comb through after a wash for the FIRST TIME!!!! I still had hair breakage but it was not as much as I usually had after a wash. I then put in the Profectiv deep conditioner. I covered with a plastic cap and let sit in my hair for two hours before washing the product out. After I washed it out I blow dried. I had absolutely no breakage at all. It usually takes me about 30 minutes to blow dry my hair because it is so unmanageable but after using this product I could comb it out with no problem. My hair was strong, shiny and NO BREAKAGE!!! I did not comb one strand of hair out after using this product and before I was combing out hand fulls of hair. I have found my conditioner that I will always use. My hair is short due to using the wrong products but I am confident I will have long and beautiful hair again with this product. I had to call my mother and tell her about the results of this product because she has also been suffering from hair breakage. Please purchase and trust me you will not regret!!!using the wrong products but I am confident I will have long and beautiful hair again with this product.

            <li> I got the product fast and at a very good price.  I use this on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and it makes her hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I got this  in a speedy amount of time and i really havent seen any change in the hair but it was with the try</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t Permed my hair in 2 and a half years, and I must say in addition to less damage to my follicles from the chemicals, this product helped my hair down to a length I&#x27;ve been trying to get for ten years. Smells great, I use it as a deep conditioner, keeping it on for over ten mins. Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> Currently transitioning, used this for the first time and I must say I&#x27;m impressed. It does wonders for my hair. It detangles the hair as soon as you apply it. And surprisingly you don&#x27;t have to use too much. Leave it on with a cap and you actually feel it working and penetrating deep into the hair. Rinse it out and my hair was smooth, silky and moisturized. No breakage. Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not new to this product, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! it worked miracles for my dry damaged hair! Literally saved me from having to cut my hair off. I highly recommend this product, as well as other products by this brand.</li>
