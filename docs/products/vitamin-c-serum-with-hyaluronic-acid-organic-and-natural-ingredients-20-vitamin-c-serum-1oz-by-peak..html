            <li>Since I started using this vitamin c serum, my face looks brighter, feels more supple, and I&#x27;m still hoping that the fine lines under and around my eyes will lessen!</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished and my skin has a nice dewey glow to it.</li>

            <li>Love this product and will purchase again.</li>

            <li>I have started to noticed a difference in my skin, and I am glad I went with this product.</li>
            <li>Overall great serum!</li>
            <li>and I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but since using this, it has been a lot better than before.</li>
            <li>Im sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and easy to apply on my face.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the serum is extremely light weight and goes on the skin very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a huge Kiehl&#x27;s &#x27;midnight recovery&#x27; fan but this serum is A LOT better.</li>
            <li>The product is lightweight and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>I think this was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>Another major plus is Peak Products great customer service.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve used it and found it seems to improve my fine lines.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes have all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for almost three weeks as directed and have not seen a change in fine lines or my skin.</li>
            <li>I also love how it goes into my face so quickly.</li>
            <li>It leave my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I think this is a great product that I will continue to use regularly because it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really a scent to the product and you get a lot of serum for the price (and it comes in a glass bottle which is nice).  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and can be worn before bed or underneath makeup.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my face I apply this morning and night, and it glides on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It does have a good stretch which is why I gave it its current rating :)</li>
            <li>All in all good so far.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it&#x27;s all natural, is at an affordable price, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I apply it immediately after the shower in the morning and before going to bed on a clean face.</li>
            <li>I love this product SO much.</li>
            <li>Nongreasy and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>When you use it twice per day it can go quickly</li>
            <li>She likes that the product dries super quick</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Love how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>Which is pretty remarkable as they were deep.  </li>
            <li>I also take Super Buffered Vitamin C and Calcium supplements which work together to build collagen.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, as well as with</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly which was nice because when I order something I look forward to trying it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>I will update after use for a few weeks but so far I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li>I have been using the vitamin c serum for about 3 weeks now, and so far I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is natural and safe.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to find an anti-aging product that doesn&#x27;t either cause breakouts or irritation, until this product.  </li>
            <li>I even have some smile lines which are so visible.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed right into my skin.</li>
            <li>I just feel like my skin is even happier, if that was possible - since I started using this awesome product along with the other products in the line.</li>
            <li>guess its a good product but for me it made my skin burn using it with other products.</li>
            <li>Beautiful skin begins with prevention, I&#x27;ve already seen enough improvements that I will continue to use this serum daily.</li>
            <li>The eye dropper actually makes it very easy to get the right amount of serum out (unlike the pumps)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any one looking to smooth out your skin and protect it against time and pollutants.</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly, and leaves my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more absorbent and the natural ingredients really make a difference.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t delay her daily routine, and that it&#x27;s very light on her skin</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning with my sunscreen, then again at night with moisturizer, and it seems my smile lines are less prominent than they were!</li>
            <li>For me, it is like giving my pores a huge shot of Vit C, with organic and natural ingredients and Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>I never expected vitamin c to break me out especially from a good manufacturing company</li>
            <li>Purchased at discount for testing, at first I exceeded the recommended amount and found it irritated my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have started getting complements from people on how smooth and clear my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more even and toned all around as opposed to some red splotches that I used to have.</li>
            <li>This is great for anyone who is noticing the signs of aging on their face &amp; want to maintain that youthful look as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle of this serum</li>
            <li>Many helpful tips left for use.  </li>
            <li>In my later life I have become more aware of chemicals and what they do to your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I recommend this product and hopefully, they make a bigger bottle and make it cheaper.:)</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum is exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>Your better off saving for a facial, glycolic peel or microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>I received the serum on Oct 1st and it has been exactly a month after which I am reviewing this product.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I see a big difference in fine lines but happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This is nice because I don&#x27;t wear foundation due to skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I started using Peak Vitamin C serum last month and have already seen noticeable improvements in my skin--it definitely has more of a glow, looks healthier, and fine lines have been reduced.</li>
            <li>I research pretty much everything I buy....</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and is absorbed right away, it is not tacky/sticky like some other Vitamin C products....</li>
            <li>began using it to diminish the appearances of some barely noticeable fine lines below my eyes, but nothing really happened.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and thus wrinkles faster than more oily skin (I believe) and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, and absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I believe that they really want you to be happy with their product and are willing to stand behind it.</li>
            <li>I am seeing a different in my fine lines after three weeks of using.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and looks terrific, smooth and tighter.</li>
            <li>40 in june!this stuff really works well</li>
            <li>Works nicely &amp; left skin smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This serum goes on light and instantly smooths!</li>
            <li>Like using this, dries fast.</li>
            <li>really counter-acts the effects on my skin with the concentrated Vitamin C treatment.</li>
            <li>products as it seems like everyone wants to put &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; in the title to catch attention and sell their stuff</li>
            <li>and once I add the whole routine of products my skin gets irritated.  </li>
            <li>and it has really helped my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvements.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks to this Vitamin C Serum, it deserves all  the credit. .</li>
            <li>I got this product because my skin is starting to get fine lines around my eyes which I feel is making me look older.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing synthetic lying on my skin that just sits there which was my problem with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;Something super cool-</li>
            <li>Compared to what similar (more expensive) products may charge, Peak&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is a good value to add to any aging-gracefully arsenal...</li>
            <li>With the combination of the 2, I have noticed less wrinkles and more fullness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is starting to help heal my acne that I have on my face and even making my overall skin look so much better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just got a little more acne</li>
            <li>This serum is clean, clear, has no odor, and I&#x27;ve reordered several times.  </li>
            <li>It really has worked wonders for my skin and now I want to use on my husband sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>I have now had a few days to use this product and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>But now I feel I can definitely say that Peak vitamin C Serum in conjunction with Christina Moss&#x27;s organic facial moisturizer has improved my 74 year old skin better than anything else I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>my smile lines were gone -- like totally gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews of products that don&#x27;t live up to what they promised.</li>
            <li>I have been using this at night in addition to a new organic cream I bought from Christina Moss.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>It has also made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re starting to run low on the 2nd bottle, order 2 more.</li>
            <li>The discoloration on my cheeks is almost gone completely!</li>
            <li>Am 46 years old with increasingly very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful not to use too much or put on certain areas because I will get breakouts</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And so reasonably priced for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>sun spots have faded considerably, and my face looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>And so reasonably priced for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Also, though some are natural they might not work for my mix oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>make my skin soft</li>
            <li>I will have to wait and watch of how far the effectiveness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed differences in my skin only after a few days for the better.</li>
            <li>I love this serum, and I have only been using a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been steadily using it daily for almost a month now</li>
            <li>have definitely noticed a difference in the firmness of the skin around my eyes, especially the outer corners where my skin most resembles crepe paper and has a few deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>They do on gently and with no stickiness nor detectable smell once dry.  </li>
            <li>Using this, along with the entire Christina Moss product line on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these three  products for as long as I live and</li>
            <li>I finish off my facial regime with extra virgin coconut oil (cold pressed) in lieu of facial moisturizer and am very pleased with how well the Peak Vitamin C Serum and coconut oil work together.  </li>
            <li>I am of Asian descent, in my mid 40s, and spent 8 yrs under the glorious Maui sun in my early 20s and never thought about sunscreen!</li>

            <li> I have started to noticed a difference in my skin, and I am glad I went with this product.</li>
            <li> Overall great serum!</li>
            <li> and I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> but since using this, it has been a lot better than before.</li>
            <li> Im sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and easy to apply on my face.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the serum is extremely light weight and goes on the skin very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a huge Kiehl&#x27;s &#x27;midnight recovery&#x27; fan but this serum is A LOT better.</li>
            <li> The product is lightweight and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> I think this was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> Another major plus is Peak Products great customer service.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used it and found it seems to improve my fine lines.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes have all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost three weeks as directed and have not seen a change in fine lines or my skin.</li>
            <li> I also love how it goes into my face so quickly.</li>
            <li> It leave my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I think this is a great product that I will continue to use regularly because it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really a scent to the product and you get a lot of serum for the price (and it comes in a glass bottle which is nice).  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and can be worn before bed or underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> After cleansing my face I apply this morning and night, and it glides on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It does have a good stretch which is why I gave it its current rating :)</li>
            <li> All in all good so far.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it&#x27;s all natural, is at an affordable price, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I apply it immediately after the shower in the morning and before going to bed on a clean face.</li>
            <li> I love this product SO much.</li>
            <li> Nongreasy and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> When you use it twice per day it can go quickly</li>
            <li> She likes that the product dries super quick</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> Love how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> Which is pretty remarkable as they were deep.  </li>
            <li> I also take Super Buffered Vitamin C and Calcium supplements which work together to build collagen.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, as well as with</li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly which was nice because when I order something I look forward to trying it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> I will update after use for a few weeks but so far I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin c serum for about 3 weeks now, and so far I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to find an anti-aging product that doesn&#x27;t either cause breakouts or irritation, until this product.  </li>
            <li> I even have some smile lines which are so visible.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed right into my skin.</li>
            <li> I just feel like my skin is even happier, if that was possible - since I started using this awesome product along with the other products in the line.</li>
            <li> guess its a good product but for me it made my skin burn using it with other products.</li>
            <li> Beautiful skin begins with prevention, I&#x27;ve already seen enough improvements that I will continue to use this serum daily.</li>
            <li> The eye dropper actually makes it very easy to get the right amount of serum out (unlike the pumps)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any one looking to smooth out your skin and protect it against time and pollutants.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly, and leaves my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more absorbent and the natural ingredients really make a difference.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t delay her daily routine, and that it&#x27;s very light on her skin</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning with my sunscreen, then again at night with moisturizer, and it seems my smile lines are less prominent than they were!</li>
            <li> For me, it is like giving my pores a huge shot of Vit C, with organic and natural ingredients and Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> I never expected vitamin c to break me out especially from a good manufacturing company</li>
            <li> Purchased at discount for testing, at first I exceeded the recommended amount and found it irritated my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have started getting complements from people on how smooth and clear my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more even and toned all around as opposed to some red splotches that I used to have.</li>
            <li> This is great for anyone who is noticing the signs of aging on their face &amp; want to maintain that youthful look as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of this serum</li>
            <li> Many helpful tips left for use.  </li>
            <li> In my later life I have become more aware of chemicals and what they do to your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product and hopefully, they make a bigger bottle and make it cheaper.:)</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> Your better off saving for a facial, glycolic peel or microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> I received the serum on Oct 1st and it has been exactly a month after which I am reviewing this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see a big difference in fine lines but happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is nice because I don&#x27;t wear foundation due to skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I started using Peak Vitamin C serum last month and have already seen noticeable improvements in my skin--it definitely has more of a glow, looks healthier, and fine lines have been reduced.</li>
            <li> I research pretty much everything I buy....</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and is absorbed right away, it is not tacky/sticky like some other Vitamin C products....</li>
            <li> began using it to diminish the appearances of some barely noticeable fine lines below my eyes, but nothing really happened.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and thus wrinkles faster than more oily skin (I believe) and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, and absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I believe that they really want you to be happy with their product and are willing to stand behind it.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a different in my fine lines after three weeks of using.  </li>
            <li> My face feels and looks terrific, smooth and tighter.</li>
            <li> 40 in june!this stuff really works well</li>
            <li> Works nicely &amp; left skin smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This serum goes on light and instantly smooths!</li>
            <li> Like using this, dries fast.</li>
            <li> really counter-acts the effects on my skin with the concentrated Vitamin C treatment.</li>
            <li> products as it seems like everyone wants to put &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; in the title to catch attention and sell their stuff</li>
            <li> and once I add the whole routine of products my skin gets irritated.  </li>
            <li> and it has really helped my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvements.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks to this Vitamin C Serum, it deserves all  the credit. .</li>
            <li> I got this product because my skin is starting to get fine lines around my eyes which I feel is making me look older.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing synthetic lying on my skin that just sits there which was my problem with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;Something super cool-</li>
            <li> Compared to what similar (more expensive) products may charge, Peak&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is a good value to add to any aging-gracefully arsenal...</li>
            <li> With the combination of the 2, I have noticed less wrinkles and more fullness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is starting to help heal my acne that I have on my face and even making my overall skin look so much better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just got a little more acne</li>
            <li> This serum is clean, clear, has no odor, and I&#x27;ve reordered several times.  </li>
            <li> It really has worked wonders for my skin and now I want to use on my husband sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I have now had a few days to use this product and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> But now I feel I can definitely say that Peak vitamin C Serum in conjunction with Christina Moss&#x27;s organic facial moisturizer has improved my 74 year old skin better than anything else I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> my smile lines were gone -- like totally gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews of products that don&#x27;t live up to what they promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night in addition to a new organic cream I bought from Christina Moss.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> It has also made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re starting to run low on the 2nd bottle, order 2 more.</li>
            <li> The discoloration on my cheeks is almost gone completely!</li>
            <li> Am 46 years old with increasingly very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to use too much or put on certain areas because I will get breakouts</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And so reasonably priced for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> sun spots have faded considerably, and my face looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> And so reasonably priced for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Also, though some are natural they might not work for my mix oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> make my skin soft</li>
            <li> I will have to wait and watch of how far the effectiveness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed differences in my skin only after a few days for the better.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and I have only been using a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been steadily using it daily for almost a month now</li>
            <li> have definitely noticed a difference in the firmness of the skin around my eyes, especially the outer corners where my skin most resembles crepe paper and has a few deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> They do on gently and with no stickiness nor detectable smell once dry.  </li>
            <li> Using this, along with the entire Christina Moss product line on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these three  products for as long as I live and</li>
            <li> I finish off my facial regime with extra virgin coconut oil (cold pressed) in lieu of facial moisturizer and am very pleased with how well the Peak Vitamin C Serum and coconut oil work together.  </li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent, in my mid 40s, and spent 8 yrs under the glorious Maui sun in my early 20s and never thought about sunscreen!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it makes my skin absolutely glow.  </li>
            <li> My skin was highly sensitive using this with other products, so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far been using this product everyday and starting to see a difference in only a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I havent used it long enoguh to see how well it works or anything</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel stretched or dry</li>
            <li> So I have been trying other products such as Burt&#x27;s Bees skin line.</li>
            <li> Face does not feel so dry.</li>
            <li> prone, sun spots and red sensitive skin at night and lately also in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Improvement is hard to evaluate because I am 81 years old</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> Only regret its a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Expensive products such as: Clinique, Stee Lauders, Angels, Bobby brown, and other tv offers.</li>
            <li> My skin was dull and blotchy prior to using this serum.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom since she has been saying lately that she feels like her outside appearance doesn&#x27;t match her youthful personality.</li>
            <li> While researching I found out that Dr. Ozz also recommended Vitamin C for dark spots and elasticity.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of usage, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems less rough</li>
            <li> and it did not higher my skin at all!</li>
            <li> that I feel sag are now feeling tighter and less saggy.</li>
            <li> but, I also haven&#x27;t been using it twice a day &amp; still have over a half of bottle of drops to go.  </li>
            <li> i still have the odd spot here and there</li>
            <li> , HOWEVER, I truly feel that this product is making my skin tighten up and getting rid of little wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin in a non-oily manner and it looks like the little wrinkles in the outer corners of my eyes are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Some products work for a little while</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is due to the cream or this but either way its working.  </li>
            <li> I like that it gave me no sensation, and I can see improvement within few applies.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy smoker and I can tell already&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> so I took a few days off of using the product.</li>
            <li> I am down to the last drops and I am sad it might take a while for me to repurchase this product because of</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling refreshed in this awful Minnesota deep freeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its working</li>
            <li> In my opinion a useless product - did nothing and has strange feel on skin...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s ridiculous the amount of people who are telling me I look like I&#x27;m 20, 22, 19, etc.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have nothing to say bad about the product.</li>
            <li> I have started to use this serum after I wash and tone my face using a glycolic acid base facial cleanser and toner.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a thin, silky blanket on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using retin a based on my esthetician&#x27;s advice and while the creping has not gone away, it has not gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I have furrow lines on my forehead and this have decreased in appearance.  </li>
            <li> I find it difficult to believe all the glowing reports it is receiving.</li>
            <li> Frustrated, as salon products were making me allergic to them as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it has good smell. after use it, my skin looks good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and easy to apply on my face.</li>
            <li> So far been using this product everyday and starting to see a difference in only a couple of days. It is starting to help heal my acne that I have on my face and even making my overall skin look so much better. Being a smoker anything that helps my skin is a big plus in my book. I will update after use for a few weeks but so far I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> After 3+ weeks of using it my face is smoother, brighter, and clearer.  I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to use too much or put on certain areas because I will get breakouts but that&#x27;s my sensitive skin. I never expected vitamin c to break me out especially from a good manufacturing company but like I said, that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light serum.   I have now had a few days to use this product and absolutely love it.  My face feels and looks terrific, smooth and tighter. For those of us over 60 this is a must have!</li>
            <li> works great,my skins glowing,today i was guessed to be 22,ill be 40 in june!this stuff really works well&lt;br /&gt;received for discounted price for my review</li>
            <li> Works nicely &amp; left skin smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR PROVIDING AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff is awesome! A great serum that does a great job! My skin feels perfect after using it! And my skin looks great! And so reasonably priced for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on light and instantly smooths! Dries very quickly, and leaves my skin soft all day. The eye dropper actually makes it very easy to get the right amount of serum out (unlike the pumps) so I&#x27;m not wasting any when I use it. I did get a discount off the list price thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this! I just feel like my skin is even happier, if that was possible - since I started using this awesome product along with the other products in the line.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin c serum for about 3 weeks now, and so far I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My sun spots have faded considerably, and my face looks brighter.  I use the&lt;br /&gt;Christina Moss facial wash and the moisturizer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with&lt;br /&gt;the products.  I will continue to use these three  products for as long as I live and&lt;br /&gt;can afford them.  I think they are a great value, since it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of&lt;br /&gt;product for the results I get.  Kenny, the CEO  is a great customer service person.&lt;br /&gt;He wants to make sure you are happy with the product, but he is in not  pushy.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you like the products as well as I do.</li>
            <li> Great for my face! My skin feels a lot smoother. A little goes a long way as well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased at discount for testing, at first I exceeded the recommended amount and found it irritated my cheeks.  Since then I&#x27;ve used it and found it seems to improve my fine lines.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I like that it gave me no sensation, and I can see improvement within few applies. Really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Like using this, dries fast. I have very dry skin and it helps with that. Face does not feel so dry.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I will be sixty in a couple of months so dealing with aging skin.  When I don&#x27;t use the C Serum I notice a big difference in a couple of days.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling moisturized. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin yet I can tell it&#x27;s working. Nongreasy and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum is clean, clear, has no odor, and I&#x27;ve reordered several times.  This is great for the price point and the way my skin looks.  I love it.</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff is awesome! A great serum that does a great job! My skin feels perfect after using it! And my skin looks great! And so reasonably priced for such a quality product. There are so many expensive products like this on the market that it&#x27;s refreshing to get a quality one for a price I can afford! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I am pleased with it.  Improvement is hard to evaluate because I am 81 years old but I intend to keep using it for now.</li>
            <li> I tried t his on my face and it does smell nice and feels refreshing. I havent used it long enoguh to see how well it works or anything but it does seem to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> The Peak Vitamin C Serum works wonders for my face and neck area.  I love this product!  I have started getting complements from people on how smooth and clear my skin looks.  It feels great on my skin also.  I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. The product is lightweight and easy to absorb. It leave my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt on my skin....wasn&#x27;t to greasy.</li>
            <li> This serum did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed differences in my skin only after a few days for the better. I am a heavy smoker and I can tell already&lt;br /&gt;it really counter-acts the effects on my skin with the concentrated Vitamin C treatment.</li>
            <li> Camelia here, writing from Brandon&#x27;s amazon account again... I&#x27;m reviewing the Vitamin C Serum as I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while now. I apply it after my shower, before I moisturize and definitely before make-up application. I&#x27;m always weary about those &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products as it seems like everyone wants to put &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; in the title to catch attention and sell their stuff, HOWEVER, I truly feel that this product is making my skin tighten up and getting rid of little wrinkles. Given I don&#x27;t have a ton of them, but every woman knows what her face looks like under a microscope, and let&#x27;s put it this way... I NEED anti-aging serum. This stuff is it. I&#x27;m actually pretty obsessed with it. My skin is dry and thus wrinkles faster than more oily skin (I believe) and what this serum does to my face is incredible! It moisturizes my skin in a non-oily manner and it looks like the little wrinkles in the outer corners of my eyes are disappearing. My skin looks more even and toned all around as opposed to some red splotches that I used to have. Areas of my face (under my chin specifically) that I feel sag are now feeling tighter and less saggy. When I look in the mirror now I don&#x27;t think &amp;#34;ugh I look old&amp;#34; anymore. I think &amp;#34;Is it just me or do I look younger?&amp;#34;... The only difference is the Vitamin C Serum and I apply it twice per day. Once in the morning after my shower, prior to the Christina Moss Naturals moisturizer + make-up, and once at the end of the day after I wash my face for bed. When you use it twice per day it can go quickly so I&#x27;d recommend buying 2 bottles at once. When you&#x27;re starting to run low on the 2nd bottle, order 2 more. Worth every penny. And be generous in your application! Face and neck... Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 so I&#x27;m not yet developing wrinkles.  I&#x27;m using this as a preventative measure along with the Christina Moss face wash and moisturizer.  I love applying this serum.  A little goes a long way, and it makes my skin absolutely glow.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found these products, and I know every time I use them, that I am doing something great for my skin!</li>
            <li> love the smell and love how is feels on my skin..My skin just drinks it in..Love everything about this product..skins feels great and lines not so prominent..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost a month and think it&#x27;s a pretty effective product! I use it in the morning with my sunscreen, then again at night with moisturizer, and it seems my smile lines are less prominent than they were! Compared to what similar (more expensive) products may charge, Peak&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is a good value to add to any aging-gracefully arsenal...</li>
            <li> I got this product because my skin is starting to get fine lines around my eyes which I feel is making me look older. I have been using Peak Products Vitamin C Serum for over a month now &amp; I have noticed the area around my eyes looking more youthful. It is rejuvenating my skin so I feel amazing. This is great for anyone who is noticing the signs of aging on their face &amp; want to maintain that youthful look as long as possible. I am buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I have started to use this serum after I wash and tone my face using a glycolic acid base facial cleanser and toner.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for about 2 months and can definitely tell a difference!  I&#x27;m amazed how it has smoothed out the fine lines around my eyes and reduced the deeper lines!  I will definitely continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> My stats - Age:  40 - Gender:  Female - Skin condition:  Crows feet, some deeper wrinkles around eyes, sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely noticed a difference in the firmness of the skin around my eyes, especially the outer corners where my skin most resembles crepe paper and has a few deeper wrinkles.  The serum is silky smooth, glides on very nicely, and soaks in rather quickly. I finish off my facial regime with extra virgin coconut oil (cold pressed) in lieu of facial moisturizer and am very pleased with how well the Peak Vitamin C Serum and coconut oil work together.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, as well as with the great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom since she has been saying lately that she feels like her outside appearance doesn&#x27;t match her youthful personality. I recently went and her dinner with dinner and her she just looked younger like she was glowing from the inside out, i asked if she had been doing anything differently and she just said shes been using this product twice a day under her moisturizer. She likes that the product dries super quick so it doesn&#x27;t delay her daily routine, and that it&#x27;s very light on her skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel like she has anything extra on her face. I feel like not only has this product help my mom physically but it&#x27;s also given her back some of that youthful confidence. I&#x27;m glad that I decided to take advantage of the discounted price in exchange for a review, will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Great stuff</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Vitamin C after doing the research on this type of C.....great product. I research pretty much everything I buy....I can&#x27;t help myself...I just do. This product goes on easily and is absorbed right away, it is not tacky/sticky like some other Vitamin C products....I will purchase again and again, I have been using this for about a week along with the Christina Moss moisturizer and I really love both products.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so I was hesitant to try this product. So very glad I did. It&#x27;s very light but moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;and seems to brighten my skin instantly. It has also made my skin very soft. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night in addition to a new organic cream I bought from Christina Moss.  With the combination of the 2, I have noticed less wrinkles and more fullness in my skin.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week now and can tell a noticeable difference.  It soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling refreshed in this awful Minnesota deep freeze. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin but, I also haven&#x27;t been using it twice a day &amp; still have over a half of bottle of drops to go.  The item arrived quickly and packaged well.  I&#x27;ll give an update on the product once I&#x27;ve finished the serum drops.  They do on gently and with no stickiness nor detectable smell once dry.  It leaves a thin, silky blanket on the skin.  I do believe this is protecting my skin from antioxidant damage just because of the ingredients that are in it.  I put it on only after my skin has been cleansed.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin using this  product it is like applying sticky water to the skin. I find it difficult to believe all the glowing reports it is receiving. will not be wasting my money on this product again and would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Works for awhile. Not an eraser.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of this serum and I will be ordering again, in a bigger bottle if poss! I am of Asian descent, in my mid 40s, and spent 8 yrs under the glorious Maui sun in my early 20s and never thought about sunscreen! In the last 5 yrs or so I&#x27;ve noticed a dullness in my skin as well as creping around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using retin a based on my esthetician&#x27;s advice and while the creping has not gone away, it has not gotten worse. Since I started using this vitamin c serum, my face looks brighter, feels more supple, and I&#x27;m still hoping that the fine lines under and around my eyes will lessen! Regardless, I think this is a great product that I will continue to use regularly because it makes my skin feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the customer service is impeccable. I believe that they really want you to be happy with their product and are willing to stand behind it. The response time to my questions were almost immediate, and followed up later to ensure satisfaction. I&#x27;m really glad I gave it a try and I hope you do too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its working just yet so I&#x27;ll be back to leave another review. It does have a good stretch which is why I gave it its current rating :)</li>
            <li> Almost instantly I noticed a change on the face. As I continued to use it, it soften my face and made some of my wrinkles disappear. I also love how it goes into my face so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day and have received compliments on how much better my skin looks.  Just ordered my second bottle.  Arrived promptly and in good condition.  Many helpful tips left for use.  Very very pleased.</li>
            <li> The dropper is nice and the bottle is pleasant. Used it with a derma roller and it soaks in nicely</li>
            <li> Second bottle. Love how soft and smooth my skin is. Amazing product I use it morning and night. Fine lines are diminished and my skin has a nice dewey glow to it. Love love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews of products that don&#x27;t live up to what they promised. I believed that if you have nothing nice to say just don&#x27;t say anything at all.  Am 46 years old with increasingly very sensitive skin.  Acne and  melias&#x27; prone, sun spots and red sensitive skin at night and lately also in the mornings.  I used to use anything on my skin.  Expensive products such as: Clinique, Stee Lauders, Angels, Bobby brown, and other tv offers. Also over the counter such as Neutrogena, Oil of Olay and others)  In my later life I have become more aware of chemicals and what they do to your skin.  So I have been trying other products such as Burt&#x27;s Bees skin line. Some products work for a little while and once I add the whole routine of products my skin gets irritated.  I didn&#x27;t know what worked and what didn&#x27;t.  Also, though some are natural they might not work for my mix oily skin. Frustrated, as salon products were making me allergic to them as well. I researched and read many reviews. I came across this Vitamin C recommended by Christina Moss&#x27;s organic moisturizer. While researching I found out that Dr. Ozz also recommended Vitamin C for dark spots and elasticity. The woman who has been doing my facials for three years kept asking me to use it along with Gycolic acid.  but I thought she was just trying to sell me yet another product. Well, I have been using this product in combination with Christina Moss&#x27;s moisturizer for four weeks and it has really helped my skin.  I now can go out the door in the morning without being embarrassed because my red and patchy skin.  It really has worked wonders for my skin and now I want to use on my husband sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it to diminish the appearances of some barely noticeable fine lines below my eyes, but nothing really happened. I took before and after pictures for a month and nothing changed at all. I also used it on my acne to see if it would diminish acne scars but again, nothing. I didn&#x27;t notice anything or any changes in my skin at all. I just got a little more acne but I don&#x27;t want to blame this product as I don&#x27;t know if this was the cause of my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wanted to love this product but I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvements.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I use this under the Christina Moss moisturizer and I have seen a noticeable difference in my face.  Not sure if it is due to the cream or this but either way its working.  I have furrow lines on my forehead and this have decreased in appearance.  Which is pretty remarkable as they were deep.  Love it and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Excellent... Five stars....  I am seeing a different in my fine lines after three weeks of using.  Love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product works well, my skin feels great and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I used this for over a 3 days before I noticed anything besides moisturizing which was instant! I have sensitive skin and it did not higher my skin at all! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product! No stinging or burning. Using this, along with the entire Christina Moss product line on my sensitive skin. Hope they continue making their products.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands. Not sure if I see a big difference in fine lines but happy with the results.</li>
            <li> As a guy I&#x27;m always looking for great products for my skin.  I really like this product because it&#x27;s all natural, is at an affordable price, and it works great.  My skin feels softer and just looks better.  I was reading in Grooming Secrets For Men at thestylishman. com site that I should be using a serum so I tried this one and am glad I did.  It also arrived quickly which was nice because when I order something I look forward to trying it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Loving it already reordered and told all my friends!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 3 week and I like it! I have started to noticed a difference in my skin, and I am glad I went with this product. It is natural and safe. No harsh chemicals. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent! The discoloration on my cheeks is almost gone completely! I have been using this product for about 10 days, once a day, at night, after I cleanse with Christina Moss face wash. The two go together perfectly. I follow up by using jojoba oil as a moisturizer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this serum in combination with the Christina Moss Naturals moisturizer, morning and night, and it feels great.  It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, and absorbs into my skin quickly.  I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to find an anti-aging product that doesn&#x27;t either cause breakouts or irritation, until this product.  After a few weeks of usage, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems less rough and my pores have shrunk.  This is nice because I don&#x27;t wear foundation due to skin irritation.  There isn&#x27;t really a scent to the product and you get a lot of serum for the price (and it comes in a glass bottle which is nice).  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and am looking into buying more from this company.  Overall, I have nothing to say bad about the product.</li>
            <li> I have waited to write so as to be sure I am as enthusiastic as there has seemed reason to be. But now I feel I can definitely say that Peak vitamin C Serum in conjunction with Christina Moss&#x27;s organic facial moisturizer has improved my 74 year old skin better than anything else I have tried over the years. I plan to settle on these two products for every day use.</li>
            <li> excellent product! make my skin soft</li>
            <li> Overall great serum! Goes on smoothly and can be worn before bed or underneath makeup. I highly recommend this to any one looking to smooth out your skin and protect it against time and pollutants. Beautiful skin begins with prevention, I&#x27;ve already seen enough improvements that I will continue to use this serum daily.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for three weeks and I am so pleased with the results. My skin was dull and blotchy prior to using this serum. I even have some smile lines which are so visible. After a week of using the serum, I already saw the results such as lightening of sun spots and my smile lines were gone -- like totally gone. There were times though I had some break outs so I took a few days off of using the product. I am down to the last drops and I am sad it might take a while for me to repurchase this product because of it&#x27;s price. I knocked one star off though because I had been trying to diminish the wrinkles around my neck area, but have not seem any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product and hopefully, they make a bigger bottle and make it cheaper.:)</li>
            <li> Great product, with be using again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she likes it. Only regret its a small bottle.</li>
            <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> My skin has actually improved! i have teenager skin at the grand age of 30! i still have the odd spot here and there but since using this, it has been a lot better than before.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a short while, and have not had any issues.  My skin looks good.</li>
            <li> I love this product SO much. I&#x27;ve been steadily using it daily for almost a month now and I can noticeably see that my skin looks clearer and smoother. The fine lines around my eyes have all but disappeared. I used to be a huge Kiehl&#x27;s &#x27;midnight recovery&#x27; fan but this serum is A LOT better. It&#x27;s way more absorbent and the natural ingredients really make a difference. There&#x27;s nothing synthetic lying on my skin that just sits there which was my problem with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;Something super cool- I just hit the big 30 and with the recent use of this product, it&#x27;s ridiculous the amount of people who are telling me I look like I&#x27;m 20, 22, 19, etc. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have used this product only 2 weeks but I feel my face is smoother. Wrinkles will take time to fade away Im sure. I have read where Vitamin C together with hyaluronic acid is a combination successful in ridding wrinkles &amp; age spots.  This company had great references so I am giving it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I think this was too strong for my skin. My skin was highly sensitive using this with other products, so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its a good product but for me it made my skin burn using it with other products.</li>
            <li> I started using Peak Vitamin C serum last month and have already seen noticeable improvements in my skin--it definitely has more of a glow, looks healthier, and fine lines have been reduced. Will 100% be continuing to use this product as part of my day/night skin regiment. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like the fountain of youth. It&#x27;s great, its absorbant and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Very good results with Vitamin C serum, my eustachian recommends buying only products with Hyaluronic Acid - nothing else works.  I also take Super Buffered Vitamin C and Calcium supplements which work together to build collagen. Without Calcium, Vitamin C will not work. I love it that we have all these wonderful products, choices and reviews on Amazon!</li>
            <li> In my opinion a useless product - did nothing and has strange feel on skin...</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and I have only been using a few days. This Vitamin C Serum is exactly what I wanted and needed. After cleansing my face I apply this morning and night, and it glides on so smoothly. The serum does not leave any sticky,  tacky feeling. It is absorbed right into my skin. My husband asked me,  what I was doing to my complexion,  as it was radiant, and glowing. Thanks to this Vitamin C Serum, it deserves all  the credit. . For me, it is like giving my pores a huge shot of Vit C, with organic and natural ingredients and Hyaluronic Acid. This will be a permanent product in my daily skin care regimen.  Another major plus is Peak Products great customer service.</li>
            <li> On occasion you see a bargain. However, you get what you pay for. I have used this product for almost three weeks as directed and have not seen a change in fine lines or my skin. Your better off saving for a facial, glycolic peel or microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this , you must purchase and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy</li>
            <li> I received the serum on Oct 1st and it has been exactly a month after which I am reviewing this product. I have some acne scaring (pitted) and wanted to use this serum to see if it smoothens out the texture of the skin (especially healing the scars).&lt;br /&gt;Well, I must say it definitely does the job. My scars appear visibly healed.  The redness of the scars has faded.  I apply it immediately after the shower in the morning and before going to bed on a clean face. I layer it with some gel based moisturizer However, it has been only a month of trial.  I will have to wait and watch of how far the effectiveness goes.(i.e Does it have a plateau stage?).  The texture of the serum is extremely light weight and goes on the skin very smoothly.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel stretched or dry (Sometimes I don&#x27;t even use moisturizer).  All in all good so far.</li>
