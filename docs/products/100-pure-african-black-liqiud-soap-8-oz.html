            <li>Great for rashes and acne too</li>
            <li>Reason why I am giving this 3 stars is because although it is a great product, it isn&#x27;t liquid.</li>

            <li>Great for cleaning my face, I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 14</li>
            <li>Heard a lot of great things about this soap.</li>
            <li>lol eh.</li>
            <li>product is probably great for the summer, but during the fall/winter season, it&#x27;s a bit too drying on the skin.</li>
            <li>I can not begin to tell you how much money this product is saving us!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>But it was a good start.</li>
            <li>But then for some its a good thing because&lt;</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good my skin is looking.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me every since my acne prone skin experienced an allergic reaction to a popular acne skin care system about six months.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I wished.</li>
            <li>I ordered it as a face wash, but it did so good on my face, that I decided to try it in the shower</li>
            <li>you good seller</li>
            <li>Yes it is good for the skin and the skin and revitalizes also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good more nice tank</li>
            <li>Cleans exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Although this is more of a gel than a liquid, I have gotten great results from using this product.</li>
            <li>, I loved it so much as a body wash, I decided to try it as a shampoo, again , AWESOME  results..</li>
            <li>The first month so that I had this, it worked great for me!</li>
            <li>and I have learned from this, &amp;#34;you better believe that !</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found it here!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutley LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>

            <li>and my face already looks better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic for those of us who have bravely ventured into the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; (no shampoo/chemicals/products) world.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The lather was amazing.</li>
            <li>This is another product I am not to thrilled about.</li>
            <li>I kind of had no idea what</li>
            <li>a nice boar-hair brush (like the kind used for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>the brush nice and wet.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>well I&#x27;ll be honest...</li>
            <li>His skin is looking really nice.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to add something to it to make it my own.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely though and works well for the dog&#x27;s bath.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love it on my skin, it cleanses really good without making it dehydrated and paper-like.</li>
            <li>Ive gone natural !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is great, has a nice texture and smells really clean.</li>
            <li>good product ...lathers well and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your sking feeling fantastic and so clean!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the consistency fool you, because it is a lot better than it looks.</li>
            <li>She said that it broke her even more.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is serves many purposes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But my acne hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.</li>
            <li>That one has more ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that I can order this to my home now since I am no longer in NY.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the bar variety.</li>
            <li>this helps someone :).</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my third time buying this soap, it is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I ended up having to spend more money</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the product, and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>just preference I guess:)</li>
            <li>Will get more soon.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the soap.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Idk if this is authentic</li>
            <li>It works well, but with the bottle I am pouring more than I feel I need to use and there is no flip top to lessen the usage.</li>
            <li>I have been using this  for more than a week now, and I am in love with this product..</li>
            <li>Nothing else has changed in their regimen, so I can safely attribute their much-healed skin to this</li>
            <li>I will get more when I need it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the balck soap is more of a gel than a liquid.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with it for my face and body.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Need to order more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Organic\\&quot; worked better for my skin b/c</li>
            <li>it is not as potent as this product .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this liquid soap.</li>
            <li>Its more a glue.</li>
            <li>I can say that it lathers pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and in nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It will have your body squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>Excellant product, I have used Black soap and it is the best soap for the price and is especially good for facial scrub</li>
            <li>This flattens out huge pimples magically.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great product and my skin hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts since I have been using this on both my face and my body and then moisturizing with 100% natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is a great natural soap that can lather face,hair, &amp; everything you think of without worrying abt chemical, mineral oil or sls.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I had an inkling these soaps would be great on my sensitive, breakout prone skin</li>
            <li>My skin loves me again &amp; has a clear nice healthy glow!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this soap on Harlem and immediately fell in love with what it did for my skin!</li>
            <li>And the box it came in was fine</li>
            <li>I find the smell completely inoffensive and even pleasant...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted to have found a natural product that works!</li>
            <li>Seems strange at 1st but really good!</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel since it takes so little.</li>
            <li>I get a huge pimple.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was so bizarre looking that wanted to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s both of them working together -- but either way, the result is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I say it is a great alternative to using commercial acne prevent/control products.  </li>
            <li>I also have an oily scalp, I mixed this with some shampoo, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The prices here are very good compared to the other site.</li>
            <li>Even with only washing my face once a day, the improvements are astonishing!!</li>
            <li>I have an acne prone face it healed my face from the first week!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>which I was incredibly excited about.</li>
            <li>I have two permanent scars on both sides of my face that look like laugh line indentations from using this soap after two weeks!  </li>
            <li>Worth getting!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it might work well for some, but unfortunately not me.</li>
            <li>It leaves you smelling clean.</li>
            <li>and it is really clean</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I honestly cant get enough and my daughter who has eczema is able to use this soap when I mix it with the Shea Oil.</li>
            <li>For me it has a clean soap smell</li>
            <li>Gets my face squeaky clean</li>
            <li>but I DO care about how well they clean and if they make your skin like a papyrus after using it on your face or if they clean without harm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like this soap gets skin clean</li>
            <li>I have tried everything, and this stuff is just the right stuff for my kind of achne (a large amount of uder-skin achne for anyone who is wondering)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading many positive reviews on this soap, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>The key to ensure that you receive optimal results when using this is to use a good moisturizer after you clean your face with this soap.</li>
            <li>wow, works amazing.</li>
            <li>I really really really wanted to like this item because its better for the environment</li>
            <li>My face feels super clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>love this soap, really works you can feel it working.  </li>
            <li>love it so much I&#x27;ll buy and re-buy.....</li>
            <li>But if you want pure black soap, and aren&#x27;t bothered by the appearance, this is one of the best deals you can get.</li>
            <li>If I could recommend something to make it better, add an essential oil to it to make it smell better and package it in something shower friendly.</li>
            <li>Again I think this would be right for people who have huge pimples or severe acne.</li>
            <li>pretty much every kind of sulfate and parabin free face cleansing program available at Target and Whole</li>
            <li>Overall it makes your skin feel nice, clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it is so mild.</li>
            <li>have oily skin and this has helped me tremendously with controlling the oil my face produces.</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time and it was wrapped perfectly, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the fact that it&#x27;s an add on item, I only wanted the soap</li>
            <li>Also when I was threading my chin for the first time, I got HUGE bumps all over.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural alternative to commercial facial cleaners and this met my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>The baking soda/water method of washing leaves a lot to be desired but this black liquid soap lathers perfectly and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a peculiar color, but the odor is gentle and slightly sweet...and, best of all, I now have smooth soft skin again.</li>
            <li>Once this cleared, as the soap deeply cleansed my pores of the gunk that was piled up in there, my skin has been radiant and amazing.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;it keeps it fresh inside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Anyone who battles acne should try this soap to build a nice &amp; simple regimen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After 3 weeks of use, my skin is fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I would love to have it in a 32 oz or more size container!!!</li>
            <li>The bumps on the right side of my face flattened and went away.</li>
            <li>The soap looks a little different from what I was expecting however, my skin feels great after I wash and moisturize, and it looks brighter and more even each day.</li>
            <li>waaay better than the black charcoal soaps that are suppose to be better than this..</li>
            <li>African black soap is the BEST , unrefined and pure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent quality!!!!!!!!  I can already see how the black soap has cleared up my facial</li>
            <li>I imagine if you used it on your entire body it would get used up much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>For me I find it to be more mild (than the solid)</li>
            <li>and when I mix the African Shea Oil with it-it is more mild than Dove soap.</li>
            <li>It is so moisturizing, I no longer have to use a conditioner, my hair looks beautiful and is full of body and bounce, my dry itchy skin is also a thing of the past, and my face, looks better than it has in years...</li>
            <li>Lathers great and is just what you need to remove makeup without being harsh to the skin!</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;soap\\&quot; is absolutely amazing it makes my skin sooo smooth, it cleared up my tiny red blemishes AND in conjunction with my 100% pure, organic Coffee bean eye cream, it smoothed out my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Good quality black soap paste.  </li>
            <li>mixed face washes and toners from the Body Shop which were good but didn&#x27;t give me results anywhere near this soap, Proactive Solution which didn&#x27;t work for me, and</li>
            <li>This soap seems to work very well, after the first use my face softer than it had been in ages!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been consistent with using this product but the times that I have used it</li>
            <li>I will definitely be a lifetime customer. :)</li>
            <li>I also purchased the solid form hopefully that will work better than this.</li>
            <li>At first it was off-putting because it was the consistency of tamarind paste</li>
            <li>We will be ordering again as we run out of this first tub.  </li>
            <li>I expected this to be a miracle product to be honest.    </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s funny is my mom told me to stay away from Palm Oil on my face.</li>
            <li>It is a drying soap, however it was exactly what my oily skin needed.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get more out of the solid pack.</li>
            <li>after a lifetime of soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend money on useless creams when this works best</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use a few times a week to get an extremely deep clean.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this 100% Pure African Liquid Soap.</li>
            <li>It looks like jam in a jar but clears blackheads, tightens pores, removes dead skin my skin is soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>I have started using it with my Clairsonic brush for a super deep clean.</li>
            <li>I have gotten off accurate about 6 months ago, had amazing skin and decided I wanted to try a new face soap and since I&#x27;ve heard such a amazing things about black African soap, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>However, it does lather really well and makes my skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Even as a solid, the wax is soft enough to mix into a liquid in a bottle with warm water, which I also use to shower and bath, also makes both my face body smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have been dealing with pretty profound hormonal acne for a couple of years now, and have tried almost everything to clear it up, including three or four different brands of acne cleanser/toner/cream combinations, and then the oil cleansing method of natural skin care (which did make my skin more healthy and radiant, but did not stop my break</li>
            <li>I do not use it daily, feeling it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>When I was just using the eye cream and a different face wash my fine lines were still there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unusable really.</li>
            <li>I do not see much difference.  </li>
            <li>It creates luxurious suds to really soften your skin and relieve any itching.</li>
            <li>has become a staple in my house and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>My husband now loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this stuff--</li>
            <li>It exfoliates the skin on my feet and my back feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really help me at all.</li>
            <li>It turns out I really like it.  </li>
            <li>i always like to wash mah face with this here soap, i have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m seeing miraculous results in the way of relief from acne, I&#x27;m still breaking out but not as much.  </li>
            <li>so I should probably listen to her (haha).     </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and it really helps control the oil on my face.  </li>
            <li>a 4 out of 5 is because it&#x27;s very waxy.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very fair-skinned with lots of allergies and sensitivities).</li>
            <li>Using it, will see how well it is really.</li>
            <li>Really helped with combination skin.</li>
            <li>I feel I am not getting as much product as I was expecting in that state.</li>
            <li>have had acne my whole life and am now 31 still dealing with blemishes and hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>and it does not take much if you&#x27;re just washing your face.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nature and Herbs</li>
            <li>FAST shipping too</li>
            <li>This is VERY runny.  </li>
            <li>The package should really be redesigned.</li>
            <li>As for my body, it really controlled my body odor.</li>
            <li>My daughter has acne and it clears her face and back smooth with no blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much about the scent, I &amp;#34;douse&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>i love the smell its not too fragrant like some other soaps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other products besides these two for my skin and it has never looked better.</li>
            <li>but it seems to last a while too which is economical for me!</li>
            <li>I really wanted it for my skin as a more natural product during my pregnancy but see myself using this long after.</li>
            <li>I sleep with makeup on, will sometimes run out the door applying new make up over old, and more often only wash my face once a day rather than two.</li>
            <li>so this small bottle will last 2-3 months which is a great</li>
            <li>I found that the only soap that doesn&#x27;t make me break out is Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day.</li>
            <li>Ive had better pure african back soap...</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a true liquid soap next time</li>
            <li>I love the thick rich lather and the soft skin I get after my shower.</li>
            <li>The soap is wonderful, I live in the desert and we have very hard water and very dry skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does clear imperfect skin!</li>
            <li>I normally use Kirks Castile soap or Ivory, and I find these to be more drying than the Black soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this soap and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The high quality product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy the solid one as you can control how much you use and a tiny bit really does do a lot.</li>
            <li>It is a great way to use this soap, especially  for those who do not use black soap daily,</li>
            <li>, I have noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my acne scars, my pores are smaller, and my skin is incredibly soft and taught.  </li>
            <li>The real test comes when my 15 and 20 year old boys use it, they have some mild acne to get rid of, I will update later.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and smooth, it really does help with any imperfections you may have, I have dry skin in the winter and it has helped a lot, my daughter has started using it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think any other product could have done that, and very quickly too.    </li>
            <li>I used it almost every morning and night, and my face started to clear up really fast.</li>
            <li>and my makeup would be very shiny by the early morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap before and was surprised to see it listed here at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It runs out of the bottle far too fast.  </li>
            <li>and I heard it to be more harsh.</li>
            <li>how amazing African Black soap is.</li>
            <li>Black soap is amazing overall .</li>
            <li>African black soap is one of the most pure soaps on Earth.</li>
            <li>I used to live in Brooklyn, NY where I could go to Fulton street and buy it from vendors on the street.</li>
            <li>have been using this product for about a month, and I am absolutely astonished at how much my skin has improved in that short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I am an older woman with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has returned to its former smooth texture, slurping up the moisturizer like it did in the old, younger days.  </li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne and this cleared my skin in about a week and does not leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li>I love black soap and have tried many different brands including using bricks of the raw soap.  </li>
            <li>I used to purchase this in New York all the time, it always clears my skin up and makes it really soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how this one natural product cares for my skin better than the most expensive, doctor prescribed, commonly used products available to us.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>i love this liquid soap i made 3 bottles of shampoo with it using distilled water and 3 different size bottles small medium and large from some leftover shampoos.</li>
            <li>Other reviews said that it smells good, I personally couldn&#x27;t smell anything it didn&#x27;t smell good or bad</li>
            <li>I think a bag/sack with a spout would have been easier and mess free.</li>
            <li>but once you wet it down it foams up very nicely and super thick.</li>
            <li>It smells different than the shea moisture black soap, but I think this one works a tad bit better.</li>
            <li>This brand is good in that it isn&#x27;t as drying as some of the black soaps can be and isn&#x27;t as messy as the bricks.</li>
            <li>Thick pudding consistency but the same STRONG antiseptic authentic soap I expected..</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so clear.</li>
            <li>but my mother has clear skin</li>
            <li>Assuming that this soap traveled clear from Africa before shipping to me...</li>
            <li>Has clear my acne</li>
            <li>So, while it has worked amazingly for me, I had to take about a week from using it, and my face is slowly going back to being oily and not dried out.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap,in hopes that it will help me in battle against adult acne and oily/ combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this 3 times so far and will continue to use it for life.</li>
            <li>However, my 15 year old daughter whom is suffering from hormonal acne and has freqent breakouts and sensitive skin, has not done well at all with the soap.</li>
            <li>i would give this a 5 star thanks for this product i will be a constant buyer.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and it never dried out my skin</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I started using this my skin changed completely.</li>
            <li>I had adult acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working on my 14 year old skin.</li>
            <li>It did make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li>from somebody that uses all natural product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I thought it would not , since it is natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult and have oily sensitive skin and blackheads.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my sensitive skin, but this soap made me break out...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even been two weeks and already nearly all of my hormonal acne is gone and my skin looks lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li>It only takes a pea sized amount if even that much to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>It came as shown in picture, smells like old soap...</li>
            <li>Only requires a pea-sized amount -- if you use any more than that, it&#x27;s just a waste.</li>
            <li>The product is good but the shopping and handing is expensive</li>
            <li>approximately 1/3 warm water&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my first African Black Soap from Smoky Mountain Minerals and they are much much higher than any of the sites I&#x27;ve found here.</li>
            <li>Okay- 1st let me say if the solid AFRICAN BLACK SOAP didnt work for you please give the liquid a try.</li>
            <li>I love it, and it only take a small amount to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does burn a little, but not badly.</li>
            <li>This was the first time that I received by delivery and it came sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>The African soap help dries out acne and return skin to normal.</li>
            <li>Since this soap really cleans you face and removes all oil, you need to apply a moisturizer to balance out your skin or your face will become too dry and eventually your face will try to compensate for this dryness by over producing oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you try it long enough, you will see  results, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li>So try using it every other day at first, rather than using it day and night like I did.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed and shocked that doctors don&#x27;t prescribe or mention it!</li>
            <li>It is pretty drying, I suggest using it every other day.  </li>
            <li>The soap arrived 4 days later, just as pictured, the texture was very gooey, it smelled kind of like plastic, but its not in anyway offensive, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scent behind upon rinsing, I had read that it was drying in previous reviews, but it left my skin soft and clean, a little dry, but not too much.</li>
            <li>I usually use unscented products and this just smells clean, not like perfume.</li>
            <li>less like poop, you might want one of the more manufactured black soaps for sale here.</li>
            <li>The first week or so, my skin purged a bit, and I had small bumps on my face, particularly on my forehead, and two cystic acne bumps on my jaw line.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to keep the lid on and it really is one of the few products where you only need a pea-size or less of product.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, I use natural yellow shea butter</li>
            <li>Package was crushed and pretty much destroyed which dried it out near the exposed parts.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using black soap</li>
            <li>THIS NOT MY FIRST TIME USING BLACK SOAP,</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and not strong.</li>
            <li>I am truly amazed that something that costs $8 could have such a profound effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t moisturize afterwards, my skin can feel slightly dry -- but not nearly as dry or tight-feeling as normal</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a little drying, but I just follow-up with a gentle natural serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does lay my cystic pimple flat but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li>After realizing how little it takes to wash your face with, I went ahead and spooned about 2-month&#x27;s worth into a smaller jar -- one of those mini jam jars from a hotel.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 different types of black soap and I tried this one first.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my face, I felt a slight burning sensation on every open skin (popped pimples and scabs).</li>
            <li>My face also likes it as I&#x27;m starting to see my skin tone evening out better than other facial washes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Its also pretty messy...</li>
            <li>It would just heal any harsh acne on the first layer of your skin.    </li>
            <li>Takes a bit to get makeup off but still worth the effort because my skin is clearer and not all dried out!</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of purely liquid black liquid.</li>
            <li>It works well, now his acne is all gone, he is working on the scaring by washing with black soap and moisturizing with pure shea cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used african black soap, but I can tell you, it will not be my last..</li>
            <li>In my eternal quest to find a product that really works for acne, I discovered &amp;#34;African black soap.&amp;#34; My two teenagers have been using the soap for two weeks with noticeably improved results.</li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;simmer&amp;#34; for 15-30 seconds, I only do for this long as i feel it could burn my sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li>I like pure African black soap</li>
            <li>I love the fact I can buy the natural African black soap, this is less messy and it leaves my skin supple.</li>
            <li>Its very concentrated you only need a little.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, my skin is soft and healthy and glowing I have in the past spent triple the money</li>

            <li> I can not begin to tell you how much money this product is saving us!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> But it was a good start.</li>
            <li> But then for some its a good thing because&lt;</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good my skin is looking.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me every since my acne prone skin experienced an allergic reaction to a popular acne skin care system about six months.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I wished.</li>
            <li> I ordered it as a face wash, but it did so good on my face, that I decided to try it in the shower</li>
            <li> you good seller</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The lather was amazing.</li>
            <li> This is another product I am not to thrilled about.</li>
            <li> I kind of had no idea what</li>
            <li> a nice boar-hair brush (like the kind used for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> the brush nice and wet.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;ll be honest...</li>
            <li> His skin is looking really nice.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to add something to it to make it my own.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely though and works well for the dog&#x27;s bath.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I love it on my skin, it cleanses really good without making it dehydrated and paper-like.</li>
            <li> Ive gone natural !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is great, has a nice texture and smells really clean.</li>
            <li> good product ...lathers well and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>

            <li> Great product and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the consistency fool you, because it is a lot better than it looks.</li>
            <li> She said that it broke her even more.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that is serves many purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But my acne hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.</li>
            <li> That one has more ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that I can order this to my home now since I am no longer in NY.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the bar variety.</li>
            <li> this helps someone :).</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this soap, it is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I ended up having to spend more money</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the product, and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> just preference I guess:)</li>
            <li> Will get more soon.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the soap.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Idk if this is authentic</li>
            <li> It works well, but with the bottle I am pouring more than I feel I need to use and there is no flip top to lessen the usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this  for more than a week now, and I am in love with this product..</li>
            <li> Nothing else has changed in their regimen, so I can safely attribute their much-healed skin to this</li>
            <li> I will get more when I need it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the balck soap is more of a gel than a liquid.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with it for my face and body.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> Need to order more.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Organic\\&quot; worked better for my skin b/c</li>
            <li> it is not as potent as this product .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Its more a glue.</li>
            <li> I can say that it lathers pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> It will have your body squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> Excellant product, I have used Black soap and it is the best soap for the price and is especially good for facial scrub</li>
            <li> This flattens out huge pimples magically.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great product and my skin hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts since I have been using this on both my face and my body and then moisturizing with 100% natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is a great natural soap that can lather face,hair, &amp; everything you think of without worrying abt chemical, mineral oil or sls.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I had an inkling these soaps would be great on my sensitive, breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> My skin loves me again &amp; has a clear nice healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this soap on Harlem and immediately fell in love with what it did for my skin!</li>
            <li> And the box it came in was fine</li>
            <li> I find the smell completely inoffensive and even pleasant...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted to have found a natural product that works!</li>
            <li> Seems strange at 1st but really good!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel since it takes so little.</li>
            <li> I get a huge pimple.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was so bizarre looking that wanted to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s both of them working together -- but either way, the result is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I say it is a great alternative to using commercial acne prevent/control products.  </li>
            <li> I also have an oily scalp, I mixed this with some shampoo, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> The prices here are very good compared to the other site.</li>
            <li> Even with only washing my face once a day, the improvements are astonishing!!</li>
            <li> I have an acne prone face it healed my face from the first week!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> which I was incredibly excited about.</li>
            <li> I have two permanent scars on both sides of my face that look like laugh line indentations from using this soap after two weeks!  </li>
            <li> Worth getting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it might work well for some, but unfortunately not me.</li>
            <li> It leaves you smelling clean.</li>
            <li> and it is really clean</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I honestly cant get enough and my daughter who has eczema is able to use this soap when I mix it with the Shea Oil.</li>
            <li> For me it has a clean soap smell</li>
            <li> Gets my face squeaky clean</li>
            <li> but I DO care about how well they clean and if they make your skin like a papyrus after using it on your face or if they clean without harm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like this soap gets skin clean</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, and this stuff is just the right stuff for my kind of achne (a large amount of uder-skin achne for anyone who is wondering)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading many positive reviews on this soap, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> The key to ensure that you receive optimal results when using this is to use a good moisturizer after you clean your face with this soap.</li>
            <li> wow, works amazing.</li>
            <li> I really really really wanted to like this item because its better for the environment</li>
            <li> My face feels super clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> love this soap, really works you can feel it working.  </li>
            <li> love it so much I&#x27;ll buy and re-buy.....</li>
            <li> But if you want pure black soap, and aren&#x27;t bothered by the appearance, this is one of the best deals you can get.</li>
            <li> If I could recommend something to make it better, add an essential oil to it to make it smell better and package it in something shower friendly.</li>
            <li> Again I think this would be right for people who have huge pimples or severe acne.</li>
            <li> pretty much every kind of sulfate and parabin free face cleansing program available at Target and Whole</li>
            <li> Overall it makes your skin feel nice, clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it is so mild.</li>
            <li> have oily skin and this has helped me tremendously with controlling the oil my face produces.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and it was wrapped perfectly, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the fact that it&#x27;s an add on item, I only wanted the soap</li>
            <li> Also when I was threading my chin for the first time, I got HUGE bumps all over.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural alternative to commercial facial cleaners and this met my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> The baking soda/water method of washing leaves a lot to be desired but this black liquid soap lathers perfectly and is all natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a peculiar color, but the odor is gentle and slightly sweet...and, best of all, I now have smooth soft skin again.</li>
            <li> Once this cleared, as the soap deeply cleansed my pores of the gunk that was piled up in there, my skin has been radiant and amazing.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;it keeps it fresh inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Anyone who battles acne should try this soap to build a nice &amp; simple regimen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, my skin is fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I would love to have it in a 32 oz or more size container!!!</li>
            <li> The bumps on the right side of my face flattened and went away.</li>
            <li> The soap looks a little different from what I was expecting however, my skin feels great after I wash and moisturize, and it looks brighter and more even each day.</li>
            <li> waaay better than the black charcoal soaps that are suppose to be better than this..</li>
            <li> African black soap is the BEST , unrefined and pure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!!!!!!!!  I can already see how the black soap has cleared up my facial</li>
            <li> I imagine if you used it on your entire body it would get used up much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> For me I find it to be more mild (than the solid)</li>
            <li> and when I mix the African Shea Oil with it-it is more mild than Dove soap.</li>
            <li> It is so moisturizing, I no longer have to use a conditioner, my hair looks beautiful and is full of body and bounce, my dry itchy skin is also a thing of the past, and my face, looks better than it has in years...</li>
            <li> Lathers great and is just what you need to remove makeup without being harsh to the skin!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;soap\\&quot; is absolutely amazing it makes my skin sooo smooth, it cleared up my tiny red blemishes AND in conjunction with my 100% pure, organic Coffee bean eye cream, it smoothed out my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Good quality black soap paste.  </li>
            <li> mixed face washes and toners from the Body Shop which were good but didn&#x27;t give me results anywhere near this soap, Proactive Solution which didn&#x27;t work for me, and</li>
            <li> This soap seems to work very well, after the first use my face softer than it had been in ages!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been consistent with using this product but the times that I have used it</li>
            <li> I will definitely be a lifetime customer. :)</li>
            <li> I also purchased the solid form hopefully that will work better than this.</li>
            <li> At first it was off-putting because it was the consistency of tamarind paste</li>
            <li> We will be ordering again as we run out of this first tub.  </li>
            <li> I expected this to be a miracle product to be honest.    </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s funny is my mom told me to stay away from Palm Oil on my face.</li>
            <li> It is a drying soap, however it was exactly what my oily skin needed.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get more out of the solid pack.</li>
            <li> after a lifetime of soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend money on useless creams when this works best</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use a few times a week to get an extremely deep clean.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 100% Pure African Liquid Soap.</li>
            <li> It looks like jam in a jar but clears blackheads, tightens pores, removes dead skin my skin is soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have started using it with my Clairsonic brush for a super deep clean.</li>
            <li> I have gotten off accurate about 6 months ago, had amazing skin and decided I wanted to try a new face soap and since I&#x27;ve heard such a amazing things about black African soap, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> However, it does lather really well and makes my skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Even as a solid, the wax is soft enough to mix into a liquid in a bottle with warm water, which I also use to shower and bath, also makes both my face body smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have been dealing with pretty profound hormonal acne for a couple of years now, and have tried almost everything to clear it up, including three or four different brands of acne cleanser/toner/cream combinations, and then the oil cleansing method of natural skin care (which did make my skin more healthy and radiant, but did not stop my break</li>
            <li> I do not use it daily, feeling it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> When I was just using the eye cream and a different face wash my fine lines were still there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unusable really.</li>
            <li> I do not see much difference.  </li>
            <li> It creates luxurious suds to really soften your skin and relieve any itching.</li>
            <li> has become a staple in my house and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> My husband now loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this stuff--</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the skin on my feet and my back feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really help me at all.</li>
            <li> It turns out I really like it.  </li>
            <li> i always like to wash mah face with this here soap, i have really oily skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m seeing miraculous results in the way of relief from acne, I&#x27;m still breaking out but not as much.  </li>
            <li> so I should probably listen to her (haha).     </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> and it really helps control the oil on my face.  </li>
            <li> a 4 out of 5 is because it&#x27;s very waxy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very fair-skinned with lots of allergies and sensitivities).</li>
            <li> Using it, will see how well it is really.</li>
            <li> Really helped with combination skin.</li>
            <li> I feel I am not getting as much product as I was expecting in that state.</li>
            <li> have had acne my whole life and am now 31 still dealing with blemishes and hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> and it does not take much if you&#x27;re just washing your face.</li>
            <li> Thanks Nature and Herbs</li>
            <li> FAST shipping too</li>
            <li> This is VERY runny.  </li>
            <li> The package should really be redesigned.</li>
            <li> As for my body, it really controlled my body odor.</li>
            <li> My daughter has acne and it clears her face and back smooth with no blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much about the scent, I &amp;#34;douse&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i love the smell its not too fragrant like some other soaps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products besides these two for my skin and it has never looked better.</li>
            <li> but it seems to last a while too which is economical for me!</li>
            <li> I really wanted it for my skin as a more natural product during my pregnancy but see myself using this long after.</li>
            <li> I sleep with makeup on, will sometimes run out the door applying new make up over old, and more often only wash my face once a day rather than two.</li>
            <li> so this small bottle will last 2-3 months which is a great</li>
            <li> I found that the only soap that doesn&#x27;t make me break out is Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day.</li>
            <li> Ive had better pure african back soap...</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a true liquid soap next time</li>
            <li> I love the thick rich lather and the soft skin I get after my shower.</li>
            <li> The soap is wonderful, I live in the desert and we have very hard water and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does clear imperfect skin!</li>
            <li> I normally use Kirks Castile soap or Ivory, and I find these to be more drying than the Black soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this soap and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The high quality product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy the solid one as you can control how much you use and a tiny bit really does do a lot.</li>
            <li> It is a great way to use this soap, especially  for those who do not use black soap daily,</li>
            <li> , I have noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my acne scars, my pores are smaller, and my skin is incredibly soft and taught.  </li>
            <li> The real test comes when my 15 and 20 year old boys use it, they have some mild acne to get rid of, I will update later.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft and smooth, it really does help with any imperfections you may have, I have dry skin in the winter and it has helped a lot, my daughter has started using it</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think any other product could have done that, and very quickly too.    </li>
            <li> I used it almost every morning and night, and my face started to clear up really fast.</li>
            <li> and my makeup would be very shiny by the early morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap before and was surprised to see it listed here at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It runs out of the bottle far too fast.  </li>
            <li> and I heard it to be more harsh.</li>
            <li> how amazing African Black soap is.</li>
            <li> Black soap is amazing overall .</li>
            <li> African black soap is one of the most pure soaps on Earth.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Brooklyn, NY where I could go to Fulton street and buy it from vendors on the street.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for about a month, and I am absolutely astonished at how much my skin has improved in that short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I am an older woman with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has returned to its former smooth texture, slurping up the moisturizer like it did in the old, younger days.  </li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne and this cleared my skin in about a week and does not leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li> I love black soap and have tried many different brands including using bricks of the raw soap.  </li>
            <li> I used to purchase this in New York all the time, it always clears my skin up and makes it really soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how this one natural product cares for my skin better than the most expensive, doctor prescribed, commonly used products available to us.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> i love this liquid soap i made 3 bottles of shampoo with it using distilled water and 3 different size bottles small medium and large from some leftover shampoos.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said that it smells good, I personally couldn&#x27;t smell anything it didn&#x27;t smell good or bad</li>
            <li> I think a bag/sack with a spout would have been easier and mess free.</li>
            <li> but once you wet it down it foams up very nicely and super thick.</li>
            <li> It smells different than the shea moisture black soap, but I think this one works a tad bit better.</li>
            <li> This brand is good in that it isn&#x27;t as drying as some of the black soaps can be and isn&#x27;t as messy as the bricks.</li>
            <li> Thick pudding consistency but the same STRONG antiseptic authentic soap I expected..</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so clear.</li>
            <li> but my mother has clear skin</li>
            <li> Assuming that this soap traveled clear from Africa before shipping to me...</li>
            <li> Has clear my acne</li>
            <li> So, while it has worked amazingly for me, I had to take about a week from using it, and my face is slowly going back to being oily and not dried out.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap,in hopes that it will help me in battle against adult acne and oily/ combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this 3 times so far and will continue to use it for life.</li>
            <li> However, my 15 year old daughter whom is suffering from hormonal acne and has freqent breakouts and sensitive skin, has not done well at all with the soap.</li>
            <li> i would give this a 5 star thanks for this product i will be a constant buyer.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and it never dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I started using this my skin changed completely.</li>
            <li> I had adult acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working on my 14 year old skin.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li> from somebody that uses all natural product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I thought it would not , since it is natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and have oily sensitive skin and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my sensitive skin, but this soap made me break out...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even been two weeks and already nearly all of my hormonal acne is gone and my skin looks lighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> It only takes a pea sized amount if even that much to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> It came as shown in picture, smells like old soap...</li>
            <li> Only requires a pea-sized amount -- if you use any more than that, it&#x27;s just a waste.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the shopping and handing is expensive</li>
            <li> approximately 1/3 warm water&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought my first African Black Soap from Smoky Mountain Minerals and they are much much higher than any of the sites I&#x27;ve found here.</li>
            <li> Okay- 1st let me say if the solid AFRICAN BLACK SOAP didnt work for you please give the liquid a try.</li>
            <li> I love it, and it only take a small amount to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does burn a little, but not badly.</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I received by delivery and it came sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> The African soap help dries out acne and return skin to normal.</li>
            <li> Since this soap really cleans you face and removes all oil, you need to apply a moisturizer to balance out your skin or your face will become too dry and eventually your face will try to compensate for this dryness by over producing oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you try it long enough, you will see  results, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li> So try using it every other day at first, rather than using it day and night like I did.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed and shocked that doctors don&#x27;t prescribe or mention it!</li>
            <li> It is pretty drying, I suggest using it every other day.  </li>
            <li> The soap arrived 4 days later, just as pictured, the texture was very gooey, it smelled kind of like plastic, but its not in anyway offensive, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scent behind upon rinsing, I had read that it was drying in previous reviews, but it left my skin soft and clean, a little dry, but not too much.</li>
            <li> I usually use unscented products and this just smells clean, not like perfume.</li>
            <li> less like poop, you might want one of the more manufactured black soaps for sale here.</li>
            <li> The first week or so, my skin purged a bit, and I had small bumps on my face, particularly on my forehead, and two cystic acne bumps on my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to keep the lid on and it really is one of the few products where you only need a pea-size or less of product.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, I use natural yellow shea butter</li>
            <li> Package was crushed and pretty much destroyed which dried it out near the exposed parts.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using black soap</li>
            <li> THIS NOT MY FIRST TIME USING BLACK SOAP,</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and not strong.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed that something that costs $8 could have such a profound effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t moisturize afterwards, my skin can feel slightly dry -- but not nearly as dry or tight-feeling as normal</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little drying, but I just follow-up with a gentle natural serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does lay my cystic pimple flat but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> After realizing how little it takes to wash your face with, I went ahead and spooned about 2-month&#x27;s worth into a smaller jar -- one of those mini jam jars from a hotel.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 different types of black soap and I tried this one first.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my face, I felt a slight burning sensation on every open skin (popped pimples and scabs).</li>
            <li> My face also likes it as I&#x27;m starting to see my skin tone evening out better than other facial washes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Its also pretty messy...</li>
            <li> It would just heal any harsh acne on the first layer of your skin.    </li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get makeup off but still worth the effort because my skin is clearer and not all dried out!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of purely liquid black liquid.</li>
            <li> It works well, now his acne is all gone, he is working on the scaring by washing with black soap and moisturizing with pure shea cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used african black soap, but I can tell you, it will not be my last..</li>
            <li> In my eternal quest to find a product that really works for acne, I discovered &amp;#34;African black soap.&amp;#34; My two teenagers have been using the soap for two weeks with noticeably improved results.</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;simmer&amp;#34; for 15-30 seconds, I only do for this long as i feel it could burn my sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I like pure African black soap</li>
            <li> I love the fact I can buy the natural African black soap, this is less messy and it leaves my skin supple.</li>
            <li> Its very concentrated you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, my skin is soft and healthy and glowing I have in the past spent triple the money</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this type of liquid black soap.</li>
            <li> I can not stress enough, a little goes a very, very  long way.. do not use to much or, you may not get the same results we have....</li>
            <li> clean, vegan, liquid soap that mixes well with oils, including essential oils since I am not a great fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> It last a long time too since you only need a tiny amount to wash your face with</li>
            <li> I also suffer from adult acne and this soap has not only helped me have fewer breakouts, but is also clearing up my acne scars and brightening my dark spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try using it consistently for at least 2 wks</li>
            <li> It will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very dry skin but since starting to use this along with shea butter as my lotion, ive noticed a bit difference.</li>
            <li> but..its very thick and the top is hard to open.</li>
            <li> It is hard to give a real review on the product.</li>
            <li> but they never completely went away.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> As long as I use this soap it stays cleared up.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of products to remedy my sudden attack of scaly, rough skin...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it really has made my skin a lot less dry.</li>
            <li> In a month&#x27;s time I am perhaps 1/4 of the way through the container of black soap, so I imagine this container will last me for several months.  </li>
            <li> in general my skin is less oily and not aggravated by this</li>
            <li> Now this is my fault, because I&#x27;ve read the reviews about how people said to only use it every other day, and I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li> Feels differently that other soaps but does the job.</li>
            <li> but if you dont like the smell you can mix with lavender or other scents you can find at your local health food store or here on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit and dry out your face though, so probably only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Just remember to follow up with a moisturizing oil or lotion so that your body doesn&#x27;t dry out or become ashy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that this soap leaves your face extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry scalp and lathering with it after an overnight oil poo</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this tub will last a long time- even though my daughter keeps stealing it from me.</li>
            <li> Jar arrived cracked, and the soap itself had a very bizarre texture that made it almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> The liquid last awhile &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in Providence, finding black soap only exists virtually.</li>
            <li> Again, I do not feel like the black soap DEEP CLEANS into pores.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it will dry out your skin if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> Also, this is real African Black soap.</li>
            <li> heard about African Black Soap from some friends who work in Hollywood and I rushed to Amazon to buy</li>
            <li> it up with approximately 1/3 of 100% pure African black liquid soap&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li> I just really wanted some liquid black soap because this is so thick and sticky</li>
            <li> IT will last a long time in the jar because you need a small amount.     </li>
            <li> one (1) 16.9 oz empty bottle (you will continue to reuse this)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did not really improve my acne.</li>
            <li> Brought all my cosmic acne back, dried and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Texture is thicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the soap for a few days</li>
            <li> It had actually gotten worse after my recent hysterectomy any my facial scarring had increased.</li>
            <li> , I found hard bits of undetermined material in the soap, not sure how pure this soap is anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> I keep some in a little (1/2 oz?) jar and it&#x27;s enough for a month or more of face washing since it sudses like crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use the solid raw soap</li>
            <li> Even getting out of the shower and not having put on lotion yet, my skin is much less dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, loads of suds.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But I had mild acne and going back, my acne wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> i made garlic shampoo , tea tree shampoo and one regular black soap shampoo for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to not use too much or put near your eye because it can get into your eyes and hurting really bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s related to the soap or not.  </li>
            <li> Not for the squeamish due to it&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> Those other pictures need to be deleted to eliminate confusion as to which type of soap product is being supplied.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I used 1 part Black Soap with 2 parts shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have very bad acne scars, uneven skin tone, and blotchiness, but the black soap was able to clear this up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered an \\&quot;African\\&quot; black soap that  was actually \\&quot;Raw Black Soap\\&quot;, not African, and came as a bar</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not right</li>
            <li> Prefer same product in hard form.</li>
            <li> The package arrived cracked in several places and is a bit hard to get out of the tub, but it doesn&#x27;t leak out and it isn&#x27;t drying out.</li>
            <li> Pay especially close attention to avoid the delicate skin around your eye.</li>
            <li> I expect the 8 oz I bought to last at least 8-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some says it lightens the dark areas didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> The soap initially dried up my skin, but never really relieved me of the acne.  </li>
            <li> I definitely won&#x27;t use it again due to the sticky feeling it left on my skin (maybe I used it wrong).  </li>
            <li> It is not pretty, but it works!</li>
            <li> I have been cleansing with this soap 1-2 times per day (usually once) and follow it by rubbing a pea sized amount of raw African shea butter on my face.  </li>
            <li> But the lye (which is present in the ashes of Ghana formulas) seriously eliminated my ringworm.</li>
            <li> However, when I was using the black soap, it continually flattened it out</li>
            <li> All you need is a dime size (or half a dime size) as well.</li>
            <li> Also this is not to be compared with the black soap that comes in a bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading all the reviews on Black soap.</li>
            <li> You can&lt;br /&gt;definately tell the difference from typical body soap.</li>
            <li> I been ordering that black soap, dubu dubu soap didn&#x27;t work well on my acnes.</li>
            <li> Since using black soap, my skin feels nicer than it ever has.</li>
            <li> I was expecting chunks of black soap in a less dense state since it was pictured in a tub.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half way gone.  </li>
            <li> I had used Dr. Organic Black soap w/ shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have not developed a single pimple (even through my monthly cycle when I&#x27;m usually guaranteed at least 2 or 3)</li>
            <li> It has cut down on the oil, but it will still get a little oily, but nothing like before.</li>
            <li> I was paying a small fortune on prescription acne medications, doctor visits and visits to an esthitician for minimal relief.</li>
            <li> its not really a true liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I can only use it every other day, alternating between this and my regular soap or my face dries out, but that may just be the cold weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All my little acne under the skin started to go away</li>
            <li> My acne scars looked a little shiny.</li>
            <li> Just add a little water and put it in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It does get a little messy scooping it out of the bowl.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product again after not buying it for a few years.</li>
            <li> The soap was dried out.</li>
            <li> waited a few months to write my review</li>
            <li> and we didn&#x27;t know how we were gonna use it without it getting messy.  </li>
            <li> This took care of it in a few days.</li>
            <li> The ONLY problem I had is when I received the soap in the mail, the tub that the soap came in was broken up and cracked with some of the soap coming out.</li>
            <li> Too messy with as runny as it</li>
            <li> This product also leaves my skin sooooooooooooo dry!!!!!</li>
            <li> it looks a little weird in the jar but other than that it works and softens the skin.i used it on my face and it has cleared up my acne and dry skin.i use it to bathe with,and i would purchase it again if i can get it in a bar form.you have to watch out for little black grains in the soap.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with this liquid black soap, tone with witch hazel, &amp; moisturize with coconut oil!</li>
            <li> It is confusing that other users have linked pictures that imply this product is fully liquid (squeeze bottle pictures).  </li>
            <li> The look and texture are very very odd</li>
            <li> /&gt;This lasts me about 10 shampoos and I have very thick and long hair (Caucasian hair).  </li>
            <li> , I would recommend starting here for a mere $4-$10 (depending on which version of the Black Soap you prefer).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Acutane (I don&#x27;t recommend using anything so harsh on the body), Retin-A, tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I stopped having bad breakouts several years ago, after which my irresponsible face regimen took hold, but in the last year I have been plagued with hormonal cystic acne under my neck.</li>
            <li> After about a month, I think my skin got really tired of it, because my chin got EXTREMELY dry, with the skin cracking and flaking.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start off with me saying that I have an oily skin type, and I have a lot of scars/hyperpigmentation from past acne that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> round motions in the waxy-consistency to create a foam and lather it on the skin!</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s the reason it&#x27;s working so well.</li>
            <li> If I do get a breakout, it&#x27;s one of those small ones and it dries up once I use the soap.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, it is similar to any commerical soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is added but the consistency makes it</li>
            <li> not sure if my skin is clearing up.  </li>
            <li> So, I moistened my face an used a small amount of this tarry cleanser on my face.</li>
            <li> And the container its small</li>
            <li> ew dead bugs inside wth!</li>
            <li> This soap was very harsh....</li>
            <li> A few very small hard bits (maybe shell?)</li>
            <li> I have the hard soap in the plastic container</li>
            <li> If I would have tried this product sooner, it could have saved from applying countless harsh chemicals to my face, ingesting dangerous doctor prescribedmeds, and years of embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;Gah!</li>
            <li> did I say VERY HARSH FOR YOUR FACE!  </li>
            <li> seriously.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I had to take some relief dropper, I am dumb for washing soap around my eye area.</li>
            <li> No antifungal creams were working and in fact it was getting worse.</li>
            <li> and i think it made my zits worse.</li>
            <li> But I grew tired of the stinging.</li>
            <li> Infact it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I am tired of using products with all kinds of stuff in them that we have to google to get an understanding of what it is.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it just did not agree with my skin and made it worse.  </li>
            <li> This soap do not have the ingredients that real black soap has, was very disappointed to find out that it only has palm oil, palm kernel oil and water.</li>
            <li> , I used too must on my bare skin) and now I have the worst scar ever.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not even expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say,  won&#x27;t be ordering this ever again.</li>
            <li> Do they not have any quality control at all, WTF???</li>
            <li> So the stinging was scary.     </li>
            <li> All in all I was not impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> but sadly I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My son had terrible acne on his face and back.</li>
            <li> ill still have the acne anyway.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing to see what I paid for was broken and not handled with care.</li>
            <li> There was a DEAD INSECT IN IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I never get those, but I experimented very wrongly with tea tree oil (it isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and had scratchy stuff in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been ugly to look at and painful to touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Over and over, I thought maybe this or that miracle product would help me...only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;(  </li>
            <li> NASTY!!!!</li>
            <li> I would buy this even if it smelled dreadful, but it doesn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> Broke me out like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have the worst face cleansing habits in the history of faces.</li>
            <li> This stuff was nasty, bought it on a friends recommendation, and it was horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start off with me saying that I have an oily skin type, and I have a lot of scars/hyperpigmentation from past acne that I&#x27;ve had. The first month so that I had this, it worked great for me! I used it almost every morning and night, and my face started to clear up really fast. All my little acne under the skin started to go away and my skin was evening out, which I was incredibly excited about. After about a month, I think my skin got really tired of it, because my chin got EXTREMELY dry, with the skin cracking and flaking. Now this is my fault, because I&#x27;ve read the reviews about how people said to only use it every other day, and I didn&#x27;t listen. So, while it has worked amazingly for me, I had to take about a week from using it, and my face is slowly going back to being oily and not dried out. So try using it every other day at first, rather than using it day and night like I did. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. It smells different than the shea moisture black soap, but I think this one works a tad bit better. It did not get rid of my acne, but skin care works differently for everybody so give it a try. Plus, it&#x27;s not even expensive.</li>
            <li> This soap do not have the ingredients that real black soap has, was very disappointed to find out that it only has palm oil, palm kernel oil and water. I took a chance on this product even after seeing that it didn&#x27;t show the ingredients on Amazon, this was my mistake and I have learned from this, &amp;#34;you better believe that !&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just really wanted some liquid black soap because this is so thick and sticky it&#x27;s unusable really. Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap,in hopes that it will help me in battle against adult acne and oily/ combination skin.  The soap looks a little different from what I was expecting however, my skin feels great after I wash and moisturize, and it looks brighter and more even each day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been consistent with using this product but the times that I have used it I do not see much difference.  Its also pretty messy...Leaves brown stuff all over shower.  I will try using it consistently for at least 2 wks and if I see a difference I will come back and update my review.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. I love it. A little bit goes a long way and it is so mild. It creates luxurious suds to really soften your skin and relieve any itching. Don&#x27;t let the consistency fool you, because it is a lot better than it looks. I will definitely be a lifetime customer. :)</li>
            <li> The soap initially dried up my skin, but never really relieved me of the acne.  My son, who is 12 initially noticed his acne clearing, but within a couple of weeks the soap did not seem to work as well and his acne returned.  Ended up switching products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 100% Pure African Liquid Soap. The key to ensure that you receive optimal results when using this is to use a good moisturizer after you clean your face with this soap. Since this soap really cleans you face and removes all oil, you need to apply a moisturizer to balance out your skin or your face will become too dry and eventually your face will try to compensate for this dryness by over producing oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this has helped me tremendously with controlling the oil my face produces. I also suffer from adult acne and this soap has not only helped me have fewer breakouts, but is also clearing up my acne scars and brightening my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;It also is an excellent body soap. It will have your body squeaky clean! It removes all dirt and odors which is especially great for your after workout showers or baths. It leaves you smelling clean. Just remember to follow up with a moisturizing oil or lotion so that your body doesn&#x27;t dry out or become ashy.&lt;br /&gt;This has become a staple in my house and my whole family uses it. My husband now loves it as much as I do. I have purchased this 3 times so far and will continue to use it for life. It is the best soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Brooklyn, NY where I could go to Fulton street and buy it from vendors on the street. Now that I&#x27;m in Providence, finding black soap only exists virtually. My whole family loves this stuff--they&#x27;re Japanese and have never heard of it before--and it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the best stuff on the planet. I had ringworm once and my boyfriend purchased this for me. He told me to apply it to my ringworm and in three days it went away! No antifungal creams were working and in fact it was getting worse. But the lye (which is present in the ashes of Ghana formulas) seriously eliminated my ringworm. I was so impressed and shocked that doctors don&#x27;t prescribe or mention it! I highly, highly recommend this type of liquid black soap. It will last you a long time! Great for rashes and acne too (my boyfriend said he used it with shea butter and tea tree oil when he was younger).</li>
            <li> We purchased this becasue of the reviews. The soap is doing wonderful for me.  It exfoliates the skin on my feet and my back feels so smooth. My skins seems to have clarity. However, my 15 year old daughter whom is suffering from hormonal acne and has freqent breakouts and sensitive skin, has not done well at all with the soap. She said that it broke her even more.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is great, has a nice texture and smells really clean. A little bit goes a long way, loads of suds.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product again after not buying it for a few years. There were some ingredients in the soap that I don&#x27;t think belonged in there! Needless to say,  won&#x27;t be ordering this ever again.</li>
            <li> i love this liquid soap i made 3 bottles of shampoo with it using distilled water and 3 different size bottles small medium and large from some leftover shampoos. i made garlic shampoo , tea tree shampoo and one regular black soap shampoo for everyday use. i love the smell its not too fragrant like some other soaps. i would give this a 5 star thanks for this product i will be a constant buyer.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this in New York all the time, it always clears my skin up and makes it really soft.</li>
            <li> It is hard to give a real review on the product. It was shipped in a plastic tub that was cracked. The soap was dried out.</li>
            <li> waited a few months to write my review so I could give a proper review and it didn&#x27;t really help me at all. It does definitely burn and i warn you not to get it on your anus.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so clear. I can only use it every other day, alternating between this and my regular soap or my face dries out, but that may just be the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;Ah well. I still love it.</li>
            <li> This is another product I am not to thrilled about. I can say that it lathers pretty good. I also purchased the solid form hopefully that will work better than this.</li>
            <li> I kind of had no idea what I was gonna get with this product.  It was recommended and in the store of a blogger I respect so figured I would give it a go.  It turns out I really like it.  Both my husband and myself have been using it for a couple of weeks now.  Me with my mixed ethnic skin (African-American and Latina) my hubby with his White skin.  It has been working well for both of us.  At first it was off-putting because it was the consistency of tamarind paste and we didn&#x27;t know how we were gonna use it without it getting messy.  It is easy to keep the lid on and it really is one of the few products where you only need a pea-size or less of product.  We will be ordering again as we run out of this first tub.  I really wanted it for my skin as a more natural product during my pregnancy but see myself using this long after.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves making face wash out of this stuff. we use to get it at a local store, however they quit carrying it. I am so glad to have found it here! The only issue I have with the product is the plastic tub was cracked when we received it. We have to keep it stored in a zip lock bag to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap that your money can buy! A little goes a long way. I love the fact that is serves many purposes. I can tell a diffference in my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it in my hair yet. My face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry after I wash it. However, I always follow up with  moisturizers such as coconut oil, shea butter, or jojoba oil. Will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect Consistency. As someone who has achne, this stuff works. I have tried everything, and this stuff is just the right stuff for my kind of achne (a large amount of uder-skin achne for anyone who is wondering)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My prefered way of usage:&lt;br /&gt;Get a nice boar-hair brush (like the kind used for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;Get the brush nice and wet.&lt;br /&gt;Make round motions in the waxy-consistency to create a foam and lather it on the skin! (Back, face, arms, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Let it &amp;#34;simmer&amp;#34; for 15-30 seconds, I only do for this long as i feel it could burn my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;wash it off in the shower!</li>
            <li> i always like to wash mah face with this here soap, i have really oily skin and this just seems to help me with mah condition.  waaay better than the black charcoal soaps that are suppose to be better than this..</li>
            <li> The product is good but the shopping and handing is expensive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m seeing miraculous results in the way of relief from acne, I&#x27;m still breaking out but not as much.  Not sure if it&#x27;s related to the soap or not.  I can tell you that this soap leaves your face extremely dry.  Invest in a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use as a face wash. It last a long time too since you only need a tiny amount to wash your face with</li>
            <li> I like the African soap,I use it as it is and it is really clean but you have to use body oil after it.I use it also with coffe soap and table spoon of almond oil and it works for strechmarks.I will orderd again.</li>
            <li> it looks a little weird in the jar but other than that it works and softens the skin.i used it on my face and it has cleared up my acne and dry skin.i use it to bathe with,and i would purchase it again if i can get it in a bar form.you have to watch out for little black grains in the soap.</li>
            <li> There was a DEAD INSECT IN IT!!!!! NASTY!!!! DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! Do they not have any quality control at all, WTF???</li>
            <li> I started using this soap with my grandson and now add hemp oil, avocado oil, and castor oils. Wonderful</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on me. It gave me a rash on my checks (since i used it on my face for zits) and i think it made my zits worse. It said it works best on oily skin which i have, but i used it for 2 months and did nothing good for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this tub will last a long time- even though my daughter keeps stealing it from me. It leaves your skin squeaky clean. A few very small hard bits (maybe shell?) but still an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I like and dislike this product. But I had mild acne and going back, my acne wasn&#x27;t that bad. I just had a lot of scars and acne on the side of my face. But my acne hasn&#x27;t gotten any better. I expected this to be a miracle product to be honest.    I used this twice a day, in the morning and in the shower. When I initially tried it, it started to sting my face. The bumps on the right side of my face flattened and went away. Scars were still there.     But what makes me think this is for severe acne, is because it helped me when I had a cystic acne. I never get those, but I experimented very wrongly with tea tree oil (it isn&#x27;t bad, I used too must on my bare skin) and now I have the worst scar ever. However, when I was using the black soap, it continually flattened it out and I don&#x27;t think any other product could have done that, and very quickly too.    But I grew tired of the stinging. My cheeks would burn like my skin was coming off. My acne scars looked a little shiny. But it never did anything for them. I have oily skin, and it never dried out my skin so I don&#x27;t know what the stinging was about. I do not have sensitive skin. I have \\&quot;MY SKIN CAN TAKE ON THE WORLD!\\&quot; type of skin. So the stinging was scary.     When I had big bumps, it flattened that but they never completely went away. Even my smallest acne, it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for it, but the big pimples it would flatten.    It also did nothing for blackheads. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was deep cleaning my face either.     Again I think this would be right for people who have huge pimples or severe acne. This flattens out huge pimples magically.     All you need is a dime size (or half a dime size) as well. It lathers very good. IT will last a long time in the jar because you need a small amount.     Also when I was threading my chin for the first time, I got HUGE bumps all over. This took care of it in a few days. Another reason why I think this is for severe, big pimple type acne.     I guess I&#x27;ll just keep it incase I get a huge pimple. I notice where it would burn, my face was shiny.    edit : I noticed there is a review that says his/her son saw improvement in their acne then it just stopped and they ended up switching products. I also just switched products. Again, I do not feel like the black soap DEEP CLEANS into pores. It would just heal any harsh acne on the first layer of your skin.    Ingredients : Palm Kernel oil, Palm oil, and water. What&#x27;s funny is my mom told me to stay away from Palm Oil on my face. I have not looked it up but my mother has clear skin so I should probably listen to her (haha).     Also this is not to be compared with the black soap that comes in a bar. That one has more ingredients and I heard it to be more harsh. I do not want to try it though...</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with pretty profound hormonal acne for a couple of years now, and have tried almost everything to clear it up, including three or four different brands of acne cleanser/toner/cream combinations, and then the oil cleansing method of natural skin care (which did make my skin more healthy and radiant, but did not stop my break outs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month, and I am absolutely astonished at how much my skin has improved in that short period of time.  The first week or so, my skin purged a bit, and I had small bumps on my face, particularly on my forehead, and two cystic acne bumps on my jaw line.  Once this cleared, as the soap deeply cleansed my pores of the gunk that was piled up in there, my skin has been radiant and amazing.  I have not developed a single pimple (even through my monthly cycle when I&#x27;m usually guaranteed at least 2 or 3), I have noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my acne scars, my pores are smaller, and my skin is incredibly soft and taught.  I have been cleansing with this soap 1-2 times per day (usually once) and follow it by rubbing a pea sized amount of raw African shea butter on my face.  In a month&#x27;s time I am perhaps 1/4 of the way through the container of black soap, so I imagine this container will last me for several months.  I only use this on my face - I imagine if you used it on your entire body it would get used up much more quickly.  I have not even made a visible dent in the shea butter, which was of similar cost.  I imagine that will last me a year.  I am truly amazed that something that costs $8 could have such a profound effect on my skin.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else on my skin at this point.  This stuff is absolutely amazing.  seriously.  try it.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this soap on Harlem and immediately fell in love with what it did for my skin! I have very oily skin and my makeup would be very shiny by the early morning. When I started using this my skin changed completely. It is a drying soap, however it was exactly what my oily skin needed. I constantly have people ask what I use on my face. I&#x27;m glad to see that I can order this to my home now since I am no longer in NY.</li>
            <li> The product is supposed to be like a paste.instead when i received it.it was like water.very unsatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Cleans exceptionally well. I had adult acne. Had!!! This is a great product to use a few times a week to get an extremely deep clean. Be careful, it will dry out your skin if you use it too often. Pay especially close attention to avoid the delicate skin around your eye. It lasts a long time too, I purchased this four-five months ago, and will have to reorder in the next month or so. It works much better than the bar variety. I use with the clairson mia, that probably has a lot to do with my face clearing up. But it was a good start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading all the reviews on Black soap. I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. The soap arrived 4 days later, just as pictured, the texture was very gooey, it smelled kind of like plastic, but its not in anyway offensive, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any scent behind upon rinsing, I had read that it was drying in previous reviews, but it left my skin soft and clean, a little dry, but not too much. I normally use Kirks Castile soap or Ivory, and I find these to be more drying than the Black soap. The real test comes when my 15 and 20 year old boys use it, they have some mild acne to get rid of, I will update later.</li>
            <li> Jar arrived cracked, and the soap itself had a very bizarre texture that made it almost impossible to use. It was like slimy Play-Doh that wouldn&#x27;t lather or dissolve. I tried using it maybe 5-6 times until I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;soap\\&quot; is absolutely amazing it makes my skin sooo smooth, it cleared up my tiny red blemishes AND in conjunction with my 100% pure, organic Coffee bean eye cream, it smoothed out my fine lines. When I was just using the eye cream and a different face wash my fine lines were still there. Also, this is real African Black soap. I ordered an \\&quot;African\\&quot; black soap that  was actually \\&quot;Raw Black Soap\\&quot;, not African, and came as a bar soap- not at all the same.</li>
            <li> wow, works amazing. no ache</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for those of us who have bravely ventured into the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; (no shampoo/chemicals/products) world.  The baking soda/water method of washing leaves a lot to be desired but this black liquid soap lathers perfectly and is all natural.  Here is how I use it for shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use one (1) 16.9 oz empty bottle (you will continue to reuse this)&lt;br /&gt;Carefully drill or poke a hole in the cap that goes to your empty 16.9 oz plastic bottle (I use an old water bottle)&lt;br /&gt;Fill it up with approximately 1/3 of 100% pure African black liquid soap&lt;br /&gt;Add approximately 1/3 warm water&lt;br /&gt;Replace cap&lt;br /&gt;Place your finger over the drilled hole in the cap and shake well&lt;br /&gt;This lasts me about 10 shampoos and I have very thick and long hair (Caucasian hair).  Note if you go \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; you only need to wash your hair 2-3 times a week so this small bottle will last 2-3 months which is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone :).</li>
            <li> Not for the squeamish due to it&#x27;s appearance. If you want something that looks... well I&#x27;ll be honest... less like poop, you might want one of the more manufactured black soaps for sale here. But if you want pure black soap, and aren&#x27;t bothered by the appearance, this is one of the best deals you can get.</li>
            <li> Excellant product, I have used Black soap and it is the best soap for the price and is especially good for facial scrub</li>
            <li> Ive had better pure african back soap...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent find.  Leaves your sking feeling fantastic and so clean!!!  You can&lt;br /&gt;definately tell the difference from typical body soap. AND gets rid of blemishes.. It would have been&lt;br /&gt;a 5 Star..but..its very thick and the top is hard to open. But then for some its a good thing because&lt;br /&gt;it keeps it fresh inside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face since the 4th of July. My face has been the clearest it&#x27;s ever been. I use it twice a day and have no problem with drying. I think that&#x27;s because I have severely oily skin. It has cut down on the oil, but it will still get a little oily, but nothing like before. I don&#x27;t have to go wipe it off throughout the day. I have been using this scrub I bought off of here. Not sure if that&#x27;s the reason it&#x27;s working so well. I also bought scar treatment for my acne scars off of here and it seems to be working. If I do get a breakout, it&#x27;s one of those small ones and it dries up once I use the soap. I have not had one cystic one since using this and I&#x27;m thankful for that. I went out yesterday and didn&#x27;t even realize I didn&#x27;t put makeup on. That&#x27;s how good my skin is looking. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great product and my skin hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts since I have been using this on both my face and my body and then moisturizing with 100% natural shea butter. I don&#x27;t use any other products besides these two for my skin and it has never looked better. Reason why I am giving this 3 stars is because although it is a great product, it isn&#x27;t liquid. It&#x27;s like a sticky putty! I can&#x27;t put it on my wash cloth, so I just smash it into a sponge and lather (for my body). For my face, I just lather between my hands. Next time I&#x27;m going to try the liquid in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working on my 14 year old skin. His skin is looking really nice.</li>
            <li> This did not really improve my acne. Infact it made it worse. Perhaps if you try it long enough, you will see  results, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to put up with it. It did make my skin soft though. However it made my daughter&#x27;s skin burn, so we ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner as described. I love this product. My last order of this product has lasted for over a year! Just add a little water and put it in a bottle. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought my first African Black Soap from Smoky Mountain Minerals and they are much much higher than any of the sites I&#x27;ve found here. I paid $12.00 for 2.3 oz. The soap is wonderful, I live in the desert and we have very hard water and very dry skin. I also have chronic ezema on my hands. As long as I use this soap it stays cleared up. I love the thick rich lather and the soft skin I get after my shower. I&#x27;d highly recommend this soap and will continue to use it. The prices here are very good compared to the other site.</li>
            <li> When the soap came in the mail it looked as pictured. Other reviews said that it smells good, I personally couldn&#x27;t smell anything it didn&#x27;t smell good or bad it was BLANK.  It was soap it lathered but I didn&#x27;t feel any extra moisture as promised.  All in all I was not impressed with this item. Maybe I just need to add something to it to make it my own.  I definitely won&#x27;t use it again due to the sticky feeling it left on my skin (maybe I used it wrong).  I really really really wanted to like this item because its better for the environment but sadly I didn&#x27;t.  If I could recommend something to make it better, add an essential oil to it to make it smell better and package it in something shower friendly. I think a bag/sack with a spout would have been easier and mess free.</li>
            <li> clean, vegan, liquid soap that mixes well with oils, including essential oils since I am not a great fan of the smell. Feels differently that other soaps but does the job. Makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this soap, it is perfect for my skin. The package arrived on time and it was wrapped perfectly, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the fact that it&#x27;s an add on item, I only wanted the soap and I ended up having to spend more money just so I could get it. Overall, I am very happy with the product, and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for bathing, washing my hands and face.  Its very concentrated you only need a little.  I am tired of using products with all kinds of stuff in them that we have to google to get an understanding of what it is.  Ive gone natural !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality black soap paste.  It is confusing that other users have linked pictures that imply this product is fully liquid (squeeze bottle pictures).  Those other pictures need to be deleted to eliminate confusion as to which type of soap product is being supplied.</li>
            <li> The high quality product</li>
            <li> Okay- 1st let me say if the solid AFRICAN BLACK SOAP didnt work for you please give the liquid a try. For me I find it to be more mild (than the solid) and when I mix the African Shea Oil with it-it is more mild than Dove soap. I absolutley LOVE THIS PRODUCT! My only complaint is I would love to have it in a 32 oz or more size container!!! I honestly cant get enough and my daughter who has eczema is able to use this soap when I mix it with the Shea Oil. For me it has a clean soap smell but if you dont like the smell you can mix with lavender or other scents you can find at your local health food store or here on Amazon!!!! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Prefer same product in hard form.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this product for my mom she said it&#x27;s good for allergies! or skin removes Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;and she would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like pure African black soap but I don&#x27;t care for this version. I&#x27;d rather use the solid raw soap just preference I guess:). I feel like I get more out of the solid pack.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful! It makes your skin so soft and smooth, it really does help with any imperfections you may have, I have dry skin in the winter and it has helped a lot, my daughter has started using it and she loves it too.  It is not pretty, but it works!</li>
            <li> I love it, and it only take a small amount to do the trick. Refer to family members. Will get more soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!!! It&#x27;s lasting me longer than the bar form and not as drying.  Anyone who battles acne should try this soap to build a nice &amp; simple regimen.  I cleanse with this liquid black soap, tone with witch hazel, &amp; moisturize with coconut oil! My skin loves me again &amp; has a clear nice healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even in the market for face wash when I bought this, but somehow a search for shea butter led me to it and I thought it was so bizarre looking that wanted to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. 100%. The look and texture are very very odd (it feels like hardened syrup) but once you wet it down it foams up very nicely and super thick. Only requires a pea-sized amount -- if you use any more than that, it&#x27;s just a waste. After realizing how little it takes to wash your face with, I went ahead and spooned about 2-month&#x27;s worth into a smaller jar -- one of those mini jam jars from a hotel. I expect the 8 oz I bought to last at least 8-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, my skin is fresh and glowing. Afterwards, I use natural yellow shea butter (I also mix in some unrefined coconut oil.) If I don&#x27;t moisturize afterwards, my skin can feel slightly dry -- but not nearly as dry or tight-feeling as normal soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually started using the shea butter at the same time that I started with this soap, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the soap or the shea butter or if it&#x27;s both of them working together -- but either way, the result is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was told about  how amazing African Black soap is. from somebody that uses all natural product&#x27;s. I do like the soap, hoping my teen daughters will give it a try as well. I do not use it daily, feeling it is a bit strong. I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me every since my acne prone skin experienced an allergic reaction to a popular acne skin care system about six months.  May I say it is a great alternative to using commercial acne prevent/control products.  Even as a solid, the wax is soft enough to mix into a liquid in a bottle with warm water, which I also use to shower and bath, also makes both my face body smooth.  This was the first time that I received by delivery and it came sooner than expected.  I am really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the soap. The ONLY problem I had is when I received the soap in the mail, the tub that the soap came in was broken up and cracked with some of the soap coming out. It was very disappointing to see what I paid for was broken and not handled with care.</li>
            <li> It is a great natural soap that can lather face,hair, &amp; everything you think of without worrying abt chemical, mineral oil or sls. It helps fading your marks like cocoa butter or shea butter. Just be careful to not use too much or put near your eye because it can get into your eyes and hurting really bad. I thought it would not , since it is natural. I was wrong, it is similar to any commerical soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that is why my left eye is now sore. I had to take some relief dropper, I am dumb for washing soap around my eye area. It still GREAT soap. I been ordering that black soap, dubu dubu soap didn&#x27;t work well on my acnes. African black soap is the BEST , unrefined and pure.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomde this one, along with witch hazel to apply after that. Soap is dryness after using, making me thinking it detoxing. Witch hazel is a great way for toner along with vitamin c or tree tea cream .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the liquid variety; a container with&lt;br /&gt;a jelly-like consistency arrived.  I have used tons of products to remedy my sudden attack of scaly, rough skin...after a lifetime of soft, smooth skin. Over and over, I thought maybe this or that miracle product would help me...only to be disappointed. I have always used a defolient mitt along with any skin care emolients, but nothing worked.  I decided to give this product a try simply by virtue of the reviews that Amazon posted.  Amazingly enough, it works.  My skin has returned to its former smooth texture, slurping up the moisturizer like it did in the old, younger days.  I have no idea why this product worked and the others didn&#x27;t..but I don&#x27;t care.  I would buy this even if it smelled dreadful, but it doesn&#x27;t...It&#x27;s a peculiar color, but the odor is gentle and slightly sweet...and, best of all, I now have smooth soft skin again.</li>
            <li> This soap seems to work very well, after the first use my face softer than it had been in ages! It does sting a bit and dry out your face though, so probably only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and have oily sensitive skin and blackheads.  I just started using this and it really helps control the oil on my face.  A little bit goes a long way.  It is pretty drying, I suggest using it every other day.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I also have an oily scalp, I mixed this with some shampoo, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  It helps with oily scalp too.  A little goes a long way, I used 1 part Black Soap with 2 parts shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing love it !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love black soap and have tried many different brands including using bricks of the raw soap.  This brand is good in that it isn&#x27;t as drying as some of the black soaps can be and isn&#x27;t as messy as the bricks. The only reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because it&#x27;s very waxy. I&#x27;m not sure what is added but the consistency makes it so it&#x27;s a little difficult to use.  So I just used a sponge type of thing, putting the soap on that and it worked out okay. It did lather real nice.  Overall it makes your skin feel nice, clean and smooth.  Since using black soap, my skin feels nicer than it ever has. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap. I have used the bar before but since I travel I prefer the liquid.&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t stain towels like the bar. The liquid last awhile &amp; a little goes a long way. A dime size amount is enough to wash your face with.</li>
            <li> Broke me out like crazy!!! I have gotten off accurate about 6 months ago, had amazing skin and decided I wanted to try a new face soap and since I&#x27;ve heard such a amazing things about black African soap, I decided to try it. Worst thing I have ever bought! Brought all my cosmic acne back, dried and irritated my skin. My skin is oily/combination and it comepletely screwed me over. Beware of this product.</li>
            <li> Lathers great and is just what you need to remove makeup without being harsh to the skin!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my oily, acne-prone skin and although it&#x27;s not a miracle worker (I still break out) in general my skin is less oily and not aggravated by this at all (I&#x27;m very fair-skinned with lots of allergies and sensitivities). I find the smell completely inoffensive and even pleasant... it&#x27;s a bit earthy in the container, but once you&#x27;ve diluted with water it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. I keep some in a little (1/2 oz?) jar and it&#x27;s enough for a month or more of face washing since it sudses like crazy! Perfect for travel since it takes so little. I haven&#x27;t tried diluting for use as shampoo/body wash/etc.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I wished.But it will do for now. Using it, will see how well it is really.</li>
            <li> Ordered the soap back in the fall of 2012 and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I use it as a multipurpose for my hair, face, and body, all of which, adores the product.  I suffer from dry scalp and lathering with it after an overnight oil poo and this is a dream as it removes the dirt, flakes, and calms the itchiness.  I use it for shower and bath time applying it to a wash cloth and cleans well over my body.  My face also likes it as I&#x27;m starting to see my skin tone evening out better than other facial washes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Great soap here!  Don&#x27;t pass on it!</li>
            <li> Really helped with combination skin.I used daily for washing my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This soap was very harsh....WAIT... did I say VERY HARSH FOR YOUR FACE!  I have two permanent scars on both sides of my face that look like laugh line indentations from using this soap after two weeks!  I am hoping I&#x27;m not permanently scared from this!  JUST A WARNING!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my sensitive skin, but this soap made me break out... I tried it out because of my eczema, but I found that I was breaking out on my face, back and chest after only a weeks use. I used it for another week and the pimples kept coming, so I started using it as dog soap. It lathers nicely though and works well for the dog&#x27;s bath.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found hard bits of undetermined material in the soap, not sure how pure this soap is anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I found that the only soap that doesn&#x27;t make me break out is Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day.</li>
            <li> Broke me out. I had a helluva rash from this in areas that  don&#x27;t suppose to occur.  .  Idk if this is authentic but it&#x27;s not right</li>
            <li> I used one time but will report with an update.</li>
            <li> I was expecting chunks of black soap in a less dense state since it was pictured in a tub. I received a bottle of purely liquid black liquid. I feel I am not getting as much product as I was expecting in that state. It works well, but with the bottle I am pouring more than I feel I need to use and there is no flip top to lessen the usage. It works well enough, lathering and so forth.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have the worst face cleansing habits in the history of faces. I sleep with makeup on, will sometimes run out the door applying new make up over old, and more often only wash my face once a day rather than two. I stopped having bad breakouts several years ago, after which my irresponsible face regimen took hold, but in the last year I have been plagued with hormonal cystic acne under my neck. &#x3D;(  It&#x27;s been ugly to look at and painful to touch.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about African Black Soap from some friends who work in Hollywood and I rushed to Amazon to buy every version of it could find. I bought 4 different types of black soap and I tried this one first. It&#x27;s not even been two weeks and already nearly all of my hormonal acne is gone and my skin looks lighter and brighter. After reading the reviews, I had an inkling these soaps would be great on my sensitive, breakout prone skin but I could not have known to what degree. Even with only washing my face once a day, the improvements are astonishing!! In the past I&#x27;ve used Acutane (I don&#x27;t recommend using anything so harsh on the body), Retin-A, tea tree oil mixed face washes and toners from the Body Shop which were good but didn&#x27;t give me results anywhere near this soap, Proactive Solution which didn&#x27;t work for me, and pretty much every kind of sulfate and parabin free face cleansing program available at Target and Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how this one natural product cares for my skin better than the most expensive, doctor prescribed, commonly used products available to us.&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with breakouts, oily skin, acne scars, etc., I would recommend starting here for a mere $4-$10 (depending on which version of the Black Soap you prefer).&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne my whole life and am now 31 still dealing with blemishes and hormonal acne. If I would have tried this product sooner, it could have saved from applying countless harsh chemicals to my face, ingesting dangerous doctor prescribedmeds, and years of embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;Gah! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used african black soap, but I can tell you, it will not be my last..I have been using this  for more than a week now, and I am in love with this product..I ordered it as a face wash, but it did so good on my face, that I decided to try it in the shower, I loved it so much as a body wash, I decided to try it as a shampoo, again , AWESOME  results..It is so moisturizing, I no longer have to use a conditioner, my hair looks beautiful and is full of body and bounce, my dry itchy skin is also a thing of the past, and my face, looks better than it has in years...My husband is also using this product and is experiencing the same results as I am...I can not begin to tell you how much money this product is saving us!!!!!! I can not stress enough, a little goes a very, very  long way.. do not use to much or, you may not get the same results we have....</li>
            <li> In my eternal quest to find a product that really works for acne, I discovered &amp;#34;African black soap.&amp;#34; My two teenagers have been using the soap for two weeks with noticeably improved results. Nothing else has changed in their regimen, so I can safely attribute their much-healed skin to this soap.&lt;br /&gt;For product aesthetics: the smell is earthy but tolerable. Texture is thicker than expected. Packaging is a bit beat up and mashed. Assuming that this soap traveled clear from Africa before shipping to me...the packaging is not a big deal. I&#x27;m delighted to have found a natural product that works!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using black soap but I like it.  My face feels super clean after using it.  I&#x27;ve only been using the soap for a few days not sure if my skin is clearing up.  It lathers well and it does not take much if you&#x27;re just washing your face.</li>
            <li> Seems strange at 1st but really good! Takes a bit to get makeup off but still worth the effort because my skin is clearer and not all dried out! If you have skin problems like open wounds, sores etc this will sting because of its antimicrobial, antibacterial properties etc. I will get more when I need it but it seems to last a while too which is economical for me! The package arrived cracked in several places and is a bit hard to get out of the tub, but it doesn&#x27;t leak out and it isn&#x27;t drying out.</li>
            <li> Black soap is amazing overall . Its a great make up remover. They even send it in a Ziploc bag , which is helpful because after you shower with is you can just place it back into the bag. My container did have crack in it.</li>
            <li> I have the hard soap in the plastic container and I love it. A little goes a long way and it really has made my skin a lot less dry. I&#x27;ve always had very dry skin but since starting to use this along with shea butter as my lotion, ive noticed a bit difference. Even getting out of the shower and not having put on lotion yet, my skin is much less dry. I may give the liquid a try if it&#x27;s worked well for others but I do enjoy the solid one as you can control how much you use and a tiny bit really does do a lot. Worth getting!</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and in nice packaging. The consistency of the balck soap is more of a gel than a liquid.  I am in love with it for my face and body. It only takes a pea sized amount if even that much to wash my face.  I also use it to wash the blemishes on my chest. I follow this with a witch hazel toner, and a tiny bit of shea butter. Thanks Nature and Herbs</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap before and was surprised to see it listed here at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;It does wonders for the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I am 34 and a bi-racial female who has struggled with hormonal and cystic acne. It had actually gotten worse after my recent hysterectomy any my facial scarring had increased. I was paying a small fortune on prescription acne medications, doctor visits and visits to an esthitician for minimal relief. I still had to wear make-up daily because I was so embarrassed by the condition of my skin. Even with the make-up covering up the acne scars and redness, my skin was still bumpy and the texture just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I got this stuff Christmas Eve. It looked nothing like the description of &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34;. So, I moistened my face an used a small amount of this tarry cleanser on my face. The lather was amazing. Yes, it does burn a little, but not badly. Yes, it is a little drying, but I just follow-up with a gentle natural serum.&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you...it is January 6 and my face already looks better! My scars have started fading. My acne is peeling away. The texture of my skin is already smoother and brighter. I can&#x27;t wait to see what longer use does. I have started using it with my Clairsonic brush for a super deep clean. I am also letting my kids (teens) use the soap and they are seeing improvements with their teen acne too!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ever. A little goes a long way, my skin is soft and healthy and glowing I have in the past spent triple the money but this is a wonderful product see for yourself. It looks like jam in a jar but clears blackheads, tightens pores, removes dead skin my skin is soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> Thick pudding consistency but the same STRONG antiseptic authentic soap I expected.. FAST shipping too</li>
            <li> Will not buy again.  This is VERY runny.  However, it does lather really well and makes my skin feel clean and soft.  The reason I will not buy again is because of the packaging.  Too messy with as runny as it it.  This bottle should have a \\&quot;flip top\\&quot; and not the screw cap.  I&#x27;ve only had it a week and it&#x27;s half way gone.  It runs out of the bottle far too fast.  The package should really be redesigned.</li>
            <li> After reading many positive reviews on this soap, I decided to try it.  For some reason, it just did not agree with my skin and made it worse.  I&#x27;m sure it might work well for some, but unfortunately not me.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!  I use this for all kinds of things.  Sometimes I use it as-is to wash my face, but I&#x27;ve also used it in a DIY handwash, DIY shower gel.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does clear imperfect skin! Buy it, try it and like it. It does get a little messy scooping it out of the bowl.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRIDUCT. there is Rip OFF. And the container its small</li>
            <li> My son had terrible acne on his face and back. I bought this some and melted it then mixed it with Jojoba oil and Almond oil. It works well, now his acne is all gone, he is working on the scaring by washing with black soap and moisturizing with pure shea cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> good product ...lathers well and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good more nice tank you good seller</li>
            <li> The African soap help dries out acne and return skin to normal. I am very happy with this product. I would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I have very bad acne scars, uneven skin tone, and blotchiness, but the black soap was able to clear this up.  The key is consistency.  You will see results with continue use.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I absolutely love, love, love this product.  It lathers so well, I feel refreshed after showering with it.  Use this soap and the shea butter, and I guarantee you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Package was crushed and pretty much destroyed which dried it out near the exposed parts. And the box it came in was fine so guess it was sold like that. The product it self I did like. It did seem to help my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> Great results for my skin. Need to order more.</li>
            <li> A miracle soap for my face! I have an acne prone face it healed my face from the first week!! I&#x27;m still amazed. As for my body, it really controlled my body odor. However, it didn&#x27;t improve the acne on my body only on my face. Some says it lightens the dark areas didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Yes it is good for the skin and the skin and revitalizes also</li>
            <li> This stuff is like miracle cream for teens with acne problems.  My daughter has acne and it clears her face and back smooth with no blemishes.  Don&#x27;t spend money on useless creams when this works best and it&#x27;s safe to use.  I am definitely a customer for life!</li>
            <li> ew dead bugs inside wth!</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my face, I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 14 haven&#x27;t had any skin issues yet</li>
            <li> Gets my face squeaky clean</li>
            <li> This stuff was nasty, bought it on a friends recommendation, and it was horrible.  It smells bad and had scratchy stuff in it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I love the fact I can buy the natural African black soap, this is less messy and it leaves my skin supple. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love this soap, really works you can feel it working.  Has clear my acne</li>
            <li> Although this is more of a gel than a liquid, I have gotten great results from using this product. I was looking for a more natural alternative to commercial facial cleaners and this met my needs perfectly. I have mild adult acne and this cleared my skin in about a week and does not leave the skin dry. Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Heard a lot of great things about this soap. I have a ne..womp womp eommmp. It came as shown in picture, smells like old soap...no gimicks. Used almost all of it now.....still acne lol eh. I wont order again,  miss my smelly soaps...ill still have the acne anyway.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!!!!!!!!  I can already see how the black soap has cleared up my facial blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I chose this form (as opposed to the bar form) , because I could &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; a piece of it, place it in a bottle, and dissolve it into a liquid form.  It is a great way to use this soap, especially  for those who do not use black soap daily,</li>
            <li> I love it on my skin, it cleanses really good without making it dehydrated and paper-like.Soaps are so different in Ph and foam...I don&#x27;t care much about the scent, I &amp;#34;douse&amp;#34; myself in perfume afterwards anyways....but I DO care about how well they clean and if they make your skin like a papyrus after using it on your face or if they clean without harm.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much I&#x27;ll buy and re-buy.....that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;My mom in law asked me &amp;#34;what do u use it for&amp;#34; like she was expecting me to say &amp;#34;tough stains on laundry&amp;#34;..lol.&lt;br /&gt;No, this is one of the gentlest soaps for skin on our Earth.</li>
            <li> like this soap gets skin clean</li>
            <li> THIS NOT MY FIRST TIME USING BLACK SOAP, BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING THIS HERE PRODUCT.  I had used Dr. Organic Black soap w/ shea butter. I feel like \\&quot;Dr. Organic\\&quot; worked better for my skin b/c it is not as potent as this product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 days now. The first time I washed my face, I felt a slight burning sensation on every open skin (popped pimples and scabs). The burning went away after moisturizing my face. It does lay my cystic pimple flat but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely. This product also leaves my skin sooooooooooooo dry!!!!! I have to put 2 layers of moisturizer and vaseline (petroleum jelly) just so i can wiggle my nose, raise my eyebrows, or yawn. And even after all that moisturizing, it still feels tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is probably great for the summer, but during the fall/winter season, it&#x27;s a bit too drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; to my skin and it has been over a month.</li>
            <li> African black soap is one of the most pure soaps on Earth. If you have any type of skin, this is the perfect soap. This soothes skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. If you suffer from acne, scarring, or blemishes, you will notice a difference with this soap! I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t have the same effectiveness as the sold soap, but it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with sensitive skin. I love the feel of this liquid soap. It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean. The scent is fresh and not strong. I usually use unscented products and this just smells clean, not like perfume. I think my skin is improving and I have no rashes and I think some of the age spots are lessening. I am going to give a sample to my daughter and granddaughter to try.</li>
            <li> its not really a true liquid soap. Its more a glue. it works for what I needed it to. I will be looking for a true liquid soap next time</li>
