            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li>My favorite massage oil.  </li>
            <li>plus I love the pump top.</li>
            <li>I love this massage lotion.</li>
            <li>to order more</li>
            <li>This is what most massage therapies uses</li>
            <li>sure if it is OK on skin, i.e. does it breath?  </li>
            <li>Biotone, I know you can make a better gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a massage therapist for 16 years and love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Not too greasy and don&#x27;t need to keep adding more.</li>
            <li>Love this gel.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it on Amazon and it is now the go to lubricant of choice when I have to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li>Although many companies use this in food it was originally used for machinery lube.  </li>

            <li>Overall I think it is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>What l like most is that it is exactly what my PT uses</li>
            <li>Part of the reason for that was the effortless and smooth way her hands glided across my body from head to toe - including the most sensitive of areas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It glides very nicely and uses less product than the Biotone lotion.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my skin right after receiving it.  </li>
            <li>and i was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>They should make this with natural fragrance or fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only gel I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any massage enthusiasts!</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>thus it&#x27;s nice glide and long lasting ability.  </li>
            <li>A little more long lasting than needed, should evaporate more quickly for my purposes.</li>
            <li>Not as cloying and sloppy as straight oils, easier to glide across the skin than lotions or creams, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It smells OK, not the best and not the worst.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is&lt;br /&gt;Canola</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It is very nice for massage and only requires a very small amount.</li>
            <li>It would be great except for the fake perfume smell.  </li>

            <li> It outperforms the use of standard lotion as that tends to create clumps of dead skin when giving long massages.</li>
            <li> Only needed a little bit per limb like a couple drops.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent and leaves a slight oily residue, the residue being why it is only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it washes out well.  </li>
            <li> theurapeutic qualities without the mess</li>
            <li> It does not leave a sticky or slick after effect on your skin.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment for Biotone products.  </li>
            <li> I suppose Grapeseed Oil instead of Canola is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> At any rate it reaks of an annoying fake perfume/fragrance smell.  </li>

            <li> The Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Gel is very good.  It glides very nicely and uses less product than the Biotone lotion.  The only drawback I have seen is that is becomes somewhat solid in its container over time and has problems pumping.  Overall I think it is a very nice product.</li>

            <li> Good smell, non greasy, and not sticky! Great stuff, plus I love the pump top.</li>
            <li> This massage gel is great! It was recommended to me by a massage therapist friend of mine (I use it for personal use however), and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. The smell is light and pleasant, the feel is not greasy at all, and the glide it provides is fantastic! A little bit goes a long way. Additionally it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets like massage oil tends to do. I would highly recommend this product to any massage enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> I love this massage lotion. It does have a slight scent and leaves a slight oily residue, the residue being why it is only 4 stars. It outperforms the use of standard lotion as that tends to create clumps of dead skin when giving long massages.</li>
            <li> Water soluble so easily washes out of sheets&lt;br /&gt;Same theurapeutic qualities without the mess&lt;br /&gt;Great skin hydrating properties&lt;br /&gt;Time to order more</li>
            <li> Great, non greasy like a lotion but gives glide like an oil. No scent, good for clients with sensitive needs.</li>
            <li> The Biotone massage gel is the absolute best; it combines the benefits of premium quality lotion and oil, and it&#x27;s GREAT for the skin! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Glides nicely.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this at a massage spa where a happy ending was offered.  It was the best massage I&#x27;d ever had.  Part of the reason for that was the effortless and smooth way her hands glided across my body from head to toe - including the most sensitive of areas.  After the massage I asked her what she used and she showed me this.  Luckily I found it on Amazon and it is now the go to lubricant of choice when I have to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li> just what i needed i ordered this for someone and i was exactly as stated. This is what most massage therapies uses</li>
            <li> It was what I was looking for.  Only needed a little bit per limb like a couple drops.  Not greasy at all. Just disappeared!  Great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s the only gel I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it keeps mens body hair from forming those little&amp;#34; hair ball knots&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I put this on my skin right after receiving it.  It would be great except for the fake perfume smell.  I had to take a shower it was bothering me so much.&lt;br /&gt;Yuk. Such a disappointment for Biotone products.  They should make this with natural fragrance or fragrance free.  The main ingredient is&lt;br /&gt;Canola Oil&#x3D;Rape Seed Oil.  Although many companies use this in food it was originally used for machinery lube.  I avoid foods with Canola&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it is OK on skin, i.e. does it breath?  ....thus it&#x27;s nice glide and long lasting ability.  It does seem to have that quality but again I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;sure about it on skin.  The container says Grapeseed, Apricot, and Sesame on the front.  I suppose Grapeseed Oil instead of Canola is too expensive.  I find this misleading.  At any rate it reaks of an annoying fake perfume/fragrance smell.  Biotone, I know you can make a better gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a massage therapist for 16 years and love this stuff.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it washes out well.  My sheets last longer because they don&#x27;t have that stale-oil odor.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not too greasy and don&#x27;t need to keep adding more. What l like most is that it is exactly what my PT uses and I don&#x27;t need to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Love this gel. Allows for a nice glide and it&#x27;s the perfect consistency .  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel on your hands.</li>
