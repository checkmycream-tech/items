            <li>This is a great color of purple.  </li>
            <li>This color is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend, liked it!</li>
            <li>It is a bright purple- not quite neon, but bright and sassy.  </li>
            <li>Bright, almost neon purple.</li>
            <li>got a good color with just two coats</li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous neon type of purple.</li>
            <li>It does take like three coats to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>this is a good summer color, its darker than most, but still bright in color.  </li>
            <li>I got many compliments with this shade!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled with the color.</li>
            <li>It is a nice neon-like purple.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready for another color, the good thing is that I don&#x27;t have to soak my nails in acetone because the color just peels off!</li>
            <li>I ordered this from a reputable Ebay seller.</li>
            <li>and one week later, the stuff is just as shiny and just as perfect as the day I put it on.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>After finishing it was more of a, Magenta maybe?</li>
            <li>I am sure someone will like this color, it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>and I got more compliments on this shade</li>
            <li>Stunning color in two coats.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to look up photos of this color before you buy based on the producer photo alone.</li>
            <li>Ended up purchasing the gelish mini version and it was more of the grape color</li>
            <li>better quality than the rio and the colors are about the Glow;).once again</li>
            <li>I love the color, with two coats it is a purple/pink fuchsia color.</li>
            <li>Not too bright but bright enough.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really look like the colour pictured, is more of a pinky purple rather than bright violet purple  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought it, it was this amazing purple/magenta color.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this deep and bright purple color.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the light sorce it can change color a bit.</li>
            <li>so I ordered here because I liked the sample so much.  </li>
            <li>Looks great with many other colors.  </li>
            <li>Very eye catching and true to the color you see in  the picture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful fuschia purple pink</li>
            <li>This was the first Gelish polish I ever used and really love the color.  </li>
            <li>This color is so awsome GETS LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS bright purple very different</li>
            <li>It takes 2 or 3 coats to get full coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li>I prefer the look of the true purple as shown in the photos that other reviewers were so kind to post.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Gelish.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this color on myself or my daughter, people comment on what a pretty purple it is.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on the color, but if i happen to snag or hit my nail on something, the paint chips and then the whole thing peels off!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so runny that I couldn&#x27;t even get the first coat to cover my nail...</li>
            <li>this is a pretty color</li>
            <li>As usual package was good and shipping super fast.</li>
            <li>Okay, It is definitely not the flat purple it is showing but is actually a brighter lighter purple , it is a verrry nice color</li>
            <li>The color looks absolutely nothing like the color on the screen.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.  </li>
            <li>It looked too much like Tahit Hottie.</li>
            <li>This gelish color is a vibrant purple.</li>
            <li>I have several different shades of Gelish &amp;#34;purples&amp;#34;, but now this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I have quite a few Gelish polishes, but this one is currently my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I need to work more on applying the polish because I did it alittle uneven.  </li>
            <li>It seems real watery compared to some of the other colors and took 3 coats (nothing new there) to get a full color.</li>
            <li>I used 2 coats to get the desired color I wanted and have gotten compliments many times in just a few days!  </li>
            <li>The white makes it really pop.</li>
            <li>Goes on well, needs 3 coats to cover completely.</li>
            <li>As a professional nail tech, I know that these colors are made in batches.</li>
            <li>I am black American (brown skin) and the colors are fabulous .way</li>

            <li> It is a neon purple where on the screen it looks like a dark purple and it definitely isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The second time it was much more pink and not purple at all :(</li>
            <li> however it is a purple pink color not purple.  </li>
            <li> it kept running to the center.</li>
            <li> then any other color I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s gotten to the point where I&#x27;m actually trying to get it to chip</li>
            <li> Not a true purple purple like I was hoping.</li>
            <li> (make you blink pink,radiance,lime green and purple).</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this at all</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just my bottle, but it seemed a bit runny and was shrinking on my nails.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not real gelish or it&#x27;s fake?</li>
            <li> This polish does not chip even though I am very hard on my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Maybe try with a white base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this polish.</li>

            <li> Absolutely my favorite color!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend, liked it!</li>
            <li> I have quite a few Gelish polishes, but this one is currently my favorite.  It is a bright purple- not quite neon, but bright and sassy.  I used three coats to get an opaque finish.  I can&#x27;t stop staring at my beautiful nails!</li>
            <li> The color looks absolutely nothing like the color on the screen. It is a neon purple where on the screen it looks like a dark purple and it definitely isn&#x27;t. I am not pleased with this at all</li>
            <li> this is a good summer color, its darker than most, but still bright in color.  got a good color with just two coats</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech. I ordered this from a reputable Ebay seller. Unfortunately, the color was more of a purpley-magenta color. I prefer the look of the true purple as shown in the photos that other reviewers were so kind to post. That being said, I&#x27;m extra rough on my nails, as I also do hair. This is my first experience with Gelish. This polish has been indestructible. Seriously, it&#x27;s gotten to the point where I&#x27;m actually trying to get it to chip (picking at stuff with my thumbs, etc.) and one week later, the stuff is just as shiny and just as perfect as the day I put it on. I&#x27;m truly impressed.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this color on myself or my daughter, people comment on what a pretty purple it is. Lovely.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  Keep in mind however it is a purple pink color not purple.  Not sure if it was just my bottle, but it seemed a bit runny and was shrinking on my nails.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on the color, but if i happen to snag or hit my nail on something, the paint chips and then the whole thing peels off! If my nails happen to last two weeks and I&#x27;m ready for another color, the good thing is that I don&#x27;t have to soak my nails in acetone because the color just peels off!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a purple to add to my collection and decided to try this one. I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled with the color. It seems real watery compared to some of the other colors and took 3 coats (nothing new there) to get a full color. After finishing it was more of a, Magenta maybe? Not a true purple purple like I was hoping. Then again, I did not look for proper swatches before purchase so do realize it was my fault. I am sure someone will like this color, it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> So, this is my fav at my salon where I get my nails done. It&#x27;s a beautiful fuschia purple pink but when I got this one, it&#x27;s a deep purple, just like the picture. Same name and two different shades? I&#x27;m so disappointed. The picture of my toes is what it should be from the salon and the bottle is what I got. Maybe it&#x27;s not real gelish or it&#x27;s fake?</li>
            <li> THis is the perfect color for a neon polish.  Not too bright but bright enough.  I love this one.  Depending on the light sorce it can change color a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great color of purple.  It takes 2 or 3 coats to get full coverage.  I like it.</li>
            <li> This was the first Gelish polish I ever used and really love the color.  I need to work more on applying the polish because I did it alittle uneven.  I used 2 coats to get the desired color I wanted and have gotten compliments many times in just a few days!  This polish does not chip even though I am very hard on my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now. It is a gorgeous neon type of purple. Ideal for Spring/Summer!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really look like the colour pictured, is more of a pinky purple rather than bright violet purple  that&#x27;s pictured</li>
            <li> Okay, It is definitely not the flat purple it is showing but is actually a brighter lighter purple , it is a verrry nice color and I got more compliments on this shade then any other color I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> Stunning color in two coats.  I feel like I&#x27;ve got a fuchsia plant on my fingers!  I had seen the actual color at our local Sally Beauty supply but they didn&#x27;t have it in so I ordered here because I liked the sample so much.  So happy I did!</li>
            <li> This gelish color is a vibrant purple. It&#x27;s amazing. I do 3 coats, if u want it brighter do a coat of white then two coats of purple.... The white makes it really pop.</li>
            <li> Great nailpolish! However the picture or description should reveal that the color is a neon purple and not at all a royal blue. Make sure to look up photos of this color before you buy based on the producer photo alone.</li>
            <li> I love this deep and bright purple color.  Looks great with many other colors.  Goes on well, needs 3 coats to cover completely.</li>
            <li> This color is so awsome GETS LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS bright purple very different have 4 other purples all different color ranges this is a beauty</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely amazing! No curing issues at all! I would highly recommend this one. It is a nice neon-like purple.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this polish. It&#x27;s so runny that I couldn&#x27;t even get the first coat to cover my nail...it kept running to the center. I will be returning it. :-(</li>
            <li> Color changes to blue after 2 days</li>
            <li> If you want your nails to get some attention, this is the color you should use.  I have several different shades of Gelish &amp;#34;purples&amp;#34;, but now this is my favorite.  It went on evenly and the color is to die for.</li>
            <li> Very eye catching and true to the color you see in  the picture.  I got many compliments with this shade!</li>
            <li> this is a pretty color but it&#x27;s runny, you need a lot of coats for it to be a solid color.</li>
            <li> As a professional nail tech, I know that these colors are made in batches. The first time I bought it, it was this amazing purple/magenta color. The second time it was much more pink and not purple at all :(</li>
            <li> Not the color I was hoping for. It looked too much like Tahit Hottie. Ended up purchasing the gelish mini version and it was more of the grape color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> GREAT COLOR! One of my favorites, I always get compliments!</li>
            <li> Bright, almost neon purple. I did use three coats because I do not like a visible nail line. Happy with product and service!</li>
            <li> I have four of the six colors (make you blink pink,radiance,lime green and purple). Gelish has done it again. I love the consistency not to thin or thick like spring collection of this year. I am black American (brown skin) and the colors are fabulous .way better quality than the rio and the colors are about the Glow;).once again thank you gelish coverage for my liking was three coats with each..but  I could have gotten away with two. As usual package was good and shipping super fast.</li>
            <li> It does take like three coats to get good coverage. Maybe try with a white base coat.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! I love the color, with two coats it is a purple/pink fuchsia color.</li>
