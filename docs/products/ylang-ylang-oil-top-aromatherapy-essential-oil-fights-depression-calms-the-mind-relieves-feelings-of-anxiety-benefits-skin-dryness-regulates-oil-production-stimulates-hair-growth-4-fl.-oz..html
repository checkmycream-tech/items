            <li>This stuff is amazing, it smells so good, used it on my skin first and its soft and</li>

            <li>The bottle also states that this item is bottled in the USA and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad strong but</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use much though because it is very strong.</li>
            <li>The dropper came sealed to ensure it was clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and he fell right to sleep!</li>
            <li>Ylang Ylang Oil is one of my favorite oils scent wise because of the floral-y smell so trying this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals was definitely an excitement to me!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a promotional price on the fair understanding that I would leave an unbiased and objective review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always loved essential oils.</li>
            <li>Body Naturals sends you 4 full oz.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;d save money buying this at full price.  </li>
            <li>I got this oil because I loved smelling the one at the store by a different brand</li>
            <li>Ylang is very good for emotional wellbeing and relaxation which is a must in our very busy household.</li>
            <li>When first opening the bottle, the smell was extremely strong.</li>
            <li>The oil is clear and free of contaminants and feels very light on, with no overly greasy residue with can indicate that an oil has been diluted..</li>
            <li>The scent is not only refreshing but an aphrodisiac and promotes healthy stress levels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product, it&#x27;s liquid consistency, it&#x27;s liquid color, it&#x27;s fragrance, it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s dark tinted glass bottle and the bonus dropper.</li>
            <li>It has so many great topical uses from aiding in the healing process of minor cuts or blemishes to eczema and even stress relief/antidepressant qualities even when just absorbed!</li>
            <li>This is the first day of use and I&#x27;m already sold on this product , I got a discount for Dollardealsreview.com and only paid $1.00 for the whole bottle, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing this again or ones like it , great company.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use very much of it at first because it really had an overwhelming scent to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a 4 oz bottle so it will last a long time at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li>When I walked back in, I started to smell the flower and it was much better!</li>
            <li>I also placed this in my diffuser when I was studying and noticed I was much more attentive and less stressed leading to me being more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put it in the diffuser in my kitchen and it smells amazing through out my entire downstairs.</li>
            <li>The oil comes with a dropper and that is so useful.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a dark amber color and comes with it&#x27;s own glass dropper for easy application and measurement.</li>
            <li>It comes in a dark bottle to prevent light spoilage and also comes with a glass pipette dropper (which I love!)</li>
            <li>With a dropper, you can get the right amount into your diffuser, burner, or on your wrist.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a glass dropper so you can get the right amount of oil without wasting it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in my scalp yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will at least smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more from this company when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is this awesome, but I know quite a few people that should be trying this oil!</li>
            <li>I love the floral scent that Ylang Ylang essential oil has.</li>
            <li>I received my first sample bottle from this company at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions with this oil.</li>
            <li>love that the company (Pure Body Naturals) has given the most common uses and ideas for use of this oil right on the bottle to help those who may be unfamiliar with the use of oils.</li>
            <li>The amount of oil that you receive is such a good amount that you will  have ample to experiment on the different uses.  </li>
            <li>Very calming and peaceful.</li>
            <li>and she stays on full alert so this has been helping when I can control everything early in the day and continually.</li>
            <li>I accidentally got this in my eyes when i was applying it to my face, and it left a strong burning sensation...</li>
            <li>so I decided to give this Pure Body Naturals brand a try.</li>
            <li>so this feels pure to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the sent is helping with my mood , I&#x27;m a first time user of essential oils, but have herd amazing things about them, I wanted to try this one out due to me being pregnant and my moods being everywhere.</li>
            <li>My husband said he didn’t think it was that strong but more of a subtle floral</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It helps relaxing muscle tension, anger, depression, and anxiety promoting a healthy mood!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many more</li>
            <li>It was very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li>The scent is so pleasing but exercise caution as the scent it can be overpowering if you use too much.</li>
            <li>It is so relaxing and really helps me to unwind after work.</li>
            <li>The Ylang Ylang oil smells very floral and relaxes you.</li>
            <li>This is a superior quality oil, I tried other brands for this variety and this one is the real deal, no mixed smells.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite oils to diffuse in the evenings now (my other one is lavender).</li>
            <li>Essential oils and natural fragrances are fine for me though.  </li>
            <li>Less tang, more depth.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, this oil really ups the anti and gets you going!</li>
            <li>Encourages new hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>Put into my new diffuser</li>
            <li>This 4oz bottle is Huge and will be lasting me months even with the frequency I use it because it only takes 2-3 drops for any application.</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals Ylang Ylang Oil (Cananga Odorata) is a 100% pure, natural and therapeutic Grade Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to open, but after reading others reviews I had to see it for myself.</li>
            <li>only complaint about this item is that it is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li>The dropper was broken, but that was in shipping, so my stars don&#x27;t reflect it (not the seller&#x27;s fault), which was a shame, because that makes it a lot better!  </li>
            <li>I personally have a less quality brand that I use for my diffuser and save this one for my baths and skincare because I know this one is better quality.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body</li>
            <li>I like adding a couple drops to my bath and its been helping to clear up my skin and some acne issues</li>
            <li>and it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Just got into using natural oils...</li>
            <li>I had burned patchouli incense since I was a teenager, and when, in my early 20&#x27;s, I developed a sensitivity to chemical perfumes, I started wearing it in oil form.  </li>
            <li>so whenever I&#x27;m around them I can smell them and feel like I have real flowers next to me.</li>
            <li>simply a scent I would much prefer if it was lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>smell of this is so much better than the other, more expensive type I have.  </li>
            <li>I love Ylang Ylang and was nervous that not buying my usual brand would result in lesser quality-</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals has indeed made a high quality Ylang Ylang oil that smells just as floral-y as any other brand of ylang ylang oil</li>
            <li>I use it in my diffuser and just a few drops goes a long way and fills the whole house with this sweet floral aroma.</li>
            <li>The directions for different uses were very clear.</li>
            <li>I will say you have to be careful how much you you use, because it will increase the intensity of the smell.</li>
            <li>I said, I paid a lot for my first bottle and it smells sort of odd (zesty?)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tired many oils in the past with one other ylang ylang to compare it to and this one is a much better quality than the last.  </li>
            <li>I still have my small bottle of fairly expensive ylang ylang oil that I bought a while back (after the episode of New Girl where all day people were talking about how great Schmidt smelled, and every time he responded, &#x27;I smell like the oil from the ylang ylang tree.&#x27;)  </li>
            <li>Without one, you end up with spills on the first two, and a fingerfull of wasted oil on the last.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Don&#x27;t use much though because it is very strong.</li>
            <li> The dropper came sealed to ensure it was clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and he fell right to sleep!</li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang Oil is one of my favorite oils scent wise because of the floral-y smell so trying this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals was definitely an excitement to me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a promotional price on the fair understanding that I would leave an unbiased and objective review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Body Naturals sends you 4 full oz.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;d save money buying this at full price.  </li>
            <li> I got this oil because I loved smelling the one at the store by a different brand</li>
            <li> Ylang is very good for emotional wellbeing and relaxation which is a must in our very busy household.</li>
            <li> When first opening the bottle, the smell was extremely strong.</li>

            <li> The scent is not only refreshing but an aphrodisiac and promotes healthy stress levels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product, it&#x27;s liquid consistency, it&#x27;s liquid color, it&#x27;s fragrance, it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s dark tinted glass bottle and the bonus dropper.</li>
            <li> It has so many great topical uses from aiding in the healing process of minor cuts or blemishes to eczema and even stress relief/antidepressant qualities even when just absorbed!</li>
            <li> This is the first day of use and I&#x27;m already sold on this product , I got a discount for Dollardealsreview.com and only paid $1.00 for the whole bottle, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing this again or ones like it , great company.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use very much of it at first because it really had an overwhelming scent to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a 4 oz bottle so it will last a long time at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> When I walked back in, I started to smell the flower and it was much better!</li>
            <li> I also placed this in my diffuser when I was studying and noticed I was much more attentive and less stressed leading to me being more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put it in the diffuser in my kitchen and it smells amazing through out my entire downstairs.</li>
            <li> The oil comes with a dropper and that is so useful.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a dark amber color and comes with it&#x27;s own glass dropper for easy application and measurement.</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark bottle to prevent light spoilage and also comes with a glass pipette dropper (which I love!)</li>
            <li> With a dropper, you can get the right amount into your diffuser, burner, or on your wrist.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a glass dropper so you can get the right amount of oil without wasting it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in my scalp yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will at least smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more from this company when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is this awesome, but I know quite a few people that should be trying this oil!</li>
            <li> I love the floral scent that Ylang Ylang essential oil has.</li>
            <li> I received my first sample bottle from this company at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions with this oil.</li>
            <li> love that the company (Pure Body Naturals) has given the most common uses and ideas for use of this oil right on the bottle to help those who may be unfamiliar with the use of oils.</li>
            <li> The amount of oil that you receive is such a good amount that you will  have ample to experiment on the different uses.  </li>
            <li> Very calming and peaceful.</li>
            <li> and she stays on full alert so this has been helping when I can control everything early in the day and continually.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got this in my eyes when i was applying it to my face, and it left a strong burning sensation...</li>
            <li> so I decided to give this Pure Body Naturals brand a try.</li>
            <li> so this feels pure to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the sent is helping with my mood , I&#x27;m a first time user of essential oils, but have herd amazing things about them, I wanted to try this one out due to me being pregnant and my moods being everywhere.</li>
            <li> My husband said he didn’t think it was that strong but more of a subtle floral</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It helps relaxing muscle tension, anger, depression, and anxiety promoting a healthy mood!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many more</li>
            <li> It was very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li> The scent is so pleasing but exercise caution as the scent it can be overpowering if you use too much.</li>
            <li> It is so relaxing and really helps me to unwind after work.</li>
            <li> The Ylang Ylang oil smells very floral and relaxes you.</li>
            <li> This is a superior quality oil, I tried other brands for this variety and this one is the real deal, no mixed smells.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils to diffuse in the evenings now (my other one is lavender).</li>
            <li> Essential oils and natural fragrances are fine for me though.  </li>
            <li> Less tang, more depth.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, this oil really ups the anti and gets you going!</li>
            <li> Encourages new hair growth.</li>
            <li> and I live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> Put into my new diffuser</li>
            <li> This 4oz bottle is Huge and will be lasting me months even with the frequency I use it because it only takes 2-3 drops for any application.</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals Ylang Ylang Oil (Cananga Odorata) is a 100% pure, natural and therapeutic Grade Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to open, but after reading others reviews I had to see it for myself.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this item is that it is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li> The dropper was broken, but that was in shipping, so my stars don&#x27;t reflect it (not the seller&#x27;s fault), which was a shame, because that makes it a lot better!  </li>
            <li> I personally have a less quality brand that I use for my diffuser and save this one for my baths and skincare because I know this one is better quality.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body</li>
            <li> I like adding a couple drops to my bath and its been helping to clear up my skin and some acne issues</li>
            <li> and it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Just got into using natural oils...</li>
            <li> I had burned patchouli incense since I was a teenager, and when, in my early 20&#x27;s, I developed a sensitivity to chemical perfumes, I started wearing it in oil form.  </li>
            <li> so whenever I&#x27;m around them I can smell them and feel like I have real flowers next to me.</li>
            <li> simply a scent I would much prefer if it was lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> smell of this is so much better than the other, more expensive type I have.  </li>
            <li> I love Ylang Ylang and was nervous that not buying my usual brand would result in lesser quality-</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals has indeed made a high quality Ylang Ylang oil that smells just as floral-y as any other brand of ylang ylang oil</li>
            <li> I use it in my diffuser and just a few drops goes a long way and fills the whole house with this sweet floral aroma.</li>
            <li> The directions for different uses were very clear.</li>
            <li> I will say you have to be careful how much you you use, because it will increase the intensity of the smell.</li>
            <li> I said, I paid a lot for my first bottle and it smells sort of odd (zesty?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired many oils in the past with one other ylang ylang to compare it to and this one is a much better quality than the last.  </li>
            <li> I still have my small bottle of fairly expensive ylang ylang oil that I bought a while back (after the episode of New Girl where all day people were talking about how great Schmidt smelled, and every time he responded, &#x27;I smell like the oil from the ylang ylang tree.&#x27;)  </li>
            <li> Without one, you end up with spills on the first two, and a fingerfull of wasted oil on the last.  </li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang Oil comes in a 4oz bottle which will last for a long time for me personally anyways.</li>
            <li> My first initial thought was WHOA that is one serious floral scent.</li>
            <li> I compared the fragrance of this bottle of Ylang Ylang EO with other bottles of Ylang Ylang EO that I already had in my possession (which were substantially more expensive in price and brand &#x27;fame&#x27;</li>
            <li> I use this essential oil as a perfume and mix it with other oils for aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Also mixed in a base of coconut oil to make a nice massage oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle says to leave the oil in your hair over night but as a test I left it in longer and found that my hair was actually less oily then it would be unwashed.</li>
            <li> you are missing out on total control of the body naturally.&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li> This brand is no different than the other expensive bottle I bought from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I needed to rinse my eyes and face under cold water for several minutes in order to reduce the &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;... therefore I would recommend that you do NOT apply this to the face to avoid this, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> other than its a oil not a vream</li>
            <li> I also like to add a few drops of essential oils into a small container of coconut oil</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it is less frizzy</li>
            <li> so I wanted to see if I could put a little bit of the Ylang Ylang oil on them to make them have the floral scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, I have been having trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> I am adding a few drops into our conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is made of heavy duty glass.</li>
            <li> I was dealing with lately.</li>
            <li> I used it behind my ears and in my hair.</li>
            <li> Also in regards to it&#x27;s vasodilating properties it will increase blood flow, thereby causing a decreased stress on the heart and the heart rate will decrease and provide a calming effect on the body.  </li>
            <li> I have some artificial flowers</li>
            <li> I put a couple drops on a cotton ball and ran it over the artificial flowers and</li>
            <li> With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t make this product horrible -</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product at a promotional price on the fair understanding that I would leave an unbiased and objective review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The is great Ylang Ylang EO; it&#x27;s a product of Madagascar that&#x27;s bottled in the USA. I&#x27;m an essential oil enthusiast and have quite a collection EO&#x27;s in my cabinet. I compared the fragrance of this bottle of Ylang Ylang EO with other bottles of Ylang Ylang EO that I already had in my possession (which were substantially more expensive in price and brand &#x27;fame&#x27; I might add) and this bottle of divine fragrance matched them in floral intensity and richness. Ylang Ylang is one of my favorite EO&#x27;s. I&#x27;m using it in my EO air diffuser as I write. I&#x27;m happy with this product, it&#x27;s liquid consistency, it&#x27;s liquid color, it&#x27;s fragrance, it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s dark tinted glass bottle and the bonus dropper.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of Ylang Ylang oil! This brand is no different than the other expensive bottle I bought from Whole Foods. I use this essential oil as a perfume and mix it with other oils for aromatherapy. The bottle is a dark amber color and comes with it&#x27;s own glass dropper for easy application and measurement. The bottle arrived sealed with no leakage issues. At the price it&#x27;s listed (around $18) I will definitely buy more from this company when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have always loved essential oils. They have so many beneficial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I have been having trouble sleeping. So I read that Ylang Ylang oil helps with that so I decided to give this Pure Body Naturals brand a try. When first opening the bottle, the smell was extremely strong. I really didn&#x27;t like it. Didn&#x27;t smell like a flower at all. But I tried it anyway. I ended up putting it in my oil diffuser and mixing it with lavender oil and that helped a lot. I walked out of the room for a while and let it circulate. When I walked back in, I started to smell the flower and it was much better! Slept like a champ too! Woke up so relaxed and refreshed. So I decided to see what else it&#x27;s good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ylang Ylang oil:&lt;br /&gt;(pronounced Eee-lang Eee-lang)&lt;br /&gt;1. Encourages new hair growth. This is probably what I am most excited about! I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair to grow healthier and this might just be my ticket!&lt;br /&gt;2. Balancing complexion. Whether you have oily, dry, or combination skin, ylang ylang oil can help you achieve the perfect balanced complexion.&lt;br /&gt;3. Increase sexual desire. You can&#x27;t read an article without each one of them mentioning this fact. Apparently, this oil really ups the anti and gets you going! We shall see I suppose!&lt;br /&gt;4. Depression/anxiety. Not only is this awesome, but I know quite a few people that should be trying this oil! It helps relaxing muscle tension, anger, depression, and anxiety promoting a healthy mood!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many more but I&#x27;ll just stop here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals Ylang Ylang Oil (Cananga Odorata) is a 100% pure, natural and therapeutic Grade Essential Oil. It came in a 4fl.oz glass bottle with a separate oil dripper. My first initial thought was WHOA that is one serious floral scent. I was hesitant to use very much of it at first because it really had an overwhelming scent to me. My husband said he didn’t think it was that strong but more of a subtle floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using my ZAQ oil diffuser so I decided to start off by diffusing the Ylang oil in the bedroom. I noticed it worked very quickly on the baby and he fell right to sleep! It was very calming and relaxing. The oil as it was diffusing was much more soothing then when I just tried smelling it in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ylang Ylang is very good for emotional wellbeing and relaxation which is a must in our very busy household. I have also been told that its great for your skin and hair. I am eager to see how it works on our hair. I am adding a few drops into our conditioner. I also like to add a few drops of essential oils into a small container of coconut oil and then you can use it as a massage oil or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This item was received at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> I love the floral scent that Ylang Ylang essential oil has. Upon receiving this item, I opened it and placed it in my diffuser and OH the smell is wonderful. The amount of oil that you receive is such a good amount that you will  have ample to experiment on the different uses.  The scent is so pleasing but exercise caution as the scent it can be overpowering if you use too much. The oil comes with a dropper and that is so useful. As I am beginning to unlock the uses for essential oil I had to see what I uses I could possibly find and after conducting some researchI found  that Ylang ylang oil supports emotional and spiritual balance.I  saw where the scent of Ylang ylang is thought to an aphrodisiac (I will have to test that at a later time). I received this oil at a promotional price and said I would evaluate the product honestly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.. I recieved it yesterday and have used it in my diffuser all day today. I  have seen an improvement in my overall mood. I&#x27;ve felt more productive all day. I put it in the diffuser in my kitchen and it smells amazing through out my entire downstairs. I would recommend this product and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fragrance! Some ylang ylang I don&#x27;t like but this one is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a very big bottle ( 4 ounces!) of therapeutic grade Ylang Ylang essential oil. It is not diluted in a carrier oil. It comes in a dark bottle to prevent light spoilage and also comes with a glass pipette dropper (which I love!) The smell is reminiscent of lilies to me, but not so overpowering. The oil is clear and free of contaminants and feels very light on, with no overly greasy residue with can indicate that an oil has been diluted..so this feels pure to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the company (Pure Body Naturals) has given the most common uses and ideas for use of this oil right on the bottle to help those who may be unfamiliar with the use of oils. The directions for different uses were very clear. The bottle also states that this item is bottled in the USA and cruelty free. Overall, I am very happy with the oil and will be looking for more from this company.</li>
            <li> For those who do not know the oil Ylang Ylang you are missing out on total control of the body naturally.&lt;br /&gt;Pure Body Naturals sends you 4 full oz. Of top quality therapeutic oil along with a dropper for easy dispensing and I use this with my diffuser to let the go throughout the house to balance everyone and everything. I have a chocolate lab and she stays on full alert so this has been helping when I can control everything early in the day and continually. For my pain especially on overcast days this goes to help with the pain and balancing my body working to heal me I think from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;I stay calmer, more focus in with the days I use this Ylang Ylang.  To me this is must have in any household.&lt;br /&gt;Pure Body Naturals gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product</li>
            <li> I love ylang ylang.  The smell is very romantic.  Don&#x27;t use much though because it is very strong.</li>
            <li> Great smell, i like to use it just as I would perfume. I accidentally got this in my eyes when i was applying it to my face, and it left a strong burning sensation... I needed to rinse my eyes and face under cold water for several minutes in order to reduce the &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;... therefore I would recommend that you do NOT apply this to the face to avoid this, especially if you have sensitive skin. aside from that it is great all over the body.</li>
            <li> aromatherapy has been a life saver to me with my anxiety disorder. I did order this oil through a special promotion to try it and share my honest opinion. This oil smells really good and it is all natural. I use it in my diffuser and just a few drops goes a long way and fills the whole house with this sweet floral aroma. Ylang Ylang is great as a mood booster and I also use it diluted in fractioned coconut oil and use a roll on bottle that I carry in my purse for stressful situations. This is a superior quality oil, I tried other brands for this variety and this one is the real deal, no mixed smells.</li>
            <li> I have began to fall in love with this oil. I used it behind my ears and in my hair. The smell lasts all day and my hair feels amazing when I apply the oil and is making my hair healthier. The bottle says to leave the oil in your hair over night but as a test I left it in longer and found that my hair was actually less oily then it would be unwashed. I feel like it has added balance to my hair. I also noticed that it is less frizzy and I live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> Just got into using natural oils... other than its a oil not a vream i love it... my skin looks better already.... i got it for a reduced price for my unbiased opinion... thank you. .. again cant wait to see more changes....</li>
            <li> Oh, my.  This is really nice AND huge.  I still have my small bottle of fairly expensive ylang ylang oil that I bought a while back (after the episode of New Girl where all day people were talking about how great Schmidt smelled, and every time he responded, &#x27;I smell like the oil from the ylang ylang tree.&#x27;)  Prior to that I always wore patchouli.  I had burned patchouli incense since I was a teenager, and when, in my early 20&#x27;s, I developed a sensitivity to chemical perfumes, I started wearing it in oil form.  I added ylang ylang (ylang ylang on my neck, patchouli on my wrist, not mixed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I paid a lot for my first bottle and it smells sort of odd (zesty?) from the bottle, but is beautiful ON, after it soaks in.  I was given a discount to honestly review this one, so of course I figured I&#x27;d save money buying this!  Well, I&#x27;d save money buying this at full price.  It is HUGE.  The dropper was broken, but that was in shipping, so my stars don&#x27;t reflect it (not the seller&#x27;s fault), which was a shame, because that makes it a lot better!  With a dropper, you can get the right amount into your diffuser, burner, or on your wrist.  Without one, you end up with spills on the first two, and a fingerfull of wasted oil on the last.  Then again, with this bottle, there is plenty to wear on your fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this is so much better than the other, more expensive type I have.  It&#x27;s earthier.  Less tang, more depth.  I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, I just smelled it from the bottle.  I will update this review in a couple of days when I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
            <li> I love the floral scent of Ylang Ylang! It is so relaxing and really helps me to unwind after work. When I put a few drops into my diffuser it leaves my house with a very inviting fragrance and I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on it. The scent is not only refreshing but an aphrodisiac and promotes healthy stress levels. I personally have a less quality brand that I use for my diffuser and save this one for my baths and skincare because I know this one is better quality. It has so many great topical uses from aiding in the healing process of minor cuts or blemishes to eczema and even stress relief/antidepressant qualities even when just absorbed! I like adding a couple drops to my bath and its been helping to clear up my skin and some acne issues I was dealing with lately.This 4oz bottle is Huge and will be lasting me months even with the frequency I use it because it only takes 2-3 drops for any application. I definitely recommend trying this oil if you haven&#x27;t before..your skin and health will thank you! I received my first sample bottle from this company at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions with this oil. I am in no way obligated nor would benefit from leaving a good review, this oil is great quality and earned all five stars based on that alone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it smells so good, used it on my skin first and its soft and the sent is helping with my mood , I&#x27;m a first time user of essential oils, but have herd amazing things about them, I wanted to try this one out due to me being pregnant and my moods being everywhere. This is the first day of use and I&#x27;m already sold on this product , I got a discount for Dollardealsreview.com and only paid $1.00 for the whole bottle, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing this again or ones like it , great company. I also like that it&#x27;s n a glass bottle which makes it last longer .</li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang Oil is one of my favorite oils scent wise because of the floral-y smell so trying this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals was definitely an excitement to me! Pure Body Naturals has indeed made a high quality Ylang Ylang oil that smells just as floral-y as any other brand of ylang ylang oil I&#x27;ve tried. I love using this Ylang Ylang oil in my oil diffuser and letting it fill up my house with that amazing relaxing scent. I have some artificial flowers so I wanted to see if I could put a little bit of the Ylang Ylang oil on them to make them have the floral scent so whenever I&#x27;m around them I can smell them and feel like I have real flowers next to me. I put a couple drops on a cotton ball and ran it over the artificial flowers and surprisingly it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ylang Ylang Oil comes in a 4oz bottle which will last for a long time for me personally anyways. It also comes with a glass dropper so you can get the right amount of oil without wasting it. I would definitely recommend this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil with a very fragrant flowery smell.  I&#x27;ve tired many oils in the past with one other ylang ylang to compare it to and this one is a much better quality than the last.  I put mine in the diffuser and it makes my whole room smell great.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite scents.  I did receive this oil at a discount in exchange for my honest review of the product.  When I purchased it I was looking for an oil that doubles as an aphrodisiac.  The reason this works so well is because it dilates the blood flow to increase blood flow to those important regions that need it the most.  Also in regards to it&#x27;s vasodilating properties it will increase blood flow, thereby causing a decreased stress on the heart and the heart rate will decrease and provide a calming effect on the body.  This is a wonderful oil for so many reasons and I just love it.  It&#x27;s also a 4 oz bottle so it will last a long time at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff smells so good!! Great oil! Wonderful product! Must buy! Use it instead for your beauty and holistic medicine. Have anxiety? Get this and the Lavender! Cheers and good health to you!</li>
            <li> Put into my new diffuser and I love the scent. Very calming and peaceful. Not too sterile smelling like the tee tree oil. Also mixed in a base of coconut oil to make a nice massage oil. My woman loves it! :) Purchase thru promotion for honest evaluation.</li>
            <li> This Ylang Ylang oil is great! It came with not only a cap but the dropper topper too. This is really nice when trying get the oil out from the bottle. The bottle is made of heavy duty glass. The dropper came sealed to ensure it was clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this item is that it is SUPER strong. With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t make this product horrible - it just means you need to dilute it with a carrier oil. It is not a bad strong but simply a scent I would much prefer if it was lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and could tell an improvement in my mood. It made me feel much more confident and relaxed. I also placed this in my diffuser when I was studying and noticed I was much more attentive and less stressed leading to me being more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Trying ylang ylang &amp; patchouli oils for depression. It&#x27;s been two weeks &amp; feel so much better.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils to diffuse in the evenings now (my other one is lavender). It has a sweet scent that just makes you feel good. After doing the research on it, it has been shown to have a soothing and relaxing effect on people. I must agree. I am glad that I gave this one a try. I haven&#x27;t used it in my scalp yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will at least smell amazing.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivity and I am allergic to synthetic fragrances. Essential oils and natural fragrances are fine for me though.  I got this oil because I loved smelling the one at the store by a different brand but I wanted a better deal. This one makes me allergic and I am returning it. I have found it to give me a reaction like the one I have to an air freshener or a scented clothing detergent. I don&#x27;t trust the quality.  I am going to get the one at the store.</li>
            <li> The smell is soooooo soothing. I was hesitant at first to open, but after reading others reviews I had to see it for myself. The Ylang Ylang oil smells very floral and relaxes you. I will say you have to be careful how much you you use, because it will increase the intensity of the smell. You will be happy with your purchase and the smell.</li>
            <li> I love Ylang Ylang and was nervous that not buying my usual brand would result in lesser quality- I was wrong, great quality for a great price!  I am thrilled!  I was given a discount for my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> This is cool feels great</li>
