            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>but the foundation itself is awesome like most Revlon products I find the smell does go away after 15 mins after applying and for me the longer</li>

            <li>Ive always loved this foundation</li>

            <li>I also tried their Color Stay under eye concealer, which seems to have extremely good coverage - as well as this</li>
            <li>In this process - I have worn a number of the top rated brand cosmetics - and have tried a whole gamut of products - trying to find the perfect blend and formula for my skin - and something that would match my skin tone - best.  </li>
            <li>Light with very good coverage and</li>
            <li>but I guess its more about the makeup itself which is great I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever had this problem, but I will apply foundation at the beginning of the day, and within a couple of hours, I&#x27;m a very interesting shade of orange.</li>
            <li>Has a great finish and stays on well:)</li>
            <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s got really great coverage.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>This is the kind of foundation that looks better as you wear it throughout the day!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was amazing since It was coming from America to the uk.</li>
            <li>However, this foundation is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it online, perfect colour and SO MUCH CHEAPER than retail stores here in Australia.</li>
            <li>texture is quite nice, and it doesn&#x27;t run, yet goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>So as a beginner, I will just say that I think it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>It lasts about 7 hours oily free on its own or all day with a setting powder!</li>
            <li>This came so quickly, and the price was great.</li>
            <li>I was pretty shiny, but the makeup was still clinging on and hiding my flaws beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like I was applying foundation, more like a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>long wearing great full face foundation :D</li>
            <li>If I had have known how great this product is, I would have tried this when I first had the hunch to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had have known how great this product is, I would have tried this when I first had the hunch to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I found such an excellent product at such an excellent price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, I love the consistency of this foundation!</li>
            <li>The packaging is a bit of an issue, but I will gladly put up with it to be able to use this wonderful product!I cannot recommend this stuff enough and encourage everyone that just can&#x27;t seem to find that foundation that they love to try this out.  </li>
            <li>I wore it the better it looked</li>
            <li>+ containers now and love the texture and how it lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a wonderful feeling finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t look orange on me.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>This foundation is okay.</li>
            <li>make up and love how it looks on.</li>
            <li>love it and am wearing it to my formal in November.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have picked a better product.</li>
            <li>love this creme foundation...</li>
            <li>I had heard many rave reviews on this</li>
            <li>I am sure that doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone&#x27;s skin, but it didn&#x27;t react well to mine.</li>
            <li>I used this with a stipple brush, but I found that I got better coverage using my fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an outstanding foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an outstanding foundation.  </li>
            <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I wish that more of it came in the pot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Saying that, this stuff stays for the most of the day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about it wearing off and it really does stay on amazingly well!  </li>
            <li>I liked it more the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, blends well with a brush or fingers.</li>
            <li>I was dusting over the foundation - Maybelline&#x27;s Shine Free Pressed Powder in Soft Cameo and received a ton of compliments on how great my skin looked, while wearing this foundation/powder combination.  </li>
            <li>- I decided to do a side by side comparison to see which product looked best - midday, when I normally begin to have a major shine - and need re-powdering.  </li>
            <li>- I decided to do a side by side comparison to see which product looked best - midday, when I normally begin to have a major shine - and need re-powdering.  </li>
            <li>and it does provide a very even coverage and nice smooth  finish.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the heavy glass jar is the best packaging</li>
            <li>It feels so light &amp; smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on really nice, although it settled and became overly powdry shockingly fast.</li>
            <li>Great coverage for the acne prone, and a cheaper alternative to the liquid version but does the same job</li>
            <li>My favorite right now..build the coverage you want.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to blend ( I use my fingers to dot it on in sections and blend it in with my fingers before moving on to another section) and works best with a thin layer.  </li>
            <li>I find that the using the wipe and then washing gets almost all of it off since my toner pad that I use afterwards is almost still clean when I get done using it.  </li>
            <li>Though even when I wear this without the finishing powder it still stays on well, I was just attending a special event and wanted that</li>
            <li>it is a great option for people with very fair skin, however can look somewhat heavily applied/cakey, even when buffed into the skin with minimal product (although not to the extent of Rimmel Stay Matte).</li>
            <li>it is med to full coverage.</li>
            <li>; formula is so silky smooth and fun to use.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad, and</li>
            <li>First, Ivory is the perfect color for my pale, cool skin.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and the jar it comes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got that pasty white skin that makes people feel really good about their own skin color when they put their arm out next to mine.</li>
            <li>There was really no reason to look for another formula, or so I thought - because I was pretty darn happy with the results of the Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse formula.  </li>

            <li>, it is easily adaptable for day or night wear depending on how much you put on) then blend well.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning and it stays on all day (in hot, humid Houston, TX!)</li>
            <li>The first application of the foundations proved that Revlon Color Stay Whipped had a much better initial coverage - because I was able to blend over blemishes and this covered much better than the previous Maybelline brand that I had loved so much - before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>- you may be surprised how much you really love this product!  </li>

            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is great because you waste none of the product.</li>
            <li>I will say that it won&#x27;t come off really if you lightly scratch your nose or something, which was a blessing for me.  </li>
            <li>Although it looks like it will be way too pink, it actually blends in and looks great!  </li>
            <li>This is a really great shade for pale people who cant find the right shade.</li>
            <li>(Revlon, just because other companies are charging more - keep your price on this product in the range that it currently is... too many cosmetic companies start charging more - then out price themselves from their loyal following).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which at first I noticed but then realised how so many foundations have some kind of scent to them which usually puts me off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all and feels good on my skin,  Will not be buying the expensive department store brands any more!!</li>
            <li>There are a number of cosmetic companies that are charging far more for their foundation - than Revlon, but not offering the quality that this particular product delivers.</li>
            <li>I purchased this foundation on the strength of some stellar reviews, and I must say it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>SOFT GOING ON, SMOOTH TO THE TOUCH, EVEN APPLICATION, NOT STINKY, LASTS ALL DAY</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>- I finally splurged on this - and have now tried it a couple of days, and LOVE it...</li>
            <li>I got a shade too light (of course) and now I&#x27;m on a search for a decent bronzer, but other than that i love the airbrushed look</li>
            <li>It blends easily &amp; you can add several layers to cover up any spots.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup artist and image consultant with an extensive background in all sorts of cosmetics - and have been lucky enough to wear some of the top end brand foundations - since I was age 13 and first began wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about the foundation is that it&#x27;s actually light enough for my super pale skin.</li>
            <li>one point, I was lucky enough to be wearing La Prairie&#x27;s brand of foundation, which at the time - was about $65.00 per bottle, and truthfully - the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme Makeup works better on my skin - and last longer without needing a touch up - than any other foundation that I have tried in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it stayed on very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation</li>
            <li>I am 70 and found this very drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, covers flaws, I can use it to the last drop.</li>
            <li>I really really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I do reccommend applying one light coat, allow your skin to absorb it, and then a final coat.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It does go on smooth particularly if you use a damp facial sponge.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this over the original Colorstay.</li>
            <li>midday test - was the major eye opener, because the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme - actually stayed much more matte - than what happened about 6 hours after applying the Maybelline brand foundation and powder.  </li>

            <li>This foundation goes on smoothly and has a nice finished look, however, my skin needs to get used to this as I have had a few breakouts, very minor, but still.. i will continue to use it as I have older skin 50</li>
            <li>It provides quite good coverage and only oxidises slightly.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, but it hasn&#x27;t been bothered by this product.</li>
            <li>and this stuff stops me from being a total grease face by the end of the day in comparison to other drugstore foundations I own.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on a beauty list of dry skin friendly foundations.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no odor, no irritation, no chalkiness, no oxidation (a problem I often have with foundation), and it looks fantastic on my skin.</li>
            <li>Its doesnt feel sticky nor heavy when you put it on your face :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good if you have normal to oily skin will little or no blemishes as it loves to cling to dry patches.</li>
            <li>Ok, confession time- I am pale.</li>
            <li>Full coverage foundations often age my skin, settling into the dry pores and emphasizing them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the past couple of years - I was relatively happy with the Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse - and constantly received compliments on my skin, the entire time that I wore this product.  </li>
            <li>and I thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li>fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was right on for my skin, i&#x27;m super pale.  </li>
            <li>so it looks very natural and flattering on the skin.</li>
            <li>You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Makeup is itchy which is usually why after an hour it looks like I didn&#x27;t put on any makeup at all with most things.  </li>
            <li>Before purchasing this foundation, I first looked at all of the reviews and found that a number of people totally adore this product...</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many cosmetic foundations in containers that you must pump, squeeze, shake and/or need various methods of getting to at the half way point.</li>
            <li>The coverage is okay, but not a full enough coverage for me.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the Holy Grail of drugstore foundations, and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li>I have to use this on good skin days so, needless to say it&#x27;s not my &#x27;holy grail&#x27; foundation, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually have yellow undertones, but I decided to get ivory because the yellower tones never work right with my skin.  </li>
            <li>However, I was becoming very tired of having the powder only last a total of 3 weeks... or so - and have been looking for a better product to replace that.  </li>
            <li>However, I was becoming very tired of having the powder only last a total of 3 weeks... or so - and have been looking for a better product to replace that.  </li>
            <li>After my last encounter of a pump type container that was half full with a non-removable cap, I decided it was time for action and that I would never spend another dime on a foundation I could not get to.</li>
            <li>but recently they discontinued my color where I live..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t powder after the initial powdering to set it and the only area that really wore off at all was my nose.  </li>
            <li>a makeup/baby wipe first before washing your face since this stuff doesn&#x27;t just wash off like other foundations.  </li>
            <li>I am normal to dry...</li>
            <li>I have pink undertones, and I&#x27;ve found that the majority of pale foundation shades have a strong orange or yellow tone to them.</li>
            <li>Lightweight makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Color as appears (pretty fair).&lt;br /&gt;Container is a bit heavy</li>
            <li>bottle size was bigger than I expected, it&#x27;s about the size of my palm &amp; is two inches high, although the glass bottle</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help with my dark circles, but my circles are super dark</li>

            <li> If I had have known how great this product is, I would have tried this when I first had the hunch to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that I found such an excellent product at such an excellent price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, I love the consistency of this foundation!</li>
            <li> The packaging is a bit of an issue, but I will gladly put up with it to be able to use this wonderful product!I cannot recommend this stuff enough and encourage everyone that just can&#x27;t seem to find that foundation that they love to try this out.  </li>
            <li> I wore it the better it looked</li>
            <li> + containers now and love the texture and how it lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a wonderful feeling finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t look orange on me.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li> This foundation is okay.</li>
            <li> make up and love how it looks on.</li>
            <li> love it and am wearing it to my formal in November.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have picked a better product.</li>
            <li> love this creme foundation...</li>
            <li> I had heard many rave reviews on this</li>
            <li> I am sure that doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone&#x27;s skin, but it didn&#x27;t react well to mine.</li>
            <li> I used this with a stipple brush, but I found that I got better coverage using my fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an outstanding foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an outstanding foundation.  </li>
            <li> Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li> I love this foundation.</li>
            <li> I wish that more of it came in the pot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Saying that, this stuff stays for the most of the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about it wearing off and it really does stay on amazingly well!  </li>
            <li> I liked it more the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, blends well with a brush or fingers.</li>
            <li> I was dusting over the foundation - Maybelline&#x27;s Shine Free Pressed Powder in Soft Cameo and received a ton of compliments on how great my skin looked, while wearing this foundation/powder combination.  </li>
            <li> - I decided to do a side by side comparison to see which product looked best - midday, when I normally begin to have a major shine - and need re-powdering.  </li>
            <li> - I decided to do a side by side comparison to see which product looked best - midday, when I normally begin to have a major shine - and need re-powdering.  </li>
            <li> and it does provide a very even coverage and nice smooth  finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the heavy glass jar is the best packaging</li>
            <li> It feels so light &amp; smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on really nice, although it settled and became overly powdry shockingly fast.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for the acne prone, and a cheaper alternative to the liquid version but does the same job</li>
            <li> My favorite right now..build the coverage you want.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to blend ( I use my fingers to dot it on in sections and blend it in with my fingers before moving on to another section) and works best with a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> I find that the using the wipe and then washing gets almost all of it off since my toner pad that I use afterwards is almost still clean when I get done using it.  </li>
            <li> Though even when I wear this without the finishing powder it still stays on well, I was just attending a special event and wanted that</li>
            <li> it is a great option for people with very fair skin, however can look somewhat heavily applied/cakey, even when buffed into the skin with minimal product (although not to the extent of Rimmel Stay Matte).</li>
            <li> it is med to full coverage.</li>
            <li> ; formula is so silky smooth and fun to use.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad, and</li>
            <li> First, Ivory is the perfect color for my pale, cool skin.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and the jar it comes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got that pasty white skin that makes people feel really good about their own skin color when they put their arm out next to mine.</li>
            <li> There was really no reason to look for another formula, or so I thought - because I was pretty darn happy with the results of the Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse formula.  </li>

            <li> , it is easily adaptable for day or night wear depending on how much you put on) then blend well.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and it stays on all day (in hot, humid Houston, TX!)</li>
            <li> The first application of the foundations proved that Revlon Color Stay Whipped had a much better initial coverage - because I was able to blend over blemishes and this covered much better than the previous Maybelline brand that I had loved so much - before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> - you may be surprised how much you really love this product!  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is great because you waste none of the product.</li>
            <li> I will say that it won&#x27;t come off really if you lightly scratch your nose or something, which was a blessing for me.  </li>
            <li> Although it looks like it will be way too pink, it actually blends in and looks great!  </li>
            <li> This is a really great shade for pale people who cant find the right shade.</li>
            <li> (Revlon, just because other companies are charging more - keep your price on this product in the range that it currently is... too many cosmetic companies start charging more - then out price themselves from their loyal following).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which at first I noticed but then realised how so many foundations have some kind of scent to them which usually puts me off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all and feels good on my skin,  Will not be buying the expensive department store brands any more!!</li>
            <li> There are a number of cosmetic companies that are charging far more for their foundation - than Revlon, but not offering the quality that this particular product delivers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation on the strength of some stellar reviews, and I must say it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> SOFT GOING ON, SMOOTH TO THE TOUCH, EVEN APPLICATION, NOT STINKY, LASTS ALL DAY</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> - I finally splurged on this - and have now tried it a couple of days, and LOVE it...</li>
            <li> I got a shade too light (of course) and now I&#x27;m on a search for a decent bronzer, but other than that i love the airbrushed look</li>
            <li> It blends easily &amp; you can add several layers to cover up any spots.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup artist and image consultant with an extensive background in all sorts of cosmetics - and have been lucky enough to wear some of the top end brand foundations - since I was age 13 and first began wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the foundation is that it&#x27;s actually light enough for my super pale skin.</li>
            <li> one point, I was lucky enough to be wearing La Prairie&#x27;s brand of foundation, which at the time - was about $65.00 per bottle, and truthfully - the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme Makeup works better on my skin - and last longer without needing a touch up - than any other foundation that I have tried in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it stayed on very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping too.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation</li>
            <li> I am 70 and found this very drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, covers flaws, I can use it to the last drop.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I do reccommend applying one light coat, allow your skin to absorb it, and then a final coat.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It does go on smooth particularly if you use a damp facial sponge.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this over the original Colorstay.</li>
            <li> midday test - was the major eye opener, because the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme - actually stayed much more matte - than what happened about 6 hours after applying the Maybelline brand foundation and powder.  </li>

            <li> This foundation goes on smoothly and has a nice finished look, however, my skin needs to get used to this as I have had a few breakouts, very minor, but still.. i will continue to use it as I have older skin 50</li>
            <li> It provides quite good coverage and only oxidises slightly.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, but it hasn&#x27;t been bothered by this product.</li>
            <li> and this stuff stops me from being a total grease face by the end of the day in comparison to other drugstore foundations I own.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on a beauty list of dry skin friendly foundations.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no odor, no irritation, no chalkiness, no oxidation (a problem I often have with foundation), and it looks fantastic on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its doesnt feel sticky nor heavy when you put it on your face :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good if you have normal to oily skin will little or no blemishes as it loves to cling to dry patches.</li>
            <li> Ok, confession time- I am pale.</li>
            <li> Full coverage foundations often age my skin, settling into the dry pores and emphasizing them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the past couple of years - I was relatively happy with the Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse - and constantly received compliments on my skin, the entire time that I wore this product.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li> fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was right on for my skin, i&#x27;m super pale.  </li>
            <li> so it looks very natural and flattering on the skin.</li>
            <li> You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Makeup is itchy which is usually why after an hour it looks like I didn&#x27;t put on any makeup at all with most things.  </li>
            <li> Before purchasing this foundation, I first looked at all of the reviews and found that a number of people totally adore this product...</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many cosmetic foundations in containers that you must pump, squeeze, shake and/or need various methods of getting to at the half way point.</li>
            <li> The coverage is okay, but not a full enough coverage for me.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the Holy Grail of drugstore foundations, and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I have to use this on good skin days so, needless to say it&#x27;s not my &#x27;holy grail&#x27; foundation, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually have yellow undertones, but I decided to get ivory because the yellower tones never work right with my skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I was becoming very tired of having the powder only last a total of 3 weeks... or so - and have been looking for a better product to replace that.  </li>
            <li> However, I was becoming very tired of having the powder only last a total of 3 weeks... or so - and have been looking for a better product to replace that.  </li>
            <li> After my last encounter of a pump type container that was half full with a non-removable cap, I decided it was time for action and that I would never spend another dime on a foundation I could not get to.</li>
            <li> but recently they discontinued my color where I live..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t powder after the initial powdering to set it and the only area that really wore off at all was my nose.  </li>
            <li> a makeup/baby wipe first before washing your face since this stuff doesn&#x27;t just wash off like other foundations.  </li>
            <li> I am normal to dry...</li>
            <li> I have pink undertones, and I&#x27;ve found that the majority of pale foundation shades have a strong orange or yellow tone to them.</li>
            <li> Lightweight makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Color as appears (pretty fair).&lt;br /&gt;Container is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> bottle size was bigger than I expected, it&#x27;s about the size of my palm &amp; is two inches high, although the glass bottle</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with my dark circles, but my circles are super dark</li>
            <li> This makeup really left my skin looking cakey and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have nearly no experience with make-up.  </li>
            <li> Whipped - looked much more matte and professional, while at the same time - the Maybelline brand was needing a dusting of powder to refinish the base foundation - about 6 hours into wear.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;d rather not look like I&#x27;m going into liver failure, thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the product itself-</li>
            <li> Now excuse me while I go stock up on it just in case it gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> My first negative review on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have dry acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Yes even dry skin.</li>
            <li> Finally something pale enough without washing me out.</li>
            <li> Even Loreal&#x27;s lightest foundation in &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; was too dark and yellow.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I could see this lasting me a while.</li>
            <li> Yes, a little bit darker than my natural skin tone, but I don&#x27;t mind because it gives me a little color, and I don&#x27;t look like the undead.&lt;br /&gt;-The &amp;#34;whipped creme&amp;#34</li>
            <li> After, I put a brushing of finishing powder which gives it a little extra hold.</li>
            <li> I expected it to slide off, if anything.</li>
            <li> I do go back over trouble areas with another thin layer and find that this prevents me from needing much concealer.  </li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;I just haven&#x27;t spent enough time in the sun this summer&amp;#34; pale, but &amp;#34;Let</li>
            <li> me slather this 100spf sunscreen on my Irish skin before I become a walking tomato&amp;#34; pale.</li>
            <li> And finding the right foundation shade to match my ghostly whiteness is difficult.</li>
            <li> For people who need to lighten this foundation,  MAC Face and Body can make it trickier to work with, so you may want to look at other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Ive used other of Revlon&#x27;s foundations</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry skin in my t-zone.</li>
            <li> It also has 10g less product than an average foundation bottle (30mL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slightly powder smell to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t provide very much insight.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more frustrating that leaving the house thinking you look hot, and then checking your car mirror two hours later to discover you look like you had a very bad fake tanning</li>
            <li> You would have to use an excessive amount for it to look that way unlike some other foundations</li>
            <li> I ordered this on amazon because it is not available in the uk.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Use very little to cover what I need.</li>
            <li> I got it within a few days even though it wasn&#x27;t supposed to come until late December.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target (cheaper here) on impulse which I&#x27;m still not sure why.</li>
            <li> I dislike drugstore brands and usually wear Ben Nye, MaC and smashbox.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding products that won&#x27;t just fade away.</li>
            <li> I use this foundation sparingly over my BB cream base since it&#x27;s a little heavy to do all over for my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> Really thick, heavy, and made my face feel dirty.</li>
            <li> is fairly thick!</li>
            <li> It is very hard for me t make this stuff look cakey on my skin.</li>
            <li> So I gave this four stars because the smell of the foundation is not great</li>
            <li> I have been using powder base for so long that I am still learning to apply this one correctly.  </li>
            <li> I Purchased this foundation out of mere curiosity.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so it looked terrible on my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about it wearing off and it really does stay on amazingly well!  I wore it for 14 hours once and it stayed on very well.  I didn&#x27;t powder after the initial powdering to set it and the only area that really wore off at all was my nose.  I was pretty shiny, but the makeup was still clinging on and hiding my flaws beautifully.  I think a powdering in the middle of the day would have prevented this and it would have kept going even longer!  I actually have yellow undertones, but I decided to get ivory because the yellower tones never work right with my skin.  Although it looks like it will be way too pink, it actually blends in and looks great!  It is very easy to blend ( I use my fingers to dot it on in sections and blend it in with my fingers before moving on to another section) and works best with a thin layer.  I do go back over trouble areas with another thin layer and find that this prevents me from needing much concealer.  It doesn&#x27;t help with my dark circles, but my circles are super dark so I don&#x27;t blame the product for that lol.  I do recommend wiping with a makeup/baby wipe first before washing your face since this stuff doesn&#x27;t just wash off like other foundations.  I find that the using the wipe and then washing gets almost all of it off since my toner pad that I use afterwards is almost still clean when I get done using it.  The packaging is a bit of an issue, but I will gladly put up with it to be able to use this wonderful product!I cannot recommend this stuff enough and encourage everyone that just can&#x27;t seem to find that foundation that they love to try this out.  You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have used Loreal for years and I thought I would try something new. This foundation goes on smoothly and has a nice finished look, however, my skin needs to get used to this as I have had a few breakouts, very minor, but still.. i will continue to use it as I have older skin 50+ and it does provide a very even coverage and nice smooth  finish.</li>
            <li> Ive always loved this foundation but recently they discontinued my color where I live.. long wearing great full face foundation :D ~mimi</li>
            <li> Lightweight makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Color as appears (pretty fair).&lt;br /&gt;Container is a bit heavy but there is a moderate amount of makeup inside.</li>
            <li> So I gave this four stars because the smell of the foundation is not great but the foundation itself is awesome like most Revlon products I find the smell does go away after 15 mins after applying and for me the longer I wore it the better it looked which is great I it is med to full coverage. I don&#x27;t think the heavy glass jar is the best packaging but I guess its more about the makeup itself which is great I will buy again. Fast Shipping too.</li>
            <li> I have been using powder base for so long that I am still learning to apply this one correctly.  It does go on smooth particularly if you use a damp facial sponge.</li>
            <li> I use this foundation sparingly over my BB cream base since it&#x27;s a little heavy to do all over for my everyday makeup. Easy to apply, blends well with a brush or fingers. I&#x27;ve been through 2+ containers now and love the texture and how it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It feels so light &amp; smooth on my face. It blends easily &amp; you can add several layers to cover up any spots.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle size was bigger than I expected, it&#x27;s about the size of my palm &amp; is two inches high, although the glass bottle it&#x27;s in is fairly thick!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on amazon because it is not available in the uk. I really like this foundation it&#x27;s good if you have normal to oily skin will little or no blemishes as it loves to cling to dry patches. I have to use this on good skin days so, needless to say it&#x27;s not my &#x27;holy grail&#x27; foundation, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was amazing since It was coming from America to the uk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation on the strength of some stellar reviews, and I must say it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. First, Ivory is the perfect color for my pale, cool skin. I literally could not tell the difference between the foundation and the color of my skin when I was applying it, which leads me to my next point--it is so lightweight and creamy I didn&#x27;t feel like I was applying foundation, more like a nice moisturizer. There is absolutely no odor, no irritation, no chalkiness, no oxidation (a problem I often have with foundation), and it looks fantastic on my skin. I have tried many expensive brands, and none compare to the quality of this one. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the Holy Grail of drugstore foundations, and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! I apply it in the morning and it stays on all day (in hot, humid Houston, TX!). It&#x27;s got great coverage even though it&#x27;s lightweight. My skin is pretty sensitive, but it hasn&#x27;t been bothered by this product. My favorite thing about the foundation is that it&#x27;s actually light enough for my super pale skin. I&#x27;ve got that pasty white skin that makes people feel really good about their own skin color when they put their arm out next to mine. It&#x27;s such a wonderful feeling finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t look orange on me. I&#x27;ve tried out a bunch of higher-end foundations and they&#x27;ve all been too orangey or haven&#x27;t given enough coverage. I&#x27;m thrilled that I found such an excellent product at such an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  It is not heavy at all and feels good on my skin,  Will not be buying the expensive department store brands any more!!</li>
            <li> SOFT GOING ON, SMOOTH TO THE TOUCH, EVEN APPLICATION, NOT STINKY, LASTS ALL DAY, THIS MAKE UP DOES NOT MAKE YOU BREAK OUT!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry skin in my t-zone. Full coverage foundations often age my skin, settling into the dry pores and emphasizing them. I purchased this based on a beauty list of dry skin friendly foundations. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of foundation that looks better as you wear it throughout the day! I do have combination, fair skin and this color and the formula work great with my skin. I apply it with a beauty blender, and touch up the parts of my face that need extra coverage with my fingers. It lasts about 7 hours oily free on its own or all day with a setting powder!</li>
            <li> This foundation is okay. I liked it more the first time I tried it. I have dry skin, so it looked terrible on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 70 and found this very drying. Goes on beautifully...then goes dryyyyyy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have a hard time finding products that won&#x27;t just fade away. I get noticeable results from this make up and love how it looks on. You can&#x27;t get the colour I got (Ivory) in Australia so I ordered it online, perfect colour and SO MUCH CHEAPER than retail stores here in Australia. I have naturally fairly oily skin so I put on the perfecting primer underneath, then rub this between my fingers and apply (for night time coverage, it is easily adaptable for day or night wear depending on how much you put on) then blend well. After, I put a brushing of finishing powder which gives it a little extra hold. Though even when I wear this without the finishing powder it still stays on well, I was just attending a special event and wanted that extra coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is quite nice, and it doesn&#x27;t run, yet goes on nicely. It has a slightly powder smell to it but it&#x27;s not bad, and it&#x27;s just simply not fragranced which at first I noticed but then realised how so many foundations have some kind of scent to them which usually puts me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am wearing it to my formal in November. Couldn&#x27;t have picked a better product.</li>
            <li> This came so quickly, and the price was great. Compared to the store prices that are upwards of $10, this was a steal at only $7. I got it within a few days even though it wasn&#x27;t supposed to come until late December. I definitely recommend this over the original Colorstay.</li>
            <li> Ok, confession time- I am pale. Not &amp;#34;I just haven&#x27;t spent enough time in the sun this summer&amp;#34; pale, but &amp;#34;Let me slather this 100spf sunscreen on my Irish skin before I become a walking tomato&amp;#34; pale. And finding the right foundation shade to match my ghostly whiteness is difficult. I have pink undertones, and I&#x27;ve found that the majority of pale foundation shades have a strong orange or yellow tone to them. Even Loreal&#x27;s lightest foundation in &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; was too dark and yellow. I&#x27;d rather not look like I&#x27;m going into liver failure, thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the product itself- It&#x27;s the perfect shade! Yes, a little bit darker than my natural skin tone, but I don&#x27;t mind because it gives me a little color, and I don&#x27;t look like the undead.&lt;br /&gt;-The &amp;#34;whipped creme&amp;#34; formula is so silky smooth and fun to use. I apply it with my fingers, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. I don&#x27;t use a primer, and yet it stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is great because you waste none of the product. With a bottle, you lose 20% of your foundation, despite multiple attempts to scoop the last bit out with a pencil.....or a Popsicle stick....or anything else you can get your hands on. (What? I never do that!)&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t change color over the course of the day. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever had this problem, but I will apply foundation at the beginning of the day, and within a couple of hours, I&#x27;m a very interesting shade of orange. There&#x27;s nothing more frustrating that leaving the house thinking you look hot, and then checking your car mirror two hours later to discover you look like you had a very bad fake tanning experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my go-to foundation from now on. Now excuse me while I go stock up on it just in case it gets discontinued! ;)</li>
            <li> love this creme foundation... good color, feel, stayability.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this foundation out of mere curiosity. I had heard many rave reviews on this and I wanted to try it out myself. The coverage is okay, but not a full enough coverage for me. The problem that I had with this is it made my skin burn for some reason. I am sure that doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone&#x27;s skin, but it didn&#x27;t react well to mine. I used this with a stipple brush, but I found that I got better coverage using my fingers. I was not a fan of this product, but that is just a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target (cheaper here) on impulse which I&#x27;m still not sure why. I dislike drugstore brands and usually wear Ben Nye, MaC and smashbox. However, this foundation is amazing. I have dry acne prone skin and this covers like a dream. Yes even dry skin. And even after doing a chemical peel. This has now been my go too foundation</li>
            <li> My first negative review on amazon! I didn&#x27;t like this at all. Really thick, heavy, and made my face feel dirty. Made me break out as well. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Use very little to cover what I need. It&#x27;s great on every part of my face, even though I have combo skin. And the color...amazing! Finally something pale enough without washing me out.</li>
            <li> This foundation is a mousse consistency,  it is a great option for people with very fair skin, however can look somewhat heavily applied/cakey, even when buffed into the skin with minimal product (although not to the extent of Rimmel Stay Matte). It provides quite good coverage and only oxidises slightly. For people who need to lighten this foundation,  MAC Face and Body can make it trickier to work with, so you may want to look at other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many cosmetic foundations in containers that you must pump, squeeze, shake and/or need various methods of getting to at the half way point. After my last encounter of a pump type container that was half full with a non-removable cap, I decided it was time for action and that I would never spend another dime on a foundation I could not get to. I searched and discovered this Revlon makeup.  Not only can I get to it, it is everything I wanted.  It&#x27;s light, covers flaws, I can use it to the last drop.</li>
            <li> Ha!  I have nearly no experience with make-up.  So as a beginner, I will just say that I think it&#x27;s nice.  It does what it says it does... I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t provide very much insight.  I will say that it won&#x27;t come off really if you lightly scratch your nose or something, which was a blessing for me.  Makeup is itchy which is usually why after an hour it looks like I didn&#x27;t put on any makeup at all with most things.  This lasted all day though~!</li>
            <li> I really really like this product.  Light with very good coverage and the color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I am normal to dry... So this was too drying for Winter but it&#x27;ll be great for summer!  Has a great finish and stays on well:)</li>
            <li> My favorite right now..build the coverage you want.  Does not break me out either so that is always good</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I got a shade too light (of course) and now I&#x27;m on a search for a decent bronzer, but other than that i love the airbrushed look i get when using a beauty blender to apply, and the matte look it has once I&#x27;m finished. I do reccommend applying one light coat, allow your skin to absorb it, and then a final coat. I will deff buy again</li>
            <li> This makeup really left my skin looking cakey and dry.  Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was right on for my skin, i&#x27;m super pale.  But the consistency of the makeup just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I went back to my Tarte powder makeup.</li>
            <li> Ive used other of Revlon&#x27;s foundations but I like this one best,It has a flawless/Porcelain effect. This is a really great shade for pale people who cant find the right shade. Quick shipping and the jar it comes it is way bigger than I thought,this will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s smooth, I love the consistency of this foundation! Its doesnt feel sticky nor heavy when you put it on your face :) I really recommend it :)</li>
            <li> My intuition guided me to this product several months ago, but I was unwilling to actually purchase and try this - until recently.  Before purchasing this foundation, I first looked at all of the reviews and found that a number of people totally adore this product... then - after I researched and read a number of reviews - I finally splurged on this - and have now tried it a couple of days, and LOVE it... so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup artist and image consultant with an extensive background in all sorts of cosmetics - and have been lucky enough to wear some of the top end brand foundations - since I was age 13 and first began wearing makeup.  In this process - I have worn a number of the top rated brand cosmetics - and have tried a whole gamut of products - trying to find the perfect blend and formula for my skin - and something that would match my skin tone - best.  There are a number of cosmetic companies that are charging far more for their foundation - than Revlon, but not offering the quality that this particular product delivers. (Revlon, just because other companies are charging more - keep your price on this product in the range that it currently is... too many cosmetic companies start charging more - then out price themselves from their loyal following).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, I was lucky enough to be wearing La Prairie&#x27;s brand of foundation, which at the time - was about $65.00 per bottle, and truthfully - the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme Makeup works better on my skin - and last longer without needing a touch up - than any other foundation that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past couple of years - I was relatively happy with the Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse - and constantly received compliments on my skin, the entire time that I wore this product.  I was dusting over the foundation - Maybelline&#x27;s Shine Free Pressed Powder in Soft Cameo and received a ton of compliments on how great my skin looked, while wearing this foundation/powder combination.  There was really no reason to look for another formula, or so I thought - because I was pretty darn happy with the results of the Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse formula.  However, I was becoming very tired of having the powder only last a total of 3 weeks... or so - and have been looking for a better product to replace that.  This is what left me open to finding the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme Makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I really loved the Maybelline products - and had just purchased the Revon Color Stay Whipped Creme Makeup - I decided to do a side by side comparison to see which product looked best - midday, when I normally begin to have a major shine - and need re-powdering.  The first application of the foundations proved that Revlon Color Stay Whipped had a much better initial coverage - because I was able to blend over blemishes and this covered much better than the previous Maybelline brand that I had loved so much - before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The midday test - was the major eye opener, because the Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme - actually stayed much more matte - than what happened about 6 hours after applying the Maybelline brand foundation and powder.  The Revlon Color Stay Whipped - looked much more matte and professional, while at the same time - the Maybelline brand was needing a dusting of powder to refinish the base foundation - about 6 hours into wear.  The Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme - didn&#x27;t actually need a powder - even at about 6 hours into constant wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an outstanding foundation.  I also tried their Color Stay under eye concealer, which seems to have extremely good coverage - as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it - you may be surprised how much you really love this product!  If I had have known how great this product is, I would have tried this when I first had the hunch to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;A Plus - Plus - Plus!r combination.

            <li> Love this foundation.  I have combination skin and it gives me a matte finish that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Giving stars for the texture. Goes on really nice, although it settled and became overly powdry shockingly fast. I expected it to slide off, if anything. Oxidized.</li>
            <li> Love this! A little goes a long way, I could see this lasting me a while. Great coverage for the acne prone, and a cheaper alternative to the liquid version but does the same job</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. I wish that more of it came in the pot. The way that the pot is shaped, makes it appear wayyy fuller than it actully is. It also has 10g less product than an average foundation bottle (30mL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying that, this stuff stays for the most of the day. I have very oily skin and this stuff stops me from being a total grease face by the end of the day in comparison to other drugstore foundations I own. It has a semi matte finish so it looks very natural and flattering on the skin. It is very hard for me t make this stuff look cakey on my skin. You would have to use an excessive amount for it to look that way unlike some other foundations</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s got really great coverage. Thankyou</li>
