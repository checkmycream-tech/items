            <li>Very glad I made this purchase from you..</li>

            <li>love these gel nails!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I really love the NEON colors!</li>
            <li>love all the colors!</li>
            <li>My first time using these on my own, still not tried all the colors, but was very impressed with the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Really nice colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and stay shiny.</li>
            <li>It may not be gelish quality but the colors are nice, I bought them for my niece</li>
            <li>she liked them.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors but they are kinda Runny &amp;#34;aka&amp;#34; watery.</li>
            <li>colors are nice.</li>
            <li>Nice colors and works good customers love it</li>
            <li>what I wanted  (neon, catching the theme here?)</li>
            <li>But otherwise nice set if you want variety.</li>
            <li>it is kind of watery.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, it was the first time I&#x27;ve used gel polish and it worked great the first time !!!</li>
            <li>They are still pretty, but the purple and orange aren&#x27;t very bright.</li>
            <li>Very cool colors except for the bright orange which turned out to be a glittery orange.</li>
            <li>The added bonus is you don&#x27;t have to clean it after the top coat!!</li>
            <li>super great deal.</li>
            <li>Would be awesome if the set came with a clear coat!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love them &amp; love the price!</li>
            <li>Awesome colors everything I expected and more!!</li>
            <li>So far I have tried 2 of the six colors, and they worked out great!</li>
            <li>Great colors and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It does work pretty good with its own product</li>
            <li>Very good for my young daughters.</li>
            <li>so many complements on my nails now.</li>
            <li>, I had purple gelish and used this top coat</li>
            <li>its okay, you can tell its cheaper than gelish and cnd shellac</li>
            <li>but if you are using it just for bmc you should be okay.</li>
            <li>I put on 3 coats plus top coat</li>
            <li>Lovely colours  but chlpped after a week</li>
            <li>Love these colors .</li>
            <li>so i will be ordering more colors.</li>
            <li>I love Bundle Monster&#x27;s gel polishes and these are no exception.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set for sure.</li>
            <li>These are such great colors!  </li>
            <li>110% satisfied.</li>
            <li>Cute colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, but I change my nails often.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>But over all, they are cute colors.</li>
            <li>It is ok, except leaking out purple one.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love these and would recommend them.</li>
            <li>These are my absolutely favorite uv gels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>Love gel nails and gel polish.  </li>
            <li>They look more like muted fall colors.  </li>
            <li>but I am pleased to say they were pretty  good</li>
            <li>The gel lasts long and is just as good as gelish brand!!!</li>
            <li>Even though this product is significantly cheaper than the brand I always use (Gelish), it lacks nothing in comparison!</li>
            <li>However, the neon pink is awesome.</li>
            <li>The pink is awesome.</li>
            <li>is more like a pumpkin color orange and is filled with silver sparkles in it..</li>
            <li>and these are just slightly more unique.  </li>
            <li>they peel off easily....</li>
            <li>They peel easily even with the correct application.</li>
            <li>zero!The only good thing I can say is the neon colors where nice but</li>
            <li>I am so impressed I am buying the other color package now!</li>
            <li>The color samples on the bottles are accurate except for the Orange &amp; the white/sparkly color which are more of a clear color- works nicely over top another color though.</li>
            <li>These colors are super cute.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just use those polishes you got to have uv light etc.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price.</li>
            <li>While these are a great price, the quality is low.</li>
            <li>The colors are great, order came on time, bottles are regular polish size.</li>
            <li>I enjoy</li>
            <li>The application is smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li>You have to do many coats to get rid of the opaque look and still, it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and beautiful and they work just as well as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Pink is awesome, purple is great, yellow is good, green is ok, Orange is not orange on this planet</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t work quickly it does tend to slide around a little, but even with that the finished product is awesome!</li>
            <li>colors arent bright, can barely see the color on nails.</li>
            <li>She was so excited she did all of our nails the day she opened it.  </li>
            <li>Fun colors for summer!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>have not disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and shiny if u also use the bmc top coat.</li>
            <li>True to picture.</li>
            <li>This is very comparable to gelish which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Full sized bottles.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors and very affordable for gel polish.  </li>
            <li>But, for the price, they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I like these colors very much!</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>its the exact grape purple I was looking for!)</li>
            <li>Nice to take a trip back to the &#x27;80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>My daughter loves doing her nails and this was a fun addition to her collection.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the green, orange and clear glitter and two coats were plenty for the colors, maybe 3 would be best for the glitter.</li>
            <li>Two coats are enough, which is nice.</li>
            <li>There is one other glitter polish that is really really sheer with teeny gold flecks, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a great set!</li>
            <li>In the box of 6 neon colors- the yellow, pink, and purple are somewhat neon- more just bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinda of gels and this one is only okay.</li>
            <li>but you cant use gelish with bmc top coat because it will turn it a different color.</li>
            <li>The purple, glitter and pink are our favorites -- but all of the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>However, out of 6 colors, I only like 2 a lot and 1 is ok.  </li>
            <li>I do absolutely love all the colors only thing..</li>
            <li>when i received those colors it showed those appropriate sticker labels but inside the bottle i thought was white is just silver sparkles and in the neon orange on it</li>
            <li>The orange is sparkle which was pretty but not</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I typically do two coats of the color and use an led light and love the results.</li>
            <li>thin polish works like Orly of Gelish and is pretty bright and cheap.</li>
            <li>The orange is more useful as an over coat of glitter like over the pink.</li>
            <li>They are all vibrant and fun to wear for any occasion.</li>
            <li>To have come from so far polish very fresh, aplied very well.</li>
            <li>pretty and works really well.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These colors are harder to take off than my Sally Hansen color, but I don&#x27;t mind because I love the colors so much.&lt;br /&gt;Iget</li>
            <li>I really wanted that neon orange.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you need to have when you get this product is the UV light.</li>
            <li>The colors are very Crayola water color looking.</li>
            <li>They are very watery and shrink away from the edges of the nail when they cure.</li>
            <li>I received my shipment yesterday and did my nails last night and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on nails very well</li>
            <li>Not even for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Came quickly love the pink and the purple but the orange isn&#x27;t neon at all its glittery</li>
            <li>I generally love B.M.C. products but for some reason the gel polishes in the whote bottle pull back from the free edge of the nail no matter how hard i try to get full coverage</li>
            <li>The lighter colors doesn&#x27;t go on well unless you do multiple coats but other than that a good purchase for my nail collection.</li>
            <li>And they work with the other brands I have the top and basecoat.</li>
            <li>I would love it if I could find a six pack in some other colors.</li>
            <li>If you go to the last picture in the set you see a true depiction of the colors.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted the purple (and</li>
            <li>You do need a UV light (purchase separately) in order for these to dry!</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy these because other brands sell gel colors for AT LEAST $8 a piece, so I thought this was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cures in 30 sec under my led light.</li>
            <li>Love the colors but, does not last long...</li>
            <li>I think many people who didn&#x27;t like this polish didn&#x27;t use it with a UV light, and it is a little thinner than other polishes I&#x27;ve used so</li>
            <li>The other 5 polishes are fine.</li>
            <li>Peels right off the instant it dries.</li>
            <li>You need base coat, and top coat to make it work, look good, and stay on.</li>
            <li>The change colors slightly according to the light</li>
            <li>The polish is nice and thin and not thick like some of the others.</li>
            <li>The hot pink is the only one worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>This is not your top brand super expensive product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the clear with the specks of glitter.</li>
            <li>I also got this item in a box that could have fit 20 of them in it what a waste.</li>
            <li>The color lasted for over a week with no trouble at all, and would have lasted longer</li>
            <li>FOR MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER</li>
            <li>And love the emerald green and lemony yellow.  </li>
            <li>After drying it was decent ,next day after washing dishes one nail started to peel off .I</li>
            <li>The orange does have a lot of glitter in it, so keep that in mind if you are buying it just for the orange, but the other colors are very pretty and neon enough for my taste.</li>
            <li>Best to have a white base before applying colors</li>
            <li>I wish the orange was actual neon not pale orange with glitter..</li>
            <li>The white is clear with glitter and the orange has glitter also.</li>
            <li>The pink is pretty but just not &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34; enough for me, personally.</li>
            <li>formula is much more watery than the Gelish brand, but if painted in thin coats,  cures just the same and just as well.</li>
            <li>The colors purple, pink, and green are amazing (though the green is thinner than the rest).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet, but they are still shiny and there are no chips or knicks so far!</li>
            <li>Colors are not true to bottles, but not thin like others have said.</li>
            <li>The texture of the polishes is a little on the sheer side, so on a couple of them you have to do three coats for that intense color.</li>
            <li>is suppose to last longer!!if you want a real nail polish that last and offers a money back guarantee diy hard nails grl Polish.</li>
            <li>I ordered the neon kit but the Clear with multicolored glitter polish is empty.</li>
            <li>What I expected to be a white (for tips, maybe) turned out to be a clear sparkle.</li>

            <li> Would be awesome if the set came with a clear coat!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them &amp; love the price!</li>
            <li> Awesome colors everything I expected and more!!</li>
            <li> So far I have tried 2 of the six colors, and they worked out great!</li>
            <li> Great colors and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It does work pretty good with its own product</li>
            <li> Very good for my young daughters.</li>
            <li> so many complements on my nails now.</li>
            <li> , I had purple gelish and used this top coat</li>
            <li> its okay, you can tell its cheaper than gelish and cnd shellac</li>
            <li> but if you are using it just for bmc you should be okay.</li>
            <li> I put on 3 coats plus top coat</li>
            <li> Lovely colours  but chlpped after a week</li>
            <li> Love these colors .</li>
            <li> so i will be ordering more colors.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster&#x27;s gel polishes and these are no exception.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set for sure.</li>
            <li> These are such great colors!  </li>
            <li> 110% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Cute colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, but I change my nails often.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> But over all, they are cute colors.</li>
            <li> It is ok, except leaking out purple one.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love these and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are my absolutely favorite uv gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Love gel nails and gel polish.  </li>
            <li> They look more like muted fall colors.  </li>
            <li> but I am pleased to say they were pretty  good</li>
            <li> The gel lasts long and is just as good as gelish brand!!!</li>
            <li> Even though this product is significantly cheaper than the brand I always use (Gelish), it lacks nothing in comparison!</li>
            <li> However, the neon pink is awesome.</li>
            <li> The pink is awesome.</li>
            <li> is more like a pumpkin color orange and is filled with silver sparkles in it..</li>
            <li> and these are just slightly more unique.  </li>
            <li> they peel off easily....</li>
            <li> They peel easily even with the correct application.</li>
            <li> zero!The only good thing I can say is the neon colors where nice but</li>
            <li> I am so impressed I am buying the other color package now!</li>
            <li> The color samples on the bottles are accurate except for the Orange &amp; the white/sparkly color which are more of a clear color- works nicely over top another color though.</li>
            <li> These colors are super cute.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just use those polishes you got to have uv light etc.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price.</li>
            <li> While these are a great price, the quality is low.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, order came on time, bottles are regular polish size.</li>
            <li> I enjoy</li>
            <li> The application is smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li> You have to do many coats to get rid of the opaque look and still, it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and beautiful and they work just as well as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Pink is awesome, purple is great, yellow is good, green is ok, Orange is not orange on this planet</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t work quickly it does tend to slide around a little, but even with that the finished product is awesome!</li>
            <li> colors arent bright, can barely see the color on nails.</li>
            <li> She was so excited she did all of our nails the day she opened it.  </li>
            <li> Fun colors for summer!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> have not disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> It is pretty and shiny if u also use the bmc top coat.</li>
            <li> True to picture.</li>
            <li> This is very comparable to gelish which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Full sized bottles.  </li>
            <li> Love the colors and very affordable for gel polish.  </li>
            <li> But, for the price, they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I like these colors very much!</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> its the exact grape purple I was looking for!)</li>
            <li> Nice to take a trip back to the &#x27;80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves doing her nails and this was a fun addition to her collection.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the green, orange and clear glitter and two coats were plenty for the colors, maybe 3 would be best for the glitter.</li>
            <li> Two coats are enough, which is nice.</li>
            <li> There is one other glitter polish that is really really sheer with teeny gold flecks, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a great set!</li>
            <li> In the box of 6 neon colors- the yellow, pink, and purple are somewhat neon- more just bright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinda of gels and this one is only okay.</li>
            <li> but you cant use gelish with bmc top coat because it will turn it a different color.</li>
            <li> The purple, glitter and pink are our favorites -- but all of the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> However, out of 6 colors, I only like 2 a lot and 1 is ok.  </li>
            <li> I do absolutely love all the colors only thing..</li>
            <li> when i received those colors it showed those appropriate sticker labels but inside the bottle i thought was white is just silver sparkles and in the neon orange on it</li>
            <li> The orange is sparkle which was pretty but not</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I typically do two coats of the color and use an led light and love the results.</li>
            <li> thin polish works like Orly of Gelish and is pretty bright and cheap.</li>
            <li> The orange is more useful as an over coat of glitter like over the pink.</li>
            <li> They are all vibrant and fun to wear for any occasion.</li>
            <li> To have come from so far polish very fresh, aplied very well.</li>
            <li> pretty and works really well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These colors are harder to take off than my Sally Hansen color, but I don&#x27;t mind because I love the colors so much.&lt;br /&gt;Iget</li>
            <li> I really wanted that neon orange.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you need to have when you get this product is the UV light.</li>
            <li> The colors are very Crayola water color looking.</li>
            <li> They are very watery and shrink away from the edges of the nail when they cure.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment yesterday and did my nails last night and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on nails very well</li>
            <li> Not even for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Came quickly love the pink and the purple but the orange isn&#x27;t neon at all its glittery</li>
            <li> I generally love B.M.C. products but for some reason the gel polishes in the whote bottle pull back from the free edge of the nail no matter how hard i try to get full coverage</li>
            <li> The lighter colors doesn&#x27;t go on well unless you do multiple coats but other than that a good purchase for my nail collection.</li>
            <li> And they work with the other brands I have the top and basecoat.</li>
            <li> I would love it if I could find a six pack in some other colors.</li>
            <li> If you go to the last picture in the set you see a true depiction of the colors.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted the purple (and</li>
            <li> You do need a UV light (purchase separately) in order for these to dry!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy these because other brands sell gel colors for AT LEAST $8 a piece, so I thought this was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cures in 30 sec under my led light.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but, does not last long...</li>
            <li> I think many people who didn&#x27;t like this polish didn&#x27;t use it with a UV light, and it is a little thinner than other polishes I&#x27;ve used so</li>
            <li> The other 5 polishes are fine.</li>
            <li> Peels right off the instant it dries.</li>
            <li> You need base coat, and top coat to make it work, look good, and stay on.</li>
            <li> The change colors slightly according to the light</li>
            <li> The polish is nice and thin and not thick like some of the others.</li>
            <li> The hot pink is the only one worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> This is not your top brand super expensive product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the clear with the specks of glitter.</li>
            <li> I also got this item in a box that could have fit 20 of them in it what a waste.</li>
            <li> The color lasted for over a week with no trouble at all, and would have lasted longer</li>
            <li> FOR MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER</li>
            <li> And love the emerald green and lemony yellow.  </li>
            <li> After drying it was decent ,next day after washing dishes one nail started to peel off .I</li>
            <li> The orange does have a lot of glitter in it, so keep that in mind if you are buying it just for the orange, but the other colors are very pretty and neon enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> Best to have a white base before applying colors</li>
            <li> I wish the orange was actual neon not pale orange with glitter..</li>
            <li> The white is clear with glitter and the orange has glitter also.</li>
            <li> The pink is pretty but just not &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34; enough for me, personally.</li>
            <li> formula is much more watery than the Gelish brand, but if painted in thin coats,  cures just the same and just as well.</li>
            <li> The colors purple, pink, and green are amazing (though the green is thinner than the rest).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet, but they are still shiny and there are no chips or knicks so far!</li>
            <li> Colors are not true to bottles, but not thin like others have said.</li>
            <li> The texture of the polishes is a little on the sheer side, so on a couple of them you have to do three coats for that intense color.</li>
            <li> is suppose to last longer!!if you want a real nail polish that last and offers a money back guarantee diy hard nails grl Polish.</li>
            <li> I ordered the neon kit but the Clear with multicolored glitter polish is empty.</li>
            <li> What I expected to be a white (for tips, maybe) turned out to be a clear sparkle.</li>
            <li> The orange is pale, green is more of a Kelley green and the last one with a white for is actually clear sparkles.</li>
            <li> The green is not as dark as the picture indicates (not that I love green).</li>
            <li> Decent gel polish but colors not accurate</li>
            <li> peel isn&#x27;t not sure if it is really gel polish</li>
            <li> The Gel polish doesn&#x27;t really last long, probably 2 days.</li>
            <li> and like I figure they all easily peel off like fake nails.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this collection, however there are a few problems or at least a few things I didn&#x27;t expect.  </li>
            <li> It is very pretty colors only thing is it peels quickly on natural nails does prettyngood on artificial nail acrylic.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t expensive to buy the light as well.</li>
            <li> All other polishes follow the same color hues...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even dry don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> This polish is wayyyyyy to watery..drains to the side of your nails...and takes FOREVER to dry...</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy these after reading some negative reviews, but I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> Only a few of the bottles are actual solid colors (pink, purple, green, and neon yellow).</li>
            <li> It needs at least 2 to 3 coats because its not thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Very strange!</li>
            <li> The pink and purple are my favorat colors tho.</li>
            <li> This set came when expected and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> All colors are what was expected, except the orange...</li>
            <li> do not suggest to apply on finger nails if you have heavy daily duty work because they wont stay well.</li>
            <li> This brand sells a kit that brings base n top plus an additional red color,</li>
            <li> I use it with the bmc base and top coat, it does shrink back some</li>
            <li> I bought this six color set and the 3 piece starter kit (with the base and top coat) of the same brand, b.m.c..</li>
            <li> Not sure what the positive reviewers are using to keep it on, but it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> decided to see if any other ones would come out</li>
            <li> I wanted the other pack of six colors</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying the other colors.</li>
            <li> That one didn&#x27;t even last a few hours!</li>
            <li> The orange is sparkly and thin and the white is sparkles only.</li>
            <li> The green looks like an emerald green by time you apply enough coats to make it opaque.</li>
            <li> overnight not right after I was finished.  </li>
            <li> In the photo i thought the sparkly bottle was just a plain white and the orange was just plain neon orange.</li>
            <li> I loved the glitter set, but this one is terrible</li>
            <li> what I recieved was a three piece set, that had a top coat, base coat and 1 color.</li>
            <li> So basically I just paid around $30 for a base coat, top coat, and 1 color.</li>
            <li> Dont buy the base coat and top coat to use with other products tho!</li>
            <li> Plus, I used some nail art and over the course of a few days the green color faded completely to a pale neon yellow.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you want a watered down look.</li>
            <li> easily piled off :(</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> All of Bundle Monster&#x27;s products that I have gotten (and I&#x27;ve bought quite a few)</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worse than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on BMC.</li>
            <li> the orange and green are NOT what I would call summer colors.  </li>
            <li> Polish was thick, not watery like the other reviewer claims.  </li>
            <li> The orange is not just plain orange though, it is glitter orange.</li>
            <li> Really bad the whole nail peels off in a day!</li>
            <li> One downside the clear polish was a dirty glitter .</li>
            <li> When I get my nails done with gel polish at the salon it usually lasts about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure what it is suppose to be</li>
            <li> 30 minutes later it was still wet: (</li>
            <li> it was dull with glitter in it, doesn&#x27;t go with the neon theme</li>
            <li> The colors are hardly what I would consider neon.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to trust reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all of the colors at least once.  </li>
            <li> Colors are thick.</li>
            <li> Im assuming it was labeled wrong, and the other</li>
            <li> but I am only trying to save you from being disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think the secret is to put on thin layers.</li>
            <li> BMC is NOT a great company.</li>
            <li> it runs all down my fingers even after applying a thin layer bad quality wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> I started using gloves to protect my nails from chipping unfortunately, that did not work.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work for you, you must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought these because for the price, how could you go wrong?  </li>
            <li> the polish is very thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll provide a picture merely as proof of my purchase and use of the product, not in support of it!</li>
            <li> The quality was so bad i removed it immediately.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with Gelish base coat.</li>
            <li> Need to buy the BMC base coat.</li>
            <li> I thought it was my primer or base coat</li>
            <li> I have used the bmc base coat as well,</li>
            <li> But :&#x27;( they sent me an ugly glittery orange instead of a neon orange :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this set.  </li>
            <li> Worst nail paint I ever bought so watery</li>
            <li> The orange is awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the mix of colors in this set! Absolutely perfect for summer! The texture of the polishes is a little on the sheer side, so on a couple of them you have to do three coats for that intense color. The orange actually has glitter in it (the others do not). There is one other glitter polish that is really really sheer with teeny gold flecks, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a great set!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this collection, however there are a few problems or at least a few things I didn&#x27;t expect.  The colors purple, pink, and green are amazing (though the green is thinner than the rest). The orange is sparkly and thin and the white is sparkles only. I have not used the yellow yet since it is still winter.&lt;br /&gt;These colors are harder to take off than my Sally Hansen color, but I don&#x27;t mind because I love the colors so much.&lt;br /&gt;Iget so many complements on my nails now. I typically do two coats of the color and use an led light and love the results. I will buy another kit from them. Probably the metallic one.</li>
            <li> Really nice colors. True to picture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great... pretty and works really well. But :&#x27;( they sent me an ugly glittery orange instead of a neon orange :( I really wanted that neon orange.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just use those polishes you got to have uv light etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinda of gels and this one is only okay. It does work pretty good with its own product but you cant use gelish with bmc top coat because it will turn it a different color. Thats what it did to mine, I had purple gelish and used this top coat and it turned it yellow/brown overnight not right after I was finished.  Overall its okay, you can tell its cheaper than gelish and cnd shellac but if you are using it just for bmc you should be okay. Dont buy the base coat and top coat to use with other products tho!</li>
            <li> The best gel nail polish ever; my daughter and I love the colors.  The purple, glitter and pink are our favorites -- but all of the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> Way to watery and doesnt even look like polish since it clumps around the deges of your nails and you have to do a minimum of 4 coats for it to look colored.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors but does NOT last 2 wks as I&lt;br /&gt;Uv gel color should, not even 1 wk. I started using gloves to protect my nails from chipping unfortunately, that did not work. Not very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> The polish is nice and thin and not thick like some of the others. The colors are nice and stay shiny. a good brand.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors! Love these products!</li>
            <li> The change colors slightly according to the light</li>
            <li> You need base coat, and top coat to make it work, look good, and stay on. This brand sells a kit that brings base n top plus an additional red color, great price.&lt;br /&gt;U also need a uv or led curing light.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesnt work for you, you must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I generally love B.M.C. products but for some reason the gel polishes in the whote bottle pull back from the free edge of the nail no matter how hard i try to get full coverage</li>
            <li> Works alright but some colors were not colors but glitter and that was not advertised or what I was looking for and for the price I would&#x27;ve preferred what I thought I was getting</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because I can&#x27;t give it zero!The only good thing I can say is the neon colors where nice but the orange one was orange glitter.I put on 3 coats plus top coat and it didn&#x27;t take on even on all nails but I put glitter so it wasn&#x27;t noticeable.After drying it was decent ,next day after washing dishes one nail started to peel off .I decided to see if any other ones would come out and like I figure they all easily peel off like fake nails.Never again will I purchase these!gel is suppose to last longer!!if you want a real nail polish that last and offers a money back guarantee diy hard nails grl Polish.</li>
            <li> Lovely colours  but chlpped after a week</li>
            <li> Two of the colors aren&#x27;t the color of what the bottle says. The white is clear with glitter and the orange has glitter also.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome! It&#x27;s cures in 30 sec under my led light. I use it with the bmc base and top coat, it does shrink back some but I can work with it for the price. I have used gelish, opi, finger paints, chinese brands, orly, and gelaze. This is very comparable to gelish which is my favorite. The added bonus is you don&#x27;t have to clean it after the top coat!! Win win win.</li>
            <li> Got for granddaughter for Christmas to go with the uv lamp we got her.  She was so excited she did all of our nails the day she opened it.  Good product</li>
            <li> Worst nail paint I ever bought so watery doesn&#x27;t even dry don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> Love these colors . They are just great</li>
            <li> I bought these because for the price, how could you go wrong?  However, out of 6 colors, I only like 2 a lot and 1 is ok.  The green is not as dark as the picture indicates (not that I love green). But, for the price, they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, it was the first time I&#x27;ve used gel polish and it worked great the first time !!!</li>
            <li> It may not be gelish quality but the colors are nice, I bought them for my niece she liked them.</li>
            <li> Fun colors for summer!  Nice to take a trip back to the &#x27;80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The only thing that you need to have when you get this product is the UV light. Although it does not come with the nail polish it isn&#x27;t expensive to buy the light as well.</li>
            <li> The colors are very Crayola water color looking. You have to do many coats to get rid of the opaque look and still, it doesn&#x27;t look right. The product is definitely gel, and lasts, but the color quality lacks severely.</li>
            <li> Really bad the whole nail peels off in a day!</li>
            <li> I would have given these a five if all the colors were neon, but only three out of the six are. However, the neon pink is awesome. I love it!</li>
            <li> colors arent bright, can barely see the color on nails. even after trying several coats still doesnt seem to work.</li>
            <li> The polishes peel. I did them on Monday, it is now Thursday, and I already had to redo 2 nails because they peeled off, and the rest are starting to lift. They won&#x27;t make it through the weekend. I loved the glitter set, but this one is terrible</li>
            <li> I ordered these by accident thinking they were another brand! but I am pleased to say they were pretty  good so I&#x27;m not disappointed. And they work with the other brands I have the top and basecoat.</li>
            <li> I like these colors very much! Very cute for summer coming up!</li>
            <li> As a nail technician, tried loads of brand Gel polish and I most say the BMC works the best for me. My clients can&#x27;t get enough of them so i will be ordering more colors.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster&#x27;s gel polishes and these are no exception. All of Bundle Monster&#x27;s products that I have gotten (and I&#x27;ve bought quite a few) have not disappointed me yet. I&#x27;m a big fan and recommend them to everyone that comments on my nails.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with Gelish base coat. Need to buy the BMC base coat. Did not apply evenly.  Nor did it coat the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Peels right off the instant it dries. Waste of money. Not sure what the positive reviewers are using to keep it on, but it&#x27;s no good. At all.</li>
            <li> Love these polishes! Gel is the only way to go and this price rocks! If you go to the last picture in the set you see a true depiction of the colors. The pink is pretty but just not &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34; enough for me, personally. The yellow is highlighter yellow. Look forward to using each color! Product was the same type of gel as the gelish.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy these because other brands sell gel colors for AT LEAST $8 a piece, so I thought this was too good to be true. I bought this six color set and the 3 piece starter kit (with the base and top coat) of the same brand, b.m.c.. So far I have tried 2 of the six colors, and they worked out great! I still need to perfect my application process (I&#x27;m a newbie) but they seem like salon quality. I have only been wearing the gel polish for 2 days, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet, but they are still shiny and there are no chips or knicks so far! I think the secret is to put on thin layers. I used a 54 W UV nail dryer to cure the gels. I would recommend this set for sure.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy these after reading some negative reviews, but I was very surprised! I think many people who didn&#x27;t like this polish didn&#x27;t use it with a UV light, and it is a little thinner than other polishes I&#x27;ve used so if you don&#x27;t work quickly it does tend to slide around a little, but even with that the finished product is awesome! The orange does have a lot of glitter in it, so keep that in mind if you are buying it just for the orange, but the other colors are very pretty and neon enough for my taste. I am so impressed I am buying the other color package now!</li>
            <li> I liked the colors but they are kinda Runny &amp;#34;aka&amp;#34; watery. The pink and purple are my favorat colors tho. I could do with out the others. I also got this item in a box that could have fit 20 of them in it what a waste.</li>
            <li> These are such great colors!  Everyone just loves them that has used them!!  Awesome colors everything I expected and more!!</li>
            <li> This set came when expected and well packaged.  My daughter loves doing her nails and this was a fun addition to her collection.  You do need a UV light (purchase separately) in order for these to dry!</li>
            <li> polish works well. good quality.</li>
            <li> In the box of 6 neon colors- the yellow, pink, and purple are somewhat neon- more just bright. The orange is pale, green is more of a Kelley green and the last one with a white for is actually clear sparkles. Decent gel polish but colors not accurate</li>
            <li> Did not get all of the colors and the polish is very thin it runs all down my fingers even after applying a thin layer bad quality wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this set, the neutrals and the top/base coat set. Lasts two weeks. Polish was thick, not watery like the other reviewer claims.  You must shake it to mix the color. 110% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price. Cute colors</li>
            <li> I am amazed that these are big bottles for this price. I&#x27;ve used the green, orange and clear glitter and two coats were plenty for the colors, maybe 3 would be best for the glitter. The color lasted for over a week with no trouble at all, and would have lasted longer I&#x27;m sure, but I change my nails often. I would definitely buy these again. I wanted the other pack of six colors but they were out.</li>
            <li> Colors are not true to bottles, but not thin like others have said. I am pleased with the quality. Would be awesome if the set came with a clear coat!</li>
            <li> Only a few of the bottles are actual solid colors (pink, purple, green, and neon yellow). The rest are sparkles, something I was unaware of.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is much more watery than the Gelish brand, but if painted in thin coats,  cures just the same and just as well.</li>
            <li> All of the colors aren&#x27;t as neon as I was hoping. They are still pretty, but the purple and orange aren&#x27;t very bright.</li>
            <li> peel isn&#x27;t not sure if it is really gel polish</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them &amp; love the price!</li>
            <li> These colors are super cute. I&#x27;ve used all of the colors at least once.  When I get my nails done with gel polish at the salon it usually lasts about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been averaging one week with these colors at home.  Not to shabby for a beginner. I would love it if I could find a six pack in some other colors.</li>
            <li> USED THE PURPLE FOR MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT &amp; A LOT CHEAPER THAN A SALON.</li>
            <li> While these are a great price, the quality is low. They are very watery and shrink away from the edges of the nail when they cure. But over all, they are cute colors. Very good for my young daughters.</li>
            <li> Great colors and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought the neon colors about a month ago and am buying the basic colors today. The colors are great, order came on time, bottles are regular polish size. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty colors only thing is it peels quickly on natural nails does prettyngood on artificial nail acrylic.</li>
            <li> I like all the color. I enjoy n using it.....</li>
            <li> Love these colors!  They are all vibrant and fun to wear for any occasion.</li>
            <li> This polish is great. It is full size bottles and does a perfect job with two coats. I received my shipment yesterday and did my nails last night and they look fantastic. The orange is not just plain orange though, it is glitter orange.</li>
            <li> Very awesome colors and easy to apply..</li>
            <li> I  ordered this six piece color kit and what I recieved was a three piece set, that had a top coat, base coat and 1 color. Nothing like what is in the prod. description or picture. I was under the impression that I would be receiving SIX colors, especially for this price. A complete waste of money! So basically I just paid around $30 for a base coat, top coat, and 1 color. U do the math!!</li>
            <li> Full sized bottles.  The color samples on the bottles are accurate except for the Orange &amp; the white/sparkly color which are more of a clear color- works nicely over top another color though.</li>
            <li> I wish the orange was actual neon not pale orange with glitter.. The pink is awesome.</li>
            <li> Very cool colors except for the bright orange which turned out to be a glittery orange. Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but, does not last long...they peel off easily....</li>
            <li> cracks and peels of like a regular nail polish I thought it was my primer or base coat but nop its this bmc nail polishes I dont recommend them</li>
            <li> thin polish works like Orly of Gelish and is pretty bright and cheap.</li>
            <li> Does not cure, stays sticky, only way to get the sticky to go away is to rub nail polish remover over it after placing it under a UV lamp for 10-15 minutes and it leaves it with no shine.</li>
            <li> It is ok, except leaking out purple one. Check it again before you pack it</li>
            <li> Even though this product is significantly cheaper than the brand I always use (Gelish), it lacks nothing in comparison! If you took the labels off the two products, you&#x27;d never be able to tell which one is which! THATS how good bmc is! :)</li>
            <li> All colors are what was expected, except the orange...it was dull with glitter in it, doesn&#x27;t go with the neon theme</li>
            <li> This is wonderful gel polish.. Colors are great and nice sized bottles.. Very glad I made this purchase from you..</li>
            <li> This polish is wayyyyyy to watery..drains to the side of your nails...and takes FOREVER to dry...30 minutes later it was still wet: (</li>
            <li> Didnt stick to the nail...it felt and looked oily.</li>
            <li> Pink is awesome, purple is great, yellow is good, green is ok, Orange is not orange on this planet Im assuming it was labeled wrong, and the other Im not sure what it is suppose to be but it has some kind of glitter in it that just makes every color I put it over dirty. Still was worth buying for the best 3 colors.</li>
            <li> My first time using these on my own, still not tried all the colors, but was very impressed with the variety of colors. Quick delivery. To have come from so far polish very fresh, aplied very well. Looking forward to trying the other colors. Thankful.</li>
            <li> colors are nice. easily piled off :( do not suggest to apply on finger nails if you have heavy daily duty work because they wont stay well.</li>
            <li> This is not your top brand super expensive product but it still works great. The orange is more useful as an over coat of glitter like over the pink. But I absolutely love these and would recommend them. super great deal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on nails very well</li>
            <li> love these gel nails!</li>
            <li> These are my absolutely favorite uv gels. The application is smooth and glossy. It needs at least 2 to 3 coats because its not thick and goopy. I love them!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  I really love the NEON colors!</li>
            <li> The orange is awful. Colors are thick. Best to have a white base before applying colors</li>
            <li> I have had this polish on for a week now with no chips. I only gave 4 stars because I have to see if it will last 2 weeks like the nail shop. It is pretty and shiny if u also use the bmc top coat. I have used the bmc base coat as well,</li>
            <li> The lighter colors doesn&#x27;t go on well unless you do multiple coats but other than that a good purchase for my nail collection.</li>
            <li> I do absolutely love all the colors only thing.. In the photo i thought the sparkly bottle was just a plain white and the orange was just plain neon orange. when i received those colors it showed those appropriate sticker labels but inside the bottle i thought was white is just silver sparkles and in the neon orange on it is more like a pumpkin color orange and is filled with silver sparkles in it.. That is all</li>
            <li> The Gel polish doesn&#x27;t really last long, probably 2 days.</li>
            <li> I use this gel with the gelish foundation and top it off; it works great. The gel lasts long and is just as good as gelish brand!!! For the price this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> Nice colors and works good customers love it</li>
            <li> Not all of them are neon colors, but they work good. Two coats are enough, which is nice. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> BMC is NOT a great company. Their nail polish does not stay. Not even for a whole day. Worse than regular nail polish. It&#x27;s a SCAM. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> love all the colors! the best way to do your own nails at home instead of going to the nail shop!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and very affordable for gel polish.  I mainly wanted the purple (and its the exact grape purple I was looking for!) And love the emerald green and lemony yellow.  All other polishes follow the same color hues...and these are just slightly more unique.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality for a reasonable price! The colors are bright and beautiful and they work just as well as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this set.  The colors are hardly what I would consider neon. They peel easily even with the correct application. The hot pink is the only one worth mentioning. The green looks like an emerald green by time you apply enough coats to make it opaque. Not neon like I was expecting! Plus, I used some nail art and over the course of a few days the green color faded completely to a pale neon yellow. Very strange! The places where the nail art was created a shadow effect on the color. The orange is sparkle which was pretty but not what I wanted  (neon, catching the theme here?) What I expected to be a white (for tips, maybe) turned out to be a clear sparkle. That one didn&#x27;t even last a few hours! I know it&#x27;s hard to trust reviews but I am only trying to save you from being disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money on BMC. I&#x27;ll provide a picture merely as proof of my purchase and use of the product, not in support of it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning and these colors are great! Very beautiful! Just wish I would&#x27;ve gotten a blue in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the neon kit but the Clear with multicolored glitter polish is empty. The other 5 polishes are fine. Is it possible to just get that one replaced?</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you want a watered down look. The quality was so bad i removed it immediately. I tried 2 colors and i will not ever use it again.</li>
            <li> Nice bright colors I didn&#x27;t like the clear with the specks of glitter.</li>
            <li> Great deal when one gel polish could cost the price of all of these great polishes. One downside the clear polish was a dirty glitter . And the orange was a gold glitter but at the price I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Love gel nails and gel polish.  Would have given this set five stars but the orange and green are NOT what I would call summer colors.  They are not neon colors.  They look more like muted fall colors.  But otherwise nice set if you want variety.</li>
            <li> My wife was over joyed</li>
            <li> I thought this was a kit not just nail polish</li>
            <li> Takes 3-4 coats it is kind of watery.</li>
            <li> Came quickly love the pink and the purple but the orange isn&#x27;t neon at all its glittery and I don&#x27;t like it</li>
