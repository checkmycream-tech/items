            <li>Ultra Swim is a good product for those who need to remove chlorine from their hair and keep looking wonderful.</li>
            <li>When I swim laps my hair can get straw-like, but UltraSwim shampoo and conditioner leave it feeling great.</li>
            <li>Ultraswim is great for removing the chlorine smell without drying your hair out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re a swimmer in chlorine.  </li>
            <li>If you are at your wit&#x27;s end and just can&#x27;t take it anymore, this is probably a good buy for you.</li>
            <li>is probably a good buy for you.</li>
            <li>I find that if I use the shampoo alone, it&#x27;s not as good as using the shampoo and then the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Have used this conditioner (and shampoo) for 10 years--- works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I did stop using the conditioner for about a year and used my favorite brand conditioner with the UltraSwim shampoo and my hair</li>
            <li>stayed healthy.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and</li>
            <li>but it does the job for the most part.  </li>
            <li>After using the shampoo I place the conditioner in my hair and leave it in as close to 3 minutes as possible because I have gotten the best results that way.  </li>
            <li>you will be glad you did. :)</li>
            <li>This conditioner gets most of it out (I have a salt water pool).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice mild fragrance</li>
            <li>We all have blonde hair and these products work beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for two years and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair free of chorline smell and does not strip out my color.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells good and leaves our hair shiny, healthy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the smell (a tiny bit strong), but the product works well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability).</li>
            <li>No green hair so far, so I would imagine that is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use it right after swimming as it seems to work better than if you wait to wash your hair later.</li>
            <li>This seems to help get the chlorine out better than most other shampoos.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain that it&#x27;s great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>As an avid swimmer, I purchased this product for a friend.  </li>
            <li>sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt</li>
            <li>It is runnier than regular conditioner which makes it better--- doesn&#x27;t make swim cap slide off.</li>
            <li>This real does work!  </li>
            <li>I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars only because my hair is quite healthy and vibrant,</li>
            <li>I recently started swimming again and my hair was getting dry, so I searched for this and was surprised - but happy - that it is still around.  </li>
            <li>even though I swim, however, I don&#x27;t know that it really has to do with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have gone bottle blonde, but love to swim laps at my gym, so needed something that I could use after swimming to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t go green.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the UltraSwim shampoo and it works really well.</li>
            <li>That is what I wanted so mission accomplished.  </li>
            <li>I take a water aerobics class 2 to 3 times a week, and it has really helped.</li>
            <li>It really takes out the chlorine from our hair...</li>
            <li>I swim a lot and my hair gets really course from the chlorine</li>
            <li>so this really helps to soften it up and the shampoo gets out the chemicals.</li>
            <li>our long hair easily.</li>
            <li>I just recently began using the conditioner again because Amazon had run a special sale.  </li>
            <li>While I LOVE the shampoo (see my review of that), the conditioner is so watered down and runny</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool.</li>
            <li>I used to swim on my high school swim team, and I remember using this product 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work well, kind of hard to tell.</li>
            <li>At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>...though I can&#x27;t say it is or isn&#x27;t any better than ordinary conditioner.  </li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s not anywhere near the shower water---</li>
            <li>and I really like my regular conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as it would if I weren&#x27;t swimming</li>
            <li>No green hair, no straw-like feel, and Ultra Swim detangles</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and not dried</li>
            <li>The Ultra Swim brand is a high quality product designed to condition the hair of people who swim daily or often and need a product that will moisturize and maintain the quality of their hair.  </li>
            <li>Got this &amp; it not only has kept my hair the correct color, but I was surprised with how well it conditioned my hair.  </li>
            <li>Product does make a difference, was beginning to experience dry hair from frequent swimming.  </li>

            <li> I have purchased this item previously and it works well to remove chlorine as much as possible after spending time in the pool.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been swimming 3-4 times a week for 2 years now.  I use both the Shampoo and the Conditioner.   While I LOVE the shampoo (see my review of that), the conditioner is so watered down and runny, I feel like I bought it from a less-than-ethical street vendor.  Just not the quality one would expect.  It&#x27;s so runny that I end up using alot of extra because it&#x27;s tough to even get it from my hand to my hair without it draining away (and it&#x27;s not anywhere near the shower water---it&#x27;s just runny and thin).    I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars only because my hair is quite healthy and vibrant, even though I swim, however, I don&#x27;t know that it really has to do with the conditioner.  I have continually used the UltraSwim SHAMPOO, so I know that&#x27;s making a difference.  I did stop using the conditioner for about a year and used my favorite brand conditioner with the UltraSwim shampoo and my hair stayed healthy.  I just recently began using the conditioner again because Amazon had run a special sale.  Once I started using it again, I remembered why I had stopped.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this conditioner!</li>
            <li> As an avid swimmer, I purchased this product for a friend.  The Ultra Swim brand is a high quality product designed to condition the hair of people who swim daily or often and need a product that will moisturize and maintain the quality of their hair.  The only unrelated comment about this product would be the seller, who charged almost the same amount I paid that I paid for product for shipping it to me. I also ordered the Ultra Swim shampoo on the same order, but since it came from different vendor it was shipped separately.  In the future, I would caution folks to try and order products from the same vendor to avoid being overcharged for shipping.    Otherwise, the product is obviously more expensive than regular conditioner, but you get the benefits as well. Ultra Swim is a good product for those who need to remove chlorine from their hair and keep looking wonderful. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair. The type that usually doesn&#x27;t have real complaints when it comes to chlorine. That was before I started swimming in a hotel pool that LOADS their water with hydrogen peroxide (and it tastes like salt, too!). At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner. About a week into swimming every day - even with a cap - and my hair started feeling like straw. Absolutely horrible. I tried leaving my regular conditioner in longer and even left some on the ends after my shower in the hopes of helping things. Didn&#x27;t work. So I started browsing the web and came across UltraSwim. Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both the UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo and the UltraSwim Conditioner. I was disappointed in how watered down both the shampoo and conditioner seemed (the reason for giving 4*s and not 5). The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability). I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the chlorine-removal properties of the UltraSwim shampoo were what I was experiencing and I really like my regular conditioner, so I stopped using the UltraSwim conditioner and went back to using my regular conditioner. The results were disappointing. I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner. I switched back to the UltraSwim conditioner and the results improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool. She said she couldn&#x27;t tell. Even when my hair was wet! After another appointment 2 months later - my stylist still can&#x27;t feel any chlorine build-up. If you are at your wit&#x27;s end and just can&#x27;t take it anymore, this is probably a good buy for you. You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?this is probably a good buy for you. You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li> Bought this for post swim lesson showers for my daughter.  Seems to work well, kind of hard to tell. No green hair so far, so I would imagine that is a good sign.  I actually like the way my hair feels after using it too.</li>
            <li> I have gone bottle blonde, but love to swim laps at my gym, so needed something that I could use after swimming to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t go green.  Got this &amp; it not only has kept my hair the correct color, but I was surprised with how well it conditioned my hair.  I just use it after swimming, so I can&#x27;t say for certain that it&#x27;s great for everyday use.  But it works great for what I need!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the smell (a tiny bit strong), but the product works well.</li>
            <li> I used to swim on my high school swim team, and I remember using this product 30 years ago.  I recently started swimming again and my hair was getting dry, so I searched for this and was surprised - but happy - that it is still around.  It worked then and it works now.  I find that if I use the shampoo alone, it&#x27;s not as good as using the shampoo and then the conditioner.  This seems to help get the chlorine out better than most other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use this with the UltraSwim shampoo and it works really well. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as it would if I weren&#x27;t swimming but it does the job for the most part.  I have long hair past my shoulder blades and I swim 2-3 x week for about 6 months out of the year then I revert to swimming 1 x week.  It has a nice mild fragrance and I also use it prior to jumping in the pool to further protect my hair from the chlorine.  After using the shampoo I place the conditioner in my hair and leave it in as close to 3 minutes as possible because I have gotten the best results that way.  Also, it helps to use the shampoo and conditioner as soon after leaving the pool as possible.</li>
            <li> I started using the Ultra Swim shampoo/conditioner when I was a child, after we discovered that chlorine will turn blonde hair GREEN and ruin the texture of your hair!  I still use it and now use it on my children&#x27;s hair after we swim in a chlorinated pool.  Regular shampoo/conditioner does NOT remove chlorine.  We all have blonde hair and these products work beautifully.  No green hair, no straw-like feel, and Ultra Swim detangles our long hair easily. Plus, it smells good and leaves our hair shiny, healthy, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, too watering,  I would not use them anymore and not recommend to  my swimming friends.</li>
            <li> This product is good !!</li>
            <li> I am a triathlete and sometimes I swim every day. I hate the smell of chorine in my hair and worried about the damage on my color treated hair. I have used this product for two years and it is fantastic. It leaves my hair free of chorline smell and does not strip out my color. My hair is soft and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> I match this with TRISWIM Shampoo, 9-Ounce. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> ...though I can&#x27;t say it is or isn&#x27;t any better than ordinary conditioner.  In any event, it works well for me, and I am a swimmer.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the conditioner as it did not leave my hair feeling soft or well conditioned. Would buy shampoo again but skip the conditioner.</li>
            <li> UltraSwim is the best shampoo for post-swimming. When I swim laps my hair can get straw-like, but UltraSwim shampoo and conditioner leave it feeling great.</li>
            <li> Have used this conditioner (and shampoo) for 10 years--- works amazingly well. Binds to chlorine and removes it from hair. 1 bottle lasts at least a season-- or two depending on swim schedule. Put conditioner on wet hair prior to swim cap to protect hair. Use shampoo and conditioner after swim. It is runnier than regular conditioner which makes it better--- doesn&#x27;t make swim cap slide off. Great product-- protects highlighted hair, too!! Buy it-- you will be glad you did. :)</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of pool.  This conditioner gets most of it out (I have a salt water pool).  That is what I wanted so mission accomplished.  I use in conjunction with the shampoo of the same brand.</li>
            <li> After only one application, it turned my shiny and silky hair into brittle, dry, dull and fly-away hair.  Definitely will be giving this bottle away.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item previously and it works well to remove chlorine as much as possible after spending time in the pool. I take a water aerobics class 2 to 3 times a week, and it has really helped. It&#x27;s important to use it right after swimming as it seems to work better than if you wait to wash your hair later. My hairdresser said she noticed the difference after I started using it.</li>
            <li> Ultraswim is great for removing the chlorine smell without drying your hair out. I&#x27;ve used it for 15 years - it was great then and still is!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my child, competitive swimmer whose hair is subjected to chlorine 2hours daily. caring and maintaining hair quality at such harsh environments is a challenge. this conditioner is applied before the swim training and helps reducing chemicals damage. recommend for swim athletes.</li>
            <li> It really takes out the chlorine from our hair...</li>
            <li> This real does work!  Finally a product that removes the green tinge from blonde hair!  As soon as pool season starts my blonde daughter&#x27;s hair turns green from the pool!  I was amazed how well it worked when nothing else worked!! Its awesome product!  I stocked up!</li>
            <li> This goes with the Shampoo. I swim a lot and my hair gets really course from the chlorine so this really helps to soften it up and the shampoo gets out the chemicals. I recommend to swimmers.</li>
            <li> Product does make a difference, was beginning to experience dry hair from frequent swimming.  This product helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ultraswim for over 20 years and it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re a swimmer in chlorine.  I have dark hair so I only use it here and there but if you have toe headed children, this is a must have in the summers</li>
