    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It would also make an excellent gift (or incentive for someone to take care of *their* teeth!)</li>
            <li>What great bag of goodies!</li>
            <li>This would make a great gift for that person who you have no idea what to buy for!</li>
            <li>I was seriously impressed with this</li>
            <li>(I like the spinning head the best.)  </li>
            <li>Excellent electric tooth brush with oral health kit!</li>
            <li>I gave this toothbrush to my kids because they aren&#x27;t very good at brushing.</li>
            <li>A brush is good, but the paste can make it awesome</li>
            <li>toothbrush and heads are great though.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anyone that this kit wouldn&#x27;t make a great gift for.</li>
            <li>This is a great set.</li>
            <li>I have the problem of some flosses getting cut up or frayed on my teeth when I floss, but Glide works great for me.  </li>
            <li>At times I wasn&#x27;t happy and would do my teeth</li>
            <li>in all, this is a VERY nice starter kit for dental health.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Toothbrush is very effective in cleaning her teeth</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself would be a good sell along with the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good way to get all the products you need in one package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like buying a product and then having to pay a good amount of money for the 1st refill.</li>
            <li>The dental floss is Glide, which is a good quality floss.  </li>
            <li>The mouthwash, Scope, is also really good.  </li>
            <li>As stated, it is superior than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>They are clearly a good products that can help your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>package is a great deal because it comes with two brush heads, plus my favorite Crest whitening toothpaste, mouth wash, and floss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>It just works better and my teeth just feel cleaner!  </li>
            <li>is a great idea; and now with this package it is easy to do that.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why you would need to get all this in a kit.</li>
            <li>Scope is nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to get all the products that work together in one</li>
            <li>The attachments are a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to switch it</li>
            <li>floss is not my favorite but the mouthwash is good.  </li>
            <li>There is no water to deal with...a nice change from the &#x27;70s when everyone had waterpiks spraying around.  </li>
            <li>The bag is nice, and the products that are included are a nice, added bonus.</li>
            <li>I think it charges with some kind of magnetic mechanism.  </li>
            <li>If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried the Oral-B before, but wasn&#x27;t really thrilled by it.  </li>
            <li>I just put a travel toothbrush cover, the one-piece kind that you shove over a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But this toothbrush seems to do a very nice job at getting teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li>A great way to keep your teeth clean and healthy between cleanings.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 is an excellent electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Well we all do because dental hygiene is very important.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional 1000 toothbrush does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Love that the kit comes with those extras.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, I noticed my oldest daughters teeth looked so much better.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that while Listerine will probably always be my number one favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brand, Scope is up there.</li>
            <li>My favorite heads are</li>
            <li>so it was interesting to compare it with this version (the \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>Love this kit.</li>
            <li>and I love oral b brushes.  </li>
            <li>but these oral b brushes seem to have better reviews</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>No nasty burning sensation with the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that this set comes with a replacement head as well.</li>
            <li>This set is a tote packed with one of my FAVORITE toothbrushes, the Oral B 1000.  </li>
            <li>My teeth seemed more polished and they felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>I could feel more food particles being freed from between my teeth.</li>
            <li>when it beeps, I switch to the top inside, etc.  </li>
            <li>This whole package would be a great gift for someone who needs an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A cardboard shaped insert in the top of the box keeps things from sliding around.  </li>
            <li>Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones.</li>
            <li>With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head).</li>
            <li>To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it alerts me to change quadrants in my mouth, especially if I am zoning and/or listening to the news on tv - lol!  </li>
            <li>so make sure to watch for that.  </li>
            <li>Having all the products together in a bright white reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.hite reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.</li>
            <li>The Crest + Oral B Clean Kit is nice, but a bit on the costly side.</li>
            <li>think, depending on the circumstances, this is a great gift idea for just about anyone, even a new graduate of a dental hygienist school - maybe with a gift card tucked inside for some shopping as well :)</li>
            <li>Not as good as some of the higher-end models ($20-$50 more), but definitely a better clean that using your good old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>toothpaste is pretty good.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that the charge lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste was ok and the floss was fine.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows that keeping your teeth clean and your mouth fresh requires a three pronged approach - brushing for 2 minutes twice a day, flossing and using a good mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can come up with is that this the ideal present for Dentists to give away as birthday presents.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is easy to hold and handle</li>
            <li>an important aside, the most important thing to consider when buying an electric toothbrush is the cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>brush tips change easily but don&#x27;t come off under use</li>
            <li>It fits easily in the corner of my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it is easy to hold being slim.</li>
            <li>Easily found here on Amazon.com or at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Wow--what a difference this package of products has made in how fresh, clean, and healthy my mouth feels!</li>
            <li>No, she recommended a high quality one like the Oral-B toothbrush included in this set that I received in exchange for a fair review from Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothpaste, floss, and rinse are just fine-</li>
            <li>so it is comfortable and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrush for many years and I am glad to see the new models come out better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I find the 1000 series offers the best value by far.</li>
            <li>This is a huge convenience to me, and the way I want to purchase toothbrushes going forward.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge</li>
            <li>(so they can enjoy such a great product too)</li>
            <li>This brush seems to work really well and all my kids can use it with their own heads.</li>
            <li>No excuses now for me not take better care of my teeth and gums--not with this nice reusable tote filled with quality products from top name brands such as Oral-B, Braun, Crest, and Scope.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic electric, rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and this kit helps to maintain a plaque free mouth between visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li>The brushing performance is fantastic...</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes arenâ€™t cheap, but if you look around there are deals or coupons on them which help reduce their cost.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I would get excited over using a certain kind of rechargeable toothbrush, but I must say, I am over this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dental floss is also good, it&#x27;s the flat type which I know is not always everyone&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>The dental floss is also good, it&#x27;s the flat type which I know is not always everyone&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel so clean, you tend to smile more.  </li>
            <li>I love it for reaching back there and keeping me tidy and build-up free in-between</li>
            <li>Original Mouth Wash&lt;br</li>
            <li>The higher the number of the series, the more options it has.  </li>
            <li>I drink hot coffee and iced tea every day, and I love both savory and sweet foods.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>This brush helped me keep the area around where I needed a implant clean,  it also has the timer</li>
            <li>However, it will clean your teeth and it will do it WELL.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean with the assistance of Crest toothpaste with Scope after brushing with Oral-B.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to package everything (well, almost everything) needed for dental care in a single package.</li>
            <li>so I had to use their old toothbrush head bands so they each had their own color, but</li>
            <li>I tried these out around the same time to get a good sense of the differences of the two units.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unless you travel more than two week, you don&#x27;t really need to take your charger with you.  </li>
            <li>Simple, tastes good, works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a sturdy bag and it&#x27;s full of goodies.&lt;br /&gt;Included</li>
            <li>/&gt;Several pros: no batteries, countertop charger, full set of brushing supplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>With this shape of brush head, it works much better, plus since there is no spinning, there&#x27;s not as much toothpaste and spit flying</li>
            <li>The claims about Oral B electric toothbrushes cleaning your teeth so many times more than a regular toothbrush are all true.  </li>
            <li>The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Cleaning kit is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Every brush is now a perfectly clean, mouth-tingling fresh experience.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is really the star of the show, but the whole product selection is nice.</li>
            <li>In my mid-fifties, my smile is not as bright as it used to be, and I have noticed changes in my overall oral health.</li>
            <li>The Pro-Health seems to be thicker and more durable than the regular, but I can&#x27;t say that it cleaned any better.</li>
            <li>The power brush works well, producing adequate power and the The Crest Complete toothpaste has a nice, fresh flavor.  </li>
            <li>well worth buying, but the Oral-B power toothbrush is what really makes the package worthwhile.</li>
            <li>If you want to feel good about your mouth, breath, and smile, definitely consider getting one of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss is much more pleasant than any floss I have used before, so I am now flossing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good product with great results, but I&#x27;m not sure they need to sell all these extra items together.</li>
            <li>all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric brush!Electric brush!</li>
            <li>I have used the regular mode the most often so using this brush or the one that costs much more work exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that The charger is easy to travel with, its tiny when detached.  </li>
            <li>The heads in this kit (two are included - the Precision Clean and the Deep Sweep) are also good, but for my needs, not as effective as other head styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Precision Clean 1000 toothbrush in this kit is not only keeping her teeth plaque free, it stimulates her gums and she says her mouth feels refreshed and clean and her teeth feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>A very good feature is the different settings - there is a sensitive tooth setting, for example, that works very well if you have an implant -</li>
            <li>good thing is that overall as a unit, the toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to look at as you squeeze it out, which believe it or not actually makes a difference with me.</li>
            <li>Scope Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ve also used the Sonicare line of powered brushes, Oral-B is my favorite brand by far.</li>
            <li>Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste 4.4oz,</li>
            <li>Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste 4.4oz,</li>
            <li>I would have to say that it is well worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing.  </li>
            <li>So, if you gifted someone this by mail, they would probably feel like \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>that I always felt like I got my monies worth).  </li>
            <li>have had such great experience with the Oral B Professional Precision line</li>
            <li>The specially designed professional head makes it easy to get food debris out of all the \\&quot;nooks and</li>
            <li>The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic</li>
            <li>It really does mimic the clean feeling I get after getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>you get a real feel clean.</li>
            <li>I inadvertently flung the toothpaste right off the toothbrush by turning it on too soon (it&#x27;s got a pretty powerful spin to it).</li>
            <li>This would be a lovely gift for anybody, at least, I would be thrilled to receive</li>
            <li>The Scope mouthwash is nice and the floss is strong and easy to use due to its flat construction.</li>
            <li>It gets between my teeth far more easily and comfortably than any other brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Setup is quick and easy, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about actually putting anything together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Precision 1000 appears to more of a personal brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with extra brush heads, which I love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, if I were a dentist and needed a present for my nephew&#x27;s birthday, I&#x27;d consider this a healthy option.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and probably will never be able to go back to regular brushing.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush will stop if you apply too much pressure, which is useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took over 8 hours to fully charge it the first time, but once it is charged, you can leave it resting on the charger when you aren&#x27;t using it.  </li>
            <li>I brush the top outside,</li>
            <li>I am a pretty die-hard Sonicare fan.  </li>
            <li>If you want to have one for the entire family, you might want to buy [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 comes with two interchangeable heads, one round regular brush head, and one deep-sweep more rectangular head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product with the Glide floss, Crest complete toothpaste and the Scope Original mouth rinse will guarantee you clean teeth and fresh breath and an overall benefit in terms of mouth care.</li>
            <li>Scope Original Mint Rinse Classic 250mL and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss 15m&lt;</li>
            <li>Scope Original Mint Rinse Classic 250mL and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss 15m&lt;</li>
            <li>-B 1000 - I have owned several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years, both basic models as well as their more advanced models.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss pretty much cover all of your dental hygiene needs.</li>
            <li>The speed was nice and was fast enough to get a nice deep clean, but not so fast that it would feel harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li>The tote bag isn&#x27;t worth much (why would I want a tote bag that says Crest?), and the price on this set is really high.  </li>
            <li>I have these little floss loops that thread floss through for me to clean, but I don&#x27;t use them all the time and try to hit the area good with my multiple times a day brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, easy to take along for travel, and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t need the extras that come with this kit because I already have them, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to add to the inventory.  </li>
            <li>The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit put the smile back on my face, and it&#x27;s looking better every day.</li>
            <li>But it really wasn&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t spend too much time favoring one area over another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really like the brush head.</li>
            <li>I really like all of the added bonuses in the bag as well.</li>
            <li>I got this kit for my wife and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>This kit really packs a dental cleaning punch.</li>
            <li>, straight -- it is really a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit seems to keep a charge really well.</li>
            <li>It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.  </li>
            <li>This is very helpful, as I tend to do that.  </li>
            <li>My dentist even noticed that my teeth were much cleaner after I stared using them.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000).</li>
            <li>I needed a mouth make-over, and the Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit came just at the right time.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush is the most basic of the Professional Precision line, but is far greater than a regular brush or even one of the $30 Oral B electric brushes that you will not regret getting one.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been scratching my head trying to figure out why this &amp;#34;Professional Daily Clean Kit&amp;#34; even exists.  </li>
            <li>and she says it makes her entire mouth feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The Crest + Oral-Professional Daily Clean Kit has an electric toothbrush (1000 model) plus toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Dental Floss</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t round, it is a traditional toothbrush shape, but does amazing things!  </li>
            <li>the batteries get low it doesnâ€™t clean as well</li>
            <li>This Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush is now slimmer, lighter, and more powerful than my previous brushes.  </li>
            <li>you go higher in the Professional Care family</li>
            <li>This is such a cool and convenient way to upgrade a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mouthwash - classic Scope.</li>
            <li>About as classic as you can get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used those that use AA batteries, but they do not vibrate (or spin) at as high frequency as these rechargeable ones.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am convinced that high quality power toothbrush is a &amp;#34;smile-worthy&amp;#34; investment.</li>
            <li>(Although you really should make sure they want an electric toothbrush first, because 5 years ago I would have been angry and would vastly have preferred the money to a toothbrush gift, so I&#x27;m glad my father never bought me an electric</li>
            <li>This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others.</li>
            <li>Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Puslonic, and CrossAction Power.l work on most other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The bottle of Scope Classic Mint Mouthwash adds extra zing and freshness, giving you the confidence of fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Crest + Oral-B Daily Clean Kit includes: Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with 2 brush head refills (1 Precision Clean and 1 Deep Sweep), Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope</li>

            <li>It was like, wow, I got so much stuff.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any of the bells and whistles as the more advanced (and much more expensive) models such as a separate display unit and multiple brushing modes, but it gets the job done and does it well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is like having your personal dentist right there at home.</li>
            <li>you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless</li>
            <li>a long period of use, I have found that many of the more expensive features are superfluous, whereas I absolutely need the quadrant timer</li>
            <li>All of the items come in a bag, which you can reuse for other things (not a heavy duty bag, but might work for light things).</li>
            <li>Several of my friends have tried and recommended electronic toothbrushes, but this is my first experience with a non-manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dentist usually recommends the phillips, which is okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add:  The deep sweep brush will work on most other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say that if the light blinks red then you must charge for 40 minutes before the toothbrush can give you a 2 minute clean, but this doesn&#x27;t say how long you would have to wait if your unit is completely drained of power or how long it&#x27;d take to charge completely.</li>
            <li>other&#x27;s have noted, these products are sold individually, but the packaging makes it nice for a recent graduate or someone going off to college/job interviews.</li>

            <li>far as the dental floss and Scope goes, they&#x27;re pretty standard.</li>
            <li>I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste provides a solid scrub while also leaving behind a pleasant aftertaste and no tasty staining.</li>

            <li>For years my father and brother had tried to sell me on an electric toothbrush, and I held off because I was fine with my plain old nonelectric brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course I want something that actually works and would choose quality over style, but this toothpaste works very well.</li>

            <li>The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care</li>
            <li>I like to use really minty toothpaste, and the Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste with Scope offers multiple benefits all in one product.</li>
            <li>Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t spell out how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li>This head&#x27;s scrubbing action coupled with its speed make it a killer option for cleaning that area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and classy, but still, way over the mark in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dental care items are not really all that exciting, but seeing five things (brush, extra brush head, floss, mouth wash, toothpaste) that I would have to buy anyway, I was like \\&quot;Wow, so much stuff.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>so much stuff\\&quot; when they open it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extras:  toothpaste, mouth wash, floss, and extra brush head:  The toothbrush alone is much cheaper than the kit, so</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and use Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a milder aftertaste than listerine, and is nonobtrusive as far as mouthwashes go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Tooth Brush</li>
            <li>Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Toothpaste&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a somewhat small thing, but it can make a big difference if you&#x27;re looking to use it right away or give it a quick charge to take on the road.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t just leave it in the shower like a plain old nonelectric, but I still get my shower clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that although this might seem shallow, I feel better when I have toothpaste that looks like something I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting in my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the major selling point for this kit is the Oral-B toothbrush, and it is a knock-out -- particularly with the back and forth cleaning head.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous automatic toothbrushes with the circular action, but this lateral movement really makes me feel like I get deep</li>
            <li>Any version of Glide is, in my opinion, far better than any other floss if you have tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>Plus there are other goodies, toothpaste, floss, mouthwashâ€”which makes this set feel like a super value although itâ€™s lower than Iâ€™ve historically paid for tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this kit is a new Oral-B brush called the \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>the Floss Action and the Extra Soft (not included in this kit - must be purchased separately).</li>
            <li>The toothbrush would have been enough for me, BUT I think this is a terrific gift idea to give to someone just learning how to really care for their teeth.  </li>
            <li>of you are interested in the other items included in this kit, even though as I already told you too much about, to me the big news is the Deep Sweep brush!  </li>
            <li>I have bridgework, a implant, a few rootcannels, and many other things  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old brand of toothpaste when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>When I brush my teeth with the Oral-B Professional toothbrush I do feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it yet, but it attaches with the same snapping action as the lateral ahead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes;  it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.  </li>
            <li>The Sonic Care tickled my mouth and if I barely pulled it out of my mouth, toothpaste sprayed all over my mirror.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral B electric toothbrushes last several years, depending on how much it is used (I have had 3 die on me with enough use</li>
            <li>At least when new, the battery will last for a full week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.  </li>
            <li>I mean, I didn&#x27;t use floss for years because no one explained to me why it was important to use</li>
            <li>other words, the Oral-B 1000 has the absolute minimum of features - for my usage</li>
            <li>She recently had her teeth professionally cleaned as part of her regular oral hygiene program</li>
            <li>I usually use a floss pick, so the floss thread is not quite useful for me.</li>
            <li>All of the products in this kit are regular sized, they are: A tube of Crest toothpaste, Glide Pro Health dental floss, Scope mouthwash, a regular round Oral-B brush head, an Oral-B electric toothbrush with charger, of course the Deep Sweep head, and a cute little bag to put your lunch in sometime.  </li>
            <li>This is a single person complete set designed as a starter set for the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It would also make an excellent gift (or incentive for someone to take care of *their* teeth!)</li>
            <li> What great bag of goodies!</li>
            <li> This would make a great gift for that person who you have no idea what to buy for!</li>
            <li> I was seriously impressed with this</li>
            <li> (I like the spinning head the best.)  </li>
            <li> Excellent electric tooth brush with oral health kit!</li>
            <li> I gave this toothbrush to my kids because they aren&#x27;t very good at brushing.</li>
            <li> A brush is good, but the paste can make it awesome</li>
            <li> toothbrush and heads are great though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anyone that this kit wouldn&#x27;t make a great gift for.</li>
            <li> This is a great set.</li>
            <li> I have the problem of some flosses getting cut up or frayed on my teeth when I floss, but Glide works great for me.  </li>
            <li> At times I wasn&#x27;t happy and would do my teeth</li>
            <li> in all, this is a VERY nice starter kit for dental health.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Toothbrush is very effective in cleaning her teeth</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself would be a good sell along with the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good way to get all the products you need in one package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like buying a product and then having to pay a good amount of money for the 1st refill.</li>
            <li> The dental floss is Glide, which is a good quality floss.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash, Scope, is also really good.  </li>
            <li> As stated, it is superior than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> They are clearly a good products that can help your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> package is a great deal because it comes with two brush heads, plus my favorite Crest whitening toothpaste, mouth wash, and floss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> It just works better and my teeth just feel cleaner!  </li>
            <li> is a great idea; and now with this package it is easy to do that.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why you would need to get all this in a kit.</li>
            <li> Scope is nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to get all the products that work together in one</li>
            <li> The attachments are a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to switch it</li>
            <li> floss is not my favorite but the mouthwash is good.  </li>
            <li> There is no water to deal with...a nice change from the &#x27;70s when everyone had waterpiks spraying around.  </li>
            <li> The bag is nice, and the products that are included are a nice, added bonus.</li>
            <li> I think it charges with some kind of magnetic mechanism.  </li>
            <li> If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried the Oral-B before, but wasn&#x27;t really thrilled by it.  </li>
            <li> I just put a travel toothbrush cover, the one-piece kind that you shove over a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But this toothbrush seems to do a very nice job at getting teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li> A great way to keep your teeth clean and healthy between cleanings.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 is an excellent electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Well we all do because dental hygiene is very important.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional 1000 toothbrush does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Love that the kit comes with those extras.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, I noticed my oldest daughters teeth looked so much better.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that while Listerine will probably always be my number one favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brand, Scope is up there.</li>
            <li> My favorite heads are</li>
            <li> so it was interesting to compare it with this version (the \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> Love this kit.</li>
            <li> and I love oral b brushes.  </li>
            <li> but these oral b brushes seem to have better reviews</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> No nasty burning sensation with the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that this set comes with a replacement head as well.</li>
            <li> This set is a tote packed with one of my FAVORITE toothbrushes, the Oral B 1000.  </li>
            <li> My teeth seemed more polished and they felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I could feel more food particles being freed from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> when it beeps, I switch to the top inside, etc.  </li>
            <li> This whole package would be a great gift for someone who needs an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A cardboard shaped insert in the top of the box keeps things from sliding around.  </li>
            <li> Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones.</li>
            <li> With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head).</li>
            <li> To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it alerts me to change quadrants in my mouth, especially if I am zoning and/or listening to the news on tv - lol!  </li>
            <li> so make sure to watch for that.  </li>
            <li> Having all the products together in a bright white reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.hite reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.</li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral B Clean Kit is nice, but a bit on the costly side.</li>
            <li> think, depending on the circumstances, this is a great gift idea for just about anyone, even a new graduate of a dental hygienist school - maybe with a gift card tucked inside for some shopping as well :)</li>
            <li> Not as good as some of the higher-end models ($20-$50 more), but definitely a better clean that using your good old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is pretty good.</li>

            <li> I was impressed that the charge lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was ok and the floss was fine.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that keeping your teeth clean and your mouth fresh requires a three pronged approach - brushing for 2 minutes twice a day, flossing and using a good mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can come up with is that this the ideal present for Dentists to give away as birthday presents.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is easy to hold and handle</li>
            <li> an important aside, the most important thing to consider when buying an electric toothbrush is the cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> brush tips change easily but don&#x27;t come off under use</li>
            <li> It fits easily in the corner of my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it is easy to hold being slim.</li>
            <li> Easily found here on Amazon.com or at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Wow--what a difference this package of products has made in how fresh, clean, and healthy my mouth feels!</li>
            <li> No, she recommended a high quality one like the Oral-B toothbrush included in this set that I received in exchange for a fair review from Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothpaste, floss, and rinse are just fine-</li>
            <li> so it is comfortable and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrush for many years and I am glad to see the new models come out better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I find the 1000 series offers the best value by far.</li>
            <li> This is a huge convenience to me, and the way I want to purchase toothbrushes going forward.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge</li>
            <li> (so they can enjoy such a great product too)</li>
            <li> This brush seems to work really well and all my kids can use it with their own heads.</li>
            <li> No excuses now for me not take better care of my teeth and gums--not with this nice reusable tote filled with quality products from top name brands such as Oral-B, Braun, Crest, and Scope.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic electric, rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and this kit helps to maintain a plaque free mouth between visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> The brushing performance is fantastic...</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes arenâ€™t cheap, but if you look around there are deals or coupons on them which help reduce their cost.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would get excited over using a certain kind of rechargeable toothbrush, but I must say, I am over this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dental floss is also good, it&#x27;s the flat type which I know is not always everyone&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> The dental floss is also good, it&#x27;s the flat type which I know is not always everyone&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel so clean, you tend to smile more.  </li>
            <li> I love it for reaching back there and keeping me tidy and build-up free in-between</li>
            <li> Original Mouth Wash&lt;br</li>
            <li> The higher the number of the series, the more options it has.  </li>
            <li> I drink hot coffee and iced tea every day, and I love both savory and sweet foods.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> This brush helped me keep the area around where I needed a implant clean,  it also has the timer</li>
            <li> However, it will clean your teeth and it will do it WELL.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean with the assistance of Crest toothpaste with Scope after brushing with Oral-B.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to package everything (well, almost everything) needed for dental care in a single package.</li>
            <li> so I had to use their old toothbrush head bands so they each had their own color, but</li>
            <li> I tried these out around the same time to get a good sense of the differences of the two units.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unless you travel more than two week, you don&#x27;t really need to take your charger with you.  </li>
            <li> Simple, tastes good, works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes in a sturdy bag and it&#x27;s full of goodies.&lt;br /&gt;Included</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several pros: no batteries, countertop charger, full set of brushing supplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> With this shape of brush head, it works much better, plus since there is no spinning, there&#x27;s not as much toothpaste and spit flying</li>
            <li> The claims about Oral B electric toothbrushes cleaning your teeth so many times more than a regular toothbrush are all true.  </li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Cleaning kit is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Every brush is now a perfectly clean, mouth-tingling fresh experience.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really the star of the show, but the whole product selection is nice.</li>
            <li> In my mid-fifties, my smile is not as bright as it used to be, and I have noticed changes in my overall oral health.</li>
            <li> The Pro-Health seems to be thicker and more durable than the regular, but I can&#x27;t say that it cleaned any better.</li>
            <li> The power brush works well, producing adequate power and the The Crest Complete toothpaste has a nice, fresh flavor.  </li>
            <li> well worth buying, but the Oral-B power toothbrush is what really makes the package worthwhile.</li>
            <li> If you want to feel good about your mouth, breath, and smile, definitely consider getting one of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss is much more pleasant than any floss I have used before, so I am now flossing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good product with great results, but I&#x27;m not sure they need to sell all these extra items together.</li>
            <li> all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric brush!Electric brush!</li>
            <li> I have used the regular mode the most often so using this brush or the one that costs much more work exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that The charger is easy to travel with, its tiny when detached.  </li>
            <li> The heads in this kit (two are included - the Precision Clean and the Deep Sweep) are also good, but for my needs, not as effective as other head styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Precision Clean 1000 toothbrush in this kit is not only keeping her teeth plaque free, it stimulates her gums and she says her mouth feels refreshed and clean and her teeth feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> A very good feature is the different settings - there is a sensitive tooth setting, for example, that works very well if you have an implant -</li>
            <li> good thing is that overall as a unit, the toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to look at as you squeeze it out, which believe it or not actually makes a difference with me.</li>
            <li> Scope Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve also used the Sonicare line of powered brushes, Oral-B is my favorite brand by far.</li>
            <li> Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste 4.4oz,</li>
            <li> Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste 4.4oz,</li>
            <li> I would have to say that it is well worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing.  </li>
            <li> So, if you gifted someone this by mail, they would probably feel like \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li> that I always felt like I got my monies worth).  </li>
            <li> have had such great experience with the Oral B Professional Precision line</li>
            <li> The specially designed professional head makes it easy to get food debris out of all the \\&quot;nooks and</li>
            <li> The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic</li>
            <li> It really does mimic the clean feeling I get after getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> you get a real feel clean.</li>
            <li> I inadvertently flung the toothpaste right off the toothbrush by turning it on too soon (it&#x27;s got a pretty powerful spin to it).</li>
            <li> This would be a lovely gift for anybody, at least, I would be thrilled to receive</li>
            <li> The Scope mouthwash is nice and the floss is strong and easy to use due to its flat construction.</li>
            <li> It gets between my teeth far more easily and comfortably than any other brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Setup is quick and easy, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about actually putting anything together.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Precision 1000 appears to more of a personal brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with extra brush heads, which I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if I were a dentist and needed a present for my nephew&#x27;s birthday, I&#x27;d consider this a healthy option.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and probably will never be able to go back to regular brushing.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush will stop if you apply too much pressure, which is useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took over 8 hours to fully charge it the first time, but once it is charged, you can leave it resting on the charger when you aren&#x27;t using it.  </li>
            <li> I brush the top outside,</li>
            <li> I am a pretty die-hard Sonicare fan.  </li>
            <li> If you want to have one for the entire family, you might want to buy [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 comes with two interchangeable heads, one round regular brush head, and one deep-sweep more rectangular head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product with the Glide floss, Crest complete toothpaste and the Scope Original mouth rinse will guarantee you clean teeth and fresh breath and an overall benefit in terms of mouth care.</li>
            <li> Scope Original Mint Rinse Classic 250mL and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss 15m&lt;</li>
            <li> Scope Original Mint Rinse Classic 250mL and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss 15m&lt;</li>
            <li> -B 1000 - I have owned several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years, both basic models as well as their more advanced models.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss pretty much cover all of your dental hygiene needs.</li>
            <li> The speed was nice and was fast enough to get a nice deep clean, but not so fast that it would feel harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> The tote bag isn&#x27;t worth much (why would I want a tote bag that says Crest?), and the price on this set is really high.  </li>
            <li> I have these little floss loops that thread floss through for me to clean, but I don&#x27;t use them all the time and try to hit the area good with my multiple times a day brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, easy to take along for travel, and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t need the extras that come with this kit because I already have them, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to add to the inventory.  </li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit put the smile back on my face, and it&#x27;s looking better every day.</li>
            <li> But it really wasn&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t spend too much time favoring one area over another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really like the brush head.</li>
            <li> I really like all of the added bonuses in the bag as well.</li>
            <li> I got this kit for my wife and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> This kit really packs a dental cleaning punch.</li>
            <li> , straight -- it is really a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit seems to keep a charge really well.</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.  </li>
            <li> This is very helpful, as I tend to do that.  </li>
            <li> My dentist even noticed that my teeth were much cleaner after I stared using them.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000).</li>
            <li> I needed a mouth make-over, and the Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit came just at the right time.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush is the most basic of the Professional Precision line, but is far greater than a regular brush or even one of the $30 Oral B electric brushes that you will not regret getting one.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scratching my head trying to figure out why this &amp;#34;Professional Daily Clean Kit&amp;#34; even exists.  </li>
            <li> and she says it makes her entire mouth feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-Professional Daily Clean Kit has an electric toothbrush (1000 model) plus toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Dental Floss</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t round, it is a traditional toothbrush shape, but does amazing things!  </li>
            <li> the batteries get low it doesnâ€™t clean as well</li>
            <li> This Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush is now slimmer, lighter, and more powerful than my previous brushes.  </li>
            <li> you go higher in the Professional Care family</li>
            <li> This is such a cool and convenient way to upgrade a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mouthwash - classic Scope.</li>
            <li> About as classic as you can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used those that use AA batteries, but they do not vibrate (or spin) at as high frequency as these rechargeable ones.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am convinced that high quality power toothbrush is a &amp;#34;smile-worthy&amp;#34; investment.</li>
            <li> (Although you really should make sure they want an electric toothbrush first, because 5 years ago I would have been angry and would vastly have preferred the money to a toothbrush gift, so I&#x27;m glad my father never bought me an electric</li>
            <li> This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others.</li>
            <li> Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Puslonic, and CrossAction Power.l work on most other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The bottle of Scope Classic Mint Mouthwash adds extra zing and freshness, giving you the confidence of fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Crest + Oral-B Daily Clean Kit includes: Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with 2 brush head refills (1 Precision Clean and 1 Deep Sweep), Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope</li>
            <li> Crest + Oral-B Daily Clean Kit includes: Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with 2 brush head refills (1 Precision Clean and 1 Deep Sweep), Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope</li>
            <li> It was like, wow, I got so much stuff.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any of the bells and whistles as the more advanced (and much more expensive) models such as a separate display unit and multiple brushing modes, but it gets the job done and does it well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is like having your personal dentist right there at home.</li>
            <li> you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless</li>
            <li> a long period of use, I have found that many of the more expensive features are superfluous, whereas I absolutely need the quadrant timer</li>
            <li> All of the items come in a bag, which you can reuse for other things (not a heavy duty bag, but might work for light things).</li>
            <li> Several of my friends have tried and recommended electronic toothbrushes, but this is my first experience with a non-manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist usually recommends the phillips, which is okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add:  The deep sweep brush will work on most other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say that if the light blinks red then you must charge for 40 minutes before the toothbrush can give you a 2 minute clean, but this doesn&#x27;t say how long you would have to wait if your unit is completely drained of power or how long it&#x27;d take to charge completely.</li>
            <li> other&#x27;s have noted, these products are sold individually, but the packaging makes it nice for a recent graduate or someone going off to college/job interviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with two extra heads (precision clean and deep</li>
            <li> far as the dental floss and Scope goes, they&#x27;re pretty standard.</li>
            <li> I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste provides a solid scrub while also leaving behind a pleasant aftertaste and no tasty staining.</li>
            <li> The others are nice and the big bonus here is that this came with extra tooth brush heads, but if the immediate cost is a factor then buying the base first and getting the heads later is a good option.is up there.</li>
            <li> The others are nice and the big bonus here is that this came with extra tooth brush heads, but if the immediate cost is a factor then buying the base first and getting the heads later is a good option.</li>
            <li> For years my father and brother had tried to sell me on an electric toothbrush, and I held off because I was fine with my plain old nonelectric brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course I want something that actually works and would choose quality over style, but this toothpaste works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 4oz tube of Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening +</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care</li>
            <li> I like to use really minty toothpaste, and the Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste with Scope offers multiple benefits all in one product.</li>
            <li> Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t spell out how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li> This head&#x27;s scrubbing action coupled with its speed make it a killer option for cleaning that area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and classy, but still, way over the mark in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dental care items are not really all that exciting, but seeing five things (brush, extra brush head, floss, mouth wash, toothpaste) that I would have to buy anyway, I was like \\&quot;Wow, so much stuff.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> so much stuff\\&quot; when they open it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extras:  toothpaste, mouth wash, floss, and extra brush head:  The toothbrush alone is much cheaper than the kit, so</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and use Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a milder aftertaste than listerine, and is nonobtrusive as far as mouthwashes go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Tooth Brush</li>
            <li> Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Toothpaste&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat small thing, but it can make a big difference if you&#x27;re looking to use it right away or give it a quick charge to take on the road.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just leave it in the shower like a plain old nonelectric, but I still get my shower clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that although this might seem shallow, I feel better when I have toothpaste that looks like something I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the major selling point for this kit is the Oral-B toothbrush, and it is a knock-out -- particularly with the back and forth cleaning head.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous automatic toothbrushes with the circular action, but this lateral movement really makes me feel like I get deep</li>
            <li> Any version of Glide is, in my opinion, far better than any other floss if you have tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> Plus there are other goodies, toothpaste, floss, mouthwashâ€”which makes this set feel like a super value although itâ€™s lower than Iâ€™ve historically paid for tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In this kit is a new Oral-B brush called the \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> the Floss Action and the Extra Soft (not included in this kit - must be purchased separately).</li>
            <li> The toothbrush would have been enough for me, BUT I think this is a terrific gift idea to give to someone just learning how to really care for their teeth.  </li>
            <li> of you are interested in the other items included in this kit, even though as I already told you too much about, to me the big news is the Deep Sweep brush!  </li>
            <li> I have bridgework, a implant, a few rootcannels, and many other things  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old brand of toothpaste when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> When I brush my teeth with the Oral-B Professional toothbrush I do feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it yet, but it attaches with the same snapping action as the lateral ahead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes;  it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.  </li>
            <li> The Sonic Care tickled my mouth and if I barely pulled it out of my mouth, toothpaste sprayed all over my mirror.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral B electric toothbrushes last several years, depending on how much it is used (I have had 3 die on me with enough use</li>
            <li> At least when new, the battery will last for a full week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I didn&#x27;t use floss for years because no one explained to me why it was important to use</li>
            <li> other words, the Oral-B 1000 has the absolute minimum of features - for my usage</li>
            <li> She recently had her teeth professionally cleaned as part of her regular oral hygiene program</li>
            <li> I usually use a floss pick, so the floss thread is not quite useful for me.</li>
            <li> All of the products in this kit are regular sized, they are: A tube of Crest toothpaste, Glide Pro Health dental floss, Scope mouthwash, a regular round Oral-B brush head, an Oral-B electric toothbrush with charger, of course the Deep Sweep head, and a cute little bag to put your lunch in sometime.  </li>
            <li> This is a single person complete set designed as a starter set for the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with the regular round Oral-B brush, is when I try to get around the front of my mouth, the brush is outside of my mouth without my lips covering it to keep it from splattering, and it always did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes in the Professional Care series on the other hand add quadrant timers, and are rated both at 8800 oscillations per minute and at 40,000 pulsations per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothpaste - I didn&#x27;t care for the Crest toothpaste but that&#x27;s due to the fact that I need to use a sensitive formulation.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Oral B toothbrushes and have been using them for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t yet tested to see how long this Precision 1000 brush lasts off the charger, my previous model (Triumph) lasted nearly three weeks, used by four of us in the family on our trip to China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just recently had gum graft surgery for recession, and I am now very aware of how hard I am brushing now, so that I don&#x27;t destroy my gums again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I know how long to brush and where.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to charge the brush.</li>
            <li> But this is minor</li>
            <li> On the package it says that it will not fit these Oral-B electric bases:  Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Puslonic, and CrossAction Power.</li>
            <li> have used a few of the toothbrushes in the Oral-B Professional Precision line.  </li>
            <li> I find it cleans my teeth better and the replacement heads (of which there are a variety to select from) are less expensive.</li>
            <li> For brushing my tongue, I don&#x27;t want a spinning head, and want just a plain old brush.  </li>
            <li> I have resisted an electric toothbrush for years because I&#x27;ve used them in the past but the little tiny heads didn&#x27;t feel like they were doing much, just spot cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It gets into the smaller crevices in my teeth that the thicker floss can&#x27;t get into due to my having a crown or a filling, so I rather like the Glide.</li>
            <li> It gets into the smaller crevices in my teeth that the thicker floss can&#x27;t get into due to my having a crown or a filling, so I rather like the Glide.</li>
            <li> Other types, such as this, contribute to tooth pain for me.</li>
            <li> There is a red LED that flashes when power is low and a green LED that flashes</li>
            <li> The other Oral-B brush I have had a little tray with a lid to store the different brushes for different members of the family</li>
            <li> Ultimately, you probably achieve no better results using a power brush unless it induces you to use it longer or if the user has limited or impaired mobility which prevents or hinders using a traditional &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> also like the smaller charger that takes less space</li>
            <li> only compliant on this brush has always been charge time; the charge lasts for several days but not more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little annoying, although I&#x27;d guess that this was more because the instructions were so general because it was used for a wide line of electronic toothbrushes with various battery lives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I still use a manual brush at times) and have used it for at least 10 days this last time without it needing plugged in -- a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans more like the Sonicare, without all of that crazy spinning of the round brush (which was also included in this kit).  </li>
            <li> kit also comes with a standard round head.</li>
            <li> you get toothpaste sprayed around the room if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I think it&#x27;s missing is a toothbrush cover for the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing you might feel is missing, is a brush cover for your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> As the toothbrush heads are detachable, it is possible to have several people use the same toothbrush base, as long as you are willing to share the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts.  </li>
            <li> The main draw is the toothbrush, but Scope, dental floss, and toothpaste seem unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t detract from the rating due to this since that&#x27;s not a fault of the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Floss - my usual brand is the Oral-B regular Glide</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonic Care in the past, and I didn&#x27;t care for the size of the brush and the charger was really big.  </li>
            <li> Now, that is not an issue since simply gliding this brush over my teeth gets them cleaning than my hard brushing ever did.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom counter, so there is little space for extra gadgets.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not deserving of low marks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This comes as a kit as mentioned in the description. All of the items come in a bag, which you can reuse for other things (not a heavy duty bag, but might work for light things). It comes with some toothbrush heads, scope mouthwash, floss, and toothpaste. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why you would need to get all this in a kit. The main draw is the toothbrush, but Scope, dental floss, and toothpaste seem unnecessary. I personally do not like Scope. The toothpaste was ok and the floss was fine. But it really wasn&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush and heads are great though. Love that the kit comes with those extras. Also came with some coupons for replacement heads when you need to stock up. I gave this toothbrush to my kids because they aren&#x27;t very good at brushing. After 2 weeks, I noticed my oldest daughters teeth looked so much better. We aren&#x27;t strangers to electric toothbrushes. We&#x27;ve been using them for years. This brush seems to work really well and all my kids can use it with their own heads. The heads come with colors which you can switch out. Unfortunately, the only color they got was blue so I had to use their old toothbrush head bands so they each had their own color, but that&#x27;s not deserving of low marks. I just found it a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product with great results, but I&#x27;m not sure they need to sell all these extra items together. The toothbrush itself would be a good sell along with the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I received this at about the same time I received the whitening kit. I tried these out around the same time to get a good sense of the differences of the two units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that overall as a unit, the toothbrush works very well. Setup is quick and easy, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about actually putting anything together. You do have to snap one little part on the charger, but that&#x27;s optional and not really necessary unless you have multiple people that will be using the base of the toothbrush. The speed was nice and was fast enough to get a nice deep clean, but not so fast that it would feel harsh on the gums. Now the only drawback is that you aren&#x27;t given a target amount of charging time. The instructions say that if the light blinks red then you must charge for 40 minutes before the toothbrush can give you a 2 minute clean, but this doesn&#x27;t say how long you would have to wait if your unit is completely drained of power or how long it&#x27;d take to charge completely. This is a somewhat small thing, but it can make a big difference if you&#x27;re looking to use it right away or give it a quick charge to take on the road. It&#x27;s just a little annoying, although I&#x27;d guess that this was more because the instructions were so general because it was used for a wide line of electronic toothbrushes with various battery lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is pretty good. It&#x27;s nice to look at as you squeeze it out, which believe it or not actually makes a difference with me. I&#x27;ve found that although this might seem shallow, I feel better when I have toothpaste that looks like something I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting in my mouth. Of course I want something that actually works and would choose quality over style, but this toothpaste works very well. The Scope additive tastes nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the dental floss and Scope goes, they&#x27;re pretty standard. Scope is nice and I have to say that while Listerine will probably always be my number one favorite \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brand, Scope is up there. The dental floss is also good, it&#x27;s the flat type which I know is not always everyone&#x27;s favorite. It gets into the smaller crevices in my teeth that the thicker floss can&#x27;t get into due to my having a crown or a filling, so I rather like the Glide. It didn&#x27;t shred in my teeth, which is always a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this to others. It&#x27;s a bit expensive and the price for each thing separate on Amazon is almost the same price as this bag itself (except that the paste, floss, and mouthwash tend to come in bulk, which affects the price), so if the price is an issue I&#x27;d recommend just looking for the [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO toothbrush]] and picking up the rest at your local store. The others are nice and the big bonus here is that this came with extra tooth brush heads, but if the immediate cost is a factor then buying the base first and getting the heads later is a good option.is up there.

            <li> This is a bundle of the following products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with two extra heads (precision clean and deep sweep)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 250ml bottle of Scope rinse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 4oz tube of Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other&#x27;s have noted, these products are sold individually, but the packaging makes it nice for a recent graduate or someone going off to college/job interviews. It&#x27;s also nice to get all the products that work together in one package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is pretty good. Not as good as some of the higher-end models ($20-$50 more), but definitely a better clean that using your good old manual toothbrush. I have resisted an electric toothbrush for years because I&#x27;ve used them in the past but the little tiny heads didn&#x27;t feel like they were doing much, just spot cleaning my teeth. But this toothbrush seems to do a very nice job at getting teeth and gums clean. The attachments are a nice bonus. I prefer the deep cleaning head, but you can take the two heads for a test drive and see what you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste, floss, and rinse are just fine- I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old brand of toothpaste when I&#x27;m done (just force of habit), but it&#x27;s nice to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a VERY nice starter kit for dental health. It&#x27;s a good way to get all the products you need in one package. The toothbrush is really the star of the show, but the whole product selection is nice. It would also make an excellent gift (or incentive for someone to take care of *their* teeth!)</li>
            <li> Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000). The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per minute, and does not have battery charging indicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes in the Professional Care series on the other hand add quadrant timers, and are rated both at 8800 oscillations per minute and at 40,000 pulsations per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a long period of use, I have found that many of the more expensive features are superfluous, whereas I absolutely need the quadrant timer so I don&#x27;t spend too much time favoring one area over another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the Oral-B 1000 has the absolute minimum of features - for my usage patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
            <li> In my mid-fifties, my smile is not as bright as it used to be, and I have noticed changes in my overall oral health. I drink hot coffee and iced tea every day, and I love both savory and sweet foods. I needed a mouth make-over, and the Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit came just at the right time. No excuses now for me not take better care of my teeth and gums--not with this nice reusable tote filled with quality products from top name brands such as Oral-B, Braun, Crest, and Scope. Wow--what a difference this package of products has made in how fresh, clean, and healthy my mouth feels! Several of my friends have tried and recommended electronic toothbrushes, but this is my first experience with a non-manual toothbrush. The Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 comes with two interchangeable heads, one round regular brush head, and one deep-sweep more rectangular head. When the toothbrush is fully charged, it will run for about a week before needing to be recharged. Both of the brush heads have indicator bristles which will fade half-way when they need to be changed. The toothbrush signals every 30 seconds so that you can move to another section of your mouth. It will stop pulsing if you are brushing too hard. Instead of just vibrating, the toothbrush head oscillates and swivels to move over and around the surface of your teeth and gums. I like to use really minty toothpaste, and the Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste with Scope offers multiple benefits all in one product. The bottle of Scope Classic Mint Mouthwash adds extra zing and freshness, giving you the confidence of fresh breath. I have tried using dental floss in the past, but it always hurt my gums. The Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss is much more pleasant than any floss I have used before, so I am now flossing on a regular basis. The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit put the smile back on my face, and it&#x27;s looking better every day. Having all the products together in a bright white reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.hite reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrush for many years and I am glad to see the new models come out better and cheaper.  This Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush is now slimmer, lighter, and more powerful than my previous brushes.  I&#x27;ve also used those that use AA batteries, but they do not vibrate (or spin) at as high frequency as these rechargeable ones.  So a rechargeable brush like this one is preferred to the battery operated ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smaller charger that takes less space and you can carry with you when traveling, but unless you travel more than two week, you don&#x27;t really need to take your charger with you.  Even though I haven&#x27;t yet tested to see how long this Precision 1000 brush lasts off the charger, my previous model (Triumph) lasted nearly three weeks, used by four of us in the family on our trip to China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precision 1000 appears to more of a personal brush.  If you want to have one for the entire family, you might want to buy [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package is a great deal because it comes with two brush heads, plus my favorite Crest whitening toothpaste, mouth wash, and floss.  I usually use a floss pick, so the floss thread is not quite useful for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to package everything (well, almost everything) needed for dental care in a single package. It includes an Oral-B powered toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss. I&#x27;ll cover each separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B 1000 - I have owned several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years, both basic models as well as their more advanced models. I find the 1000 series offers the best value by far. It doesn&#x27;t have any of the bells and whistles as the more advanced (and much more expensive) models such as a separate display unit and multiple brushing modes, but it gets the job done and does it well. It&#x27;s compact, easy to take along for travel, and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve also used the Sonicare line of powered brushes, Oral-B is my favorite brand by far. I find it cleans my teeth better and the replacement heads (of which there are a variety to select from) are less expensive. My favorite heads are the Floss Action and the Extra Soft (not included in this kit - must be purchased separately). The heads in this kit (two are included - the Precision Clean and the Deep Sweep) are also good, but for my needs, not as effective as other head styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste - I didn&#x27;t care for the Crest toothpaste but that&#x27;s due to the fact that I need to use a sensitive formulation. Other types, such as this, contribute to tooth pain for me. I didn&#x27;t detract from the rating due to this since that&#x27;s not a fault of the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash - classic Scope. About as classic as you can get. Simple, tastes good, works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss - my usual brand is the Oral-B regular Glide so it was interesting to compare it with this version (the \\&quot;Pro-Health\\&quot;). The Pro-Health seems to be thicker and more durable than the regular, but I can&#x27;t say that it cleaned any better. Any version of Glide is, in my opinion, far better than any other floss if you have tightly spaced teeth. It gets between my teeth far more easily and comfortably than any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag. Highly recommend!br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> What great bag of goodies! This would make a great gift for that person who you have no idea what to buy for! Who doesn&#x27;t brush their teeth? I can&#x27;t think of anyone that this kit wouldn&#x27;t make a great gift for. It comes in a sturdy bag and it&#x27;s full of goodies.&lt;br /&gt;Included are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢The Crest + Oral-B Daily Clean Kit includes: Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with 2 brush head refills (1 Precision Clean and 1 Deep Sweep), Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste 4.4oz, Scope Original Mint Rinse Classic 250mL and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss 15m&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is amazing. My teeth have never felt so clean. Love this kit. Can&#x27;t recommend  it enough!</li>
            <li> I love that The charger is easy to travel with, its tiny when detached.  The case fits two types of brushes but none can be attached to the machine itself.  I have bridgework, a implant, a few rootcannels, and many other things  and I love oral b brushes.  My dentist usually recommends the phillips, which is okay but these oral b brushes seem to have better reviews so I went and asked if I can get a oral b - he said yes, he only suggested a phillips cause thats what he had a coupon for and handed me the coupon for.  This brush helped me keep the area around where I needed a implant clean,  it also has the timer so I know how long to brush and where.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It comes with mouthwash, toothpaste, and floss, in addition to the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s a bundled product. It includes everything a person should use to when brushing. Having said that, if you&#x27;re not a Crest product user, then this bundle is probably not for you, since you could get an electric toothbrush alone for a less expensive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to add another product it would be a tongue scraper, but that&#x27;s not a requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the brush head. This is one that I could get my daughters to use. The electric toothbrushes with the dual heads is difficult to use if you have a smaller mouth. This one can be used by practically anyone. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the power behind the brush, I&#x27;d give this a solid 7. I&#x27;ve had to go back and re-brush my teeth after using this, when that&#x27;s not something I feel the need to do when i use a toothbrush with the dual brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with extra brush heads, which I love. There&#x27;s nothing like buying a product and then having to pay a good amount of money for the 1st refill. Crest/Oral-B - I appreciate this.</li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Cleaning kit is a very good product.  Everyone knows that keeping your teeth clean and your mouth fresh requires a three pronged approach - brushing for 2 minutes twice a day, flossing and using a good mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest + Oral-B Daily Clean Kit includes: Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush with 2 brush head refills (1 Precision Clean and 1 Deep Sweep), Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Minty Fresh Striped Toothpaste 4.4oz, Scope Original Mint Rinse Classic 250mL and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss 15m&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Professional 1000 toothbrush does a very good job. The specially designed professional head makes it easy to get food debris out of all the \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot;.  It has a four quadrant timing mechanism that lets you get your 2 minutes of brushing time - using it guarantees equal time on all 4 quadrants.  A very good feature is the different settings - there is a sensitive tooth setting, for example, that works very well if you have an implant - that is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product with the Glide floss, Crest complete toothpaste and the Scope Original mouth rinse will guarantee you clean teeth and fresh breath and an overall benefit in terms of mouth care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been scratching my head trying to figure out why this &amp;#34;Professional Daily Clean Kit&amp;#34; even exists.  All I can come up with is that this the ideal present for Dentists to give away as birthday presents.  No? Well, moving on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is a frills-free version of Oral-Bs more expensive powered brushes.  It won&#x27;t tell you that you&#x27;ve been brushing for one minute, so move along to another area of your mouth.  It won&#x27;t spell out how much battery life is left.  However, it will clean your teeth and it will do it WELL.  I was seriously impressed with this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, a tip of the hat has to go to the toothpaste as well.  A brush is good, but the paste can make it awesome and these two go together like Nutella &amp; bananas.  (bad simile... sorry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss is not my favorite but the mouthwash is good.  No nasty burning sensation with the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if I were a dentist and needed a present for my nephew&#x27;s birthday, I&#x27;d consider this a healthy option.</li>
            <li> Well we all do because dental hygiene is very important. When I brush my teeth with the Oral-B Professional toothbrush I do feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s chair. My teeth feel squeaky clean with the assistance of Crest toothpaste with Scope after brushing with Oral-B. The toothbrush gets into the hard to reach places and in between my teeth. The toothbrush&#x27;s charge lasts about a week. I brush my teeth twice a day. I was impressed that the charge lasted as long as it did. The battery indicator flashes RED when the battery get low. You can&#x27;t miss it with the constant flashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a kit that everyone should have in their home. A great way to keep your teeth clean and healthy between cleanings.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic electric, rechargable toothbrush. It really does mimic the clean feeling I get after getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office. The toothbrush itself is easy to hold and handle and I love that this set comes with a replacement head as well. My only word of caution would be to not turn it on until you have it to your mouth. I inadvertently flung the toothpaste right off the toothbrush by turning it on too soon (it&#x27;s got a pretty powerful spin to it). The toothbrush comes with a charger, but I&#x27;ve found that one charge can easily last me about two weeks. I really like all of the added bonuses in the bag as well. The toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss pretty much cover all of your dental hygiene needs. This is a great set. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> I got this kit for my wife and she really likes it.  The Oral-B Toothbrush is very effective in cleaning her teeth and she says it makes her entire mouth feel clean and refreshed.  She recently had her teeth professionally cleaned as part of her regular oral hygiene program and this kit helps to maintain a plaque free mouth between visits to the dentist. The Oral-B Precision Clean 1000 toothbrush in this kit is not only keeping her teeth plaque free, it stimulates her gums and she says her mouth feels refreshed and clean and her teeth feel smooth.  I joke with her that the only way she could get cleaner teeth is if she got dentures and shined them up every night while sitting at the kitchen table.... that didn&#x27;t seem to be an option for her.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool and convenient way to upgrade a toothbrush.  I am considering it giftable.  This set is a tote packed with one of my FAVORITE toothbrushes, the Oral B 1000.  My dentist has actually recommended the Oral B electric toothbrushes to me.  Your teeth feel so clean, you tend to smile more.  But the genius of this set is that it comes with a replacement head.  This is a huge convenience to me, and the way I want to purchase toothbrushes going forward.  Plus there are other goodies, toothpaste, floss, mouthwashâ€”which makes this set feel like a super value although itâ€™s lower than Iâ€™ve historically paid for tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only compliant on this brush has always been charge time; the charge lasts for several days but not more.  Be prepared to constantly keep this charging and to take the charging station with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral B Clean Kit is nice, but a bit on the costly side. The power brush works well, producing adequate power and the The Crest Complete toothpaste has a nice, fresh flavor.  The Scope mouthwash is nice and the floss is strong and easy to use due to its flat construction. Ultimately, you probably achieve no better results using a power brush unless it induces you to use it longer or if the user has limited or impaired mobility which prevents or hinders using a traditional &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I start using a power tooth brush but not one of the relatively inexpensive ones you can find at any discount store. No, she recommended a high quality one like the Oral-B toothbrush included in this set that I received in exchange for a fair review from Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could immediately see and feel the difference between this toothbrush and an ordinary (non-electric) toothbrush. My teeth seemed more polished and they felt cleaner. Also when brushing my teeth I could feel more food particles being freed from between my teeth. I know this is not the point, but I hardly feel the need to floss after using this tooth brush. I would have to say that it is well worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also contains floss, Crest toothpaste with Scope, and Scope mouthwash. These are all quality products and well worth buying, but the Oral-B power toothbrush is what really makes the package worthwhile. I am convinced that high quality power toothbrush is a &amp;#34;smile-worthy&amp;#34; investment.</li>
            <li> This kit really packs a dental cleaning punch. The toothpaste provides a solid scrub while also leaving behind a pleasant aftertaste and no tasty staining. The dental floss and mouthwash are also lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the major selling point for this kit is the Oral-B toothbrush, and it is a knock-out -- particularly with the back and forth cleaning head. I have used numerous automatic toothbrushes with the circular action, but this lateral movement really makes me feel like I get deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a dental bar behind my bottom center back teeth to keep the, straight -- it is really a permanent retainer. I have these little floss loops that thread floss through for me to clean, but I don&#x27;t use them all the time and try to hit the area good with my multiple times a day brushing. This head&#x27;s scrubbing action coupled with its speed make it a killer option for cleaning that area. I love it for reaching back there and keeping me tidy and build-up free in-between flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit seems to keep a charge really well. I use it almost every day (I still use a manual brush at times) and have used it for at least 10 days this last time without it needing plugged in -- a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also comes with a standard round head. I haven&#x27;t tested it yet, but it attaches with the same snapping action as the lateral ahead. Each head comes with a tiny ring that provides a cushioned buffer between the head and the unit base.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is like having your personal dentist right there at home. Every brush is now a perfectly clean, mouth-tingling fresh experience. I absolutely love it and probably will never be able to go back to regular brushing. As a side note, I was a very heavy brusher and was inadvertently brushing away my gums from brushing too hard. Now, that is not an issue since simply gliding this brush over my teeth gets them cleaning than my hard brushing ever did. If you want to feel good about your mouth, breath, and smile, definitely consider getting one of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an important aside, the most important thing to consider when buying an electric toothbrush is the cost of replacement heads. Refills for this brush run about $6 apiece.</li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-Professional Daily Clean Kit has an electric toothbrush (1000 model) plus toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag.  There are two brush heads included, one that spins and one that goes back-and-forth.  (I like the spinning head the best.)  This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts.  At least when new, the battery will last for a full week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.  There is a red LED that flashes when power is low and a green LED that flashes while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush tips change easily but don&#x27;t come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users.  The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip.  It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.  I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush.  I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing.  This would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes;  it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.  Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  The brush will stop if you apply too much pressure, which is useful.</li>
            <li> This is a single person complete set designed as a starter set for the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several pros: no batteries, countertop charger, full set of brushing supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons?  The tote bag isn&#x27;t worth much (why would I want a tote bag that says Crest?), and the price on this set is really high.  I would expect this to cost under $50.  It&#x27;s sleek and classy, but still, way over the mark in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, this is not a waterpick.  There is no water to deal with...a nice change from the &#x27;70s when everyone had waterpiks spraying around.  But, it&#x27;s not the neatest thing to use...you get toothpaste sprayed around the room if you aren&#x27;t careful.  The brushing performance is fantastic...you get a real feel clean.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom counter, so there is little space for extra gadgets.  This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, as the base is relatively small.  It fits easily in the corner of my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took over 8 hours to fully charge it the first time, but once it is charged, you can leave it resting on the charger when you aren&#x27;t using it.  I love the small brush attachment, because I have a small mouth, and the bigger attachments don&#x27;t work as well for me.  I have used a Sonic Care in the past, and I didn&#x27;t care for the size of the brush and the charger was really big.  The Sonic Care tickled my mouth and if I barely pulled it out of my mouth, toothpaste sprayed all over my mirror.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this one, because the brush is small and easier to maneuver.  The only thing I think it&#x27;s missing is a toothbrush cover for the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every 30 seconds, it beeps so you can change locations.  I brush the top outside, when it beeps, I switch to the top inside, etc.  It turns off when it is finished.  I like how it stops if you are brushing too hard.  This is very helpful, as I tend to do that.  I just recently had gum graft surgery for recession, and I am now very aware of how hard I am brushing now, so that I don&#x27;t destroy my gums again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy larger brush attachments for this, and it comes with one.  I haven&#x27;t used that one, as I prefer the size of the smaller one.  This whole package would be a great gift for someone who needs an electric toothbrush.  The bag is nice, and the products that are included are a nice, added bonus.</li>
            <li> I got this kit within a week of getting 5 fillings in cavities caused by a diet heavy in diet soda and chocolate.  For years my father and brother had tried to sell me on an electric toothbrush, and I held off because I was fine with my plain old nonelectric brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presentation:  For a gift bag, you want some excitement of opening the bag.  This had that.  The gift bag with items arranged in it comes in a gift bag sized box.  A cardboard shaped insert in the top of the box keeps things from sliding around.  I opened the box, removed the cardboard plug, and saw everything at the same time.  It was like, wow, I got so much stuff.  Dental care items are not really all that exciting, but seeing five things (brush, extra brush head, floss, mouth wash, toothpaste) that I would have to buy anyway, I was like \\&quot;Wow, so much stuff.\\&quot;  So, if you gifted someone this by mail, they would probably feel like \\&quot;Wow, so much stuff\\&quot; when they open it. (Although you really should make sure they want an electric toothbrush first, because 5 years ago I would have been angry and would vastly have preferred the money to a toothbrush gift, so I&#x27;m glad my father never bought me an electric toothbrush.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric toothbrush experience:  I had never used an electric toothbrush before.  When you go to the dentist for an annual cleaning, the dentist uses gritty paste and an electric brush that spins, before going on to use metal picks to check for cavities between teeth.  This brush feels like that cleaning tool.&lt;br /&gt;The pros are: My teeth feel cleaner after brushing with the electric brush than with my traditional nonelectric brush.  I can still take the electric brush into the shower!  I have to remember to move it from the charger into the shower, and then back to charger.  I can&#x27;t just leave it in the shower like a plain old nonelectric, but I still get my shower clean teeth.  I used it in the shower every day for a week, and nothing went wrong.  The part where thebrush goes into the charger is just a plastic hole in the brush that fits over a plastic knob on the charging base.  There is no metal and no place where I can see electricity.  I think it charges with some kind of magnetic mechanism.  In any case, there is no part of the toothbrush that looks like you definitely would not want water to get there.  I haven&#x27;t submerged it, but I did rinse the entire brush, and nothing went wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;The cons are:  The cleaning head of the brush is small.  It is only about the size of a dime.  For brushing my tongue, I don&#x27;t want a spinning head, and want just a plain old brush.  So, I&#x27;ve been turning this toothbrush off and then using it like a traditional nonelectric brush.  Because the head is so small, I just don&#x27;t feel my tongue gets as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extras:  toothpaste, mouth wash, floss, and extra brush head:  The toothbrush alone is much cheaper than the kit, so what you pay extra for with the gift bag option is the gift bag and the extras.  I didn&#x27;t use the toothpaste.  I have sensitive teeth and use Sensodyne.  The dental floss is Glide, which is a good quality floss.  I have the problem of some flosses getting cut up or frayed on my teeth when I floss, but Glide works great for me.  The mouthwash, Scope, is also really good.  It&#x27;s has a milder aftertaste than listerine, and is nonobtrusive as far as mouthwashes go.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric tooth brush with oral health kit! The Kit comes with:&lt;br /&gt;*Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Tooth Brush&lt;br /&gt;*Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;*Scope Original Mouth Wash&lt;br /&gt;*Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Dental Floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 is an excellent electric tooth brush. Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones. Personally speaking, I prefer rounded head than the elongated head. With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head). It also has automatic timer built in: It is programmed for 2 mins total, and 2 mins are divided into 4 (30sec) durations. Each duration covering 1/4 of your teeth. This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others. The brush is waterproof and rechargeable. And it is easy to hold being slim. It is also MADE IN GERMANY. The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;2. It cleans well. As stated, it is superior than manual brushing. I always feel the smoothness of my teeth all around, even the wisdom teeth that is hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;3. The kit comes with toothpaste, floss, and a mouthwash. So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene. I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all. They are clearly a good products that can help your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price might be little prohibitive for someone who does not need all the stuff. If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a long time to charge the brush. To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours. But this is minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric brush!Electric brush!</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush for the past 5 years, replacing the brush head when needed.  At times I wasn&#x27;t happy and would do my teeth a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this Oral-B toothbrush and there is no comparison!  It just works better and my teeth just feel cleaner!  I like the fact it alerts me to change quadrants in my mouth, especially if I am zoning and/or listening to the news on tv - lol!  I never thought I would get excited over using a certain kind of rechargeable toothbrush, but I must say, I am over this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t need the extras that come with this kit because I already have them, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to add to the inventory.  The toothbrush would have been enough for me, BUT I think this is a terrific gift idea to give to someone just learning how to really care for their teeth.  I mean, I didn&#x27;t use floss for years because no one explained to me why it was important to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, depending on the circumstances, this is a great gift idea for just about anyone, even a new graduate of a dental hygienist school - maybe with a gift card tucked inside for some shopping as well :)</li>
            <li> I am a pretty die-hard Sonicare fan.  I have tried the Oral-B before, but wasn&#x27;t really thrilled by it.  I tried this kit out to give the Oral-B another shot.  So hold on a minute, I got something in this bag that brought it all to a screeching halt.  In this kit is a new Oral-B brush called the \\&quot;deep sweep\\&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t round, it is a traditional toothbrush shape, but does amazing things!  It cleans more like the Sonicare, without all of that crazy spinning of the round brush (which was also included in this kit).  It is quiet, which is a plus as some people have a problem with all of the noise of some electric toothbrushes.  The main issue I have with the regular round Oral-B brush, is when I try to get around the front of my mouth, the brush is outside of my mouth without my lips covering it to keep it from splattering, and it always did.  With this shape of brush head, it works much better, plus since there is no spinning, there&#x27;s not as much toothpaste and spit flying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you are interested in the other items included in this kit, even though as I already told you too much about, to me the big news is the Deep Sweep brush!  All of the products in this kit are regular sized, they are: A tube of Crest toothpaste, Glide Pro Health dental floss, Scope mouthwash, a regular round Oral-B brush head, an Oral-B electric toothbrush with charger, of course the Deep Sweep head, and a cute little bag to put your lunch in sometime.  The only thing you might feel is missing, is a brush cover for your toothbrush.  I just put a travel toothbrush cover, the one-piece kind that you shove over a manual toothbrush.  Easily found here on Amazon.com or at the drugstore.  The other Oral-B brush I have had a little tray with a lid to store the different brushes for different members of the family, this one didn&#x27;t come with that.  This would be a lovely gift for anybody, at least, I would be thrilled to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:  The deep sweep brush will work on most other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  On the package it says that it will not fit these Oral-B electric bases:  Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Puslonic, and CrossAction Power.l work on most other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  On the package it says that it will not fit these Oral-B electric bases:  Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Puslonic, and CrossAction Power.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Oral B toothbrushes and have been using them for a long time.  The claims about Oral B electric toothbrushes cleaning your teeth so many times more than a regular toothbrush are all true.  My dentist even noticed that my teeth were much cleaner after I stared using them.  I have always thought giving an Oral B toothbrush to someone you like (so they can enjoy such a great product too) is a great idea; and now with this package it is easy to do that.  Although you can buy everything in this set separately, it is convenient to have it all in one package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B electric toothbrushes last several years, depending on how much it is used (I have had 3 die on me with enough use that I always felt like I got my monies worth).  As the toothbrush heads are detachable, it is possible to have several people use the same toothbrush base, as long as you are willing to share the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few of the toothbrushes in the Oral-B Professional Precision line.  The higher the number of the series, the more options it has.  The Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric Toothbrush is the most basic of the Professional Precision line, but is far greater than a regular brush or even one of the $30 Oral B electric brushes that you will not regret getting one.  I have used the regular mode the most often so using this brush or the one that costs much more work exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the batteries get low it doesnâ€™t clean as well so make sure to watch for that.  The replacement brushes arenâ€™t cheap, but if you look around there are deals or coupons on them which help reduce their cost.  There are also several types of toothbrush heads, so you are bound to find one that will be your favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had such great experience with the Oral B Professional Precision line, I wouldnâ€™t even consider being a toothbrush from another company.</li>
