            <li>Their shampoo and conditioner is just as good.</li>
            <li>I loved the results from the color they chose instead of the one picked.</li>
            <li>I just tried this and loved it.</li>
            <li>I used to spend almost $200.00 to have my hair look this good, never again it&#x27;s eSalon from now on.</li>

            <li>Your prices are fantastic and make it affordable to use all of your wonderful products.</li>
            <li>My color arrived and when I had finished applying it, it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>and she asked what colour i had used as she thought it was really good.</li>
            <li>The gray coverage has been great and the color is nice too.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be skipping the salon from now on; for a fraction of the price, I can have gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>My hair color looked every bit as good as when I paid 3x&#x27;s the amount plus a tip.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>hair never looked and felt so good.</li>
            <li>My hair has NEVER looked this good.  </li>
            <li>My air is shiny and in good condition.</li>
            <li>and I did not get good customer service at all.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the personalization on the bottles.</li>
            <li>As good as salon at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I just used eSalon&#x27;s hair coloring product and I loved it.</li>
            <li>and I loved those products as well.</li>
            <li>Without question these products are superior to store bought...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really good luck with that.  </li>
            <li>No mess, no fuss, just wonderful color, and great, shinning hair!</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the kit which makes it very easy for my sister and I to have a ladies night in (although we save the wine until after we do our hair :) ).</li>
            <li>All so glad to help you, the service is so good also!</li>
            <li>What more can a girl ask - keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>When I got my order, they had lightened my order &amp; informed me of special instructions how to use it for the best results.</li>
            <li>Not an easy thing to match a redhead!!</li>
            <li>Tinted Love works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>So, it seemed, my choices were beautiful results with a hefty price tag or iffy results that were more affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love what this hair color did for me, I feel beautiful again.  </li>
            <li>My results were great and the process was easy!  </li>
            <li>My kit arrived in incredible packaging with easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>Perfect coloring; much more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; and healthy looking than store-sold box brands.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how quickly it was delivered and the communication I received before the product was even shipped.</li>
            <li>Super happy!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!</li>

            <li>I got my hair colored, but it&#x27;s more that I look good.  </li>
            <li>I always do my own hair coloring with the over-the-counter hair color</li>
            <li>I had never dyed my own hair before, always had it done at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Color - Nice</li>
            <li>They were so nice and had no problems with my request.</li>
            <li>The color was just alittle lighter which is good but the most amazing thing that I can not get over is the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much; this is a wonderful service and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though eSalon gives you a really nice brush, I chose to put the color on using the applicator bottle.</li>
            <li>The auto shipments are nice and they keep up with your whites if you have that issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair since forever.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled and my husband loves it also.</li>
            <li>then you too can follow the made just for you instructions in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>My husband even said he liked it.</li>
            <li>I was firstly impressed by how much product there was</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Uniquely designed for the individual with wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I got the results I was hoping for, 100% gray coverage, a nice shiny outcome &amp; the color was spot on.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this product if you have had some experience dying your own hair.</li>
            <li>It took a few times for me to get the perfect color, but I&#x27;ve got it now and it looks spectacular!!!  </li>
            <li>Recommend to everyone I meet who colors their own hair.</li>
            <li>I have never done my own hair color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so thrilled at the results.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the colour and my hair is in lovely condition.  </li>
            <li>like the fact that they custom make the color you decide upon from the many they provide that would be a good look for you.</li>
            <li>Thanks for great service and a great product.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best at home hair color EVER!!!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner sample was also a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was nice to have \\&quot;total\\&quot; instructions instead of trying to guess the \\&quot;timing\\&quot; of the drug store box brand.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never colored my own hair before and was concerned</li>
            <li>Loving the color.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the color that the stylists choose for me based on my profile.  </li>
            <li>feel like I am in good hands with eSalon and love the color they customized for me.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, but those two points were the best parts of this service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for years.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled to have found eSalon.  </li>
            <li>They sent a nice reply</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that the service and product was personalized.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging,</li>
            <li>So much so my husband noticed and loved it!!!</li>
            <li>but in the end I just kind of winged it</li>
            <li>so nice that I stop by mirrors just to look at it and say &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Then I followed the directions exactly as written, and even though the color looked a lot darker on my head, when I rinsed it out, I was absolutely thrilled with the results!!  </li>
            <li>They guide you to the color of your choice, and for me that was one that provided amazing gray coverage, and on top of all that E-Salon provided exceptional customer service from beginning to end.</li>
            <li>fantastic, I am really happy with the color, the procedure was very easy to follow</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage even over the copper colour my hair was and my greys, love the colour exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>With great trepidation I decided to do a full colour on my hair with my customised hair product from eSalon&#x27;s advice and instructions.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s perfect and I would recommend this to anyone who is keen to try something new.  </li>
            <li>my new best friend</li>
            <li>I really liked being able to create my own hair color with the help of a stylist.</li>
            <li>loved that fact that this process is easy for me, my hair and my pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the color was salon-quality, it provides good gray coverage and the applicator brush made it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I was very pleasantly surprised by the easy of application, great coverage of gray and my hair came out the best I&#x27;ve seen since coloring it many years now.</li>
            <li>Easy application, loved the gloves.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very easy change.  </li>
            <li>so I know what my hair is supposed to feel like and smell like, and after I put it on, it is SO VERY strong</li>
            <li>Instructions are very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>The directions are thorough and it is all very easy.  </li>
            <li>sure the more I do it, the easier it will get!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>The color is perfect and it has covered the gray completely!</li>
            <li>Most fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with the outcome!</li>
            <li>, I love the way my hair looks and feels, I love the shine and the value!</li>

            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very happy with these guys.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to just have it arrive in your mailbox, and be able to color when and where you want.</li>
            <li>The Customer Service is probably by far the greatest part though.</li>
            <li>I really liked one by L&#x27;Oreal but it did not cover my gray roots when I started to get mostly gray.</li>
            <li>the product is even more amazing....</li>
            <li>Incredibly soft hair, perfect color match to my existing color!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair color I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Gray completely covered and color was perfect</li>
            <li>I have had a wonderful experience with this product and all the things in the package to do a professional job on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable and the color is great!</li>
            <li>Loved the product and how silky smooth my hair was after the treatment.  </li>
            <li>eSalon staff fixed it and it is PERFECT!!</li>
            <li>It is really nice &amp; so much better than the drug store Sally products.  </li>
            <li>I was quite happily surprised at the perfect match, with out seeing my hair in person.  </li>
            <li>Esalon products are by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>the color itself while not the exact color i was going for was still a nice color and everything worked perfectly to my expectations otherwise, and with a quick email asking for a reformulation on my color</li>
            <li>Easy, fast and perfect color!</li>
            <li>The website is great and makes choosing the right color foolproof...</li>
            <li>My hair (very fine and curly with a lot of silver)</li>
            <li>Easy customer service, you can up load a picture of yourself and tell them all of your preferences, and they listen!</li>
            <li>This process is so easy!</li>
            <li>It was so easy!  </li>
            <li>This was so easy!</li>

            <li>Love, Love, Love all of their products!</li>
            <li>I love Love LOVE my color!  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li>the 2nd time was perfect and I am so glad that they worked with me!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Even hubby says it looks good (and that rarely occurs)!</li>
            <li>The color is so beautiful and natural looking, and my hair feels tremendous!!!  </li>
            <li>And by the way..I really don&#x27;t look incredible most days.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten okay results at home, which was much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I asked my regular hair stylist what she thought (and to be honest) and she said it was perfect and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  </li>
            <li>However,  I loved the personalization, quality, price, and most importantly, the way my hair turned out.</li>
            <li>Finding products that work best for my hair has been a major chore over the course of my 63 years of living.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to do and love the color!</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic, long-lasting, covers gray, and very healthy to my hair.</li>
            <li>the color is unique,  the product leaves hair feeling healthy, smells good and the packaging convinced me that a personalized service was what I was getting.  </li>
            <li>I love the colour, the shine, it covered the few greys that I have, but the best part is how great my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>Every kit comes with everything you will need -- shampoo, conditioner, gloves, a stain guard, and very detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, the kit contains everything you need and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I came across eSalon through Social Media and I thought their marketing presentation was impressive and decided to give it a try, so I place an online order.  </li>
            <li>Once I received my color, it was easy to apply and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It covers the gray so effectively and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color and it was easy.</li>
            <li>The color and developer were customized as expected, but the thing that impressed me most was the customized instruction pamphlet!</li>
            <li>the product arrived nicely packaged,  easy to use,  no nasty smell or burning of scalp like the brand names,  love the fact that it included a barrier product and a stain remover,</li>
            <li>Hair color us great, just like my hair and nice and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful medium brown with soft highlights!!</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>love the pictures.</li>
            <li>I love the product and love my color.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair feels wonderfully healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many hair color products - none better than this.  </li>
            <li>About their customer service: Top Notch.</li>
            <li>After I received my next order I am VERY pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li>eSalon is a fabulous product!  </li>

            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the color.  </li>

            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>so I was sure it would cover all of my hair.  </li>

            <li>Even though I eventually stumbled on a color that was okay, it was just that &#x27;okay.&#x27;</li>
            <li>The 5 stars can be, and many times are, faked.  </li>
            <li>And, my hair feels lovely, so</li>
            <li>Pleased all around and am on the auto-ship program for continued usage.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the color.</li>
            <li>love these guys.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>Reds are tricky, and they mixed my formula perfectly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color, it doesn&#x27;t look like box dye, I have color and movement.</li>
            <li>I love that there are two bottles.  </li>
            <li>you eSalon&amp;#34; for creating such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my hair after this product.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, only to be endorsed by  the hairstylist who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>How much better than that</li>
            <li>extra gloves and the stain remover are niceties that just added the perfect touch of salon details as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have received color 3 times and love the color and coverage.  </li>
            <li>Ok ...</li>
            <li>It looked ok to me.  </li>
            <li>This experience could not have turned out better.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the product, product packaging, shipping packaging and marketing are really top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found my favorite color just yet, but it&#x27;s not for lack of trying on the part of the eSalon team.</li>

            <li>I have decided on changing a couple of color applications to suit the seasons and love what is sent to me.</li>
            <li>I love that they take the time to let you choose  your skin tone, eye color, length of hair.</li>

            <li>I love everything about it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love love E-salon.  </li>
            <li>I would like to tell more people to try these products.</li>
            <li>They dont do anything and don&#x27;t really even smell that great.  </li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>not only saved lots of money by not having to pay beauty parlor price and tip , but the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the way my hair looks and the color</li>
            <li>hair has never looked or felt better, if I want to tweak my color a bit for summer or winter</li>

            <li>I love the convenience and the accessories sent to help you.</li>

            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>The end result -FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>If this is not going to perform better</li>
            <li>For $25 the product should work more than 50% of time.  </li>
            <li>The service is outstanding, but that does not make my hair look better.  </li>
            <li>Well if I do not buy an ash colored brown, I end up looking like I have had a copper explosion on the top of my head (the gray roots).</li>
            <li>LOVE eSalon :)</li>
            <li>Love how it covers the gray,  and I get lots of complements on how it looks so &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this to many friends and coworkers.</li>
            <li>This color is superb in coverage, especially the grays.</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what my color was.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the color pack.</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for many years now.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews mention that it lasts longer than salon color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They recommended that I use a conditioning mask the day before coloring my hair to put it into better condition for the coloring process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the gorgeous color that this product provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the Tinted Love Color Enhancing Treatment.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my red hair,!</li>
            <li>So with the help of my hubby, I did my roots and was extremely pleased with the results</li>

            <li>My husband volunteered to assist me and we thoroughly enjoyed the process.</li>

            <li>More is included, not just color and shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats spending over $100 at my salon.</li>
            <li>The color, texture and shine of my hair is better than it has ever been.</li>

            <li>I ordered my hair color from Esalon and it came in a very nice packaged container in a very timely manor.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much eSalon!!!!</li>
            <li>It was the EXACT color I wanted!!!</li>
            <li>Very friendly and talk by phone or email for questions and concerns.</li>
            <li>so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair either by myself or done by a professional and never has it looked this good!  </li>
            <li>Liked my first color but received an email asking if I liked it or wanted to&amp;#34; tweek&amp;#34; it some.</li>
            <li>I went for a once a year high end spa hair trim/cut and the beautician didn&#x27;t know I dye it myself and commented it looked great.  </li>
            <li>First time was a bit too bright but they adjusted once I inquired about a change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny and the grey coverage was great!</li>
            <li>For those of you into an update or a full on change in the privacy of your own home or hotel...</li>
            <li>Best coverage on my grey around my face.  </li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars except that the color was warm when I was expecting cool.</li>
            <li>I tried e-salon for the first time this week and I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful coloring- had been covering my grey hair for years with drug store brands</li>
            <li>Perfect coverage for grey resistant hair.  </li>
            <li>Btw, I never leave reviews, so this just shows how excited I am!</li>
            <li>The e-salon team did a great job of interpreting what I wanted and explaining the new how-to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my new esalon hair colour</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use, and I am extremely pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a fantastic product for an awesome price!!!</li>
            <li>This is a real review from a real first time customer who is very satisfied!</li>
            <li>That kind of support is right up there with some of my favorite</li>
            <li>Just used my new hair color and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>Without talking to me personally or seeing my hair, they sent me the most gorgeous color!</li>
            <li>I have had good results at the salon, but at a very high cost.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend  eSalon to everyone who wants superior results!!</li>
            <li>Great quality priducts and my hair is soft and managable.</li>
            <li>The color is consistent across orders, the instructions are clear, their supplies are awesome --</li>
            <li>When you sign up, you are added to auto-ship which is perfect for me because I finally found a great product and won&#x27;t go back to the shelf again!</li>
            <li>However,  with the great professional help from eSalon</li>
            <li>So if they are willing to play real safe, why do they induce the customer to try once more with a complimentary product?</li>
            <li>The lower stars are always genuine and give you a better idea of what people DON&#x27;T like about the product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny, the color gives it great dimension</li>
            <li>but as far as the match, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great product which cover grey well, lasts, and has nice tones.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied and changed my color for the first time.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy being able to switch up the color when i want to.</li>
            <li>The color was great and looks like a professional color job.</li>
            <li>Loved the whole way it was handled .</li>
            <li>I was suprised at just how good it really is.</li>
            <li>My whole experience was a good one, and my hair turned out just as I had hoed.  </li>
            <li>The eSalon product came in a great kit with clear instructions and was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t be easier, and I think it&#x27;s a superior product to what i would normally get at the grocery store!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that they could get the color so right based on questions and photos.  </li>
            <li>I had to mix my own to get the right shade and am so relieved that I can have salon-quality expertise and products delivered to me, and on a schedule</li>
            <li>I liked that I was able to upload a photo and their colorists actually looked at it and adjusted my color order to a better shade than I had selected on my own.</li>
            <li>Everything was packaged very nicely and directions were clear.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many high street brands and have liked some much more than others.</li>
            <li>They made the adjustments to my color after my first order that I was looking for and I love the color!</li>
            <li>It was true to color and the shampoo and conditioner they give you was so luscious!</li>
            <li>No dark ends and great condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never in my life would I ever use a product on my hair after reading that someone had a gob full of hair fall out!</li>
            <li>Other than that, perfect.</li>
            <li>The color is not as rich, but it lasts more than 1 to 12 days.</li>
            <li>My first color was just a bit more golden (but gorgeous) than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with their service and working me to get the color that looks best for my skin type and natural color that I still have left.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time this weekend LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>A true convert!  </li>
            <li>The color was easy to apply and the instructions were easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>This product and instructions were so easy, my husband could do it for me.  </li>
            <li>Instructions easy to follow and fool proof.</li>
            <li>Easy to choose and/or change your schedule for coloring.</li>
            <li>It was easy to order, easy to change, and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li>I was trying to decide between two colors and having the models picture to play with made it easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to do</li>
            <li>I tried eSalon using their easy online process by answering color questions.</li>
            <li>It came with easy to use instructions,  if you can follow a recipe,  </li>
            <li>Directions were easy.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this so easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone is so helpful and understanding and responds very quickly to any questions one might have.  </li>
            <li>it is easy, I do it at my convenience.</li>
            <li>They include easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and so convenient.  </li>
            <li>but it was so easy and turned out just as I wanted.</li>
            <li>Your website is easy to use to adjust timing of order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was a kick to see my name on the bottles and the easy to follow personalized directions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They make it so easy.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow, and the website provides all the information you need.  </li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>The process was easy and there was some difference but not what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Directions were easy to follow but it does help to have every thing laid out before you start.</li>
            <li>They are easy to work with and make any changes you may need.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong that I had an allergic reaction to it - rapid heartbeat and nausea.</li>
            <li>The fume was unbelievably strong to the point that sting my eyes.</li>
            <li>Most professional and talented Team.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells strong, but cover up</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li>It saves so much money, I am able to color my own hair and it looks like I went to the salon.</li>
            <li>Strong smell of ammonia; used in a ventilated bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company if you are looking for good color at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Pour the developer into the color, shake well, and apply beginning at the roots, making sure to give special attention to any parts.</li>
            <li>Two sets of gloves they gave you made it really nice; one for the first application and then one used for the rinsing and shampooing afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It covered my blonde highlights and gray hairs beautifully.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 2 stars because the color is excellent, and it colored all my gray; it&#x27;s just not worth the fumes.</li>
            <li>The first order I had was really nice</li>
            <li>; My husband (who never notices anything after 29 years) immediately noticed my hair looked nice that first time I used esalon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update one year later: The color is beautiful but destroys your hair over time.</li>
            <li>The color turned out beautifully, has been lasting, and fully covers my gray.  </li>
            <li>The best aspect is that I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about the store&#x27;s not having my particular color when I need it because it is delivered directly to my house.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, instructions are easy and color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The grey coverage is superb and the shine is amazing and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>Also, the pump of the conditioner bottle would not function (shampoo was fine).  </li>
            <li>The instructions are detailed and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m more impressed with the frou-frou than being green!  </li>
            <li>Better than a salon and much more reasonable!</li>
            <li>The products are FANTASTIC and the products are packaged to make it easy to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>The color was exactly what I wanted, my incredible amounts of gray (or glitter as I like to call it) hair was completely covered, there was a sort of pearl essence to my hair, just like the colors name proclaimed.</li>
            <li>What things got adjusted to and created for me was perfect and exactly what I was actually looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I went to my stylist today and he told me I was lucky to have hair that color!  </li>
            <li>Requested a minor change and loved the results!</li>
            <li>I am very please, love the color!  </li>
            <li>I asked for a little adjustment and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>The service is easy and user friendly.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes with some nice little extras and great packaging.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my hair feels and it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>The product is spectacular, and I&#x27;ll never use another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Shining Armor with my last order and it also is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>And after several weeks the color has not faded, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw and it still looks amazing every day, even using my own brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have asked them to &#x27;tweak&#x27; the color a few times and it&#x27;s always been done perfectly.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, especially in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li>Box hair colors in a light brown or  </li>
            <li>Bizarre.</li>
            <li>Never had such a happy outcome.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to do any guesswork to get great results, and I&#x27;ve already gotten several unsolicited compliments.</li>
            <li>How about looking fabulous and saving hours and lots of money at a salon?  </li>
            <li>I said I didn’t see that anywhere so it seems that it is very strategically place so that it isn’t noticeable, as I read everything because I have been duped by this kind of scheme before</li>
            <li>I said I didn’t see that anywhere so it seems that it is very strategically place so that it isn’t noticeable, as I read everything because I have been duped by this kind of scheme before</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product and service.</li>
            <li>Their color safe shampoo and conditioner are totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>also the condition is great at last</li>
            <li>What if the color was too light?...</li>
            <li>I use a sulfur free shampoo, so the color is not lightening.  </li>
            <li>I think if I could have told them the brand name and # from the stuff my salon uses, they would have filled it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>And something really simple that made me happy was they included two sizes of gloves.</li>
            <li>My hair was lighter at the bottom and needed to be filled before being dyed.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to trying this all over, as I enjoy reading the reviews about how shiny it makes your hair as well.</li>
            <li>I filled in the online profile questions and submitted a photo of my desired colour.</li>
            <li>My hair was so silky smooth after applying the conditioner</li>
            <li>Next kit was great.</li>
            <li>Out of time, I used it, everything I suspected was confirmed.</li>
            <li>) she told how fabulous I looked also.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how happy I finally am with color!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I filled out the profile and questionnaire and uploaded two photos-</li>
            <li>Overall, I was really happy with the kit...</li>
            <li>colour is amazing, the accessories (stain protector, stain remover, REAL latex gloves) great and the lock in shampoo and the conditionner are simply to die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>eSalon is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m a pet groomer, my name is Ana, and I run Ana Scissor Hands pet grooming, here in fantastic.</li>
            <li>the process was really simple and am so happy I found an affordable solution without having to go to the dreaded box.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the products I have purchased from e-Salon over last 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Love the golden highlights</li>
            <li>Fantastic..</li>
            <li>We bought one kit of supplies to share, and it really came in handy.</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner is light weight and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>This looks and feels fantastic, and at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>once I got in the shower and rinsed, shampooed and conditioned and dried my hair, the results were awesome.</li>
            <li>My hair color is very shiney and the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>things that are free in the package....</li>
            <li>I filled out the questionnaire and sent a picture.  </li>
            <li>I came across eSalon through nCrowd deals and thought I’d try it since it “sounded” good and supposedly professional type coloury, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I really love the color and it left my hair in really good condition.  </li>
            <li>LOVE love so much that I posted about it on my blog.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is in good condition and the creme rinse they provide leaves it silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and it was just right for my skin color.  </li>
            <li>and they get it right every time - even if they needed to talk to me to make sure they understand what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Also the color is lighter where the most gray was and does not look right.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all the people at esalon!!!</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t know what I did different, but I sure did!!  </li>
            <li>The gloves provided were very nice, but in doing the color myself, I think I will use longer gloves next time, so my forearms don&#x27;t get color on them from reaching over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also said that if I did not like the color, they would send the color I originally ordered FREE.  </li>
            <li>I must say that with eSalon my roots colored just as nicely as the rest of my hair and that was my main goal.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Loved my first color, then later requested slightly lighter for summer, and found it even more perfect!  </li>
            <li>I thought I was in for more than I bargained for, but the directions were clear and easy to follow!</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and my hair is soft, shiney and had great body.</li>
            <li>As a newly retired person, I appreciate the savings as well as the overall wonderful service and product.</li>
            <li>The customer service is very knowledgeable, nice and quick to respond.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t topically take the time to write reviews, but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Just used my first order from ESalon and really enjoyed the process.  </li>
            <li>worth it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and it is exactly what I requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I just used your products for the first time and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use this product again.</li>
            <li>I described my hair, the original color, what I wanted it to look like and sent two photos.  </li>
            <li>It is really worth it!  </li>
            <li>She could not guarantee that I would be satisfied as in the first time</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it and followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li>Surprised and very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I saw this company and was excited that my color could be delivered to my door anytime</li>
            <li>esalon has a great product that covers the grey &amp; keeps it covered..</li>
            <li>Thank you I am so excited about my&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful</li>
            <li>I really like this product! :)</li>
            <li>but I will check with a representative from eSalon first:-)  </li>
            <li>My wife was advised to change the colour she had originally selected, and the results were beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping they would come out with something unique, maybe something i had never tried before.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with all the products esalon offers.  </li>
            <li>A very true color they matched just right .  </li>
            <li>Well, I went from light blonde to a good match for my cherry wood furniture.</li>
            <li>You get 2 pairs of gloves, a packet of color safe shampoo to wash excess dye from your hair and a packet of color safe conditioner which leaves your hair soft like in the salons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for many years and have used drugstore brands, mixed my own at wholesale beauty supply outlets, and had my stylist color it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this service - especially the options to choose how frequently you want to recolor.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m a natural red hair, and the color was perfect, covered my grays, and gave my hair the beutiful tone it always had.</li>
            <li>I discovered while applying the Feelin Smoothie product to my hair, that it is great for dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li>Be aware that when you first order you will be signed up for automatic delivery and make sure you upload a good picture in natural light so that they can formulate the your color want.</li>
            <li>and I had to clean up around me once I was done.  </li>
            <li>After a year with esalon, I&#x27;ll never go back to drugstore hair color - the product is worth every penny, and the service is great.</li>
            <li>We had so much fun playing hair salon together, and the instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Four days later and counting, my hair is soooo soft and gorgeous!!  </li>
            <li>well all the items to do my hair were so neatly and perfectly packaged, I was quite surprised for the low introductory price I paid.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, leaves your hair soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I use the True Blue once a week to keep my hair light and bright.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it!</li>
            <li>I very rarely write reviews, but felt this one definitely is worthy of one.</li>
            <li>However, it was easy to apply and the color is fabulous, just exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I filled out the questionnaire and submitted a photo; the consultant tweeked my color selection slightly from what I had stated in the questionnaire and it turned out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other mix your own products before, but this stuff really is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product was mild to my scalp, covers my grays and left an awesome natural looking hue.</li>
            <li>The color, the step by step directions just for me, the way the shampoo and conditioner smelled made me eel special.</li>
            <li>Why eSalon added it to my specially formulated hair color is beyond me.</li>
            <li>boy, were they right!</li>
            <li>They were absolutely right!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll get it right!</li>
            <li>they always get it exactly right!</li>
            <li>Well, you guys got it soooo right!</li>
            <li>They ship it right to your door!  </li>
            <li>just want to let you know that I LOVE MY NEW COLOR!!</li>
            <li>process of creating a profile and choosing our colour was fun and easy, and the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>tell everyone where my terrific color comes from and how easy it is to use eSalon and have it delivered right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep up the good products and services you provide.</li>
            <li>I have experienced very little fading and was able to lengthen the time between coloring as a result.</li>
            <li>Tried eSalon for the first time last week and I am absolutely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I loved the consistency of the formula after it was mixed, not too goopy and not too runny.  </li>
            <li>Being able to start with the questionnaire and sending off a photo of my hair really eased my fears.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a good product and left my hair silky, but for the smell.</li>
            <li>Even though the coloring process is a pain, but the price point of this product is good enough for me to order again.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to the eSalon team xx</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Color, Shampoo n conditioner are great quality n left my hair soft n healthy.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t look good with any red tones...</li>
            <li>but then if I go for ash to prevent any red, it doesn&#x27;t look good either.</li>
            <li>Gentle on hair and color much more</li>
            <li>kiss your colorist good by, then you will have extra cash for doing mani- pedi and look like a goddess !</li>
            <li>I am delighted and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to OTC hair color products</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>As a result I rinsed it four times x 20 minutes each time in my kitchen sink with the water spraying at full force.</li>
            <li>I loved the color, the personal service, and the follow up.  </li>
            <li>We are now full time RVers , so I don&#x27;t have a salon anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have never found a hair color so true to my own color and able to cover the stubborn grey hairs!</li>
            <li>This was by far the best color I&#x27;ve had in a long time!</li>
            <li>I have taken up doing my own manicures and wanted to do my own hair, because I work full time and have a grandbaby on the way - less appointments means happier me.</li>
            <li>eSalon&#x27;s color is easy to apply and I love the fact that the stain resistant product to apply near the hairline is provided.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use (just follow the instructions or go to the website for extra information) and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Everything is included in your order to make it easy and give you confidence enough to do your own coloring.  </li>
            <li>that goes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Surprisingly, they did call me back quite quickly and said that when I purchased, there was a notification at Check Out, AND that by checking out, I was agreeing to this.</li>
            <li>that goes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Surprisingly, they did call me back quite quickly and said that when I purchased, there was a notification at Check Out, AND that by checking out, I was agreeing to this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company and they are willing to go the extra mile to make sure that you&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li>First it is extremely strong of chemicals and ammonia, which I do not use for my hair</li>
            <li>instructions were easy to follow, and not nearly as complicated as some others here have said.</li>
            <li>The step by step directions were easy to follow and the color turned out exactly how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>Color is exactly what they say it will be and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the new color!</li>
            <li>After receiving it I was pleased but wanted more red.</li>
            <li>My sister thinks it is more vibrant than the color I was using.</li>
            <li>I sent pictures of myself and a description of my hair and desired color on the website and quickly received a package with hair color, a brush, stain preventer, stain remover (which I didn&#x27;t need), shampoo and conditioner, and two pairs of gloves.</li>
            <li>They have a loyal customer in me now.</li>
            <li>The color arrived quickly, including a stain blocker to rub on your skin at the hairline to keep the color from - you guessed it - staining my skin, a stain remover to remove any staining.</li>
            <li>I took quickly on my cell phone when I placed an order for what color I thought I would want.  </li>
            <li>I am giving up my hairdresser for overall color - and am able to save money and feel I am getting a better quality of product.</li>
            <li>I also love their additional products which help the color to last longer (the Devoted Hue Color enhancing mask and the Tinted Love Color Enhancing Treatment).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the best job at covering the gray roots, but it is enough of a mask that it gets me through until I can do a regular color.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal client of E-Salon and saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li>When I ordered the product esalon pulled me back on the color to one color lighter which I was glad they did because the color they sent was more my color.  </li>
            <li>To sum it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>and even when it was close the colour faded so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am not yet sure how the &#x27;tinted love&#x27; product will maintain the colour as I have only used it once.</li>
            <li>The kit arrived quickly; it was well packaged and was personalized with my name, color, etc..</li>
            <li>also read in many reviews that the colorists from the company helped many customers to pick out their color and took the extra effort.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;d find an over-the-counter option, it would quickly be discontinued...or would ravage my hair.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m very happy to say I am turning the auto shipment back on, possibly buying the shampoo and conditioner which felt like a million bucks!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed how shiny the color is and not a color i would normally pick dark brown</li>
            <li>The dialogue the stylist opened when I wrote and wondered if going lighter may be an option was tremendously helpful.  </li>
            <li>The 1st formula wasn&#x27;t perfect and they were very helpful with suggestions to alter it for round 2.  </li>
            <li>The most challenging part is getting back of my head covered ...</li>
            <li>The best part is I can tweak my color for my next order at no extra charge.</li>
            <li>better than the high dollar salons.  </li>
            <li>I recently used my first order of hair color - not only was the color ideal, but the products made my hair feel healthy and look shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love this color super easy to do and makes my hair healthy and shiny,  not like the other coloring boxes.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, color is excellent, no more grey hair, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my eSalon personally formulated hair color system.  </li>
            <li>The next morning I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The delivery is prompt and I am overall very glad I gave them a try.</li>
            <li>They could have turned off the auto delivery option the very first time they ordered.</li>
            <li>I think it hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I started going grey.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m growing my hair long now because I know I can keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>I think that anyone who doesn&#x27;t try this is missing out of the deal of the century.&lt;br /&gt;The color is holding beautifully</li>
            <li>Good grey coverage, and even color.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled, totally satisfied, and know that next time will be better as I won&#x27;t be a total novice to the process.</li>
            <li>eSalon also included samples of their new color safe shampoo and conditioner which I will purchase.</li>
            <li>The new color has gotten many inquiries and compliments.</li>
            <li>glad I took the chance to try something new.</li>
            <li>My friends and family have all noticed the difference and love the new look.  </li>
            <li>love the new color.</li>
            <li>Not only is the color beautiful, it&#x27;s made my hair so soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>For someone who wants to color but can&#x27;t afford to spend a small fortune at a salon, eSalon is perfect.</li>
            <li>At my request, you remixed my dark brown color with more warm tones.</li>
            <li>They REALLY know what they are doing!!</li>
            <li>I was nervous about having to finagle with the formula, like my hair might not &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; at first, but even though I did need to go a bit darker and have a stronger formula to cover my stubborn grays, it was worth it!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I have been looking for!  </li>
            <li>I changed my color this last shippment, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>What more could an old lady want!</li>
            <li>My color is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>THANKs esalon!!  </li>
            <li>I got exactly the color I wanted!</li>
            <li>On my 2nd order and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I get a permanent color as I am covering gray that I am not quite ready to accept!!  </li>
            <li>It is the exact color of my hair use to be ,before the gray started showing up!</li>
            <li>It may be more than the box  kind but certainly less than a salon.</li>
            <li>so I was worried that one bottle wouldn&#x27;t be enough but it was more than enough and it&#x27;s super easy to use and the color is amazing</li>
            <li>It was easy to use following the instructions and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to go with permanent color using peroxide (have sensitive, older skin), but it actually made my hair better and the best part is the natural color - not dyed looking-</li>
            <li>&amp; like I said, the ease of clean up was much easier on my skin!</li>
            <li>As someone who has been home colouring my hair for many, many years (at first just for a nice change and then over the last ten years out of necessity)</li>
            <li>I love it, great coverage, long lasting color and their other products are equally as good.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy shopping on line and shopping for great prices, hard to find items, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to not have to worry about coloring after a few shampoos too.</li>
            <li>i just recolored it same product and it looks amazing and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>The service is  well worth trying out.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shampoo and conditioner packets that come in the kit, so I bought a bottle of each for regular use.</li>
            <li>Hair is really, really soft afterwards and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is better than professional hair color.</li>
            <li>I was sent a kit with my custom color - Medium Brown - Pearl Golden.  </li>
            <li>It looks healthy, shiny, and soft.  </li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>When my hair dried - I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was truly the color that I selected... and best part was that  ALL my grays were covered.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also it is rare that I would write a rave review about anything....</li>
            <li>The color came out just lovely and natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually fun to get their package in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use an OTC root touch up, I get a distinct line where that color is placed.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I saw an ad about eSalon but did not give it a second thought, then I read a review and decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old daughter enjoyed watching me dye it.  </li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and mostly gray.  </li>
            <li>I was able to color correct a mistake made by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li>Again, I liked the system: they canceled all my subsequent orders, and offered me a complementary try.</li>
            <li>Take the time to fill out the profile carefully and upload good quality photos.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll change my color next time to something funky and fun like bright red! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 74 years old and have never had so many complements on my hair.  </li>
            <li>They also have products that help you apply the color and products to keep your color fresh.</li>
            <li>On a final note, the day I colored I had a Doctor&#x27;s appointment, so dressed nice and put on make up.</li>
            <li>It was really nice to see a very personal approach from an online company!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks natural and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>The color did such a great job of hiding the gray around the front of my head; my hair is so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was prepared to be annoyed, but I tried what they sent me, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>And knowing that they will tweak my color any time I wish, is so exciting.  </li>
            <li>I used a golden blonde color, close to my own.</li>
            <li>This is the most true to my natural color and also the best &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; coverage I have ever had - natural looking reds are very difficult, but this turned out gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices charged by my hair stylist for coloring that I can now easily do myself.  </li>
            <li>I made a slight alteration and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>previously used Nice and Easy but couldn&#x27;t always get the colour</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the absolute best hair color I have ever used</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older and the gray has taken over, I usually do a light golden brown or a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>It adds just the right amount of copper back into my color to keep it bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The supplies I bought are superior to other beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>The convenience of having my color automatically arrive right about the time</li>
            <li>Everything I needed was right in the kit.</li>
            <li>Efficient delivery right to my door.</li>
            <li>No one ever got it right until I tried Esalon.</li>
            <li>Shipped right to your door.</li>
            <li>Also right away I could tell it was stripping my hair and the texture of my hair</li>
            <li>But I went to my stylist to get my hair colored, because I was going on a vacation and didn&#x27;t want to take the chance that eSalon might not turn out right.</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser commented on the color.&lt;br /&gt;Great product with all you need delivered right to your  home.</li>
            <li>It is just right.  </li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve answerd their questions and uploaded a photo of me, they get working on the right color for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the hair color right away.</li>
            <li>I got the kit in the mail and when I read the name of the color they sent I thought this couldn&#x27;t be right</li>
            <li>THE hardest color to get right.</li>
            <li>I used their enclosed shampoo and conditioner, as directed, right afterwards.  </li>
            <li>They got the color right, everything you need comes in the kit.</li>
            <li>They will work with you and get it right.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I was struggling to find just the right shade of color.  </li>
            <li>right now you can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how they got it so right.</li>
            <li>We had to make adjustments to get to the right tone</li>
            <li>just right at a salon.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be just the right color, which over the counter boxed colors could not give me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have since gradually gone darker and more red, and have been contacted a couple of times by a colorist to make sure they understood what I wanted and to offer advice on the right way to move into new colors.</li>
            <li>They did an amazing job getting the color right, the product arrives in a solid package exactly when they say it will, and there&#x27;s no offensive odor.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between this product &amp; the cheap drug store stuff.</li>
            <li>the first time, with only a completed questionnaire and one photo, I liked the color.</li>
            <li>I tried eSalon for the first time last week and I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I am so happy about my hair color; it is the closest it has been to its natural color in a really long time.  </li>
            <li>After years of coloring my own hair, having it done in a salon and never quite getting the color just right (too dark brown, too much red tone, fading too fast) I finally have the PERFECT shade and tone - exactly what I asked for!  </li>
            <li>The second shipment was a little more but it is a great product and service and price.</li>
            <li>This costs more than hair color you can buy in the store, but much less than going to a salon, and the results are so much better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the first time buy, cuz you will be sold on it.</li>
            <li>I love the product, my custom color is amazing, it is better then the expensive color I got in the city.</li>
            <li>If you are a natural red head and the gray hair is starting to come in, this is the best color you can find anywhere.</li>
            <li>Too ashy, to dark then they would highlight my hair to make it look good.</li>
            <li>It covered ALL my grey and was the exact, precise color I asked for!!</li>
            <li>It was exceptional compared to the other products that I have tried to fix this problem.</li>
            <li>I am really picky about my hair and take very good care of it, it is very long and very healthy, so if I endorse a product I&#x27;m pretty serious about it.  </li>
            <li>They ended up sending me a new color free of charge using express service</li>
            <li>The second time it washed out they sent me new color right away, and the new shipment looked great at first.  </li>
            <li>and then I realized that they were right the first time.</li>
            <li>If you do choose to use this product, I suggest having every window available open and every fan available to dissipate the fumes.</li>
            <li>The instructions were complete and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I slathered on my own intense conditioner and left on for 3 hours</li>
            <li>So I uploaded a few pics and explained to the colorist what I wanted to change about the color and the next shipment was PERFECT!</li>
            <li>I liked the whole concept, from how simple was to choose the color, to the system of sending me the color periodically.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I had had enough time to know how great this product actually is.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a phone call from your team who spent a good deal of time discussing my requirements.</li>
            <li>Easy to use in a complete package.  </li>
            <li>One hour later, I had a GORGEOUS, PROFESSIONAL HAIR color.  </li>
            <li>After ten days my color looks FANTASTIC and my hair feels FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>It completely covers the gray doesn&#x27;t fade out and looks good all the way up to the next color treatment.</li>
            <li>Liked it but wanted to see it dry.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy, shiny, medium brown with sparkly highlights, not flat at all and thank heavens, not brassy!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I called CS freaking out, I wasn&#x27;t super nice, but they calmed me down, said no worries</li>
            <li>My hair colour is spot on, and my hair is soft and super glossy!</li>
            <li>The online ordering process was very easy, I was presented with several hair color types to choose from, colors that would look good on me and that were possible considering my current hair color.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My advice: if you don&#x27;t quite like it at first, tell them what you don&#x27;t like and give it another try.</li>
            <li>I also bought the cup/brush &amp; clips &amp; it made dying my hair so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I colored three weeks ago and have had several compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair is looking.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to give eSalon a try, I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use them!</li>
            <li>then I read a review on this product and have been using ever since, although the first colour was not the exact colour</li>
            <li>I had first thought I would take the color to my colorist and ask her to apply it the first time.</li>
            <li>The colors last longer too; seem more resistant to sun and shampoo</li>
            <li>This was my first time.</li>
            <li>Saves me so much!  </li>
            <li>Color is exactly what I want, even when I change it.  </li>
            <li>I used my kit for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>What you have to do is follow the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>eSalon emailed me with additional questions after I first placed my order and have emailed since to see how it turned out.</li>
            <li>Most are grammatically similar with over use of the exclamation point.</li>
            <li>In fact when have you seen so many five star reviews without a spelling mistake and a short intro sentence followed by !</li>
            <li>Just tried ESalon for the first time and it didn&#x27;t meet expectations.</li>
            <li>First, it was the mixing of color and development agent.</li>
            <li>I did just use the esalon product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>It matches the color I was using  exactly.</li>
            <li>Top rate personal attention by the eSalon Team.</li>
            <li>Well the first time I ordered it was just about at the end of winter</li>
            <li>it is so pretty.</li>
            <li>I am ready for coloring again and can&#x27;t wait to use this product!</li>
            <li>I did my hair for the first time in my years.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product seems equal to what I paid a lot more for at a salon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never sorry.</li>
            <li>well worth the reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The reason I haven’t received the product is because it is auto-charged first, once it goes through, they ship it, takes up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>The reason I haven’t received the product is because it is auto-charged first, once it goes through, they ship it, takes up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>and ready made color just for me!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by the personalized packaging and detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>The color was EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely use this again!</li>
            <li>To my relief and somewhat surprise I put the color on and it was exactly the color I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I received my first shipment in July.</li>
            <li>I just used my first eSalon shipment yesterday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked after my first application.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>They matched my color exactly.</li>
            <li>When I saw an ad for eSalon, I decided to try it, and go with a more red shade, as my coloring works with it, my daughters, sister, and nieces are all red-heads.</li>
            <li>I emailed my colorist and told her what I wanted, and she did exactly what I asked.</li>
            <li>I emailed my colorist and told her what I wanted, and she did exactly what I asked.</li>
            <li>They work with their customers to get exactly what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>but the color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks eSalon!</li>
            <li>Well it looks like Esalon knows exactly what they are doing.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after sending my order, they sent an email to let me know they changed my color to a more flattering color for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>the color they recommended was exactly what I described in my order.  </li>
            <li>It arrived and there was more than enough product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Even my husband has comment on how pretty the color is.</li>
            <li>I used E-Salon hair color for the first time this weekend.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be reordering :-)</li>
            <li>I used esalon for the first time in April.</li>
            <li>I have larger hands and most dye kits</li>
            <li>Start to finish was literally the same as most box dyes need to develop and 1/4 of the time I spend in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is almost painfully obvious that &amp;#34;employees&amp;#34; have written most of the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>I also recently tried the root cover wand and love that as well.</li>
            <li>When I first started receiving my hair color product I was asked to leave feedback.</li>
            <li>The price for my first shipment was unbeatable.</li>
            <li>I am 57 and this is the first attempt at coloring my hair</li>
            <li>I believe I first saw this product on Facebook and thought I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li>First of all, I am not an employee, and I know how to spell.</li>
            <li>is exactly what I need and want.</li>
            <li>First time coloring my hair....</li>
            <li>I was nervous doing so for the first time.</li>
            <li>I just colored my hair for the first time using esalon.</li>
            <li>My hair is exactly the color I wanted.</li>
            <li>Received my first shipment from eSalon...loved the look of the packaging...</li>
            <li>I ordered my first eSalon box in July 2014.</li>
            <li>The first thing she asked was how I was applying the color.</li>
            <li>I coloured my hair last Thursday and love it.</li>
            <li>I was so very worried!</li>
            <li>My hair actually came out healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>This was the first time using your product.</li>
            <li>When I do the 2nd touch-up I will see then if it was the color formula or me :)</li>
            <li>Thanks eSalon!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried esalon hair color.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I read the directions carefully, several times, to make sure I knew what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought the kit contained product for two coloring sessions, but, then I realized that it is done in two steps, one for the roots and one for the ends.  </li>
            <li>Plus the staff are always willing to make adjustments upon request.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very manageable and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Well, I gave the team my request and on my first coloration</li>
            <li>Next time! :)</li>
            <li>I just tried for first time 2 days ago.  </li>
            <li>I got the exact color I wanted (no burgundy)</li>
            <li>Thanks e-salon!</li>
            <li>My hair is now the exact color I have  </li>
            <li>I tried my first bottle of eSalon about 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Love the color kit with everything needed, plus an extra pair of colorist gloves for just in case.</li>
            <li>But after sending pictures again, and receiving a root kit as well as color to adjust the rest, it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>First, smell..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a real £££ saver!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and I&#x27;ve seen too many \\&quot;bottled</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my own hair for a long time now, and am very picky.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and colors trying to get the exact color I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I used the esalon custom color for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions exactly...</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and my hair was left in better condition than when I use box hair dye from the drug store.</li>
            <li>Also, I read where a customer&#x27;s credit card was charged for an additional after the first order, we&#x27;ll just so you know, after you order the first time, you are automatically signed up for auto delivery, but can turn it off immediately online.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the color I have been searching for over many years.  </li>
            <li>And on the first try.  </li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t remember signing up for regular delivery every so many weeks.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The gloss works great for extending shine in between coloring, but this color lasts at least 2 weeks longer than the store-bought color I was using.  </li>
            <li>Tried for the first time a couple weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this service.</li>
            <li>But I was able to let them know this after my coloring experience, so next delivery can be adjusted</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first</li>
            <li>Exactly the color I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I want</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I just recently tried this and was very impressed with the whole process - even though I sent them a questionable picture of me and my hair, they were able to formulate the right color.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too light and with the pale skin that a MN winter brings out in many of us, it was just right.</li>
            <li>They helped me pick the right color and really knew how to give me the help that I needed.  </li>
            <li>The perfect color AND esalon was smart enough to send me enough color to not only color my roots but to color my ends</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a day, but so far, I love the results!  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first when I learned they changed the formula I had chosen to better fit the results I was trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>I also love that they supply you with pretty much everything you will need such as 2 pair of gloves, packets of shampoo, conditioner, stain guard and stain remover (which I did not need).  </li>
            <li>The color is so natural and rich.</li>
            <li>The first, third, and fourth times I used esalon, the color was great and lasted 6 weeks (apart from my new root growth).  </li>
            <li>Super soft and shiny Will purchase again !</li>
            <li>Although the color came out all right, the quality of the color was similar to cheap box hair dyes.</li>
            <li>I not only got exactly what I wanted, but it has lasted, even after 6 shampoos &amp; still going strong.  </li>
            <li>, my hair was shiny, soft and the color looks rich and vibrant!</li>
            <li>After answering 10 easy questions or so &amp; uploading a current picture of myself a bottle arrived at my doorstep with almost exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I gave positive feedback</li>
            <li>but I am positive for this price and this quality I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but positive feedback on my hair</li>
            <li>At first I was very nervous about ordering hair color online.</li>
            <li>Even if the job is ok, it always needs redoing long before I can manage it again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I figured it would be worth a try and was better when comparing prices to the amount that I had to buy at the store to get complete white coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about my hair color since using this that I plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>They give you information to help with everything from application to products that will enhance your hair color experience as well as promote healthy hair and long color life.  </li>
            <li>After I colored my hair with my first order of eSalon, I noticed while I was drying it with a towel that it was very sticky.</li>
            <li>I color about every 6 weeks and honestly was buying whatever color brand was on sale in a dark brown/black.  </li>
            <li>For a fraction of the cost my hair looks just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>They send the right amount of product in the right shade and ask you to indicate how frequently you want each kit.</li>
            <li>directions are simple, easy to follow and clear, the formulation is just the right consistency (no goop and no drips!)</li>
            <li>When I received the color it was packaged so nicely with little extras and I used a brush to apply the color for the first time.</li>
            <li>it is better than getting highlights and low lights, the different colors of blond in this color seems more natural.  </li>
            <li>I even use half the developer and half the color each time because it really doesn&#x27;t take a full bottle to color the roots, and have had great success doing this.</li>
            <li>Finally after many years of using box color, I now have  my original color back!</li>
            <li>I sent them a photo of my hair color and told them I liked the light to medium blonde color and wanted to cover the increasing grey new growth.  </li>
            <li>The color is so natural and colors grey amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about the customized directions instructing me to color the roots with the first and the ends with the second bottles, but it turned out FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Finally, they also conveniently supply all of the tools needed to make the do-it-yourself experience as easy as posibble.</li>
            <li>; I didn&#x27;t have a photo to send that showed my color properly, so I chose a shade that looked easy to move to, described my color and cut, and waited.</li>
            <li>when I got my order and applied it, I almost super surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>When I finally used the product it was easy not messey.  </li>
            <li>Granted, when it does finally come out it looks great, but it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle for me.</li>
            <li>A week later and color still looks bright and grey still covered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mixing was easy - there were only two products to combine and I put them in a bowl, stirred with the applicator brush that was included.  </li>
            <li>but it was easy enough for me to do myself.</li>
            <li>Also, the illustrations and instructions that accompany the product are easy to follow, along with the hair clips, which are not only convenient but also durable.  </li>
            <li>And again, is so strong it actually wasn’t even rinsing out</li>
            <li>The inside pictures really don&#x27;t look as good as taking a picture in the sun, but I&#x27;m usually at my desk when I think about it.</li>
            <li>I did NOT notice a strong smell while coloring my hair, but when I got into the shower to pour the remaining color (mixed with water) over my hair as the instructions said to do, that smell DID become overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The color is long lasting and does a good job at covering the gray.</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re so affordable and the team at eSalon are highly attentive and work very hard to make sure you&#x27;re well looked after!</li>
            <li>Esalon certainly provides results close to salon quality.</li>
            <li>They are very high quality and turned my straw like hair into super soft hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved everything about the kit from the quick shipping to the custom color kit right down to the pink gloves!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my esalon result seems to be color that will last and stay more true till the next application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Might cost me more than the over-the-counter ones but its worth it and still tons less than what you would pay at the salon.</li>
            <li>I just sent an email describing my fine hair and the color I wanted, and they put it together and sent it back to me.  </li>
            <li>I told my colorist that the gold level was fine, but I needed the red punched up just a shade.</li>
            <li>I told my colorist that the gold level was fine, but I needed the red punched up just a shade.</li>
            <li>process was actually quicker than most at home products, I LOVE that the processing time is much less than what I am used to.</li>
            <li>Most other colors leave my gray a &#x27;funny&#x27; color.</li>
            <li>had my hair colored at a very high end Houston salon 5 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>It certainly is comparable to salon color and they really do tweak color for you.</li>
            <li>The color was changed to a little darker which I liked</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled with the little gift of gloss I received</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right color, my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair color one can purchase without having to go to an expensive salon.  </li>
            <li>Covered my  very gray roots 100% .</li>
            <li>It turned out better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair color to anyone!</li>
            <li>The color came out better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>No stain around my hairline thanks to the packet of stain protection gel they provided.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, esalon.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to do much.</li>
            <li>I filled out the feedback form for my next shipment, it was reviewed and my color changed.</li>
            <li>Thanks esalon.</li>
            <li>So much easier to schedule than having to go to a salon...</li>
            <li>haha, what are the chances.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is absolutely toxic.</li>
            <li>More than I expected.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks esalon.</li>
            <li>I have told anyone who will listen and everyone wants to try it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the ESalon Team!</li>
            <li>but this was so much easier</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Makes it SO much easier to apply the color.  </li>
            <li>High recommend!</li>
            <li>I always use the shampoo and conditioner they send, it lasts for two shampoos as my hair is very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They say they can&#x27;t make one light enough!</li>
            <li>ever so gentle..</li>
            <li>My eSalon package came today (really fast) and I have colored my hair.</li>
            <li>It was a painless process, fast, and with 100% guarantee, no risk involved.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Jules in England, UK</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it had a coating of glue or wax on it and as much as I kept trying to rinse it off</li>
            <li>really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate recommending eSalon to anyone and everyone that colors their hair and wants the quality of the salon with the expense of a home color.</li>
            <li>Thanks E Salon</li>
            <li>Thanks....  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Esalon</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the following day, I received an email suggesting that the colour I had chosen seemed a bit too light and one of the eSalon colorists would adjust it</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t know where some of the comments come from.</li>
            <li>Thanks eSalon</li>
            <li>their shampoo and conditioner is way too much for me to buy.  </li>
            <li>fast forward 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I saw no evidence of cutting corners, they even sent a battery with the timer and the clips were perfect for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Oh...the tint to use in between has really helped as well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>After spending way too much money and time at salons I gave eSalon a try.  </li>
            <li>It was much easier than using the squirt bottle.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY COLOR -</li>
            <li>That put moisture back into my hair and my hair looked fabulous, once again.  </li>
            <li>Better than l ever expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks eSalon and</li>
            <li>They are really staying tuned to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the leave in conditioner has made my hair much easier to manage and looks healthier than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>you so much e-Salon</li>
            <li>I was paying so Much for something I used to do for a living.  </li>
            <li>I have very resistant gray hair</li>
            <li>Frankly, the person I worked with did choose a color for me, but that really was it.</li>
            <li>I find the staff to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much shinier and bouncier with this</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks esalon staff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very well priced</li>
            <li>Hi!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for my custom color.</li>
            <li>I really admired the packaging / presentation,  too.  </li>
            <li>They personally make your hair color, providing colors available, then you send them a photo</li>
            <li>Their Customer Service has been very helpful in trying to get the shade I have in mind.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend eSalon for home hair coloring!</li>
            <li>Thanks eSalon for all of your follow up and caring about your product.  </li>
            <li>It was very helpful to talk on Skype with someone who  gave an advice.</li>
            <li>The colorists have been very helpful in helping me make adjustments and to understand just how color works on our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This hair color was the exact opposite of what I have experienced with hair color in the past.</li>
            <li>For nearly 10 years I&#x27;ve been coloring my gray roots, and for the last 4 or so years, it&#x27;s been more than once a month.</li>
            <li>after dying my hair with a box color from the store for over 13 years, i finally have a color that no only is beautiful but it covers the grey around the frame of my face &amp; it stays colored...</li>
            <li>Most recently I&#x27;ve been using Clairol Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li>There are really nice tones to the colour and it looks different in different lighting.</li>
            <li>The websites all talked about how sticky it is, and that it is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it; later I decided I wanted a little lighter, and they did it just right-</li>
            <li>2nd Application since becoming a new customer.</li>
            <li>is so soft and shiny after my coloring it with their products!!!</li>
            <li>I was in a bit of a hurry and did a pretty sloppy job - and yet my hair looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>a super sensitive skin, and psoriossis, and normal hair color makes my hair fall out</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and everyone has complemented me on my new colour</li>
            <li>Looks natural and eSalon got the color right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair myself with another brand I loved for years, but when I saw this product and how they used not only my picture and other details but also my goals and desires, I wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li>No store product can match my red hair and I didn&#x27;t want a complete change, just a more vibrant look</li>
            <li>the greatest disappointment came this morning when I receive a message from eSalon confirming a new charge to my credit card to an order I did not place!  </li>
            <li>Very professional people that you work with to find your exact hair color.</li>
            <li>of course I was mad at myself, then curiosity got the best of me.</li>
            <li>I might add that due to a glitch in mail service, the team at esalon provided outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li>so was willing to spend a little more money to get that.  </li>
            <li>this is the first product that matched my natural color!</li>
            <li>They came pretty close to matching my color from the pictures I sent on the first try and nailed it on the second which I&#x27;ve used consistently now for 5 months.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the color and their other products.  </li>
            <li>My hair has felt softer after with other brands but think it&#x27;s more a conditioner issue, and may just depend on one&#x27;s hair type.  </li>
            <li>Tried it again, but used less developer and more light blonde.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I described as wanting, the vibrant color doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; it appears very natural.  </li>
            <li>When I first put the new dye on the parts of my hair that are highlighted quickly turned blue!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little darker than my natural color, and I love it!</li>
            <li>No straw feeling afterwards,  good gray coverage, long lasting and little frizz which I can easily manage with a frizz serum</li>
            <li>When I didn&#x27;t get a reply, I went back into the site, filled out a new profile and reordered.  </li>
            <li>There is very little odor, and actually there is a hint of a very nice floral scent.</li>
            <li>The instructions were simple and every thing you would need was right in the kit!  </li>
            <li>Everything about my experience with eSalon has been positive and professional!  </li>
            <li>Then I began receiving compliments about how natural and pretty my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>I was even complimented by my very expensive hair stylist that my color was wonderful!</li>
            <li>The roots were exactly what I wanted and as the old darker colored hair grows out, I believe my continued use of this coloring will be what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The cost savings is awesome compared to what I have spent getting my hair professionally colored  --- at least $100 savings...  </li>
            <li>First class product the colour was fab and the condition of my hair afterwards was glossy and soft</li>
            <li>And if you order by phone with these companies, record the full conversation and state that you do not agree to any Auto-Purchases or future charges to your credit card.and to refund me immediately.</li>
            <li>And if you order by phone with these companies, record the full conversation and state that you do not agree to any Auto-Purchases or future charges to your credit card.</li>
            <li>While I liked those results I was never able to get the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for 7+ years now after moving (therefore not able to go to the stylist who I&#x27;d trusted for 7+years before.).</li>
            <li>When I started turning gray and began coloring my hair, finding the right color was a major chore.</li>
            <li>Very lightly and lasting only a week or two.</li>
            <li>Well, two years have gone by &amp; I noticed little bits of gray are really showing up on me even more despite coloring it with Loreal.</li>
            <li>– today I note that this company eSalon has charged a brand new charge to my credit card of $29.95 !?</li>
            <li>I was more then a liittle afraid of using the ESalon color but as soon as I blew my hair out my first reaction was ,,THERE I AM!!!!</li>
            <li>I have never sent them a picture, but based on my description of skin tone, natural hair color (not sure I actually remember what that is, except maybe gray), etc., as well as the sort of color I wanted, they mixed up my formula perfectly.</li>
            <li>Rather than going along with what I thought I wanted, an honest, professionals opinion was given, and I appreciate that SO very much more than just having a sale and a potentially unhappy customer.  </li>
            <li>But to have a color formulated for me, to have a stylist that I can contact, to be able to change the formula slightly...</li>
            <li>I have become a life member of eSalon, and feel that I have top professionals at the end of a call, or an email away;  which they answer within an hour or less.</li>
            <li>Much better than the color I had tried previously.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try eSalon mainly because they custom make your hair color.  </li>
            <li>This dye left my hair all the same color, and helped hide what I thought was thinning hair on top.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the exact same color I received the first time.</li>
            <li>There are SO many very similar reviews on this product that it&#x27;s obvious they have been paid to write them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a color product leave my hair super shinny and then stay that shinny over 6 weeks later.</li>
            <li>So be realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li>I did notice a bit more red in the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got into the shower for the last part, dumping the remainder of the &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; coloring mixed with water onto my hair and then rinsing it all out.  </li>
            <li>and there were many websites touting castor seed oil for African American hair.</li>
            <li>I just tried my customized hair color in natural light blonde which is like a level 9 box color from a store.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results, much more so than the result from the very expensive salon I went to.</li>
            <li>After years of coloring my own hair, with occasionally disastrous results, I tried eSalon for the first time and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; with the brush, bowl and clips.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li>highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to pay the extremely high prices to have someone color my hair.  </li>
            <li>They said that they don&#x27;t have the high lift ingredients that L&#x27;Oreal does.</li>
            <li>Well, I never used any high lift products by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I could go on raving about it, but I highly recommend that you try it if you&#x27;re looking for hair color that</li>
            <li>I feel the price is too high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who home dyes.</li>
            <li>but the price is now so high I decided to have a go myself.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the gloss.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have to &#x27;find&#x27; someone to color my hair, (plus pay the high cost)</li>
            <li>Exactly the right amount of red, and the closest to my natural color</li>
            <li>She did not offer any other choices or really advise me on the colors that would fit my complexion.</li>
            <li>Read their fine print carefully.</li>
            <li>I would go so far as to suggest wearing a respirator that one wears when working with certain paints and varnishes.</li>
            <li>The instructions are crystal clear!!</li>
            <li>I also mentioned to eSalon that I wanted a little more warmth to my hair color.  </li>
            <li>This is salon color at just a little more than grocery store price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love the color, I have adjusted it and am still adjusting it, a little with each order.</li>
            <li>the next batch i got was exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>My older daughters helped me apply it; nice thick mixture that didn&#x27;t drip.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very hard to color as it pulls red very easily and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I recently asked them to adjust the color to make it a little lighter, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely convenient, easy to use</li>
            <li>It was hard because I still liked my time at the salon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more money, but worth the extra cost since you can get just the shade you want.  </li>
            <li>My hair has hard to cover grey and this hair color covered my grey just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Be very careful if you don&#x27;t have incredibly strong hair.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical (because of my experience with those brands found in the drugstore), but was hopeful after reading all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The odor is minimal, and the gloves actually fit my hands.</li>
            <li>The two colors blend seamlessly and absolutely look like a salon job.</li>
            <li>The color lasts so much longer than my old box stuff too.</li>
            <li>The color is natural, they got my requests absolutely correct-</li>
            <li>I surprised when I received my package the very day</li>
            <li>Not too dark with nice deep copper highlights.</li>
            <li>It completely covers the grey, and the color is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I went from using a temporary color that was supposed to be a warm chestnut brown but turned my hair copperish to choosing the esalon&#x27;s permanent dark blonde color.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and it is full and soft, even though I applied the color only to my roots.</li>
            <li>and I know of a few that are satisfied customers themselves now.</li>
            <li>They have called me to chat about what I want and what&#x27;s possible to achieve; and even sent me a complimentary color when things just didn&#x27;t go the way we knew</li>
            <li>Hair does not feel normal.  </li>
            <li>The first 3 times it barely covered the gray and my color, although adjusted each time, was not at all what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>After years of boxed colors and even more years at salon colors (not to mention the amount of money I wasted)</li>
            <li>Lovely presentation and a few freebies also.</li>
            <li>It was good, but not great, and over time started to make my hair increasingly straw-like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I got tired of the gray hair and had heard good things about the product</li>
            <li>Colors grey completely and exactly the right shade of the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and my hair looks vibrant and so natural!  </li>
            <li>I was so nervous, because I had never colored my hair myself, but the directions were very clear, and I did the strand test beforehand, which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Super disapointed and am going back to my old color routine.</li>
            <li>My hair was also more dry than with my regular over the counter product.  </li>
            <li>I have strong red tones in my hair and wished to colour my hair with a none red result.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about this product, and from other reviews I&#x27;ve read, everyone feels the same way.  </li>
            <li>My next color was right on</li>
            <li>only criticism is that the ends of my hair became brittle right after using the coloring.  </li>
            <li>I will try the next shipment to see if they can get the color right; if not, I will discontinue the automatic delivery system.</li>
            <li>I just tried eSalon for the first time; I was skeptical and haven&#x27;t colored my own hair in over 10 years, and I was very concerned I would ruin my hair color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; for this new hair color.</li>
            <li>I telephoned and was repeatedly asked did I do a new profile?  </li>
            <li>You can select the frequency of new product (number of weeks) and they communicate every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The doc asked if I&#x27;d used any new hair products</li>
            <li>ALWAYS read the lowered starred reviews on a new product.  </li>
            <li>I an a new customer of ESalon.</li>
            <li>Taking into consideration of the new growth of course.</li>
            <li>I moved out of state and have not found a new colorist, so I decided to try eSalon.  </li>
            <li>No I don&#x27;t work for them, I am just a new customer.</li>
            <li>and I feel like a new person.  </li>
            <li>My 1st order came damaged and they promptly mailed a me a new box.  </li>
            <li>That said, she was nice enough to refund me which will take a few business days, and turned off the auto-purchase on my account.</li>
            <li>That said, she was nice enough to refund me which will take a few business days, and turned off the auto-purchase on my account.</li>
            <li>I paid $125.00 at the salon a few months ago, and my hair didn&#x27;t look as healthy and natural as it does today, one week after I did it myself at home.</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair with10 % gray streaks and wanted to go more red with a color that did not look pink over my gray as it faded.  </li>
            <li>I started out med brown since it is closest to my natural hair color and my main goal was covering the gray.</li>
            <li>The water never cleared completely; there was a steady stream of bubbles coming out of my hair.</li>
            <li>the directions, they were very clear..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend those busy moms like me to dye their hair at home.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not brassy and my hair is very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>very professional presentation.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t colored my hair since I was very young.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering professional brand quality hair color to the general public, without the super high prices.</li>
            <li>The grey coverage is super and the color is natural.  </li>
            <li>Added the first color aghhh, it was brown, then added the second color mahogany, another aghhh.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li>After selecting my color for the first time and uploading the picture, they wrote me back and suggested to change my color choice. . .</li>
            <li>so I never have to worry about ordering in time for my next order, plus it comes in a pretty, personalized box.</li>
            <li>They sent me the exact shade of red</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to economize, and letting go of my monthly visit to the salon was a logical choice, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to go back to using store brand hair color.</li>
            <li>I also love their other products such as leave in condition and root touch up.</li>
            <li>Have been using it since first heard of it last year.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I actually had gray coverage.</li>
            <li>, it was soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>I originally chose a color, but after I submitted a picture, they recommended a different color based on my current color, complexion, etc.  </li>
            <li>Am pleasantly surprised at how well you matched my color!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and I look as if I&#x27;m still paying to have my hair professionally done!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft shinny now!  </li>
            <li>This time I wanted a shade lighter, so the instructions were to put the first bottle on my roots, and the second on the ends.  </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions carefully, make sure you hit your part lines and hairline completely, and if possible, get a friend to help</li>
            <li>and I want it to look glossy and natural!  </li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time last week.</li>
            <li>not only followed the directions exactly, but watched their online tutorial.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed exploring some of the other related products they offer.  </li>
            <li>It was very simple to do, I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The first time it washed out esalon gave me a credit toward my next order.  </li>
            <li>And it looks like it has natural highlights, too!</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing this professional quality product for us to use at home!</li>
            <li>It was exactly the color I had prior to going gray...</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I used my eSalon custom color for the first time last night...</li>
            <li>Second was when I started opening bottles and mixing solutions, OMG the smell was straight out of a hair salon!</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li>The colour I received in my initial order was exact to what I wanted and was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised he said something!  </li>
            <li>At $10 for your first bottle of custom mixed hair color</li>
            <li>and my hair was the exact same color as before.  </li>
            <li>I have a large amount of grey in my hair and the coverage is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I had to work a little harder, I am very pleased with the results &#x3D;</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow--I would recommend paying the few extra dollars for bowl, brush and clips for your first time.  </li>
            <li>For my first order, I was told they made me a different color than I had originally ordered and was a little afraid to try it, but I loved the color I got!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products only to have a complete hair disaster that had to be corrected at a salon until now.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair highlighted using only about 10-12 foils just to give it more deminsion as it was beginning to get too dark for my age.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the shade as it is as close to my natural colour as I requested</li>
            <li>Due to a change in tone (from golden to copper), it required two different sets of color that were sent to me (second free of charge).</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for 10+ years due to greying early and used many different at home products as well as had professional hair coloring done.  </li>
            <li>Wow, even the smell announced that this was no ordinary over the counter product.  </li>
            <li>I have never experienced better customer service, anywhere!  </li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re comfortable coloring your own hair or have someone to do it for you, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think too much of it, and when it was time to color again, did the same thing with my new shipment.</li>
            <li>look younger and my new haircolor really looks natural and compliments my skintone.  </li>
            <li>Very vibrant and longer lasting than store bought brands.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the ammonia as my colorist had always used an ammonia free brand; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been detrimental to my hair at all.</li>
            <li>My color was a little darker initially, but when I called to ask how to change it, the representative was MORE than helpful.  </li>
            <li>I had to quickly look through the medicine cabinet to look for other solution.</li>
            <li>Sure application can be a little messy (red) but the color and highlights are fantastic.</li>
            <li>You have nothing to loose, full money back guarantee or new formulation of your color request will be sent to you.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, coarse and very porous hair</li>
            <li>Using your product, all of my hair is the same color, it is very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>This is so much easier on my budget (obviously).  </li>
            <li>The dye appears to be creating or picking up on my natural highlights and lowlights.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Customer support fixed the situation the day I informed them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old.</li>
            <li>Have been coloring my hair since I was 24 years old.</li>
            <li>My sister is a professional and said, &amp;#34;Please don&#x27;t tell anyone about this!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>had some my usual tried and true light blonde color and developer, and left it on for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>have short hair and have it cut every few weeks and my hairdresser always comments on the lovely condition of my hair and how natural the colour looks.</li>
            <li>I have always had a professional colorist.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have tried box hair color but never thought it looked natural.</li>
            <li>I have always had my hair coloured professionally but thought I would give this a go after reading about it in woman and home magazine.</li>
            <li>color is so natural looking!!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I clearly saw on the web site about recurring orders, so am surprised that others missed this.  </li>
            <li>Note: If you have a sensitive nose, you should think before trying it.</li>
            <li>My hair came out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This has saved me money since professional color in a salon was costing me over $100.00.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny too.  </li>
            <li>I have always gone to a professional when it came to my hair.</li>
            <li>Still a bummer, but definitely not their fault and they handled it really well.</li>
            <li>They truly care about their customers and provide professional guidance and help 24/7.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used  professional as well as box brands.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural that even my statist tells me how professional my hair looks.</li>
            <li>this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I’ve had professional hair colours and also drug store colours for 3 decades</li>
            <li>God only really knows what’s in their formula.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>and it takes only about 30-40 minutes for whole process.  </li>
            <li>but after took a bit of my hair to see what the color would be, I was surprised it was just the color</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and it shines.</li>
            <li>I am completely surprised that it turned out as well as it did.</li>
            <li>The color really surprised me too.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny, and the product didn&#x27;t burn like the salon treatment.</li>
            <li>By far the highest quality hair coloring I have ever used at home.  </li>
            <li>I have found a hair colour that looks natural</li>
            <li>I followed enclosed instructions and was completely flabbergasted with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have been coloring my hair for years; however, I always wished a professional would tell me what color I should color my hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently wrote to them when they sent me notice, which they do every month, that it was time to get my order ready, &amp; asking if I had any changes I wanted to make.</li>
            <li>The color covers my gray, make my hair soft and looks fuller.</li>
            <li>and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Colour has not faded as much as if buying a dye from a shop or even from a salon, Iwill definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair color, how soft and shiny ma hair are after the treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately my shower stall is beige.&lt;br /&gt;However, I may not have diluted the leftover dye enough, and had too much in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The professionally mixed formula is always illustrated for me, so I know how much Mahogany, Ash, etc.</li>
            <li>I got the kit, and was extremely surprised at the contents.</li>
            <li>Color covered completely.</li>
            <li>Everyone has said that it looks soooooo natural.  </li>
            <li>I work in Manhattan and have been getting my hair colored near work.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>far as the auto-ship and the color, if you go into your profile you can change when you get your order and you can change your color as well.</li>
            <li>After decades of costly professional hair colouring, I decided to go out on a limb and try eSalon.</li>
            <li>No harsh coloring that&#x27;s a plus...</li>
            <li>so I gave up on professional color a while ago and went to the OTC color.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural.</li>
            <li>Stay far, far away.</li>
            <li>It comes out soft, shiney, and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>I am ecstatic and completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I have been coloring for 35 years, premature gray and experimental.</li>
            <li>The company is very helpful when you want a color change or to adjust frequency of future deliveries.</li>
            <li>I have never had my hair my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li>It does not look like it has been colored; it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>There are highlights in it and they look natural.  </li>
            <li>and they way they present so much help and</li>
            <li>How about how personal, it had the description, on the instruction of how much of every color it got, so go ahead</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and was shiny and there is none of the gummy feel that I have read about?  </li>
            <li>I have been paying so called professional hairdressers a lot of money and never getting the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>As far as I understand it, she just went by the picture I sent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used professional color as well as permanent and Demi permanent from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>My friends thought I&#x27;d been and had my hair professionally</li>
            <li>I have used professional services as well as store brand at home products.</li>
            <li>I bought this product direct from esalon as I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold it.</li>
            <li>Directions were thorough and concise.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I started turning gray in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so I needed something to cover that and enhance my natural color.</li>
            <li>straw-like after each application but is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>He was surprised it came from a bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asking for a tweak for my next delivery, but they have been very responsive and communicative.  </li>
            <li>Professional advice as to the correct custom shade for your skin tone and desired outcome.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>After shampooing and conditioning with the samples, my hair was soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>After coloring hair, the ends of hair seemed like straw; but after washing twice, then using the conditioner all over, hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>is completely colored and</li>
            <li>so I went with the demi permanent color that matched my natural hair color.  </li>
            <li>I was very nervous because the directions said I was to only apply to my roots and not the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after using their products.</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from their site.</li>
            <li>I had colored said it looked so natural.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did the final shine rinse in the shower since that part is a bit messy</li>
            <li>Most reds wash out within a few weeks, but with eSalon&#x27;s colour, it actually stays until I re-colour every 2 months.</li>
            <li>It has kept my color vibrant and no grey hairs at my temples!  </li>
            <li>since we don&#x27;t see each other often we r just kinda in our own little space when I am there.</li>
            <li>It will be a little more expensive than box color, but the added benefit of better conditioned hair in the long run is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>The first color I received came out with slightly lighter roots (most likely due to old color on the ends of my hair at the time).</li>
            <li>With just a few words describing my original hair color, eSalon got it as close to NATURAL color as I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>So, I gave Esalon another try and asked them to make a few changes on my original color that I ordered.</li>
            <li>I originally started with the permanent color, but have just begun using their demi-permanent (washes out in a few weeks).</li>
            <li>so I avoid them at all costs, but I was so excited I took a few pics and posted them online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the list is endless and I am having fun with whoever reads this.</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde hair naturally which I normally dye it to a light natural blonde and have some highlights throughout.</li>
            <li>It felt like I was getting so much more than a regular boxed color, which I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>ESalon is the FIRST and ONLY product that hasn&#x27;t made me look like a &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li>first color wasn&#x27;t red enough, and needed the gold punched up as well.</li>
            <li>and they sent me the same color I&#x27;ve been using for a long time (medium golden brown).  </li>
            <li>As a busy mom, with three kids, I don&#x27;t have time for the salons and the grocery shelf boxes for a natural red are anything but natural (and yes, reds do gray!)</li>
            <li>Really no different than the instructions with any of the other products I&#x27;ve used - don&#x27;t color clean hair, divide it into sections, holding the sections with plastic clips</li>
            <li>Also, I should mention, low odor, zero mess and super shiny hair!</li>
            <li>Nothing short of WOW!!  </li>
            <li>I love all of the little extra touches too with the packaging and personal help.  </li>
            <li>The result came out better than I expected and matched the existing color that I had done at a salon previously.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the color washed out of my hair very quickly every other time (yes, I use a color safe shampoo).  </li>
            <li>I really like the texture of my hair since coloring it, it&#x27;s not straw feeling and the roots were covered well, even the grey.</li>
            <li>who really does grey</li>
            <li>I asked for dark blonde with gold and that&#x27;s what I got - my hair is now a bit brighter &amp; lighter than my original hair colour</li>
            <li>The color I get from my stylist is a dark brown with golden highlights.</li>
            <li>She ordered a complimentary ends (everything but the roots), lighter color to be shipped with my next order to bring the rest of my hair back to the same color as my roots.</li>
            <li>The only thing different from other hair color products was to add water to any color you have left until it&#x27;s about half water/half color, and add that to the coloring in your hair (best to do this in the shower, it can get messy) and work it in until it&#x27;s like a creamy shampoo.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star ONLY because I&#x27;m still a new customer and have a wait and see attitude about things.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new, and ordered their ash blonde color (guaranteed to color the gray!).</li>
            <li>2 days later email from esalon requested that I phone since they couldn&#x27;t retreive the new profile.  </li>
            <li>They only continue to live up to their promises and their products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and really gives my color staying power.</li>
            <li>So I left a very stern message that I did not agree to any further charges or purchases and to refund me immediately.</li>
            <li>Fast, personal and specific to your issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had enough product left over to mix back in the bottle with water and use to \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; my hair just before rinsing, and it all rinsed clean pretty easily (not so with some OTC products).  </li>
            <li>Everything u need is in the box, right down to two pairs of gloves.  </li>
            <li>My husband actually told me it looked very natural after I told him I had colored my hair.</li>
            <li>The second month, I did only the roots with the root color and the red tint on the rest of my hair exactly per instructions.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>This color is so close to my original hair color, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I have changed no other product I use except now if I use all the creme and seriums</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am willing to do it again, due to the awkwardness of holding arms up, etc.  </li>
            <li>It went on dark at first, but after a few shampoos the true color and highlights came out.  </li>
            <li>The eSalon team recommended a color slightly lighter than I had picked and they were right on.  </li>
            <li>and I think the main reason is because it didn&#x27;t cover the grey well, if at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend eSalon to anybody, and I plan on having a long relationship with them myself.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a high quality product at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I sent in several pictures of myself at different times of the year and the recipe was dead on accurate.  </li>
            <li>I t is clearly stated that your will be charged for next shipments and.</li>
            <li>When signing up, apparently there&#x27;s an auto-renew option (not fond of that) which caused an order to be placed automatically.  </li>
            <li>Also the frequent use of a double !!</li>
            <li>, any gray is very noticeable; I am not ready for that</li>
            <li>is nothing short of lush.</li>
            <li>My hair is a natural strawberry blonde</li>
            <li>I wanted to go back closer to my natural color instead of being lighter.  </li>
            <li>My natural colouring is a &#x27;copper blonde&#x27; although it tends to go darker during the Scottish winters.  </li>
            <li>The first color selection was way to dark.  </li>
            <li>In a week, I had a color made specifically for me from three different shades, along with professional colorists tools and directions.  </li>
            <li>Application was a bit more involved than my usual routine, but really, I think this showed how not thorough my usual routine was.  </li>
            <li>My hair was five different colors and they  fixed it...</li>
            <li>Plus I have the natural looking color from my youth back!</li>
            <li>Such soft hair</li>
            <li>I have been getting my hair dyed red for a while professionally, but my hairstylist is moving</li>
            <li>twisted my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair for the night, but even when it was wet, I was impressed with the richness of the color, the softness of my hair, and how even as dark as my forehead looked during application, I used the wipe in the kit before rinsing and there was no hair color stain left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This year I spent 300 at an expensive salon to do a balayage hair color (which I only liked the first day)...</li>
            <li>, i did the online question and told them no red, first time in a long time, there is no red tones.</li>
            <li>The parts that were blue rinsed out completely and the the color was even throughout.</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve simply gone with professional products and saved the life of my hair.</li>
            <li>This was much easier to use then I expected.  </li>
            <li>At the same time my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I shampooed twice with it and my hair finally felt back to normal.  </li>
            <li>so needless to say i am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I have tried boxed color many before too and normally not happy with them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they are true geniuses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making my hair color disasters a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I wanted my hair a little redder, so I think I should have looked at samples of their colors, instead of just using their survey questions to develop the right color for me.  </li>
            <li>The coloring process took a little longer than it does with the typical drug store color, but I think that&#x27;s because the coverage is so much better</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not easy to get red right!  </li>
            <li>They had adjusted the color for me and they picked something very much like the color I had previously used with a drug store brand.</li>
            <li>and the ends came out slightly darker and after a few days looked better.</li>
            <li>My original shipment did end up coming a few days later too, but they totally understand my hesitation to wait for it to arrive and risk it not showing up.</li>
            <li>The last time I went to a salon, I made it very clear that I didn&#x27;t want my hair to look red at all....</li>
            <li>I had gone to a stylist for over 20 years then moved to another state &amp; had trouble finding the right stylist.</li>
            <li>The color is consistent and covered all my other color (I had a disaster prior to using eSalon).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Learnings: You can have a terrific business idea and sufficient money to put together a great marketing strategy, yet it will fail if your product does not deliver the results expected or your business practices hurts the same customers you are trying to retain.</li>
            <li>Covers grey completely!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always just gone to the natural blonde shade it was in high school, using Garnier, Clairol, Loreal, and other name brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different boxed store colorings and I&#x27;ve used professional salons on occasion.</li>
            <li>and she saved us from social</li>
            <li>I also added some colouring tools to my initial order,  the bowl, brush and clips, and found that this simple addition made a considerable difference in ease of application and use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who colors their own hair and to girls who needlessly pay big bucks to have it done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more natural looking than the Satin mixture I was using, which tended to turn &amp;#34;reagan brown&amp;#34;, and weirdly orange with pink-ish undertones that were supposed to make up &amp;</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was Very skeptical at first, I had seen some girls rave about it on youtube</li>
            <li>I even edited my color after the 2nd month to go a little lighter, and they got it right on the mark.</li>
            <li>And after the first coloring I spoke to their colorist and asked for some little corrections in the color</li>
            <li>My hair which is naturally red has been slowly losing it&#x27;s red color and becoming lighter and lighter, I&#x27;m assuming turning white as that is what happens with redheads.  </li>
            <li>The second time, I even tried using less of the product and took two showers (because I ran out of hot water) and color-safe shampoo to cut through it.</li>
            <li>but the gloss on my ends didn&#x27;t really get that dark</li>
            <li>It really covered the grey and now waiting to see how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>After dying, my hair is shiny and natural looking and all the grey is covered.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s missing from the &#x27;real salon experience!&#x27;</li>
            <li>The first round i got</li>
            <li>, it is a little strong and if you are sensitive to that it could be a problem, but no more than an over the counter or salon product.</li>
            <li>Also, it could be that I&#x27;m just not very experienced yet at using the wand, so the lack of full coverage at my part is a result of &amp;#34;user error,&amp;#34; rather than the product.</li>
            <li>After viewing my&lt;br /&gt;completed intake and the pictures I&#x27;d sent they advised me to go a little lighter-instead of light brown they advised dark blond.</li>
            <li>The application process is a little different from any box color I have ever used, but not difficult.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it colored all my gray, but we may have needed to put more on or wait a little longer.  </li>
            <li>Especially those with red hair, it is by far the most difficult shade to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using eSalon for about a year and a half after years of paying too much for hair coloring in the salon.</li>
            <li>Natural and long lasting, for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and if you are not happy the staff will work with you until you are.</li>
            <li>It took me a few weeks the first time before I colored my hair, so I emailed eSalon and ask them to wait a couple of weeks before they sent the next color, and if they would send it about 1 shade lighter.</li>
            <li>I was still hanging in there though, hoping that at least it would not wash out as quickly but it performed about the same as over the counter.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I realized how badly damaged my hair was until I touched my new soft and healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>For me i love the Aveda salon but having a little one hard to make it there and sit with him there for three hours or so...</li>
            <li>I have been told by stylists many times that I have hard hair to color and was a little scared to try this</li>
            <li>And, when you want a little change, they are very accommodating.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to really match.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I am in the UK and heard from other people about this new colour product.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can write them at any time to change a little or a lot of your chosen color;  because summer is fast approaching, I wrote in to change my color to just one shade lighter than I&#x27;m using now.  </li>
            <li>I had an incredibly hard time coloring my own hair, due to previous neck surgery (6 years ago).  </li>
            <li>If things change with the next application, I will come back and let you know - good or bad.</li>

            <li> I &amp;#34;hoped&amp;#34; would mimic one from years ago that I loved.</li>
            <li> Your prices are fantastic and make it affordable to use all of your wonderful products.</li>
            <li> My color arrived and when I had finished applying it, it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> and she asked what colour i had used as she thought it was really good.</li>
            <li> The gray coverage has been great and the color is nice too.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be skipping the salon from now on; for a fraction of the price, I can have gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> My hair color looked every bit as good as when I paid 3x&#x27;s the amount plus a tip.  </li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li> hair never looked and felt so good.</li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER looked this good.  </li>
            <li> My air is shiny and in good condition.</li>
            <li> and I did not get good customer service at all.  </li>
            <li> and I loved the personalization on the bottles.</li>
            <li> As good as salon at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I just used eSalon&#x27;s hair coloring product and I loved it.</li>
            <li> and I loved those products as well.</li>
            <li> Without question these products are superior to store bought...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really good luck with that.  </li>
            <li> No mess, no fuss, just wonderful color, and great, shinning hair!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the kit which makes it very easy for my sister and I to have a ladies night in (although we save the wine until after we do our hair :) ).</li>
            <li> All so glad to help you, the service is so good also!</li>
            <li> What more can a girl ask - keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> When I got my order, they had lightened my order &amp; informed me of special instructions how to use it for the best results.</li>
            <li> Not an easy thing to match a redhead!!</li>
            <li> Tinted Love works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> So, it seemed, my choices were beautiful results with a hefty price tag or iffy results that were more affordable.  </li>
            <li> I love what this hair color did for me, I feel beautiful again.  </li>
            <li> My results were great and the process was easy!  </li>
            <li> My kit arrived in incredible packaging with easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Perfect coloring; much more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; and healthy looking than store-sold box brands.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly it was delivered and the communication I received before the product was even shipped.</li>
            <li> Super happy!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!</li>

            <li> I tried this product because it had many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> It was great; even better than the Nexxus and Revlon salon shampoo</li>
            <li> However, I was expecting something more based on the company&#x27;s ads.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great</li>
            <li> Happy girl :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all of the products that I have used.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lovely, the shine and condition of my hair is great.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, so much better than when I dyed it with boxed dye from the store.</li>

            <li> and I just ordered your amazing shampoo &amp; conditioner ...</li>
            <li> Totally amazing depth and dimension -- made for me...</li>
            <li> Definitely better than store-bought and just as good as salon results.</li>
            <li> I got my hair colored, but it&#x27;s more that I look good.  </li>
            <li> I always do my own hair coloring with the over-the-counter hair color</li>
            <li> I had never dyed my own hair before, always had it done at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Color - Nice</li>
            <li> They were so nice and had no problems with my request.</li>
            <li> The color was just alittle lighter which is good but the most amazing thing that I can not get over is the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much; this is a wonderful service and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though eSalon gives you a really nice brush, I chose to put the color on using the applicator bottle.</li>
            <li> The auto shipments are nice and they keep up with your whites if you have that issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair since forever.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled and my husband loves it also.</li>
            <li> then you too can follow the made just for you instructions in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> My husband even said he liked it.</li>
            <li> I was firstly impressed by how much product there was</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Uniquely designed for the individual with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I got the results I was hoping for, 100% gray coverage, a nice shiny outcome &amp; the color was spot on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product if you have had some experience dying your own hair.</li>
            <li> It took a few times for me to get the perfect color, but I&#x27;ve got it now and it looks spectacular!!!  </li>
            <li> Recommend to everyone I meet who colors their own hair.</li>
            <li> I have never done my own hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so thrilled at the results.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the colour and my hair is in lovely condition.  </li>
            <li> like the fact that they custom make the color you decide upon from the many they provide that would be a good look for you.</li>
            <li> Thanks for great service and a great product.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best at home hair color EVER!!!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner sample was also a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was nice to have \\&quot;total\\&quot; instructions instead of trying to guess the \\&quot;timing\\&quot; of the drug store box brand.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never colored my own hair before and was concerned</li>
            <li> Loving the color.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the color that the stylists choose for me based on my profile.  </li>
            <li> feel like I am in good hands with eSalon and love the color they customized for me.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but those two points were the best parts of this service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for years.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to have found eSalon.  </li>
            <li> They sent a nice reply</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the service and product was personalized.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging,</li>
            <li> So much so my husband noticed and loved it!!!</li>
            <li> but in the end I just kind of winged it</li>
            <li> so nice that I stop by mirrors just to look at it and say &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Then I followed the directions exactly as written, and even though the color looked a lot darker on my head, when I rinsed it out, I was absolutely thrilled with the results!!  </li>
            <li> They guide you to the color of your choice, and for me that was one that provided amazing gray coverage, and on top of all that E-Salon provided exceptional customer service from beginning to end.</li>
            <li> fantastic, I am really happy with the color, the procedure was very easy to follow</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage even over the copper colour my hair was and my greys, love the colour exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> With great trepidation I decided to do a full colour on my hair with my customised hair product from eSalon&#x27;s advice and instructions.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s perfect and I would recommend this to anyone who is keen to try something new.  </li>
            <li> my new best friend</li>
            <li> I really liked being able to create my own hair color with the help of a stylist.</li>
            <li> loved that fact that this process is easy for me, my hair and my pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the color was salon-quality, it provides good gray coverage and the applicator brush made it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but I was very pleasantly surprised by the easy of application, great coverage of gray and my hair came out the best I&#x27;ve seen since coloring it many years now.</li>
            <li> Easy application, loved the gloves.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very easy change.  </li>
            <li> so I know what my hair is supposed to feel like and smell like, and after I put it on, it is SO VERY strong</li>
            <li> Instructions are very easy to follow.</li>
            <li> The directions are thorough and it is all very easy.  </li>
            <li> sure the more I do it, the easier it will get!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> The color is perfect and it has covered the gray completely!</li>
            <li> Most fabulous!!  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with the outcome!</li>
            <li> , I love the way my hair looks and feels, I love the shine and the value!</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy, shiny and better than ever!  </li>

            <li> I love love the color!</li>
            <li> So glad i stumbled across this website cuz it has changed my hair life! :)</li>
            <li> They have a great price, the color is always what I expect and want, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, easy to apply, and a great price.</li>
            <li> so be assured this is special!!</li>

            <li> eSalon specialists were SO right with the color they created for ME!!!</li>
            <li> Great the first day!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, my hair has never been in better condition &amp; the color &amp; ease of use is perfect.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very happy with these guys.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to just have it arrive in your mailbox, and be able to color when and where you want.</li>
            <li> The Customer Service is probably by far the greatest part though.</li>
            <li> I really liked one by L&#x27;Oreal but it did not cover my gray roots when I started to get mostly gray.</li>
            <li> the product is even more amazing....</li>
            <li> Incredibly soft hair, perfect color match to my existing color!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair color I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Gray completely covered and color was perfect</li>
            <li> I have had a wonderful experience with this product and all the things in the package to do a professional job on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable and the color is great!</li>
            <li> Loved the product and how silky smooth my hair was after the treatment.  </li>
            <li> eSalon staff fixed it and it is PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> It is really nice &amp; so much better than the drug store Sally products.  </li>
            <li> I was quite happily surprised at the perfect match, with out seeing my hair in person.  </li>
            <li> Esalon products are by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> the color itself while not the exact color i was going for was still a nice color and everything worked perfectly to my expectations otherwise, and with a quick email asking for a reformulation on my color</li>
            <li> Easy, fast and perfect color!</li>
            <li> The website is great and makes choosing the right color foolproof...</li>
            <li> My hair (very fine and curly with a lot of silver)</li>
            <li> Easy customer service, you can up load a picture of yourself and tell them all of your preferences, and they listen!</li>
            <li> This process is so easy!</li>
            <li> It was so easy!  </li>
            <li> This was so easy!</li>

            <li> the 2nd time was perfect and I am so glad that they worked with me!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Even hubby says it looks good (and that rarely occurs)!</li>
            <li> The color is so beautiful and natural looking, and my hair feels tremendous!!!  </li>
            <li> And by the way..I really don&#x27;t look incredible most days.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten okay results at home, which was much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I asked my regular hair stylist what she thought (and to be honest) and she said it was perfect and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  </li>
            <li> However,  I loved the personalization, quality, price, and most importantly, the way my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> Finding products that work best for my hair has been a major chore over the course of my 63 years of living.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to do and love the color!</li>
            <li> The color is fantastic, long-lasting, covers gray, and very healthy to my hair.</li>
            <li> the color is unique,  the product leaves hair feeling healthy, smells good and the packaging convinced me that a personalized service was what I was getting.  </li>
            <li> I love the colour, the shine, it covered the few greys that I have, but the best part is how great my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> Every kit comes with everything you will need -- shampoo, conditioner, gloves, a stain guard, and very detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, the kit contains everything you need and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I came across eSalon through Social Media and I thought their marketing presentation was impressive and decided to give it a try, so I place an online order.  </li>
            <li> Once I received my color, it was easy to apply and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It covers the gray so effectively and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really liked the color and it was easy.</li>
            <li> The color and developer were customized as expected, but the thing that impressed me most was the customized instruction pamphlet!</li>
            <li> the product arrived nicely packaged,  easy to use,  no nasty smell or burning of scalp like the brand names,  love the fact that it included a barrier product and a stain remover,</li>
            <li> Hair color us great, just like my hair and nice and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful medium brown with soft highlights!!</li>
            <li> That is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> love the pictures.</li>
            <li> I love the product and love my color.</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair feels wonderfully healthy.  </li>

            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the color.  </li>
            <li> I also love the cream that takes off the dye on the sides of your face.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> so I was sure it would cover all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> When I was done conditioning, my hair felt healthy - not color treated.  </li>

            <li> Even though I eventually stumbled on a color that was okay, it was just that &#x27;okay.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The 5 stars can be, and many times are, faked.  </li>
            <li> And, my hair feels lovely, so</li>
            <li> Pleased all around and am on the auto-ship program for continued usage.  </li>

            <li> The color is perfect, only to be endorsed by  the hairstylist who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> How much better than that</li>
            <li> extra gloves and the stain remover are niceties that just added the perfect touch of salon details as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have received color 3 times and love the color and coverage.  </li>

            <li> I have decided on changing a couple of color applications to suit the seasons and love what is sent to me.</li>
            <li> I love that they take the time to let you choose  your skin tone, eye color, length of hair.</li>
            <li> I feel this is better than being like thousands of women that go get the store-color in a box.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love love E-salon.  </li>
            <li> I would like to tell more people to try these products.</li>
            <li> They dont do anything and don&#x27;t really even smell that great.  </li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> not only saved lots of money by not having to pay beauty parlor price and tip , but the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the way my hair looks and the color</li>
            <li> hair has never looked or felt better, if I want to tweak my color a bit for summer or winter</li>
            <li> I only put it on the roots as instructed and it&#x27;s a perfect match.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience and the accessories sent to help you.</li>
            <li> :) MBH</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> The end result -FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> If this is not going to perform better</li>
            <li> For $25 the product should work more than 50% of time.  </li>
            <li> The service is outstanding, but that does not make my hair look better.  </li>
            <li> Well if I do not buy an ash colored brown, I end up looking like I have had a copper explosion on the top of my head (the gray roots).</li>
            <li> LOVE eSalon :)</li>
            <li> Love how it covers the gray,  and I get lots of complements on how it looks so &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; .  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color, my hair is shiny and healthy looking and the entire process was effortless to do.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic  product!  </li>
            <li> I was pleased &amp; amazed with your product, as well as the convenience.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found this company.  </li>
            <li> The color they picked for me was a better choice</li>
            <li> I love this service.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the salon ($125) and way better than the box coloring kit.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is &#x27;unique&#x27; and not in a good way--thin, fine and, in humid weather, frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have exactly the subdued copper color I want, gray is covered, my hair feels great, and is easy to manage, and even seems to be growing faster</li>

            <li> YES....I LOVE this product and THANK you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and the color enhancer they have keeps it looking like new.  </li>
            <li> The color is rich, natural looking and just perfect.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quick service, and adjustments made as I requested.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a beautiful sheen &amp; looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered my hair color from Esalon and it came in a very nice packaged container in a very timely manor.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much eSalon!!!!</li>
            <li> It was the EXACT color I wanted!!!</li>
            <li> Very friendly and talk by phone or email for questions and concerns.</li>
            <li> so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair either by myself or done by a professional and never has it looked this good!  </li>
            <li> Liked my first color but received an email asking if I liked it or wanted to&amp;#34; tweek&amp;#34; it some.</li>
            <li> I went for a once a year high end spa hair trim/cut and the beautician didn&#x27;t know I dye it myself and commented it looked great.  </li>
            <li> First time was a bit too bright but they adjusted once I inquired about a change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny and the grey coverage was great!</li>
            <li> For those of you into an update or a full on change in the privacy of your own home or hotel...</li>
            <li> Best coverage on my grey around my face.  </li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars except that the color was warm when I was expecting cool.</li>
            <li> I tried e-salon for the first time this week and I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful coloring- had been covering my grey hair for years with drug store brands</li>
            <li> Perfect coverage for grey resistant hair.  </li>
            <li> Btw, I never leave reviews, so this just shows how excited I am!</li>
            <li> The e-salon team did a great job of interpreting what I wanted and explaining the new how-to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new esalon hair colour</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, and I am extremely pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a fantastic product for an awesome price!!!</li>
            <li> This is a real review from a real first time customer who is very satisfied!</li>
            <li> That kind of support is right up there with some of my favorite</li>
            <li> Just used my new hair color and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Without talking to me personally or seeing my hair, they sent me the most gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> I have had good results at the salon, but at a very high cost.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend  eSalon to everyone who wants superior results!!</li>
            <li> Great quality priducts and my hair is soft and managable.</li>
            <li> The color is consistent across orders, the instructions are clear, their supplies are awesome --</li>
            <li> When you sign up, you are added to auto-ship which is perfect for me because I finally found a great product and won&#x27;t go back to the shelf again!</li>
            <li> However,  with the great professional help from eSalon</li>
            <li> So if they are willing to play real safe, why do they induce the customer to try once more with a complimentary product?</li>
            <li> The lower stars are always genuine and give you a better idea of what people DON&#x27;T like about the product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny, the color gives it great dimension</li>
            <li> but as far as the match, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great product which cover grey well, lasts, and has nice tones.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied and changed my color for the first time.  </li>
            <li> and I really enjoy being able to switch up the color when i want to.</li>
            <li> The color was great and looks like a professional color job.</li>
            <li> Loved the whole way it was handled .</li>
            <li> I was suprised at just how good it really is.</li>
            <li> My whole experience was a good one, and my hair turned out just as I had hoed.  </li>
            <li> The eSalon product came in a great kit with clear instructions and was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t be easier, and I think it&#x27;s a superior product to what i would normally get at the grocery store!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that they could get the color so right based on questions and photos.  </li>
            <li> I had to mix my own to get the right shade and am so relieved that I can have salon-quality expertise and products delivered to me, and on a schedule</li>
            <li> I liked that I was able to upload a photo and their colorists actually looked at it and adjusted my color order to a better shade than I had selected on my own.</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged very nicely and directions were clear.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many high street brands and have liked some much more than others.</li>
            <li> They made the adjustments to my color after my first order that I was looking for and I love the color!</li>
            <li> It was true to color and the shampoo and conditioner they give you was so luscious!</li>
            <li> No dark ends and great condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never in my life would I ever use a product on my hair after reading that someone had a gob full of hair fall out!</li>
            <li> Other than that, perfect.</li>
            <li> The color is not as rich, but it lasts more than 1 to 12 days.</li>
            <li> My first color was just a bit more golden (but gorgeous) than I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with their service and working me to get the color that looks best for my skin type and natural color that I still have left.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time this weekend LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> A true convert!  </li>
            <li> The color was easy to apply and the instructions were easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> This product and instructions were so easy, my husband could do it for me.  </li>
            <li> Instructions easy to follow and fool proof.</li>
            <li> Easy to choose and/or change your schedule for coloring.</li>
            <li> It was easy to order, easy to change, and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide between two colors and having the models picture to play with made it easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to do</li>
            <li> I tried eSalon using their easy online process by answering color questions.</li>
            <li> It came with easy to use instructions,  if you can follow a recipe,  </li>
            <li> Directions were easy.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this so easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone is so helpful and understanding and responds very quickly to any questions one might have.  </li>
            <li> it is easy, I do it at my convenience.</li>
            <li> They include easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and so convenient.  </li>
            <li> but it was so easy and turned out just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Your website is easy to use to adjust timing of order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a kick to see my name on the bottles and the easy to follow personalized directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They make it so easy.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow, and the website provides all the information you need.  </li>
            <li> Easy application.  </li>
            <li> The process was easy and there was some difference but not what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Directions were easy to follow but it does help to have every thing laid out before you start.</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with and make any changes you may need.</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong that I had an allergic reaction to it - rapid heartbeat and nausea.</li>
            <li> The fume was unbelievably strong to the point that sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> Most professional and talented Team.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells strong, but cover up</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> It saves so much money, I am able to color my own hair and it looks like I went to the salon.</li>
            <li> Strong smell of ammonia; used in a ventilated bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company if you are looking for good color at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Pour the developer into the color, shake well, and apply beginning at the roots, making sure to give special attention to any parts.</li>
            <li> Two sets of gloves they gave you made it really nice; one for the first application and then one used for the rinsing and shampooing afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It covered my blonde highlights and gray hairs beautifully.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 2 stars because the color is excellent, and it colored all my gray; it&#x27;s just not worth the fumes.</li>
            <li> The first order I had was really nice</li>
            <li> ; My husband (who never notices anything after 29 years) immediately noticed my hair looked nice that first time I used esalon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update one year later: The color is beautiful but destroys your hair over time.</li>
            <li> The color turned out beautifully, has been lasting, and fully covers my gray.  </li>
            <li> The best aspect is that I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about the store&#x27;s not having my particular color when I need it because it is delivered directly to my house.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, instructions are easy and color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The grey coverage is superb and the shine is amazing and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> Also, the pump of the conditioner bottle would not function (shampoo was fine).  </li>
            <li> The instructions are detailed and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m more impressed with the frou-frou than being green!  </li>
            <li> Better than a salon and much more reasonable!</li>
            <li> The products are FANTASTIC and the products are packaged to make it easy to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> The color was exactly what I wanted, my incredible amounts of gray (or glitter as I like to call it) hair was completely covered, there was a sort of pearl essence to my hair, just like the colors name proclaimed.</li>
            <li> What things got adjusted to and created for me was perfect and exactly what I was actually looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I went to my stylist today and he told me I was lucky to have hair that color!  </li>
            <li> Requested a minor change and loved the results!</li>
            <li> I am very please, love the color!  </li>
            <li> I asked for a little adjustment and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li> The service is easy and user friendly.</li>
            <li> Plus it comes with some nice little extras and great packaging.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my hair feels and it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> The product is spectacular, and I&#x27;ll never use another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Shining Armor with my last order and it also is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> And after several weeks the color has not faded, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw and it still looks amazing every day, even using my own brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have asked them to &#x27;tweak&#x27; the color a few times and it&#x27;s always been done perfectly.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, especially in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li> Box hair colors in a light brown or  </li>
            <li> Bizarre.</li>
            <li> Never had such a happy outcome.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to do any guesswork to get great results, and I&#x27;ve already gotten several unsolicited compliments.</li>
            <li> How about looking fabulous and saving hours and lots of money at a salon?  </li>
            <li> I said I didn’t see that anywhere so it seems that it is very strategically place so that it isn’t noticeable, as I read everything because I have been duped by this kind of scheme before</li>
            <li> I said I didn’t see that anywhere so it seems that it is very strategically place so that it isn’t noticeable, as I read everything because I have been duped by this kind of scheme before</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and service.</li>
            <li> Their color safe shampoo and conditioner are totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li> also the condition is great at last</li>
            <li> What if the color was too light?...</li>
            <li> I use a sulfur free shampoo, so the color is not lightening.  </li>
            <li> I think if I could have told them the brand name and # from the stuff my salon uses, they would have filled it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> And something really simple that made me happy was they included two sizes of gloves.</li>
            <li> My hair was lighter at the bottom and needed to be filled before being dyed.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying this all over, as I enjoy reading the reviews about how shiny it makes your hair as well.</li>
            <li> I filled in the online profile questions and submitted a photo of my desired colour.</li>
            <li> My hair was so silky smooth after applying the conditioner</li>
            <li> Next kit was great.</li>
            <li> Out of time, I used it, everything I suspected was confirmed.</li>
            <li> ) she told how fabulous I looked also.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how happy I finally am with color!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I filled out the profile and questionnaire and uploaded two photos-</li>
            <li> Overall, I was really happy with the kit...</li>
            <li> colour is amazing, the accessories (stain protector, stain remover, REAL latex gloves) great and the lock in shampoo and the conditionner are simply to die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> eSalon is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a pet groomer, my name is Ana, and I run Ana Scissor Hands pet grooming, here in fantastic.</li>
            <li> the process was really simple and am so happy I found an affordable solution without having to go to the dreaded box.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the products I have purchased from e-Salon over last 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Love the golden highlights</li>
            <li> Fantastic..</li>
            <li> We bought one kit of supplies to share, and it really came in handy.</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner is light weight and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> This looks and feels fantastic, and at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> once I got in the shower and rinsed, shampooed and conditioned and dried my hair, the results were awesome.</li>
            <li> My hair color is very shiney and the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> things that are free in the package....</li>
            <li> I filled out the questionnaire and sent a picture.  </li>
            <li> I came across eSalon through nCrowd deals and thought I’d try it since it “sounded” good and supposedly professional type coloury, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I really love the color and it left my hair in really good condition.  </li>
            <li> LOVE love so much that I posted about it on my blog.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is in good condition and the creme rinse they provide leaves it silky soft.  </li>
            <li> I love the color and it was just right for my skin color.  </li>
            <li> and they get it right every time - even if they needed to talk to me to make sure they understand what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Also the color is lighter where the most gray was and does not look right.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all the people at esalon!!!</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t know what I did different, but I sure did!!  </li>
            <li> The gloves provided were very nice, but in doing the color myself, I think I will use longer gloves next time, so my forearms don&#x27;t get color on them from reaching over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also said that if I did not like the color, they would send the color I originally ordered FREE.  </li>
            <li> I must say that with eSalon my roots colored just as nicely as the rest of my hair and that was my main goal.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved my first color, then later requested slightly lighter for summer, and found it even more perfect!  </li>
            <li> I thought I was in for more than I bargained for, but the directions were clear and easy to follow!</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and my hair is soft, shiney and had great body.</li>
            <li> As a newly retired person, I appreciate the savings as well as the overall wonderful service and product.</li>
            <li> The customer service is very knowledgeable, nice and quick to respond.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t topically take the time to write reviews, but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Just used my first order from ESalon and really enjoyed the process.  </li>
            <li> worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and it is exactly what I requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I just used your products for the first time and I love the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use this product again.</li>
            <li> I described my hair, the original color, what I wanted it to look like and sent two photos.  </li>
            <li> It is really worth it!  </li>
            <li> She could not guarantee that I would be satisfied as in the first time</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it and followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Surprised and very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I saw this company and was excited that my color could be delivered to my door anytime</li>
            <li> esalon has a great product that covers the grey &amp; keeps it covered..</li>
            <li> Thank you I am so excited about my&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful</li>
            <li> I really like this product! :)</li>
            <li> but I will check with a representative from eSalon first:-)  </li>
            <li> My wife was advised to change the colour she had originally selected, and the results were beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would come out with something unique, maybe something i had never tried before.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all the products esalon offers.  </li>
            <li> A very true color they matched just right .  </li>
            <li> Well, I went from light blonde to a good match for my cherry wood furniture.</li>
            <li> You get 2 pairs of gloves, a packet of color safe shampoo to wash excess dye from your hair and a packet of color safe conditioner which leaves your hair soft like in the salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for many years and have used drugstore brands, mixed my own at wholesale beauty supply outlets, and had my stylist color it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this service - especially the options to choose how frequently you want to recolor.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m a natural red hair, and the color was perfect, covered my grays, and gave my hair the beutiful tone it always had.</li>
            <li> I discovered while applying the Feelin Smoothie product to my hair, that it is great for dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Be aware that when you first order you will be signed up for automatic delivery and make sure you upload a good picture in natural light so that they can formulate the your color want.</li>
            <li> and I had to clean up around me once I was done.  </li>
            <li> After a year with esalon, I&#x27;ll never go back to drugstore hair color - the product is worth every penny, and the service is great.</li>
            <li> We had so much fun playing hair salon together, and the instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Four days later and counting, my hair is soooo soft and gorgeous!!  </li>
            <li> well all the items to do my hair were so neatly and perfectly packaged, I was quite surprised for the low introductory price I paid.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, leaves your hair soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I use the True Blue once a week to keep my hair light and bright.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews, but felt this one definitely is worthy of one.</li>
            <li> However, it was easy to apply and the color is fabulous, just exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I filled out the questionnaire and submitted a photo; the consultant tweeked my color selection slightly from what I had stated in the questionnaire and it turned out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mix your own products before, but this stuff really is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product was mild to my scalp, covers my grays and left an awesome natural looking hue.</li>
            <li> The color, the step by step directions just for me, the way the shampoo and conditioner smelled made me eel special.</li>
            <li> Why eSalon added it to my specially formulated hair color is beyond me.</li>
            <li> boy, were they right!</li>
            <li> They were absolutely right!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll get it right!</li>
            <li> they always get it exactly right!</li>
            <li> Well, you guys got it soooo right!</li>
            <li> They ship it right to your door!  </li>
            <li> just want to let you know that I LOVE MY NEW COLOR!!</li>
            <li> process of creating a profile and choosing our colour was fun and easy, and the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> tell everyone where my terrific color comes from and how easy it is to use eSalon and have it delivered right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep up the good products and services you provide.</li>
            <li> I have experienced very little fading and was able to lengthen the time between coloring as a result.</li>
            <li> Tried eSalon for the first time last week and I am absolutely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I loved the consistency of the formula after it was mixed, not too goopy and not too runny.  </li>
            <li> Being able to start with the questionnaire and sending off a photo of my hair really eased my fears.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good product and left my hair silky, but for the smell.</li>
            <li> Even though the coloring process is a pain, but the price point of this product is good enough for me to order again.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to the eSalon team xx</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> Color, Shampoo n conditioner are great quality n left my hair soft n healthy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t look good with any red tones...</li>
            <li> but then if I go for ash to prevent any red, it doesn&#x27;t look good either.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and color much more</li>
            <li> kiss your colorist good by, then you will have extra cash for doing mani- pedi and look like a goddess !</li>
            <li> I am delighted and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to OTC hair color products</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> As a result I rinsed it four times x 20 minutes each time in my kitchen sink with the water spraying at full force.</li>
            <li> I loved the color, the personal service, and the follow up.  </li>
            <li> We are now full time RVers , so I don&#x27;t have a salon anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have never found a hair color so true to my own color and able to cover the stubborn grey hairs!</li>
            <li> This was by far the best color I&#x27;ve had in a long time!</li>
            <li> I have taken up doing my own manicures and wanted to do my own hair, because I work full time and have a grandbaby on the way - less appointments means happier me.</li>
            <li> eSalon&#x27;s color is easy to apply and I love the fact that the stain resistant product to apply near the hairline is provided.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use (just follow the instructions or go to the website for extra information) and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Everything is included in your order to make it easy and give you confidence enough to do your own coloring.  </li>
            <li> that goes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Surprisingly, they did call me back quite quickly and said that when I purchased, there was a notification at Check Out, AND that by checking out, I was agreeing to this.</li>
            <li> that goes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Surprisingly, they did call me back quite quickly and said that when I purchased, there was a notification at Check Out, AND that by checking out, I was agreeing to this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company and they are willing to go the extra mile to make sure that you&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> First it is extremely strong of chemicals and ammonia, which I do not use for my hair</li>
            <li> instructions were easy to follow, and not nearly as complicated as some others here have said.</li>
            <li> The step by step directions were easy to follow and the color turned out exactly how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Color is exactly what they say it will be and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the new color!</li>
            <li> After receiving it I was pleased but wanted more red.</li>
            <li> My sister thinks it is more vibrant than the color I was using.</li>
            <li> I sent pictures of myself and a description of my hair and desired color on the website and quickly received a package with hair color, a brush, stain preventer, stain remover (which I didn&#x27;t need), shampoo and conditioner, and two pairs of gloves.</li>
            <li> They have a loyal customer in me now.</li>
            <li> The color arrived quickly, including a stain blocker to rub on your skin at the hairline to keep the color from - you guessed it - staining my skin, a stain remover to remove any staining.</li>
            <li> I took quickly on my cell phone when I placed an order for what color I thought I would want.  </li>
            <li> I am giving up my hairdresser for overall color - and am able to save money and feel I am getting a better quality of product.</li>
            <li> I also love their additional products which help the color to last longer (the Devoted Hue Color enhancing mask and the Tinted Love Color Enhancing Treatment).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the best job at covering the gray roots, but it is enough of a mask that it gets me through until I can do a regular color.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal client of E-Salon and saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the product esalon pulled me back on the color to one color lighter which I was glad they did because the color they sent was more my color.  </li>
            <li> To sum it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> and even when it was close the colour faded so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am not yet sure how the &#x27;tinted love&#x27; product will maintain the colour as I have only used it once.</li>
            <li> The kit arrived quickly; it was well packaged and was personalized with my name, color, etc..</li>
            <li> also read in many reviews that the colorists from the company helped many customers to pick out their color and took the extra effort.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;d find an over-the-counter option, it would quickly be discontinued...or would ravage my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m very happy to say I am turning the auto shipment back on, possibly buying the shampoo and conditioner which felt like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed how shiny the color is and not a color i would normally pick dark brown</li>
            <li> The dialogue the stylist opened when I wrote and wondered if going lighter may be an option was tremendously helpful.  </li>
            <li> The 1st formula wasn&#x27;t perfect and they were very helpful with suggestions to alter it for round 2.  </li>
            <li> The most challenging part is getting back of my head covered ...</li>
            <li> The best part is I can tweak my color for my next order at no extra charge.</li>
            <li> better than the high dollar salons.  </li>
            <li> I recently used my first order of hair color - not only was the color ideal, but the products made my hair feel healthy and look shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love this color super easy to do and makes my hair healthy and shiny,  not like the other coloring boxes.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, color is excellent, no more grey hair, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my eSalon personally formulated hair color system.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The delivery is prompt and I am overall very glad I gave them a try.</li>
            <li> They could have turned off the auto delivery option the very first time they ordered.</li>
            <li> I think it hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I started going grey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m growing my hair long now because I know I can keep it looking good.</li>
            <li> I think that anyone who doesn&#x27;t try this is missing out of the deal of the century.&lt;br /&gt;The color is holding beautifully</li>
            <li> Good grey coverage, and even color.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled, totally satisfied, and know that next time will be better as I won&#x27;t be a total novice to the process.</li>
            <li> eSalon also included samples of their new color safe shampoo and conditioner which I will purchase.</li>
            <li> The new color has gotten many inquiries and compliments.</li>
            <li> glad I took the chance to try something new.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have all noticed the difference and love the new look.  </li>
            <li> love the new color.</li>
            <li> Not only is the color beautiful, it&#x27;s made my hair so soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> For someone who wants to color but can&#x27;t afford to spend a small fortune at a salon, eSalon is perfect.</li>
            <li> At my request, you remixed my dark brown color with more warm tones.</li>
            <li> They REALLY know what they are doing!!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about having to finagle with the formula, like my hair might not &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; at first, but even though I did need to go a bit darker and have a stronger formula to cover my stubborn grays, it was worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I have been looking for!  </li>
            <li> I changed my color this last shippment, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> What more could an old lady want!</li>
            <li> My color is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> THANKs esalon!!  </li>
            <li> I got exactly the color I wanted!</li>
            <li> On my 2nd order and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I get a permanent color as I am covering gray that I am not quite ready to accept!!  </li>
            <li> It is the exact color of my hair use to be ,before the gray started showing up!</li>
            <li> It may be more than the box  kind but certainly less than a salon.</li>
            <li> so I was worried that one bottle wouldn&#x27;t be enough but it was more than enough and it&#x27;s super easy to use and the color is amazing</li>
            <li> It was easy to use following the instructions and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to go with permanent color using peroxide (have sensitive, older skin), but it actually made my hair better and the best part is the natural color - not dyed looking-</li>
            <li> &amp; like I said, the ease of clean up was much easier on my skin!</li>
            <li> As someone who has been home colouring my hair for many, many years (at first just for a nice change and then over the last ten years out of necessity)</li>
            <li> I love it, great coverage, long lasting color and their other products are equally as good.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy shopping on line and shopping for great prices, hard to find items, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to not have to worry about coloring after a few shampoos too.</li>
            <li> i just recolored it same product and it looks amazing and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> The service is  well worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo and conditioner packets that come in the kit, so I bought a bottle of each for regular use.</li>
            <li> Hair is really, really soft afterwards and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> It is better than professional hair color.</li>
            <li> I was sent a kit with my custom color - Medium Brown - Pearl Golden.  </li>
            <li> It looks healthy, shiny, and soft.  </li>
            <li> Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried - I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was truly the color that I selected... and best part was that  ALL my grays were covered.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also it is rare that I would write a rave review about anything....</li>
            <li> The color came out just lovely and natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually fun to get their package in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use an OTC root touch up, I get a distinct line where that color is placed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw an ad about eSalon but did not give it a second thought, then I read a review and decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old daughter enjoyed watching me dye it.  </li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and mostly gray.  </li>
            <li> I was able to color correct a mistake made by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Again, I liked the system: they canceled all my subsequent orders, and offered me a complementary try.</li>
            <li> Take the time to fill out the profile carefully and upload good quality photos.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll change my color next time to something funky and fun like bright red! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74 years old and have never had so many complements on my hair.  </li>
            <li> They also have products that help you apply the color and products to keep your color fresh.</li>
            <li> On a final note, the day I colored I had a Doctor&#x27;s appointment, so dressed nice and put on make up.</li>
            <li> It was really nice to see a very personal approach from an online company!  </li>
            <li> My hair looks natural and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> The color did such a great job of hiding the gray around the front of my head; my hair is so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to be annoyed, but I tried what they sent me, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> And knowing that they will tweak my color any time I wish, is so exciting.  </li>
            <li> I used a golden blonde color, close to my own.</li>
            <li> This is the most true to my natural color and also the best &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; coverage I have ever had - natural looking reds are very difficult, but this turned out gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices charged by my hair stylist for coloring that I can now easily do myself.  </li>
            <li> I made a slight alteration and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> previously used Nice and Easy but couldn&#x27;t always get the colour</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the absolute best hair color I have ever used</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older and the gray has taken over, I usually do a light golden brown or a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> It adds just the right amount of copper back into my color to keep it bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The supplies I bought are superior to other beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> The convenience of having my color automatically arrive right about the time</li>
            <li> Everything I needed was right in the kit.</li>
            <li> Efficient delivery right to my door.</li>
            <li> No one ever got it right until I tried Esalon.</li>
            <li> Shipped right to your door.</li>
            <li> Also right away I could tell it was stripping my hair and the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> But I went to my stylist to get my hair colored, because I was going on a vacation and didn&#x27;t want to take the chance that eSalon might not turn out right.</li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser commented on the color.&lt;br /&gt;Great product with all you need delivered right to your  home.</li>
            <li> It is just right.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve answerd their questions and uploaded a photo of me, they get working on the right color for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the hair color right away.</li>
            <li> I got the kit in the mail and when I read the name of the color they sent I thought this couldn&#x27;t be right</li>
            <li> THE hardest color to get right.</li>
            <li> I used their enclosed shampoo and conditioner, as directed, right afterwards.  </li>
            <li> They got the color right, everything you need comes in the kit.</li>
            <li> They will work with you and get it right.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> I was struggling to find just the right shade of color.  </li>
            <li> right now you can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how they got it so right.</li>
            <li> We had to make adjustments to get to the right tone</li>
            <li> just right at a salon.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be just the right color, which over the counter boxed colors could not give me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have since gradually gone darker and more red, and have been contacted a couple of times by a colorist to make sure they understood what I wanted and to offer advice on the right way to move into new colors.</li>
            <li> They did an amazing job getting the color right, the product arrives in a solid package exactly when they say it will, and there&#x27;s no offensive odor.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between this product &amp; the cheap drug store stuff.</li>
            <li> the first time, with only a completed questionnaire and one photo, I liked the color.</li>
            <li> I tried eSalon for the first time last week and I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I am so happy about my hair color; it is the closest it has been to its natural color in a really long time.  </li>
            <li> After years of coloring my own hair, having it done in a salon and never quite getting the color just right (too dark brown, too much red tone, fading too fast) I finally have the PERFECT shade and tone - exactly what I asked for!  </li>
            <li> The second shipment was a little more but it is a great product and service and price.</li>
            <li> This costs more than hair color you can buy in the store, but much less than going to a salon, and the results are so much better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the first time buy, cuz you will be sold on it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, my custom color is amazing, it is better then the expensive color I got in the city.</li>
            <li> If you are a natural red head and the gray hair is starting to come in, this is the best color you can find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Too ashy, to dark then they would highlight my hair to make it look good.</li>
            <li> It covered ALL my grey and was the exact, precise color I asked for!!</li>
            <li> It was exceptional compared to the other products that I have tried to fix this problem.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my hair and take very good care of it, it is very long and very healthy, so if I endorse a product I&#x27;m pretty serious about it.  </li>
            <li> They ended up sending me a new color free of charge using express service</li>
            <li> The second time it washed out they sent me new color right away, and the new shipment looked great at first.  </li>
            <li> and then I realized that they were right the first time.</li>
            <li> If you do choose to use this product, I suggest having every window available open and every fan available to dissipate the fumes.</li>
            <li> The instructions were complete and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I slathered on my own intense conditioner and left on for 3 hours</li>
            <li> So I uploaded a few pics and explained to the colorist what I wanted to change about the color and the next shipment was PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I liked the whole concept, from how simple was to choose the color, to the system of sending me the color periodically.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I had had enough time to know how great this product actually is.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a phone call from your team who spent a good deal of time discussing my requirements.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in a complete package.  </li>
            <li> One hour later, I had a GORGEOUS, PROFESSIONAL HAIR color.  </li>
            <li> After ten days my color looks FANTASTIC and my hair feels FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> It completely covers the gray doesn&#x27;t fade out and looks good all the way up to the next color treatment.</li>
            <li> Liked it but wanted to see it dry.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy, shiny, medium brown with sparkly highlights, not flat at all and thank heavens, not brassy!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I called CS freaking out, I wasn&#x27;t super nice, but they calmed me down, said no worries</li>
            <li> My hair colour is spot on, and my hair is soft and super glossy!</li>
            <li> The online ordering process was very easy, I was presented with several hair color types to choose from, colors that would look good on me and that were possible considering my current hair color.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My advice: if you don&#x27;t quite like it at first, tell them what you don&#x27;t like and give it another try.</li>
            <li> I also bought the cup/brush &amp; clips &amp; it made dying my hair so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I colored three weeks ago and have had several compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair is looking.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to give eSalon a try, I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use them!</li>
            <li> then I read a review on this product and have been using ever since, although the first colour was not the exact colour</li>
            <li> I had first thought I would take the color to my colorist and ask her to apply it the first time.</li>
            <li> The colors last longer too; seem more resistant to sun and shampoo</li>
            <li> This was my first time.</li>
            <li> Saves me so much!  </li>
            <li> Color is exactly what I want, even when I change it.  </li>
            <li> I used my kit for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> What you have to do is follow the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> eSalon emailed me with additional questions after I first placed my order and have emailed since to see how it turned out.</li>
            <li> Most are grammatically similar with over use of the exclamation point.</li>
            <li> In fact when have you seen so many five star reviews without a spelling mistake and a short intro sentence followed by !</li>
            <li> Just tried ESalon for the first time and it didn&#x27;t meet expectations.</li>
            <li> First, it was the mixing of color and development agent.</li>
            <li> I did just use the esalon product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> It matches the color I was using  exactly.</li>
            <li> Top rate personal attention by the eSalon Team.</li>
            <li> Well the first time I ordered it was just about at the end of winter</li>
            <li> it is so pretty.</li>
            <li> I am ready for coloring again and can&#x27;t wait to use this product!</li>
            <li> I did my hair for the first time in my years.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product seems equal to what I paid a lot more for at a salon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never sorry.</li>
            <li> well worth the reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The reason I haven’t received the product is because it is auto-charged first, once it goes through, they ship it, takes up to 10 days.</li>
            <li> The reason I haven’t received the product is because it is auto-charged first, once it goes through, they ship it, takes up to 10 days.</li>
            <li> and ready made color just for me!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by the personalized packaging and detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> The color was EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely use this again!</li>
            <li> To my relief and somewhat surprise I put the color on and it was exactly the color I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I received my first shipment in July.</li>
            <li> I just used my first eSalon shipment yesterday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked after my first application.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> They matched my color exactly.</li>
            <li> When I saw an ad for eSalon, I decided to try it, and go with a more red shade, as my coloring works with it, my daughters, sister, and nieces are all red-heads.</li>
            <li> I emailed my colorist and told her what I wanted, and she did exactly what I asked.</li>
            <li> I emailed my colorist and told her what I wanted, and she did exactly what I asked.</li>
            <li> They work with their customers to get exactly what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> but the color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks eSalon!</li>
            <li> Well it looks like Esalon knows exactly what they are doing.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after sending my order, they sent an email to let me know they changed my color to a more flattering color for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> the color they recommended was exactly what I described in my order.  </li>
            <li> It arrived and there was more than enough product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Even my husband has comment on how pretty the color is.</li>
            <li> I used E-Salon hair color for the first time this weekend.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be reordering :-)</li>
            <li> I used esalon for the first time in April.</li>
            <li> I have larger hands and most dye kits</li>
            <li> Start to finish was literally the same as most box dyes need to develop and 1/4 of the time I spend in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is almost painfully obvious that &amp;#34;employees&amp;#34; have written most of the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I also recently tried the root cover wand and love that as well.</li>
            <li> When I first started receiving my hair color product I was asked to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> The price for my first shipment was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and this is the first attempt at coloring my hair</li>
            <li> I believe I first saw this product on Facebook and thought I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not an employee, and I know how to spell.</li>
            <li> is exactly what I need and want.</li>
            <li> First time coloring my hair....</li>
            <li> I was nervous doing so for the first time.</li>
            <li> I just colored my hair for the first time using esalon.</li>
            <li> My hair is exactly the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> Received my first shipment from eSalon...loved the look of the packaging...</li>
            <li> I ordered my first eSalon box in July 2014.</li>
            <li> The first thing she asked was how I was applying the color.</li>
            <li> I coloured my hair last Thursday and love it.</li>
            <li> I was so very worried!</li>
            <li> My hair actually came out healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> This was the first time using your product.</li>
            <li> When I do the 2nd touch-up I will see then if it was the color formula or me :)</li>
            <li> Thanks eSalon!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried esalon hair color.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully, several times, to make sure I knew what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought the kit contained product for two coloring sessions, but, then I realized that it is done in two steps, one for the roots and one for the ends.  </li>
            <li> Plus the staff are always willing to make adjustments upon request.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very manageable and shiny!  </li>
            <li> Well, I gave the team my request and on my first coloration</li>
            <li> Next time! :)</li>
            <li> I just tried for first time 2 days ago.  </li>
            <li> I got the exact color I wanted (no burgundy)</li>
            <li> Thanks e-salon!</li>
            <li> My hair is now the exact color I have  </li>
            <li> I tried my first bottle of eSalon about 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Love the color kit with everything needed, plus an extra pair of colorist gloves for just in case.</li>
            <li> But after sending pictures again, and receiving a root kit as well as color to adjust the rest, it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> First, smell..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a real £££ saver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and I&#x27;ve seen too many \\&quot;bottled</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my own hair for a long time now, and am very picky.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and colors trying to get the exact color I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I used the esalon custom color for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions exactly...</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and my hair was left in better condition than when I use box hair dye from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Also, I read where a customer&#x27;s credit card was charged for an additional after the first order, we&#x27;ll just so you know, after you order the first time, you are automatically signed up for auto delivery, but can turn it off immediately online.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the color I have been searching for over many years.  </li>
            <li> And on the first try.  </li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t remember signing up for regular delivery every so many weeks.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The gloss works great for extending shine in between coloring, but this color lasts at least 2 weeks longer than the store-bought color I was using.  </li>
            <li> Tried for the first time a couple weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this service.</li>
            <li> But I was able to let them know this after my coloring experience, so next delivery can be adjusted</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first</li>
            <li> Exactly the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I want</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I just recently tried this and was very impressed with the whole process - even though I sent them a questionable picture of me and my hair, they were able to formulate the right color.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too light and with the pale skin that a MN winter brings out in many of us, it was just right.</li>
            <li> They helped me pick the right color and really knew how to give me the help that I needed.  </li>
            <li> The perfect color AND esalon was smart enough to send me enough color to not only color my roots but to color my ends</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a day, but so far, I love the results!  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first when I learned they changed the formula I had chosen to better fit the results I was trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> I also love that they supply you with pretty much everything you will need such as 2 pair of gloves, packets of shampoo, conditioner, stain guard and stain remover (which I did not need).  </li>
            <li> The color is so natural and rich.</li>
            <li> The first, third, and fourth times I used esalon, the color was great and lasted 6 weeks (apart from my new root growth).  </li>
            <li> Super soft and shiny Will purchase again !</li>
            <li> Although the color came out all right, the quality of the color was similar to cheap box hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I not only got exactly what I wanted, but it has lasted, even after 6 shampoos &amp; still going strong.  </li>
            <li> , my hair was shiny, soft and the color looks rich and vibrant!</li>
            <li> After answering 10 easy questions or so &amp; uploading a current picture of myself a bottle arrived at my doorstep with almost exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I gave positive feedback</li>
            <li> but I am positive for this price and this quality I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but positive feedback on my hair</li>
            <li> At first I was very nervous about ordering hair color online.</li>
            <li> Even if the job is ok, it always needs redoing long before I can manage it again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I figured it would be worth a try and was better when comparing prices to the amount that I had to buy at the store to get complete white coverage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about my hair color since using this that I plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> They give you information to help with everything from application to products that will enhance your hair color experience as well as promote healthy hair and long color life.  </li>
            <li> After I colored my hair with my first order of eSalon, I noticed while I was drying it with a towel that it was very sticky.</li>
            <li> I color about every 6 weeks and honestly was buying whatever color brand was on sale in a dark brown/black.  </li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost my hair looks just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> They send the right amount of product in the right shade and ask you to indicate how frequently you want each kit.</li>
            <li> directions are simple, easy to follow and clear, the formulation is just the right consistency (no goop and no drips!)</li>
            <li> When I received the color it was packaged so nicely with little extras and I used a brush to apply the color for the first time.</li>
            <li> it is better than getting highlights and low lights, the different colors of blond in this color seems more natural.  </li>
            <li> I even use half the developer and half the color each time because it really doesn&#x27;t take a full bottle to color the roots, and have had great success doing this.</li>
            <li> Finally after many years of using box color, I now have  my original color back!</li>
            <li> I sent them a photo of my hair color and told them I liked the light to medium blonde color and wanted to cover the increasing grey new growth.  </li>
            <li> The color is so natural and colors grey amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about the customized directions instructing me to color the roots with the first and the ends with the second bottles, but it turned out FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Finally, they also conveniently supply all of the tools needed to make the do-it-yourself experience as easy as posibble.</li>
            <li> ; I didn&#x27;t have a photo to send that showed my color properly, so I chose a shade that looked easy to move to, described my color and cut, and waited.</li>
            <li> when I got my order and applied it, I almost super surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> When I finally used the product it was easy not messey.  </li>
            <li> Granted, when it does finally come out it looks great, but it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle for me.</li>
            <li> A week later and color still looks bright and grey still covered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mixing was easy - there were only two products to combine and I put them in a bowl, stirred with the applicator brush that was included.  </li>
            <li> but it was easy enough for me to do myself.</li>
            <li> Also, the illustrations and instructions that accompany the product are easy to follow, along with the hair clips, which are not only convenient but also durable.  </li>
            <li> And again, is so strong it actually wasn’t even rinsing out</li>
            <li> The inside pictures really don&#x27;t look as good as taking a picture in the sun, but I&#x27;m usually at my desk when I think about it.</li>
            <li> I did NOT notice a strong smell while coloring my hair, but when I got into the shower to pour the remaining color (mixed with water) over my hair as the instructions said to do, that smell DID become overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The color is long lasting and does a good job at covering the gray.</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re so affordable and the team at eSalon are highly attentive and work very hard to make sure you&#x27;re well looked after!</li>
            <li> Esalon certainly provides results close to salon quality.</li>
            <li> They are very high quality and turned my straw like hair into super soft hair.  </li>
            <li> I loved everything about the kit from the quick shipping to the custom color kit right down to the pink gloves!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my esalon result seems to be color that will last and stay more true till the next application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Might cost me more than the over-the-counter ones but its worth it and still tons less than what you would pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> I just sent an email describing my fine hair and the color I wanted, and they put it together and sent it back to me.  </li>
            <li> I told my colorist that the gold level was fine, but I needed the red punched up just a shade.</li>
            <li> I told my colorist that the gold level was fine, but I needed the red punched up just a shade.</li>
            <li> process was actually quicker than most at home products, I LOVE that the processing time is much less than what I am used to.</li>
            <li> Most other colors leave my gray a &#x27;funny&#x27; color.</li>
            <li> had my hair colored at a very high end Houston salon 5 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It certainly is comparable to salon color and they really do tweak color for you.</li>
            <li> The color was changed to a little darker which I liked</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled with the little gift of gloss I received</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right color, my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair color one can purchase without having to go to an expensive salon.  </li>
            <li> Covered my  very gray roots 100% .</li>
            <li> It turned out better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair color to anyone!</li>
            <li> The color came out better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> No stain around my hairline thanks to the packet of stain protection gel they provided.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, esalon.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to do much.</li>
            <li> I filled out the feedback form for my next shipment, it was reviewed and my color changed.</li>
            <li> Thanks esalon.</li>
            <li> So much easier to schedule than having to go to a salon...</li>
            <li> haha, what are the chances.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is absolutely toxic.</li>
            <li> More than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks esalon.</li>
            <li> I have told anyone who will listen and everyone wants to try it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the ESalon Team!</li>
            <li> but this was so much easier</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Makes it SO much easier to apply the color.  </li>
            <li> High recommend!</li>
            <li> I always use the shampoo and conditioner they send, it lasts for two shampoos as my hair is very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say they can&#x27;t make one light enough!</li>
            <li> ever so gentle..</li>
            <li> My eSalon package came today (really fast) and I have colored my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a painless process, fast, and with 100% guarantee, no risk involved.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Jules in England, UK</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it had a coating of glue or wax on it and as much as I kept trying to rinse it off</li>
            <li> really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate recommending eSalon to anyone and everyone that colors their hair and wants the quality of the salon with the expense of a home color.</li>
            <li> Thanks E Salon</li>
            <li> Thanks....  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Esalon</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the following day, I received an email suggesting that the colour I had chosen seemed a bit too light and one of the eSalon colorists would adjust it</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t know where some of the comments come from.</li>
            <li> Thanks eSalon</li>
            <li> their shampoo and conditioner is way too much for me to buy.  </li>
            <li> fast forward 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I saw no evidence of cutting corners, they even sent a battery with the timer and the clips were perfect for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Oh...the tint to use in between has really helped as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> After spending way too much money and time at salons I gave eSalon a try.  </li>
            <li> It was much easier than using the squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY COLOR -</li>
            <li> That put moisture back into my hair and my hair looked fabulous, once again.  </li>
            <li> Better than l ever expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks eSalon and</li>
            <li> They are really staying tuned to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the leave in conditioner has made my hair much easier to manage and looks healthier than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> you so much e-Salon</li>
            <li> I was paying so Much for something I used to do for a living.  </li>
            <li> I have very resistant gray hair</li>
            <li> Frankly, the person I worked with did choose a color for me, but that really was it.</li>
            <li> I find the staff to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much shinier and bouncier with this</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks esalon staff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very well priced</li>
            <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for my custom color.</li>
            <li> I really admired the packaging / presentation,  too.  </li>
            <li> They personally make your hair color, providing colors available, then you send them a photo</li>
            <li> Their Customer Service has been very helpful in trying to get the shade I have in mind.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend eSalon for home hair coloring!</li>
            <li> Thanks eSalon for all of your follow up and caring about your product.  </li>
            <li> It was very helpful to talk on Skype with someone who  gave an advice.</li>
            <li> The colorists have been very helpful in helping me make adjustments and to understand just how color works on our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This hair color was the exact opposite of what I have experienced with hair color in the past.</li>
            <li> For nearly 10 years I&#x27;ve been coloring my gray roots, and for the last 4 or so years, it&#x27;s been more than once a month.</li>
            <li> after dying my hair with a box color from the store for over 13 years, i finally have a color that no only is beautiful but it covers the grey around the frame of my face &amp; it stays colored...</li>
            <li> Most recently I&#x27;ve been using Clairol Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li> There are really nice tones to the colour and it looks different in different lighting.</li>
            <li> The websites all talked about how sticky it is, and that it is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it; later I decided I wanted a little lighter, and they did it just right-</li>
            <li> 2nd Application since becoming a new customer.</li>
            <li> is so soft and shiny after my coloring it with their products!!!</li>
            <li> I was in a bit of a hurry and did a pretty sloppy job - and yet my hair looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> a super sensitive skin, and psoriossis, and normal hair color makes my hair fall out</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and everyone has complemented me on my new colour</li>
            <li> Looks natural and eSalon got the color right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair myself with another brand I loved for years, but when I saw this product and how they used not only my picture and other details but also my goals and desires, I wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li> No store product can match my red hair and I didn&#x27;t want a complete change, just a more vibrant look</li>
            <li> the greatest disappointment came this morning when I receive a message from eSalon confirming a new charge to my credit card to an order I did not place!  </li>
            <li> Very professional people that you work with to find your exact hair color.</li>
            <li> of course I was mad at myself, then curiosity got the best of me.</li>
            <li> I might add that due to a glitch in mail service, the team at esalon provided outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li> so was willing to spend a little more money to get that.  </li>
            <li> this is the first product that matched my natural color!</li>
            <li> They came pretty close to matching my color from the pictures I sent on the first try and nailed it on the second which I&#x27;ve used consistently now for 5 months.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the color and their other products.  </li>
            <li> My hair has felt softer after with other brands but think it&#x27;s more a conditioner issue, and may just depend on one&#x27;s hair type.  </li>
            <li> Tried it again, but used less developer and more light blonde.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I described as wanting, the vibrant color doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; it appears very natural.  </li>
            <li> When I first put the new dye on the parts of my hair that are highlighted quickly turned blue!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than my natural color, and I love it!</li>
            <li> No straw feeling afterwards,  good gray coverage, long lasting and little frizz which I can easily manage with a frizz serum</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t get a reply, I went back into the site, filled out a new profile and reordered.  </li>
            <li> There is very little odor, and actually there is a hint of a very nice floral scent.</li>
            <li> The instructions were simple and every thing you would need was right in the kit!  </li>
            <li> Everything about my experience with eSalon has been positive and professional!  </li>
            <li> Then I began receiving compliments about how natural and pretty my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> I was even complimented by my very expensive hair stylist that my color was wonderful!</li>
            <li> The roots were exactly what I wanted and as the old darker colored hair grows out, I believe my continued use of this coloring will be what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The cost savings is awesome compared to what I have spent getting my hair professionally colored  --- at least $100 savings...  </li>
            <li> First class product the colour was fab and the condition of my hair afterwards was glossy and soft</li>
            <li> And if you order by phone with these companies, record the full conversation and state that you do not agree to any Auto-Purchases or future charges to your credit card.and to refund me immediately.</li>
            <li> And if you order by phone with these companies, record the full conversation and state that you do not agree to any Auto-Purchases or future charges to your credit card.</li>
            <li> While I liked those results I was never able to get the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for 7+ years now after moving (therefore not able to go to the stylist who I&#x27;d trusted for 7+years before.).</li>
            <li> When I started turning gray and began coloring my hair, finding the right color was a major chore.</li>
            <li> Very lightly and lasting only a week or two.</li>
            <li> Well, two years have gone by &amp; I noticed little bits of gray are really showing up on me even more despite coloring it with Loreal.</li>
            <li> – today I note that this company eSalon has charged a brand new charge to my credit card of $29.95 !?</li>
            <li> I was more then a liittle afraid of using the ESalon color but as soon as I blew my hair out my first reaction was ,,THERE I AM!!!!</li>
            <li> I have never sent them a picture, but based on my description of skin tone, natural hair color (not sure I actually remember what that is, except maybe gray), etc., as well as the sort of color I wanted, they mixed up my formula perfectly.</li>
            <li> Rather than going along with what I thought I wanted, an honest, professionals opinion was given, and I appreciate that SO very much more than just having a sale and a potentially unhappy customer.  </li>
            <li> But to have a color formulated for me, to have a stylist that I can contact, to be able to change the formula slightly...</li>
            <li> I have become a life member of eSalon, and feel that I have top professionals at the end of a call, or an email away;  which they answer within an hour or less.</li>
            <li> Much better than the color I had tried previously.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try eSalon mainly because they custom make your hair color.  </li>
            <li> This dye left my hair all the same color, and helped hide what I thought was thinning hair on top.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the exact same color I received the first time.</li>
            <li> There are SO many very similar reviews on this product that it&#x27;s obvious they have been paid to write them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a color product leave my hair super shinny and then stay that shinny over 6 weeks later.</li>
            <li> So be realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li> I did notice a bit more red in the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got into the shower for the last part, dumping the remainder of the &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; coloring mixed with water onto my hair and then rinsing it all out.  </li>
            <li> and there were many websites touting castor seed oil for African American hair.</li>
            <li> I just tried my customized hair color in natural light blonde which is like a level 9 box color from a store.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results, much more so than the result from the very expensive salon I went to.</li>
            <li> After years of coloring my own hair, with occasionally disastrous results, I tried eSalon for the first time and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; with the brush, bowl and clips.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li> highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to pay the extremely high prices to have someone color my hair.  </li>
            <li> They said that they don&#x27;t have the high lift ingredients that L&#x27;Oreal does.</li>
            <li> Well, I never used any high lift products by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I could go on raving about it, but I highly recommend that you try it if you&#x27;re looking for hair color that</li>
            <li> I feel the price is too high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who home dyes.</li>
            <li> but the price is now so high I decided to have a go myself.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the gloss.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have to &#x27;find&#x27; someone to color my hair, (plus pay the high cost)</li>
            <li> Exactly the right amount of red, and the closest to my natural color</li>
            <li> She did not offer any other choices or really advise me on the colors that would fit my complexion.</li>
            <li> Read their fine print carefully.</li>
            <li> I would go so far as to suggest wearing a respirator that one wears when working with certain paints and varnishes.</li>
            <li> The instructions are crystal clear!!</li>
            <li> I also mentioned to eSalon that I wanted a little more warmth to my hair color.  </li>
            <li> This is salon color at just a little more than grocery store price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love the color, I have adjusted it and am still adjusting it, a little with each order.</li>
            <li> the next batch i got was exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> Wow!!  </li>
            <li> My older daughters helped me apply it; nice thick mixture that didn&#x27;t drip.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to color as it pulls red very easily and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I recently asked them to adjust the color to make it a little lighter, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely convenient, easy to use</li>
            <li> It was hard because I still liked my time at the salon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more money, but worth the extra cost since you can get just the shade you want.  </li>
            <li> My hair has hard to cover grey and this hair color covered my grey just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful if you don&#x27;t have incredibly strong hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical (because of my experience with those brands found in the drugstore), but was hopeful after reading all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The odor is minimal, and the gloves actually fit my hands.</li>
            <li> The two colors blend seamlessly and absolutely look like a salon job.</li>
            <li> The color lasts so much longer than my old box stuff too.</li>
            <li> The color is natural, they got my requests absolutely correct-</li>
            <li> I surprised when I received my package the very day</li>
            <li> Not too dark with nice deep copper highlights.</li>
            <li> It completely covers the grey, and the color is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I went from using a temporary color that was supposed to be a warm chestnut brown but turned my hair copperish to choosing the esalon&#x27;s permanent dark blonde color.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it is full and soft, even though I applied the color only to my roots.</li>
            <li> and I know of a few that are satisfied customers themselves now.</li>
            <li> They have called me to chat about what I want and what&#x27;s possible to achieve; and even sent me a complimentary color when things just didn&#x27;t go the way we knew</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel normal.  </li>
            <li> The first 3 times it barely covered the gray and my color, although adjusted each time, was not at all what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> After years of boxed colors and even more years at salon colors (not to mention the amount of money I wasted)</li>
            <li> Lovely presentation and a few freebies also.</li>
            <li> It was good, but not great, and over time started to make my hair increasingly straw-like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I got tired of the gray hair and had heard good things about the product</li>
            <li> Colors grey completely and exactly the right shade of the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and my hair looks vibrant and so natural!  </li>
            <li> I was so nervous, because I had never colored my hair myself, but the directions were very clear, and I did the strand test beforehand, which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Super disapointed and am going back to my old color routine.</li>
            <li> My hair was also more dry than with my regular over the counter product.  </li>
            <li> I have strong red tones in my hair and wished to colour my hair with a none red result.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good about this product, and from other reviews I&#x27;ve read, everyone feels the same way.  </li>
            <li> My next color was right on</li>
            <li> only criticism is that the ends of my hair became brittle right after using the coloring.  </li>
            <li> I will try the next shipment to see if they can get the color right; if not, I will discontinue the automatic delivery system.</li>
            <li> I just tried eSalon for the first time; I was skeptical and haven&#x27;t colored my own hair in over 10 years, and I was very concerned I would ruin my hair color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; for this new hair color.</li>
            <li> I telephoned and was repeatedly asked did I do a new profile?  </li>
            <li> You can select the frequency of new product (number of weeks) and they communicate every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The doc asked if I&#x27;d used any new hair products</li>
            <li> ALWAYS read the lowered starred reviews on a new product.  </li>
            <li> I an a new customer of ESalon.</li>
            <li> Taking into consideration of the new growth of course.</li>
            <li> I moved out of state and have not found a new colorist, so I decided to try eSalon.  </li>
            <li> No I don&#x27;t work for them, I am just a new customer.</li>
            <li> and I feel like a new person.  </li>
            <li> My 1st order came damaged and they promptly mailed a me a new box.  </li>
            <li> That said, she was nice enough to refund me which will take a few business days, and turned off the auto-purchase on my account.</li>
            <li> That said, she was nice enough to refund me which will take a few business days, and turned off the auto-purchase on my account.</li>
            <li> I paid $125.00 at the salon a few months ago, and my hair didn&#x27;t look as healthy and natural as it does today, one week after I did it myself at home.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair with10 % gray streaks and wanted to go more red with a color that did not look pink over my gray as it faded.  </li>
            <li> I started out med brown since it is closest to my natural hair color and my main goal was covering the gray.</li>
            <li> The water never cleared completely; there was a steady stream of bubbles coming out of my hair.</li>
            <li> the directions, they were very clear..</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend those busy moms like me to dye their hair at home.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not brassy and my hair is very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> very professional presentation.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t colored my hair since I was very young.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering professional brand quality hair color to the general public, without the super high prices.</li>
            <li> The grey coverage is super and the color is natural.  </li>
            <li> Added the first color aghhh, it was brown, then added the second color mahogany, another aghhh.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li> After selecting my color for the first time and uploading the picture, they wrote me back and suggested to change my color choice. . .</li>
            <li> so I never have to worry about ordering in time for my next order, plus it comes in a pretty, personalized box.</li>
            <li> They sent me the exact shade of red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to economize, and letting go of my monthly visit to the salon was a logical choice, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to go back to using store brand hair color.</li>
            <li> I also love their other products such as leave in condition and root touch up.</li>
            <li> Have been using it since first heard of it last year.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I actually had gray coverage.</li>
            <li> , it was soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> I originally chose a color, but after I submitted a picture, they recommended a different color based on my current color, complexion, etc.  </li>
            <li> Am pleasantly surprised at how well you matched my color!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and I look as if I&#x27;m still paying to have my hair professionally done!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft shinny now!  </li>
            <li> This time I wanted a shade lighter, so the instructions were to put the first bottle on my roots, and the second on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully, make sure you hit your part lines and hairline completely, and if possible, get a friend to help</li>
            <li> and I want it to look glossy and natural!  </li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last week.</li>
            <li> not only followed the directions exactly, but watched their online tutorial.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed exploring some of the other related products they offer.  </li>
            <li> It was very simple to do, I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The first time it washed out esalon gave me a credit toward my next order.  </li>
            <li> And it looks like it has natural highlights, too!</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this professional quality product for us to use at home!</li>
            <li> It was exactly the color I had prior to going gray...</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I used my eSalon custom color for the first time last night...</li>
            <li> Second was when I started opening bottles and mixing solutions, OMG the smell was straight out of a hair salon!</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li> The colour I received in my initial order was exact to what I wanted and was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised he said something!  </li>
            <li> At $10 for your first bottle of custom mixed hair color</li>
            <li> and my hair was the exact same color as before.  </li>
            <li> I have a large amount of grey in my hair and the coverage is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I had to work a little harder, I am very pleased with the results &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow--I would recommend paying the few extra dollars for bowl, brush and clips for your first time.  </li>
            <li> For my first order, I was told they made me a different color than I had originally ordered and was a little afraid to try it, but I loved the color I got!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products only to have a complete hair disaster that had to be corrected at a salon until now.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair highlighted using only about 10-12 foils just to give it more deminsion as it was beginning to get too dark for my age.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the shade as it is as close to my natural colour as I requested</li>
            <li> Due to a change in tone (from golden to copper), it required two different sets of color that were sent to me (second free of charge).</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for 10+ years due to greying early and used many different at home products as well as had professional hair coloring done.  </li>
            <li> Wow, even the smell announced that this was no ordinary over the counter product.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced better customer service, anywhere!  </li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re comfortable coloring your own hair or have someone to do it for you, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think too much of it, and when it was time to color again, did the same thing with my new shipment.</li>
            <li> look younger and my new haircolor really looks natural and compliments my skintone.  </li>
            <li> Very vibrant and longer lasting than store bought brands.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the ammonia as my colorist had always used an ammonia free brand; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been detrimental to my hair at all.</li>
            <li> My color was a little darker initially, but when I called to ask how to change it, the representative was MORE than helpful.  </li>
            <li> I had to quickly look through the medicine cabinet to look for other solution.</li>
            <li> Sure application can be a little messy (red) but the color and highlights are fantastic.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to loose, full money back guarantee or new formulation of your color request will be sent to you.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, coarse and very porous hair</li>
            <li> Using your product, all of my hair is the same color, it is very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> This is so much easier on my budget (obviously).  </li>
            <li> The dye appears to be creating or picking up on my natural highlights and lowlights.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Customer support fixed the situation the day I informed them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old.</li>
            <li> Have been coloring my hair since I was 24 years old.</li>
            <li> My sister is a professional and said, &amp;#34;Please don&#x27;t tell anyone about this!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> had some my usual tried and true light blonde color and developer, and left it on for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> have short hair and have it cut every few weeks and my hairdresser always comments on the lovely condition of my hair and how natural the colour looks.</li>
            <li> I have always had a professional colorist.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried box hair color but never thought it looked natural.</li>
            <li> I have always had my hair coloured professionally but thought I would give this a go after reading about it in woman and home magazine.</li>
            <li> color is so natural looking!!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I clearly saw on the web site about recurring orders, so am surprised that others missed this.  </li>
            <li> Note: If you have a sensitive nose, you should think before trying it.</li>
            <li> My hair came out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This has saved me money since professional color in a salon was costing me over $100.00.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny too.  </li>
            <li> I have always gone to a professional when it came to my hair.</li>
            <li> Still a bummer, but definitely not their fault and they handled it really well.</li>
            <li> They truly care about their customers and provide professional guidance and help 24/7.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used  professional as well as box brands.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural that even my statist tells me how professional my hair looks.</li>
            <li> this at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I’ve had professional hair colours and also drug store colours for 3 decades</li>
            <li> God only really knows what’s in their formula.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> and it takes only about 30-40 minutes for whole process.  </li>
            <li> but after took a bit of my hair to see what the color would be, I was surprised it was just the color</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and it shines.</li>
            <li> I am completely surprised that it turned out as well as it did.</li>
            <li> The color really surprised me too.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny, and the product didn&#x27;t burn like the salon treatment.</li>
            <li> By far the highest quality hair coloring I have ever used at home.  </li>
            <li> I have found a hair colour that looks natural</li>
            <li> I followed enclosed instructions and was completely flabbergasted with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years; however, I always wished a professional would tell me what color I should color my hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently wrote to them when they sent me notice, which they do every month, that it was time to get my order ready, &amp; asking if I had any changes I wanted to make.</li>
            <li> The color covers my gray, make my hair soft and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Colour has not faded as much as if buying a dye from a shop or even from a salon, Iwill definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair color, how soft and shiny ma hair are after the treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately my shower stall is beige.&lt;br /&gt;However, I may not have diluted the leftover dye enough, and had too much in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The professionally mixed formula is always illustrated for me, so I know how much Mahogany, Ash, etc.</li>
            <li> I got the kit, and was extremely surprised at the contents.</li>
            <li> Color covered completely.</li>
            <li> Everyone has said that it looks soooooo natural.  </li>
            <li> I work in Manhattan and have been getting my hair colored near work.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> far as the auto-ship and the color, if you go into your profile you can change when you get your order and you can change your color as well.</li>
            <li> After decades of costly professional hair colouring, I decided to go out on a limb and try eSalon.</li>
            <li> No harsh coloring that&#x27;s a plus...</li>
            <li> so I gave up on professional color a while ago and went to the OTC color.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural.</li>
            <li> Stay far, far away.</li>
            <li> It comes out soft, shiney, and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> I am ecstatic and completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I have been coloring for 35 years, premature gray and experimental.</li>
            <li> The company is very helpful when you want a color change or to adjust frequency of future deliveries.</li>
            <li> I have never had my hair my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li> It does not look like it has been colored; it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> There are highlights in it and they look natural.  </li>
            <li> and they way they present so much help and</li>
            <li> How about how personal, it had the description, on the instruction of how much of every color it got, so go ahead</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and was shiny and there is none of the gummy feel that I have read about?  </li>
            <li> I have been paying so called professional hairdressers a lot of money and never getting the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> As far as I understand it, she just went by the picture I sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used professional color as well as permanent and Demi permanent from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> My friends thought I&#x27;d been and had my hair professionally</li>
            <li> I have used professional services as well as store brand at home products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from esalon as I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold it.</li>
            <li> Directions were thorough and concise.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I started turning gray in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so I needed something to cover that and enhance my natural color.</li>
            <li> straw-like after each application but is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> He was surprised it came from a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asking for a tweak for my next delivery, but they have been very responsive and communicative.  </li>
            <li> Professional advice as to the correct custom shade for your skin tone and desired outcome.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> After shampooing and conditioning with the samples, my hair was soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> After coloring hair, the ends of hair seemed like straw; but after washing twice, then using the conditioner all over, hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> is completely colored and</li>
            <li> so I went with the demi permanent color that matched my natural hair color.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous because the directions said I was to only apply to my roots and not the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using their products.</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from their site.</li>
            <li> I had colored said it looked so natural.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did the final shine rinse in the shower since that part is a bit messy</li>
            <li> Most reds wash out within a few weeks, but with eSalon&#x27;s colour, it actually stays until I re-colour every 2 months.</li>
            <li> It has kept my color vibrant and no grey hairs at my temples!  </li>
            <li> since we don&#x27;t see each other often we r just kinda in our own little space when I am there.</li>
            <li> It will be a little more expensive than box color, but the added benefit of better conditioned hair in the long run is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The first color I received came out with slightly lighter roots (most likely due to old color on the ends of my hair at the time).</li>
            <li> With just a few words describing my original hair color, eSalon got it as close to NATURAL color as I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> So, I gave Esalon another try and asked them to make a few changes on my original color that I ordered.</li>
            <li> I originally started with the permanent color, but have just begun using their demi-permanent (washes out in a few weeks).</li>
            <li> so I avoid them at all costs, but I was so excited I took a few pics and posted them online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the list is endless and I am having fun with whoever reads this.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair naturally which I normally dye it to a light natural blonde and have some highlights throughout.</li>
            <li> It felt like I was getting so much more than a regular boxed color, which I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> ESalon is the FIRST and ONLY product that hasn&#x27;t made me look like a &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li> first color wasn&#x27;t red enough, and needed the gold punched up as well.</li>
            <li> and they sent me the same color I&#x27;ve been using for a long time (medium golden brown).  </li>
            <li> As a busy mom, with three kids, I don&#x27;t have time for the salons and the grocery shelf boxes for a natural red are anything but natural (and yes, reds do gray!)</li>
            <li> Really no different than the instructions with any of the other products I&#x27;ve used - don&#x27;t color clean hair, divide it into sections, holding the sections with plastic clips</li>
            <li> Also, I should mention, low odor, zero mess and super shiny hair!</li>
            <li> Nothing short of WOW!!  </li>
            <li> I love all of the little extra touches too with the packaging and personal help.  </li>
            <li> The result came out better than I expected and matched the existing color that I had done at a salon previously.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color washed out of my hair very quickly every other time (yes, I use a color safe shampoo).  </li>
            <li> I really like the texture of my hair since coloring it, it&#x27;s not straw feeling and the roots were covered well, even the grey.</li>
            <li> who really does grey</li>
            <li> I asked for dark blonde with gold and that&#x27;s what I got - my hair is now a bit brighter &amp; lighter than my original hair colour</li>
            <li> The color I get from my stylist is a dark brown with golden highlights.</li>
            <li> She ordered a complimentary ends (everything but the roots), lighter color to be shipped with my next order to bring the rest of my hair back to the same color as my roots.</li>
            <li> The only thing different from other hair color products was to add water to any color you have left until it&#x27;s about half water/half color, and add that to the coloring in your hair (best to do this in the shower, it can get messy) and work it in until it&#x27;s like a creamy shampoo.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star ONLY because I&#x27;m still a new customer and have a wait and see attitude about things.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new, and ordered their ash blonde color (guaranteed to color the gray!).</li>
            <li> 2 days later email from esalon requested that I phone since they couldn&#x27;t retreive the new profile.  </li>
            <li> They only continue to live up to their promises and their products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and really gives my color staying power.</li>
            <li> So I left a very stern message that I did not agree to any further charges or purchases and to refund me immediately.</li>
            <li> Fast, personal and specific to your issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had enough product left over to mix back in the bottle with water and use to \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; my hair just before rinsing, and it all rinsed clean pretty easily (not so with some OTC products).  </li>
            <li> Everything u need is in the box, right down to two pairs of gloves.  </li>
            <li> My husband actually told me it looked very natural after I told him I had colored my hair.</li>
            <li> The second month, I did only the roots with the root color and the red tint on the rest of my hair exactly per instructions.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This color is so close to my original hair color, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have changed no other product I use except now if I use all the creme and seriums</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am willing to do it again, due to the awkwardness of holding arms up, etc.  </li>
            <li> It went on dark at first, but after a few shampoos the true color and highlights came out.  </li>
            <li> The eSalon team recommended a color slightly lighter than I had picked and they were right on.  </li>
            <li> and I think the main reason is because it didn&#x27;t cover the grey well, if at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend eSalon to anybody, and I plan on having a long relationship with them myself.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a high quality product at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I sent in several pictures of myself at different times of the year and the recipe was dead on accurate.  </li>
            <li> I t is clearly stated that your will be charged for next shipments and.</li>
            <li> When signing up, apparently there&#x27;s an auto-renew option (not fond of that) which caused an order to be placed automatically.  </li>
            <li> Also the frequent use of a double !!</li>
            <li> , any gray is very noticeable; I am not ready for that</li>
            <li> is nothing short of lush.</li>
            <li> My hair is a natural strawberry blonde</li>
            <li> I wanted to go back closer to my natural color instead of being lighter.  </li>
            <li> My natural colouring is a &#x27;copper blonde&#x27; although it tends to go darker during the Scottish winters.  </li>
            <li> The first color selection was way to dark.  </li>
            <li> In a week, I had a color made specifically for me from three different shades, along with professional colorists tools and directions.  </li>
            <li> Application was a bit more involved than my usual routine, but really, I think this showed how not thorough my usual routine was.  </li>
            <li> My hair was five different colors and they  fixed it...</li>
            <li> Plus I have the natural looking color from my youth back!</li>
            <li> Such soft hair</li>
            <li> I have been getting my hair dyed red for a while professionally, but my hairstylist is moving</li>
            <li> twisted my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair for the night, but even when it was wet, I was impressed with the richness of the color, the softness of my hair, and how even as dark as my forehead looked during application, I used the wipe in the kit before rinsing and there was no hair color stain left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This year I spent 300 at an expensive salon to do a balayage hair color (which I only liked the first day)...</li>
            <li> , i did the online question and told them no red, first time in a long time, there is no red tones.</li>
            <li> The parts that were blue rinsed out completely and the the color was even throughout.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve simply gone with professional products and saved the life of my hair.</li>
            <li> This was much easier to use then I expected.  </li>
            <li> At the same time my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I shampooed twice with it and my hair finally felt back to normal.  </li>
            <li> so needless to say i am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I have tried boxed color many before too and normally not happy with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they are true geniuses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making my hair color disasters a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted my hair a little redder, so I think I should have looked at samples of their colors, instead of just using their survey questions to develop the right color for me.  </li>
            <li> The coloring process took a little longer than it does with the typical drug store color, but I think that&#x27;s because the coverage is so much better</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not easy to get red right!  </li>
            <li> They had adjusted the color for me and they picked something very much like the color I had previously used with a drug store brand.</li>
            <li> and the ends came out slightly darker and after a few days looked better.</li>
            <li> My original shipment did end up coming a few days later too, but they totally understand my hesitation to wait for it to arrive and risk it not showing up.</li>
            <li> The last time I went to a salon, I made it very clear that I didn&#x27;t want my hair to look red at all....</li>
            <li> I had gone to a stylist for over 20 years then moved to another state &amp; had trouble finding the right stylist.</li>
            <li> The color is consistent and covered all my other color (I had a disaster prior to using eSalon).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Learnings: You can have a terrific business idea and sufficient money to put together a great marketing strategy, yet it will fail if your product does not deliver the results expected or your business practices hurts the same customers you are trying to retain.</li>
            <li> Covers grey completely!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always just gone to the natural blonde shade it was in high school, using Garnier, Clairol, Loreal, and other name brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different boxed store colorings and I&#x27;ve used professional salons on occasion.</li>
            <li> and she saved us from social</li>
            <li> I also added some colouring tools to my initial order,  the bowl, brush and clips, and found that this simple addition made a considerable difference in ease of application and use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who colors their own hair and to girls who needlessly pay big bucks to have it done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more natural looking than the Satin mixture I was using, which tended to turn &amp;#34;reagan brown&amp;#34;, and weirdly orange with pink-ish undertones that were supposed to make up &amp;</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was Very skeptical at first, I had seen some girls rave about it on youtube</li>
            <li> I even edited my color after the 2nd month to go a little lighter, and they got it right on the mark.</li>
            <li> And after the first coloring I spoke to their colorist and asked for some little corrections in the color</li>
            <li> My hair which is naturally red has been slowly losing it&#x27;s red color and becoming lighter and lighter, I&#x27;m assuming turning white as that is what happens with redheads.  </li>
            <li> The second time, I even tried using less of the product and took two showers (because I ran out of hot water) and color-safe shampoo to cut through it.</li>
            <li> but the gloss on my ends didn&#x27;t really get that dark</li>
            <li> It really covered the grey and now waiting to see how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> After dying, my hair is shiny and natural looking and all the grey is covered.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s missing from the &#x27;real salon experience!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The first round i got</li>
            <li> , it is a little strong and if you are sensitive to that it could be a problem, but no more than an over the counter or salon product.</li>
            <li> Also, it could be that I&#x27;m just not very experienced yet at using the wand, so the lack of full coverage at my part is a result of &amp;#34;user error,&amp;#34; rather than the product.</li>
            <li> After viewing my&lt;br /&gt;completed intake and the pictures I&#x27;d sent they advised me to go a little lighter-instead of light brown they advised dark blond.</li>
            <li> The application process is a little different from any box color I have ever used, but not difficult.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it colored all my gray, but we may have needed to put more on or wait a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Especially those with red hair, it is by far the most difficult shade to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eSalon for about a year and a half after years of paying too much for hair coloring in the salon.</li>
            <li> Natural and long lasting, for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and if you are not happy the staff will work with you until you are.</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks the first time before I colored my hair, so I emailed eSalon and ask them to wait a couple of weeks before they sent the next color, and if they would send it about 1 shade lighter.</li>
            <li> I was still hanging in there though, hoping that at least it would not wash out as quickly but it performed about the same as over the counter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I realized how badly damaged my hair was until I touched my new soft and healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> For me i love the Aveda salon but having a little one hard to make it there and sit with him there for three hours or so...</li>
            <li> I have been told by stylists many times that I have hard hair to color and was a little scared to try this</li>
            <li> And, when you want a little change, they are very accommodating.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to really match.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I am in the UK and heard from other people about this new colour product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can write them at any time to change a little or a lot of your chosen color;  because summer is fast approaching, I wrote in to change my color to just one shade lighter than I&#x27;m using now.  </li>
            <li> I had an incredibly hard time coloring my own hair, due to previous neck surgery (6 years ago).  </li>
            <li> If things change with the next application, I will come back and let you know - good or bad.</li>
            <li> husband recently went through some major health issues and his hair was so dry from all the meds I started using the Shining Armor on his head.  </li>
            <li> Well the store bought ash medium or dark brown did not hardly even color the gray.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it would be next to impossible to find a decent place to get our hair done anywhere near where we live, and I am in no way interested in a mullet with frosted tips.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I can actually wash and go when needed because their products smooth my horribly course hair making it look pretty decent without my usual high maintenance routine before going in public.</li>
            <li> Following all the hype and positive reviews in British newspapers and magazines, I thought I&#x27;d try this out of sheer curiosity as I like to colour and play around with my hair (usually just with a wash-in-wash-out product or semi-perm, different tones, etc).  </li>
            <li> People talk about the smell being strong, well it is absolutely not that bad compared to many other brands!</li>
            <li> I have been to a lot of professionals and they still can&#x27;t get it right, so I was skeptical about the whole process.  </li>
            <li> Ummm, it was already dark blonde with some ginger, now it&#x27;s golden blonde (with a little ginger)</li>
            <li> Such a professional company - they have a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m always slightly nervous about using a new brand in case the color isn&#x27;t what I was expecting)</li>
            <li> The product mixes very watery, which made me skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> I never color my hair anymore because the color is never what I want and my hair is left dry and unmanageable, only to end up brassy and coarse within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick and instead of having to buy two or three boxes of the store-color I wanted-to have enough for my hair, eSalon custom mixed my color with exactly the amount I needed for one low price.</li>
            <li> every single time I see her (this has actually happened with 2 different stylist in the same matter)</li>
            <li> eSalon delivers a high quality color product with a few added advantages-&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting them on and ripped the first one.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and only color the roots for gray and very white hairs peeking through.  </li>
            <li> After the application my hair was left feeling lifeless and extremely dry, and it will now take me several weeks to revive my hair from this experiment.</li>
            <li> I started with my hair having already been dyed jet black (for years), so the first application I used the root color (very dark brown) AND the red tint on nearly my entire head (against the advice of the instructions).  </li>
            <li> As for gray coverage, I  don&#x27;t see a one and trust me with dark hair and young eyes</li>
            <li> you lure customers in with a fixed price, and then surprise them with an additional cost-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that it didn&#x27;t cover the grey roots.</li>
            <li> Last test is how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li> Plus, the dye looked like it wasn&#x27;t going to dye my hair light enough and was going to look too golden, which I hate, however,</li>
            <li> Over the next 10 years it became mousey looking and dull (I always had very shinny hair).</li>
            <li> I actually like my color BETTER than my last 2 foil jobs at the expensive salon!  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth time using this product and I plan on using it for a long time!</li>
            <li> In addition, many of the products purchased from other sources burn my scalp, so I have several uncomfortable days after coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li> Then after a few months I noticed the new growth was stubborn and resisting the color so the beautician that places the color on my hair suggested they increase the strength of the developer.  </li>
            <li> I colored it 3 days ago and it I will not know how long the color will last and how long the gray stays covered.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is starting to come in silver grey.  </li>
            <li> When I tried esalon&#x27;s &#x27;made for you&#x27; dark red, it is the only colour that actually stayed in my hair.</li>
            <li> When my wife and I decided to give up life in the city for a big move to the country, I hadn&#x27;t really considered what that would mean for my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from esalon after reading reviews; unfortunately the color received was too dark (light brown) for my 90% gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Another positive - there was PLENTY of color for long, thick, curly, course hair - a challenge I have had with the drug store variety.  </li>
            <li> Company was difficult to get ahold of and wanted to charge me $15 to quick ship a replacement to try to correct the color!</li>
            <li> copper/red a little deeper and richer than my natural color.  </li>
            <li> My salon color had become really one dimensional and dull.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, but the instructions that came with the kit warn you of this first.  </li>
            <li> Sweet little kit with plenty of product for my longish thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it to cover my gray roots and return my hair to my natural look of very dark brown with reddish highlights.  </li>
            <li> Ladies if you are not reading everything you are buying /agreeing to and blindly believe that everytime product is being sent its free ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably 90% grey and my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair color is darkest brown/black.</li>
            <li> It covers the grey hair and it lasts.</li>
            <li> I wanted to boost my natural brunette color, which has faded over the years, and cover a few grays here and there.  </li>
            <li> As long as I can afford this</li>
            <li> Well it is 2:00pm MST here which is only 1:00pm there, on a Friday and conveniently their greeting states that they are closed.</li>
            <li> and the color lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but with the claims they make to be as good as a salon, and the fact that I&#x27;ve had various shades of this same color for at least 6 years if not more, with NO PROBLEMS doing it myself and the last 3 years by a salon - and they can&#x27;t make one for my hair?</li>
            <li> It was one excuse after another.</li>
            <li> (My roots are 80% grey).</li>
            <li> Long story short(er)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 with some grey.</li>
            <li> took me so long?????  </li>
            <li> package arrived well before I expected it and now that I used the kit last evening.</li>
            <li> Not soft and</li>
            <li> So when I placed my order with eSalon, I was specific as to what I wanted and expected from the coverage.</li>
            <li> but I am surely not a professional colorist either.  </li>
            <li> It had never lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> Thank you esalon, I&#x27;m a believer and now will become a long time customer.</li>
            <li> Lasts as long as my $120 salon color.  </li>
            <li> After trying to acheive the color  I wanted for so long, I decided to try eSalon.</li>
            <li> I started going grey at 16.  </li>
            <li> grey hair(roots)</li>
            <li> the full review, and check out photos of my hot wife here on my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and grows über fast</li>
            <li> Ran down my back, shirt, face, neck, in globs.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long the color last</li>
            <li> I just finished my third application, and I think I finally have it down.</li>
            <li> The stain remover wipe, which came in the package was not large enough to wipe off all hair dye on my neck.</li>
            <li> My hair does not fade to a brassy color toward the end of the color cycle, which has always been my biggest complaint about hair color (even when a hair stylist colors my hair) and the color fades more slowly than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> although the other types tell you they cover the grey 100%, they don&#x27;t tell you it will only stay that way for about 2-3 washes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a single problem and as long as I&#x27;m coloring my hair, I&#x27;m a customer.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have long hair because I was going to a party that night and at least could put it in a pony tail!!</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair and had plenty of fluids to work with!</li>
            <li> The blogs I&#x27;ve read of women who were unhappy with their haircolor usually did NOT follow their customized instructions exactly, or did not give a full description of their hair to eSalon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second was closer, but still not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The second was closer, but still not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to the other method of doing my hair color.  </li>
            <li> Any salon color I&#x27;ve had would&#x27;ve faded by now and grey showing!</li>
            <li> I have been using OTC products for 20 years, but as my roots are now white, I was never able to get my white roots to color the same as the rest of the hair</li>
            <li> My only suggestion (other than try it for 10 bucks/ plus shipping) is that if you have ANY concerns or ideas, call them.</li>
            <li> I will be using this service for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> and I will be a customer for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I started to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry, as I often do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t too dry after either.</li>
            <li> So I went to dry it</li>
            <li> I hope the human beings behind this product know how much they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I have had it professionally colored only a few times but typically color it myself from products purchased at the beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> I recently asked for minor tweak, needed to make it a bit softer (My color is dark brown)-&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try diluting less of the dye, for a smaller total amount for rinse and shine next time, and I think that will solve the mess problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was limited to colour choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, but has a lot of red in it.  </li>
            <li> My hair color was dark brown same as my roots</li>
            <li> I am naturally a dark brunet with red highlights.</li>
            <li> colour was a tad bit to dark brown and not mahogany enough, we went gradually and after 3 changes BAM on target.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaging , customer service are above average as well.</li>
            <li> I wear a short cut so average time is two haircuts.</li>
            <li> Thought since I had to decide on a color as opposed to an actual person looking down on my hair color, my greys and choosing a color that this was going to be a disaster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks now, dry hands are history!  </li>
            <li> I can get the same thing out of a box for half the price</li>
            <li> I will go back to it for half the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go to store after store to get the colour I want, by the manufacturer I prefer (a lot of times the store I usually go to run out, or simply don&#x27;t order it often enough to keep it in stock)</li>
            <li> I can go a little lighter in the summer and a little darker in the winter just as my hair does naturally!  </li>
            <li> I am very surprised by any of the negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> Usually after two weeks my color turns dull and starts changing to a very unbecoming orange red color.</li>
            <li> only problem was the mess in my shower.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical about getting the right color, liking the product and finding one that would cover my white roots the same color as the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I saw an ad for eSalon, and thought I&#x27;d try it (seeing the price was little different from drugstore boxes I&#x27;d tried before).  </li>
            <li> I struggled a little bit trying to do it by myself and had to get one of my daughters to help with the back.  </li>
            <li> they are a little different.  </li>
            <li> And, if I ever want to go a little lighter or a little darker--or even change colors completely--consulting with the colorists at eSalon is as simple as filling out a form online and waiting for someone to contact me; plus, I always have the opportunity to provide feedback following my usage of the product.</li>
            <li> just emailed esalon to suggest they stop sending all the extra packets that I don&#x27;t ever use (stain guard, stain remover, shampoo and conditioner) and reduce the price a little.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go a little darker 8 weeks later in December but kept the demi permanent.  </li>
            <li> I think that call was very confusing, she said she could not understand what was wrong, and kind of suggested me to go ahead and cancel the order.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always struggling to squeeze out the last drops from other products!!</li>
            <li> I have been using color for 43 years(oh, my, that long!!)!</li>
            <li> Love the packaging but feel bad about throwing it away each time.</li>
            <li> It looked like a bad dye job but after a few days it turned out to be really nice.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I would have would be the smell, but it&#x27;s not any different than going to the salon, or some of the colors you can buy at Sally&#x27;s or in the box.</li>
            <li> Ok-it was a bit darker than I expected,</li>
            <li> It allows me the freedom to color my hair at home with salon results minus the $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> However, the coloring process was messier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> It was darker than I expected yet</li>
            <li> The reason why their voice-mail greeting stated they were closed today is because tomorrow it’s July 4th</li>
            <li> The reason why their voice-mail greeting stated they were closed today is because tomorrow it’s July 4th</li>
            <li> 30 sec n its gone.</li>
            <li> It is now roughly two weeks since I used the eSalon color and there has been no noticeable fading of the colour.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison.  </li>
            <li> I am adding a few pics of my color over the last year.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it, dried my hair (followed all of the instructions to the letter) which by the way, were very different than box color!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days, so</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed a few days for it to &amp;#34;die down&amp;#34; before going out in public.  </li>
            <li> I finally gave up and dried with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but I got curious and decided to give esalon a try.  </li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for years and formulate my own colors by visiting Sallys and picking my tone, level and base.  </li>
            <li> I have colored my hair off and on for the past 10 years - ever since the gray started dulling down my natural color.</li>
            <li> I checked my account and the setting was turned off, which made me even a little more mad.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and there is no more gray!  </li>
            <li> (I have very small hands and the gloves that come in store-bought kits are simply too big for me to work with.)</li>
            <li> I selected a medium brown which is very slightly darker than my current color.  </li>
            <li> The product is less &amp;#34;drippy&amp;#34; than and not nearly as &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;OTC&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have a very hard to match natural color is mostly grey now.  </li>
            <li> They nailed it on the first try with only my description and a few pictures (of the wrong colored hair).  </li>
            <li> My gray is completely covered, my roots are blended smoothly into the color of the rest of my [previously colored] hair, my hair color looks natural without the horrible monochromatic look that screams \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, and I don&#x27;t have the reddish tints that stylists insist on adding even when I say I do not want them.</li>
            <li> they give you enough dye to cover even my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually colour my own hair, I go to a salon, but have been very disappointed with the colour and condition and was looking to find a new hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I realize that she is not the company only the frontline representative, but I was put off by the experience and intend to cancel the order and make an appointment at the salon, a usual.</li>
            <li> she got the other hairdresser to come over and look and feel my hair.</li>
            <li> other dyes would leave my grays lighter than the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I ordered it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands over the years to maintain my hair colour!</li>
            <li> The dye smelled like other dyes, they all stink imo.</li>
            <li> Esalon is a subscription, which I may cancel at any time, I was never under any other impression.</li>
            <li> The gray coverage lasts longer than any other product I have used or had anyone else use on me.</li>
            <li> I h ave used the esalon hair color for about 4 times now and am happier about the color and shine my hair has over any other salon service I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> the first time i thought that it was complicated, then i put on my glasses and it was easier to understand.  </li>
            <li> Then, outside of the shower, I toweled off and put the usual styling products into my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only way I&#x27;ve gotten highlights in the past was by deliberately applying them, at home or in the salon.  </li>
            <li> so I had to use leftovers from other hair color products.  </li>
            <li> Hell hath no fury like a Lion with a brassy, frizzy bottle red that has been pushed past</li>
            <li> The You Tube videos are extremely well done.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> What other mistakes could they make for something we put on our crowning glory?</li>
            <li> I had picked one color and based on my photo and other info</li>
            <li> No more grayish-white hairs and I look years younger with the darker color.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased some other items to help me with the process;  </li>
            <li> Over the counter colors did not cover the grey and faded after a few washings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 55 years old, and use to have jet black hair, there isn&#x27;t jet black natural hair, it looks so fake</li>
            <li> A colorist called me and spent atleast a half hour going over my formula with me.</li>
            <li> I know why salons have black sinks</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian of Irish, English descent with thin hair, as I told them in my interview.</li>
            <li> , I have struggled in the past with various other brands with there not being quite enough colorant to cover my hair (shoulder length and quite thick)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always too copper, too red or too dull and brown.</li>
            <li> Red is a really hard color to keep up</li>
            <li> I had asked for a dark brown and they said that based on the photo I sent, that would be too dark and recommended a medium brown.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally dark brown.</li>
            <li> I like to use demi or semi permanent color on my rather dark hair for shine and pizazz.</li>
            <li> I am a complete clumsy amateur at almost everything, but this system was designed to be fool-proof.</li>
            <li> After receiving the color I was concerned I had picked a color that was too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> Too dark?  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is all the packaging.  </li>
            <li> My color turned out soooooo dark.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown.</li>
            <li> was one shade too dark; so she recommended another.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I have ever had a hair color that covers so well, without leaving dark ends.  </li>
            <li> I like the warmer dark brown.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for application and even though the product never looked dark in the bowl, my hair and forehead/hairline was darker than dark.  </li>
            <li> but they all had dark hair, except one that was blond (which I&#x27;m not)</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Esalon for a few months now, with absolutely no issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little shocked because I was super skeptical, especially after I received this email saying  &amp;#34;we crafted a new color for you&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Also considering purchasing other products for the upkeep and health of my hair!  </li>
            <li> It seems the store bought colors are always too black even though they say dark brown.</li>
            <li> Only other complaint, I make a huge mess when I color. :(</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the first colour and asked for a very small change.</li>
            <li> Had to read directions a few times to figure out that one color was for my roots and the other for my ends...</li>
            <li> I wanted I asked for slight change</li>
            <li> Seriously, my hair has that same shine and bounce you get from your stylist.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve covered all your hair, let it sit for a half hour.</li>
            <li> less then what a salon would cost.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the eSalon hair colour when it was on a half price promotion.</li>
            <li> I like to change my color slightly</li>
            <li> I just completed coloring my hair after my request for a reformulation of the previous color.  </li>
            <li> My co-workers asked me if it was black.  </li>
            <li> My gray is covered and looks ever so slightly like salon highlights.</li>
            <li> One less thing off my mind.</li>
            <li> but I can get it on now in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I always make a mess on my forehead &amp; neck while dying my hair.</li>
            <li> After years of paying salon prices, and annoyed in general with the salon experience, I mustered the courage to do my color at home.</li>
            <li> Still no change with my hair except it looked a little brighter and less washed out strands.  </li>
            <li> Also, in contrast to what I have read on so many other reviews online, the dye smelled really, very badly.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid at first.</li>
            <li> I usually use a box from the store, but noticed lately that my roots (now turning gray) were a different color than the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Really, I was left disappointed with this service.</li>
            <li> It was a bit confusing with having to section your hair off (I have long hair) and made it a bit messy also</li>
            <li> Just a little note to let you know</li>
            <li> The color was just a little off</li>
            <li> I was a little worried what the color would look like.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it a little darker, I always go a little darker in the winter</li>
            <li> They even throw in little surprises along the way.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I wrote and asked it I could go just a little lighter, maybe 1 shade.</li>
            <li> I thought the color I wanted was a little darker...</li>
            <li> I felt that the formula was a little runny</li>
            <li> The product was a little messier than I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m used to a weaker OTC product than this was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can tweak my color for the seasons or if I just get an urge to try something a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After spending thousands of dollars at a high-end salon, I decided to try something a little easier on the budget.</li>
            <li> month I decided I wanted to go a little darker and redder.  </li>
            <li> I indicated that I wanted my hair a little darker.  </li>
            <li> However, the color has now washed out after only two weeks, leaving behind white roots and very, very dull color.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be any worse than my last self-coloring nightmare\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> When they had received the order but misplaced the profile why the attitude?  </li>
            <li> The application process was a bit messy, but I&#x27;m wondering if that was because I used the bowl and brush method.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few months to give my review though, just in case.</li>
            <li> I used to take care of the straw hair (which I no longer have), my hair is just greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> However, unlike the drug store brands, it did not fade after a few weeks (I&#x27;m a red-head).  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the next change either.</li>
            <li> I have been a e.color custom for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I will never go to the pharmacy for a box color (where its a guessing game) or to my local salon ever again!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about ordering a hair color online, especially since I have had several questionable outcomes in an actual salon!</li>
            <li> I answered a few questions about my skin and eye color and about the color, texture and length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I gave esalon&#x27;s colorists a few notes</li>
            <li> It had high-lights and wasn&#x27;t dried out like some of the store-products do your hair.</li>
            <li> I think the negative comment left by the individual about the brassy hair is unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> The leave in and styling cream are a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy</li>
            <li> Before I heard of eSalon, I was using Solfine colour and peroxide combo and even with 30% peroxide, my hair would eat through the colour in a matter of a few weeks</li>
            <li> and I have a few friends who now intend to try esalon for themselves.</li>
            <li> But after I colored I couldn&#x27;t believe how dead on the color I requested was.  </li>
            <li> Too messy</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months before trying.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get any green or brassy tones</li>
            <li> My hair is jet black (I&#x27;m east Indian) and usually ended up with messy jobs at home and salons.</li>
            <li> My hair breaks less, and having curly hair it usually gets frizzy--Shining Armor helps with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look so pale.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin, blue/grey eyes.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this produce to anyone who is tired of paying high salon prices for color and who doesn&#x27;t want to trust their hair to poor quality at-home box color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not such a dramatic change that people who know me notice</li>
            <li> The money spent in the salon is ridiculous, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> Is not bad like another reviewer said, maybe because the worst smelling dye I used (once) and actually the harshest was L&#x27;Oreal Preference.  </li>
            <li> I felt the gloves were a little small.</li>
            <li> The wrist opening is just a little too small.</li>
            <li> I always read the bad reviews first and here</li>
            <li> I have had it done in the salon a few times but usually bought box color and did it myself.</li>
            <li> The dye is so thick that it does not drip down your face.</li>
            <li> they shadily and sneakily put you on one of those AUTO purchase plans without you even knowing it, just by you checking out, you’re agreeing to very hidden terms and conditions, so BEWARE.</li>
            <li> they shadily and sneakily put you on one of those AUTO purchase plans without you even knowing it, just by you checking out, you’re agreeing to very hidden terms and conditions, so BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I see some negative feedback about hidden charges....</li>
            <li> and it was go gluey feeling that I couldn&#x27;t even dry it.  </li>
            <li> The kit was so neatly presented, with little developer bottles with my name!</li>
            <li> To my disappointment the product sent had Ammonia, which I had clearly stated in email exchanges could not be used in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I initially was skeptical about the claims, but figured, \\&quot;why not?  </li>
            <li> the color is unbelievable</li>
            <li> My sister is a hair stylist and she has given me direction in the past on coloring my hair</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair at home for years and was not satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> Rinse all the color out, then shampoo and condition as usual -</li>
            <li> I was nervous but anxious to get started.</li>
            <li> The shine is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> No more salons and</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I first saw the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li> so not sure if I will use this again.</li>
            <li> This is incredibly shady business practice-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve ever been happier with my hair color.</li>
            <li> I was not sure ordering hair color on line.  </li>
            <li> so I use cinnamon for the past 2 years, it hi lighted the whites it looked.good to me, so I saw</li>
            <li> if not better.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d go back to my expensive salon colorist.</li>
            <li> Just unbelievable.</li>
            <li> just like when I used a box dye in the past.  </li>
            <li> and that is sort of a pain and very messy.</li>
            <li> First let me say, I hate coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a long and tedious job.</li>
            <li> AWFUL - I looked ten years older with the colors they put on me.  </li>
            <li> The color lasts &amp; my hair not so dry and fake looking.  </li>
            <li> So now I have about 40% gray and because I hate coloring, I avoid it as long as possible and wear my hair in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> And none of that funky dull color on the ends that can happen when you color over color.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too hard for me.  </li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews and wish I had listened.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked it was not dried out.</li>
            <li> I get at least 3 compliments a day when I am out and about.</li>
            <li> so order at least 2 weeks before you need to use</li>
            <li> I am puzzled by all the negative reviews?</li>
            <li> I do understand that this is not a real salon and that it might perhaps be difficult to choose a hair color by looking at a picture.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have been using box colors for years and have been forced to accept the brassy highlight side-effect of them.  </li>
            <li> Previously the expensive trip to the hairdresser - difficult to organise since I work very long hours and am often on call at weekends, has been fraught with anxiety.</li>
            <li> Due to a weird post office error, one of my orders was delayed and I FREAKED OUT.</li>
            <li> No more $180 visits to the hair colorist for me!</li>
            <li> The results were everything I have been trying to accomplish for the past two years!</li>
            <li> Unlike a previous reviewer who said the smell was awful it really wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and sat down to write this review.</li>
            <li> I am 50 now and unable to work because I am raising my 3 grandsons, so money is tight.</li>
            <li> I had tried a variety of drug store box colors and learned the hard way that they are not for amateurs, and definitely not great if used once a month.</li>
            <li> My head itched so bad with this product I actually went to the doctor.  </li>
            <li> I was sick of the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; tones I was getting in the commercial stuff.</li>
            <li> felt very bad, so after only 15-20 mins (half the time they said to)  </li>
            <li> No more paying high salon prices and getting my hair cut by 17-year-old, gum-snapping, goth-looking idiots!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and spend at least $1,000 a year to cover the gray, try eSalon today!  </li>
            <li> Beauty shops didn&#x27;t even make the job any easier; ninety-nine percent of the time I left hairdressers disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased...used them several times and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and turning gray already!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> It just turned them reddish orange and when it started to fade (almost immediately) it was even worse.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse then walking out of a salon and getting home and finding dye all over the sides of your face.  </li>
            <li> I as tired of paying $100</li>
            <li> Everyone can be suspicious and I wonder about the poor reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of extracting myself from their poor business processes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Leo lioness, and I take my mane very seriously.</li>
            <li> - sounds real hard, huh?</li>
            <li> I have been unhappy with my color lately....</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I have a lot of red in my hair and being a blond, I have had really bad self coloring experiences which resulted in running to the salon for $$$$$$ color correction...</li>
            <li> And not only I hated it (because it was not lighter, just artifitially reder), but also I lost a lot of hair applying the product.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was a little disappointed after reading this</li>
            <li> I used this a second time and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was paying $150 to have my hair highlighted at an expensive salon.  </li>
            <li> I decided why not, if it goes wrong I can fix it.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Sis, but this deserves all the attention it&#x27;s getting.  </li>
            <li> But it has been getting so expensive</li>
            <li> , I have been looking for an alternative to the expensive salon visit.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to an expensive salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Strong Awful Smell - Smelled similar to that of a Perm&lt;br /&gt;Auto</li>
            <li> I tried telling my family about it they too are skeptical</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong trying their hair dye.  </li>
            <li> Give them a them a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was initially skeptical about e-salon, but I&#x27;ve tried it twice now</li>
            <li> The result is like going to an expensive salon without the expensive price and....the expensive tip.</li>
            <li> In the recent frigid temperature (-30 degrees!), one bottle in my shipment broke.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to use</li>
            <li> and I was a bit sad because my 300 balayage color was going with it.  </li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> However, if it was, isn&#x27;t that scary?</li>
            <li> So, for anyone who says on their review that there isn&#x27;t a phone number to contact customer service , they are wrong.</li>
            <li> * The 3rd order was AWFUL</li>
            <li> Salon hair color is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> Forever unhappy and salons also rubbed my skin and bruised it few times when they tried to take the excesses off my forehead and temples : ((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been disappointed (one way or another) each time.  </li>
            <li> I started using eSalon because I was sick and tired of using the boxed stuff at the store and getting incomplete coverage.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sick and tired of paying a fortune at the salon.  </li>
            <li> but I think that may be due to the awful ombré I had done before and trying to correct w/ this color.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> Terrible color, it turned out streaky and uneven.</li>
            <li> That was a disappointment too.  </li>
            <li> your unhappy with your hair, you need to try their products.&lt;br /&gt;Jan Parker</li>
            <li> The box sat around my house for over a month, as I was afraid to try it.  </li>
            <li> which I just did which is disappointing since I&#x27;m trying to grow it out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I, like another reviewer, am very skeptical of all the 5 star posts.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because everything isn&#x27;t what it seems to be nowadays.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and had even emailed my colorist with my doubts</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t bad and the smell after washing was nothing compared to what my hair used to smell like after getting it colored in the salon.</li>
            <li> and my hair texture felt really bad, like straw</li>
            <li> I knew &amp;#34;box color&amp;#34; from the drug store was a bad idea, so I purchased Satin brand from the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> because again i had read the bad reviews</li>
            <li> It was still sticky but not as bad as it had been.</li>
            <li> They were so shocked that I did not have it done professionaily.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated.</li>

            <li> it would turnout awful)</li>
            <li> After years of trying to hide my gray hair with over the counter hair dyes or paying the insane prices at hair salons, I found E Salons&#x27;s custom hair color.  </li>
            <li> and you dont have to go to a salon and pay outrageous prices for someone to do it for you and also dont have to use the terrible chemicals in box color.</li>
            <li> and for me hair coloring is terrible desicion</li>

            <li> Got my package! Had to wait a couple of weeks before I applied. I was wearing a very different hairstyle. (weave...lol)  I have natural hair 4c.&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions, they were very clear..love the pictures. That helped a lot. Added the first color aghhh, it was brown, then added the second color mahogany, another aghhh. However, after the shampoo and conditioner lock-in. I looked in the mirror and loved the color.  I remembered what my colorist told me. She said, that we would have to start darker, then go lighter. I trust that, because what I saw in the mirror was beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;I loved that fact that this process is easy for me, my hair and my pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you E-Salon, I will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;Together we will achieve my dream hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Dannie B.</li>
            <li> Carol Sullivan&lt;br /&gt;Nov 02 12:33 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; for this new hair color. It is perfect! I was sick of the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; tones I was getting in the commercial stuff. You&#x27;ve given me back my &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair color! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was paying $150 to have my hair highlighted at an expensive salon.  Even though it was no longer in my budget, I continued the splurge to have it done.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been disappointed (one way or another) each time.  I saw an ad for eSalon, and thought I&#x27;d try it (seeing the price was little different from drugstore boxes I&#x27;d tried before).  I was skeptical (because of my experience with those brands found in the drugstore), but was hopeful after reading all the great reviews.  WOW!  The packaging was the first thing that impressed me.  Then, I colored my hair.  I actually like my color BETTER than my last 2 foil jobs at the expensive salon!  This is so much easier on my budget (obviously).  I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for awhile now. I have asked them to &#x27;tweak&#x27; the color a few times and it&#x27;s always been done perfectly. There customer service is brilliant, the packaging and product is very, very good. The convenience of having my color automatically arrive right about the time It&#x27;s time to color is great!  I love the product and love my color. I&#x27;m very pleased with eSalon.&lt;br /&gt;Jenne Singer</li>
            <li> The hair color is amazing I have really thick hair so I was worried that one bottle wouldn&#x27;t be enough but it was more than enough and it&#x27;s super easy to use and the color is amazing</li>
            <li> Loved the whole way it was handled . Covered my  very gray roots 100% . The service is  well worth trying out. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who colors their own hair and to girls who needlessly pay big bucks to have it done.</li>
            <li> I heard About esalon and decided to give it a try.  My hair has hard to cover grey and this hair color covered my grey just wonderful.  I love how soft my hair feels and it looks amazing.  The color was perfect too.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shopping on line and shopping for great prices, hard to find items, etc.  I was very pleased with my eSalon personally formulated hair color system.  My hair looks great, especially in the sunshine.  Plus, my hair feels wonderfully healthy.  I have tried many hair color products - none better than this.  Robbin R. Wohl, Lake Havasu City AZ</li>
            <li> They got it right!!!  With just a few words describing my original hair color, eSalon got it as close to NATURAL color as I have ever had.  My husband said he didnt like it because it made me look 20 yrs younger.  LOL  My sister loves it and is now using eSalon hair color as well.  I even told my hair stylist and she was so impressed she was going to check it out for herself.  It&#x27;s worth the first time buy, cuz you will be sold on it.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist asked me what color I used!!!!! AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> About the products: I&#x27;ve colored my hair through eSalon for two months now.  I bought it to cover my gray roots and return my hair to my natural look of very dark brown with reddish highlights.  It turned out better than I expected.  I started with my hair having already been dyed jet black (for years), so the first application I used the root color (very dark brown) AND the red tint on nearly my entire head (against the advice of the instructions).  The second month, I did only the roots with the root color and the red tint on the rest of my hair exactly per instructions. The dye appears to be creating or picking up on my natural highlights and lowlights. I don&#x27;t have a bottle look at all!  See attached photo. I really liked the shampoo and conditioner packets that come in the kit, so I bought a bottle of each for regular use. I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple weeks my hair is so soft!  About their customer service: Top Notch. When signing up, apparently there&#x27;s an auto-renew option (not fond of that) which caused an order to be placed automatically.  As soon as I pressed send on a terse email to customer support about it, I thought maybe there was an auto-renew setting in my account.  I checked my account and the setting was turned off, which made me even a little more mad. I went to my email to write another letter and waiting for me was a message that they changed my setting and refunded my card.  All in the time it took me to even login to my account. Wow.  Also, the pump of the conditioner bottle would not function (shampoo was fine).  Customer support fixed the situation the day I informed them.  That kind of support is right up there with some of my favorite companies- like Zingerman&#x27;s, Zappos and Soda Club.  So far, I&#x27;m very happy with these guys.  I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star ONLY because I&#x27;m still a new customer and have a wait and see attitude about things.</li>
            <li> At first I was very nervous about ordering hair color online. I decided why not, if it goes wrong I can fix it. I sent my pic and told them what I wanted ( auburn). After receiving it I was pleased but wanted more red. So they adjusted it. After I received my next order I am VERY pleased!!!!! I got the color I wanted. Also when showering the color doesn&#x27;t bleed. The color lasts and looks great!</li>
            <li> eSalon is a fabulous product!  I love the color and the feel of my hair!  It is excellent at gray coverage, too. It&#x27;s amazing that they could get the color so right based on questions and photos.  And it&#x27;s not easy to get red right!  I would highly recommend this hair color to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to get some gray hair turning up. I&#x27;ve been using drug store color &amp; thought I&#x27;d give Esalon a try. The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between this product &amp; the cheap drug store stuff. So, I went back to the Loreal brand to save money. Well, two years have gone by &amp; I noticed little bits of gray are really showing up on me even more despite coloring it with Loreal. So, I gave Esalon another try and asked them to make a few changes on my original color that I ordered. It was perfect!  This is the only product that will cover my gray. It&#x27;s been weeks and my hair hasn&#x27;t faded. My advice: if you don&#x27;t quite like it at first, tell them what you don&#x27;t like and give it another try.</li>
            <li> Just used my first order from ESalon and really enjoyed the process.  I didn&#x27;t order all of the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; they offer, just the basic order.  It felt like I was getting so much more than a regular boxed color, which I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The color came out better than I expected.  I loved the consistency of the formula after it was mixed, not too goopy and not too runny.  Two sets of gloves they gave you made it really nice; one for the first application and then one used for the rinsing and shampooing afterwards.  No stain around my hairline thanks to the packet of stain protection gel they provided.  I like the fact they included the &amp;#34;Lock It In&amp;#34; hair shampoo and conditioner for one use. Hair is really, really soft afterwards and feels healthy.  I like the fact that you can write them at any time to change a little or a lot of your chosen color;  because summer is fast approaching, I wrote in to change my color to just one shade lighter than I&#x27;m using now.  Can&#x27;t wait to get my next shipment!!!</li>
            <li> Thought I would try eSalon and was not dissapointed! Liked my first color but received an email asking if I liked it or wanted to&amp;#34; tweek&amp;#34; it some. Requested a minor change and loved the results! Been coloring my hair for over 35 years and am so impressed with my rich color! Ordered coloring tools: bowl, brush, clips and now tint for between colorings. Great quality priducts and my hair is soft and managable.</li>
            <li> Colors grey completely and exactly the right shade of the rest of your hair. I&#x27;m 64 years old. Have been coloring my hair since I was 24 years old. I&#x27;m probably 90% grey and my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair color is darkest brown/black. When I turned 50 I had my hair highlighted using only about 10-12 foils just to give it more deminsion as it was beginning to get too dark for my age. Over the next 10 years it became mousey looking and dull (I always had very shinny hair). I wanted to get that shine back.  Box hair colors in a light brown or  medium brown just didn&#x27;t do it and I think the main reason is because it didn&#x27;t cover the grey well, if at all. It just turned them reddish orange and when it started to fade (almost immediately) it was even worse. Esalon hair color is perfect. Better than salon hair colors,. If there&#x27;s another hair color product out there that&#x27;s better I either haven&#x27;t found it or can&#x27;t afford it, Thanks, esalon.</li>
            <li> I loved it! I always make a mess on my forehead &amp; neck while dying my hair. Your stain remover &amp; guard were amazing! I also bought the cup/brush &amp; clips &amp; it made dying my hair so much easier!  The color was perfect &amp; although it cost a bit more than the box at the store, it was made for me &amp; like I said, the ease of clean up was much easier on my skin!</li>
            <li> Just tried e salon. Sent picture and explained what I wanted and presto I received color developer, cape brush stain remover and conditioner in mail. My color is the best ever and I am so happy. Will b recording soon!</li>
            <li> This color made my hair feel luxurious.  I love the color and it was just right for my skin color.  My hair is fuller and shinier than with the drug store brands.  I will definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product or customer service. They made the adjustments to my color after my first order that I was looking for and I love the color! They listen to what you say and I love the color.</li>
            <li> After years of coloring my own hair, having it done in a salon and never quite getting the color just right (too dark brown, too much red tone, fading too fast) I finally have the PERFECT shade and tone - exactly what I asked for!  I am SUPER happy with this product and cannot believe the great pricing.  How do they do it?  My sister is a professional and said, &amp;#34;Please don&#x27;t tell anyone about this!&amp;#34;  Sorry, Sis, but this deserves all the attention it&#x27;s getting.  I colored three weeks ago and have had several compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair is looking.  The color looks as good today as it did just after I did it.  I will never spend the big bucks on hair coloring services again.  Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with eSalon! They matched my color perfectly! I love my color and was cheaper than my salon! I am so glad I decided to give eSalon a try, I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use them!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love eSalon hair color and shampoo / conditioner. They have a great price, the color is always what I expect and want, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, easy to apply, and a great price. Their shampoo and conditioner is just as good. For the first time in my life I can actually wash and go when needed because their products smooth my horribly course hair making it look pretty decent without my usual high maintenance routine before going in public. Thank you eSalon!</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new, and ordered their ash blonde color (guaranteed to color the gray!). Well, I went from light blonde to a good match for my cherry wood furniture. Talk about brass, which was one of my requests that their color would cover. Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some my usual tried and true light blonde color and developer, and left it on for 40 minutes. No change. Tried it again, but used less developer and more light blonde. No change. Terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m going to have to go back on my hands and knees to my $300 a visit colorist and admit total defeat and beg forgiveness. Also, be sure to check your email because once you sign up for one shipment it then comes automatically every week or so. Yikes!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The customer service is very knowledgeable, nice and quick to respond. After selecting my color for the first time and uploading the picture, they wrote me back and suggested to change my color choice. . . boy, were they right! I made a slight alteration and I&#x27;m loving it! As a busy mom, with three kids, I don&#x27;t have time for the salons and the grocery shelf boxes for a natural red are anything but natural (and yes, reds do gray!) I had to mix my own to get the right shade and am so relieved that I can have salon-quality expertise and products delivered to me, and on a schedule so I don&#x27;t need to do much. The packaging of the product is so artfully arranged that you feel like you are getting treated. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this hair color. It is easy to apply, instructions are easy and color is fantastic. I will not use anything else from now on. What a great idea.  So much better than trying to pick a color at the drug store.</li>
            <li> This product popped up on my facebook feed, I ordered it for such a great price! I was a little nervous at first when I learned they changed the formula I had chosen to better fit the results I was trying to achieve. I had no problem following the directions and the color came out beautiful (strawberry Blond)! It&#x27;s shiny and the grey coverage was great! I have medium long hair and had plenty of fluids to work with! Overall I will order again, for the money it was def. worth it!</li>
            <li> Terrible color, it turned out streaky and uneven. Company was difficult to get ahold of and wanted to charge me $15 to quick ship a replacement to try to correct the color! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product well over a year and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I previously used Nice and Easy but couldn&#x27;t always get the colour I wanted then I read a review on this product and have been using ever since, although the first colour was not the exact colour I wanted I asked for slight change and I have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and have it cut every few weeks and my hairdresser always comments on the lovely condition of my hair and how natural the colour looks. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent job. LOVE the color. The color was easy to apply and the instructions were easy to follow.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have had no luck with DIY \\&quot;box\\&quot; hair color.  I have always had a professional colorist.  But it has been getting so expensive, I have been looking for an alternative to the expensive salon visit.  I tried the \\&quot;Box\\&quot; colors and nothing worked to my liking.  I tried eSalon.com and it worked perfectly!  I had hundreds of color combinations to choose from.  I even uploaded a current picture of myself with my grown out hair color so my personal eSalon colorist could see my skin tone and adjust accordingly.I ordered my kit on Friday and received it on Monday!  Very fast delivery and great packaging!!  I had first thought I would take the color to my colorist and ask her to apply it the first time. But after reading the eSalon instructions I decided to try it myself.  And it worked!  The color is perfect and it was so easy to do.  eSalon also included samples of their new color safe shampoo and conditioner which I will purchase. I also ordered the Tinted Love, their hair color enhancing product.  Tinted Love works beautifully.  I always have tiny gray hairs at my temples that seem to appear 1 week after coloring.  I use this product ever time I wash my hair.  After shampooing, I put this on and rub it in especially at my hair line.  Leave it on for 2-5 minutes and rinse it out followed by my conditioner.  It has kept my color vibrant and no grey hairs at my temples!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to an expensive salon.  I am an eSalon.com customer for life!!! Thank you eSalon!!!  Go to their website to try it.  [...]</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about ordering my hair color online, but I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance! I love the color, it&#x27;s so natural looking. Definitely better than store-bought and just as good as salon results. The odor is minimal, and the gloves actually fit my hands. (I have very small hands and the gloves that come in store-bought kits are simply too big for me to work with.) There is no burning to my scalp, the color lasts, and the customer service is excellent.  I have my account set to automatically send me a kit every 6 weeks so I never have to worry about ordering in time for my next order, plus it comes in a pretty, personalized box.</li>
            <li> This week was my fourth or fifth color with eSalon.com&#x27;s product. The color is fantastic, long-lasting, covers gray, and very healthy to my hair. The staff is wonderful and incredibly responsive to questions or changes.  The first color I received came out with slightly lighter roots (most likely due to old color on the ends of my hair at the time). The staff immediately responded to my concern and readjusted my next color accordingly. The next several orders were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as most women do, I decided to change up my color just a bit. I filled out the feedback form for my next shipment, it was reviewed and my color changed. Due to a change in tone (from golden to copper), it required two different sets of color that were sent to me (second free of charge). I was nervous about the customized directions instructing me to color the roots with the first and the ends with the second bottles, but it turned out FANTASTIC. I absolutely love it and it is exactly what I requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this produce to anyone who is tired of paying high salon prices for color and who doesn&#x27;t want to trust their hair to poor quality at-home box color. This is salon quality color in every way for the price and convenience of at-home color.</li>
            <li> Perfect coloring; much more &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; and healthy looking than store-sold box brands. The colors last longer too; seem more resistant to sun and shampoo</li>
            <li> I love the the products. I like the fact that the color is customized. I&#x27;ve been using esalon for over a year and have tweaked my color almost every time. I now have found the perfect color for me and have received several complements. Bonus is it comes to my door just when I need to recolor. Thanks esalon.</li>
            <li> This was my first time. I loved the results from the color they chose instead of the one picked. I had asked for a dark brown and they said that based on the photo I sent, that would be too dark and recommended a medium brown. I am very pleased with the results, much more so than the result from the very expensive salon I went to. I really like the texture of my hair since coloring it, it&#x27;s not straw feeling and the roots were covered well, even the grey. I followed their directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and think it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will order a 2nd color remover pack. The gloves provided were very nice, but in doing the color myself, I think I will use longer gloves next time, so my forearms don&#x27;t get color on them from reaching over.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with esalon products. After dying, my hair is shiny and natural looking and all the grey is covered.</li>
            <li> Love my color and it cover all my gray hair</li>
            <li> I just colored my hair using the order I received on 12-1-14. It is perfect, just perfect. I wanted a coppery color and my hair is the color of a shinny penny. I should have colored my hair about 4 weeks ago so I was worried about covering the gray but it totally covered it. My husband loves the look; shiny and not over processed.</li>
            <li> I have been going at a salon to have my hair colored for 20 years. I have tried box hair color but never thought it looked natural. I just tried this and loved it. It is better than professional hair color.</li>
            <li> Greatest thing since sliced bread as they say!  I am so happy that I discovered this.  Loved my first color, then later requested slightly lighter for summer, and found it even more perfect!  Saves me so much!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and LOVE it. Have recommended to everyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! I have been coloring my hair for many years and have tried EVERY product on the market. ESalon is the FIRST and ONLY product that hasn&#x27;t made me look like a &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; blonde. I don&#x27;t have the brassiness I had before. They REALLY know what they are doing!!</li>
            <li> I saw a tiny ad while I was in a different website and out of curiosity I visited their site.  I had no expectations and their talk of customization similar to a salon&#x27;s intrigued me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After perusing the entire site I signed up and tried the Demi color that was recommended. It covered my blonde highlights and gray hairs beautifully. My hair is normally dark brown. Customizing a color included sending actual photos of my hair  and answering a questionnaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a continuity program, but I opted to stop as soon as the kit was sent until my budget allowed another touch-up. They send the right amount of product in the right shade and ask you to indicate how frequently you want each kit. I also opted for the application kit that worked great; the mixing bowl, clips, and brush worked perfectly and will be ready for future kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each kit can be the same or I can change colors after consulting with the company. What&#x27;s the best thing? Doing it myself when I want and at a cost savings!</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it!  Color is exactly what I want, even when I change it.  Service is the best!  They are so into customer service!</li>
            <li> I initially was skeptical about the claims, but figured, \\&quot;why not?  It can&#x27;t be any worse than my last self-coloring nightmare\\&quot;.  Being able to start with the questionnaire and sending off a photo of my hair really eased my fears.  The product was easy to use, and I am extremely pleased with the result.  I love my color more every day.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and excellent product. I asked for dark blonde with gold and that&#x27;s what I got - my hair is now a bit brighter &amp; lighter than my original hair colour and so it suits the skin tone I have now. Left my hair soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just a little note to let you know I used my kit for the first time yesterday. I absolutely love it! No mess, no fuss, just wonderful color, and great, shinning hair! So glad I found you!</li>
            <li> I am very surprised by any of the negative reviews for this product. I have always had my hair coloured professionally but thought I would give this a go after reading about it in woman and home magazine. It was easy to use following the instructions and I love the results. Unlike a previous reviewer who said the smell was awful it really wasn&#x27;t a problem. I will be using this again definitely.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, the kit contains everything you need and the instructions are easy to follow. They sent me the exact shade of red I envisioned, my hair looks and feels wonderful. I used to spend almost $200.00 to have my hair look this good, never again it&#x27;s eSalon from now on.</li>
            <li> I decided to try eSalon personalized color- so I sent in a photo and a detailed description of what wars my hair had fought (and lost) and also my ideal result. When I tried the color out, I was FURIOUS! (Stick with me-- it gets better) Then I began receiving compliments about how natural and pretty my hair looked.  Ok-it was a bit darker than I expected, but now I absolutely love it! I think it hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I started going grey. THANK YOU eSalon!</li>
            <li> Kathy Holder&lt;br /&gt;Jul 17 05:01 pm (PDT)&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic! Love the color!! I have received so many compliments on how great my hair looks. I have recommended your product to several people and I will continue to use your product. Thank you for making me look my best!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product! Very professional people that you work with to find your exact hair color. It covers the grey hair and it lasts. My hair is very hard to color as it pulls red very easily and very quickly.  I have been to a lot of professionals and they still can&#x27;t get it right, so I was skeptical about the whole process.  What a wonderful surprise! These guys know what they are doing. I was even complimented by my very expensive hair stylist that my color was wonderful! It&#x27;s easy to apply and if you are not happy the staff will work with you until you are. I only wish they could do highlights--perhaps that will be the next step in DIY hair color! Thank you for offering professional brand quality hair color to the general public, without the super high prices. I thought I was going to have to give up getting my hair colored, then came along eSalon. Thank you, you are a girl&#x27;s best friend. :)</li>
            <li> Great packaging&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Hair color is so natural looking!!&lt;br /&gt;Have gotten tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> I LOVE eSalon.com! It&#x27;s so nice to just have it arrive in your mailbox, and be able to color when and where you want. Thank you, eSalon.com!</li>
            <li> Loved my hair colored after using the eSalon color solution.  I also love the Color Enhancement Product. My hair has a beautiful sheen &amp; looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from esalon after reading reviews; unfortunately the color received was too dark (light brown) for my 90% gray hair.  I emailed them asking to change the color for the next order.  When I didn&#x27;t get a reply, I went back into the site, filled out a new profile and reordered.  2 days later email from esalon requested that I phone since they couldn&#x27;t retreive the new profile.  I telephoned and was repeatedly asked did I do a new profile?  and then asked how they could know what to send without more information.  Voice quality and tone were borderline condescending.  When they had received the order but misplaced the profile why the attitude?  I realize that she is not the company only the frontline representative, but I was put off by the experience and intend to cancel the order and make an appointment at the salon, a usual.</li>
            <li> So much easier to schedule than having to go to a salon...my hair always feels great after I color it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve been wanting to economize, and letting go of my monthly visit to the salon was a logical choice, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to go back to using store brand hair color. It just didn&#x27;t cover the grays well and the colors were hit or miss for me. E-salon was the perfect solution. They guide you to the color of your choice, and for me that was one that provided amazing gray coverage, and on top of all that E-Salon provided exceptional customer service from beginning to end. I will continue to use E-Salon on a regular subscription basis. Great product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the great hair color I ordered from you. The color is&lt;br /&gt;a perfect match. I will never use any thing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to use it often but when I need to reorder I will contact&lt;br /&gt;you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now.  The items arrive by mail on time and in perfect condition.  The changes I have requested are done immediately.  I love this product.  It allows me the freedom to color my hair at home with salon results minus the $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! Awesome!! Highly recommended!! Excellent hair color! The professionals at esalon were a great help!</li>
            <li> I had a great color experience with eSalon.  I wanted to boost my natural brunette color, which has faded over the years, and cover a few grays here and there.  The last time I went to a salon, I made it very clear that I didn&#x27;t want my hair to look red at all....then after my color, it was red!  I was told that with brunette hair color, you can&#x27;t escape red tones.  So...I paid $85 to have red hair which I did not want.  This happened at a reputed salon in the Portland, OR area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try eSalon, sent them a current picture of my hair, and what I was looking for.  I was sent a kit with my custom color - Medium Brown - Pearl Golden.  I followed the instructions, and it looks beautiful!  Just what a wanted - richer hair hair color with no red tones!  (Nothing against red hair, I just don&#x27;t like it on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to touch up my color with this service.  What you have to do is follow the instructions exactly.  It&#x27;s not just like the box color you buy at the store.  The directions are customized for you.  The blogs I&#x27;ve read of women who were unhappy with their haircolor usually did NOT follow their customized instructions exactly, or did not give a full description of their hair to eSalon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look younger and my new haircolor really looks natural and compliments my skintone.  It&#x27;s not such a dramatic change that people who know me notice I got my hair colored, but it&#x27;s more that I look good.  That&#x27;s all I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have never applied color to my hair before, as I had always had it done in the salon.  The money spent in the salon is ridiculous, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try based on reviews.  I&#x27;ll have to say, as a total novice at applying hair color, this color is perfect! My salon color had become really one dimensional and dull.  My hair is dark brown, but has a lot of red in it.  I had lost the red in the the salon.  I have it back! This color is so close to my original hair color, it&#x27;s unbelievable. I was a little worried about the ammonia as my colorist had always used an ammonia free brand; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been detrimental to my hair at all. It looks healthy, shiny, and soft.  The smell wasn&#x27;t bad and the smell after washing was nothing compared to what my hair used to smell like after getting it colored in the salon. eSalon emailed me with additional questions after I first placed my order and have emailed since to see how it turned out. Based on my description, they were worried that I wanted to lighten my hair and recommended I go to a salon.  I realized that I should have said brighten, not lighten.  I thought their concern and advice were great.  I clearly saw on the web site about recurring orders, so am surprised that others missed this.  I also saw that you don&#x27;t have to continue ordering and it&#x27;s a very easy change.  I am thrilled, totally satisfied, and know that next time will be better as I won&#x27;t be a total novice to the process.</li>
            <li> I love the color-it&#x27;s perfect! The application process was a bit messy, but I&#x27;m wondering if that was because I used the bowl and brush method. I might try just using the bottles next time-I&#x27;m sure the more I do it, the easier it will get!  eSalon nailed it on the color, though!!! Will definitely use this again!</li>
            <li> Very interesting 5 star reviews. Most are grammatically similar with over use of the exclamation point. In fact when have you seen so many five star reviews without a spelling mistake and a short intro sentence followed by ! Also the frequent use of a double !! somewhere in the body. Furthermore this rating would have me believe about 95% of women agree on a product......haha, what are the chances. Bizarre. (I am not in the hair business and don&#x27;t color my hair)</li>
            <li> I love my hair&#x27;s condition after using this color it is just great.  The color was just a little off but I sent in a picture of myself and they have adjusted the color so it is perfect.  I would recommend this product to anyone who just cannot afford salon coloring like myself.  It is so much better than any over the counter product I have been able to obtain.  It is so easy to use and the results are just great.  Take my advice and give it a try</li>
            <li> Just tried ESalon for the first time and it didn&#x27;t meet expectations. The scent was so strong that I had an allergic reaction to it - rapid heartbeat and nausea. It seemed like a good product and left my hair silky, but for the smell. I must give it a low score because of my experience. Note: If you have a sensitive nose, you should think before trying it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color I have ever gotten.  I always do my own hair coloring with the over-the-counter hair color but I decided to try eSalon mainly because they custom make your hair color.  I love it, great coverage, long lasting color and their other products are equally as good.  Might cost me more than the over-the-counter ones but its worth it and still tons less than what you would pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> I just colored my hair this morning with this product. The result came out better than I expected and matched the existing color that I had done at a salon previously. Esalon certainly provides results close to salon quality. The ordering process on their website involves answering 5-10 questions. I received my shipment two days after ordering. However, the coloring process was messier than I had expected. First, it was the mixing of color and development agent. I had to stand next to an open window when I was mixing the two products in a bowl. The fume was unbelievably strong to the point that sting my eyes. Secondly, during the coloring process, I inevitably colored parts of my neck and forehand. The stain remover wipe, which came in the package was not large enough to wipe off all hair dye on my neck. I had to quickly look through the medicine cabinet to look for other solution. Towards the end of the recommend 30 minute coloring time, my scalp began to tinkle a bit. But after I shampooed my hair, the tinkling sensation went away. My hair came out soft and bouncy. Even though the coloring process is a pain, but the price point of this product is good enough for me to order again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, coarse and very porous hair and I have to be cautious with hair products.  The e-salon team helped me match my color perfectly and the condition of my hair is healthy now.  This has saved me money since professional color in a salon was costing me over $100.00.  I also love their other products such as leave in condition and root touch up.</li>
            <li> Best I have used to date. The roots were exactly what I wanted and as the old darker colored hair grows out, I believe my continued use of this coloring will be what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I, like another reviewer, am very skeptical of all the 5 star posts. I read the negative reviews and wish I had listened.  The smell of this product is absolutely toxic. If you do choose to use this product, I suggest having every window available open and every fan available to dissipate the fumes. I would go so far as to suggest wearing a respirator that one wears when working with certain paints and varnishes. I gave this product 2 stars because the color is excellent, and it colored all my gray; it&#x27;s just not worth the fumes. I, personally, will be returning to the low-odor variety which I can purchase at a local store. If smells bother you AT ALL, do NOT get this product. Wish I had listened.</li>
            <li> I did just use the esalon product for the first time today.  The color is perfect.  It matches the color I was using  exactly. The roots look great!  My hair is soft and shiny too.  Hopefully, the color will stay the same after washing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product!! Love the shade, the shine and the finish!! I was suprised at just how good it really is. Very happy. Well worth every penny. Thanks to all the people at esalon!!!</li>
            <li> I just used your products for the first time and I love the color. It&#x27;s shiny and has so many highlights unlike OTC hair colors. It didn&#x27;t burn my scalp the way some products do. The instructions were complete and easy to follow. Everything I needed was right in the kit. Thanks for a great product.  I&#x27;ll be using your colors from now on.</li>
            <li> I love my hair color! It was easy to use, and looks great. Not only is the color beautiful, it&#x27;s made my hair so soft and shiney. I feel as if my hair is much better than before I colored it. I would highly recommend eSalon to anybody, and I plan on having a long relationship with them myself.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent experience all the way.  I have short hair that needs a cut every 3 to 4 weeks and because it so short, any gray is very noticeable; I am not ready for that and the cost of salon coloring with that frequency would be cost-prohibitive. The e-salon product was the perfect color, the perfect instructions, the perfect solution and perfect gray-coverage. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have always gone to a professional when it came to my hair. But I saw the ad for e-salon online. I thought why not? My kit arrived in incredible packaging with easy to follow instructions. I love it!!! It was true to color and the shampoo and conditioner they give you was so luscious! I highly recommend this company. If for some reason you do need help, they are only a phone call away. Thank you E-salon. I look forward to my next shipment!</li>
            <li> I had a great experience with e salon.  I had never dyed my own hair before, always had it done at the salon.  I have short curly hair and only wanted to do my roots.  I watched the video several times and read the FAQ.  I took a picture of my roots and sent it to e salon with my order. The color matched perfectly.  I did it 4 weeks ago and wanted to make sure that it did not damage my hair before I wrote my review.  Not only was the color perfect but it did not change the texture of my hair at all.  I love the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the color.  I also love the cream that takes off the dye on the sides of your face.  There is nothing worse then walking out of a salon and getting home and finding dye all over the sides of your face.  Just a tip, don&#x27;t forget to take your shirt off before you dye your hair, if you do forget, put a shower cap on and then lift your shirt off, I did this and it worked</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this company. I was a little worried what the color would look like. It was darker than I expected yet I really love it. My hair turned out great. I&#x27;m excited to use this product again.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hair Color - Nice&lt;br /&gt;Covered Grey&lt;br /&gt;Nice Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Follow Steps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Strong Awful Smell - Smelled similar to that of a Perm&lt;br /&gt;Auto Renewal of Same Color only&lt;br /&gt;Cannot customize to get a different color - an email is sent to there color specialist to alter the color</li>
            <li> For those of you into an update or a full on change in the privacy of your own home or hotel...You CAN NOT beat the customer service of eSalon!  They custom mix your color, consult with you and for those in need..AWESOME gray coverage with no heat required.  If you like to color, but are on a budget...this company is the way to go!! I have never experienced better customer service, anywhere!  They have even credited me, when the Post office cracked a bottle.  This is a fabulous company with a wonderful product.  My hair (very fine and curly with a lot of silver) is so soft and shiny after my coloring it with their products!!!</li>
            <li> I felt the gloves were a little small. I had a hard time getting them on and ripped the first one. The wrist opening is just a little too small. Do you have a larger size? Otherwise I found I was very pleased with the ease of the procedure and with all of the items supplied.</li>
            <li> Do not be scared of eSalon everyone! I just finished my third application, and I think I finally have it down. I use my color every 3 weeks for gray coverage. For nearly 10 years I&#x27;ve been coloring my gray roots, and for the last 4 or so years, it&#x27;s been more than once a month. I was spending about $100 a month, and figured that this was just my life now. I had tried a variety of drug store box colors and learned the hard way that they are not for amateurs, and definitely not great if used once a month. My hair ended up several different colors and the gray was stubborn and never stayed covered. A $700 color correction later, I vowed to never color my hair again.  But to have a color formulated for me, to have a stylist that I can contact, to be able to change the formula slightly...I&#x27;m sold. I wanted to wait a few months to give my review though, just in case. I was nervous about having to finagle with the formula, like my hair might not &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; at first, but even though I did need to go a bit darker and have a stronger formula to cover my stubborn grays, it was worth it! This is going to save me over $1000 a year and now trims are back in my hair budget!  The Customer Service is probably by far the greatest part though. Due to a weird post office error, one of my orders was delayed and I FREAKED OUT. I had gray roots and I needed them GONE. I called CS freaking out, I wasn&#x27;t super nice, but they calmed me down, said no worries, they&#x27;d do whatever I wanted. They ended up sending me a new color free of charge using express service and I only had to wait a couple of days. Still a bummer, but definitely not their fault and they handled it really well. My original shipment did end up coming a few days later too, but they totally understand my hesitation to wait for it to arrive and risk it not showing up. Great product, great service, all around just so happy I found it.</li>
            <li> Most professional and talented Team. Efficient delivery right to my door. Excellent product. My hair color is just what I wanted and it&#x27;s condition is nothing short of lush. Top rate personal attention by the eSalon Team. I am completely satisfied!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nervous to try this online ordered product, but once I received the kit...  I LOVED it!  It came with 2 bottles so I was sure it would cover all of my hair.  Came with a shampoo, conditioner, gloves, application brush, preventative stain packet, and stain remover PLUS coloring products...  More than I expected.  Had to read directions a few times to figure out that one color was for my roots and the other for my ends... different from boxed items.  When I was done conditioning, my hair felt healthy - not color treated.  When my hair dried - I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was truly the color that I selected... and best part was that  ALL my grays were covered.  I have bought color products that did no even color my grays - even though they claimed to cover 100% of grays....  I would recommend this product to my family and friends... The cost savings is awesome compared to what I have spent getting my hair professionally colored  --- at least $100 savings...  Very happy I have tried this and will use again...</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome hair color I have ever used. Trust me I have used alot of hair color in my time from paying $200.00 to have it colored to using every box brand on the markert. I really liked one by L&#x27;Oreal but it did not cover my gray roots when I started to get mostly gray. So I change to the mousse by John Friedia and I really like it. I kept reading about this in alot of different magazines and thought why not give it a try for $5.00. My hair has felt like straw for about a 2 years now. I lost about 40lbs and thought that might have been why so I just dealed with it. Well the first time I ordered it was just about at the end of winter so I ordered it a little darker, I always go a little darker in the winter so I don&#x27;t look so pale. I thought it was wonderful the color is unbelievable it is better than getting highlights and low lights, the different colors of blond in this color seems more natural.  Every time I washed my hair I was shocked it was not dried out. It took me a few weeks the first time before I colored my hair, so I emailed eSalon and ask them to wait a couple of weeks before they sent the next color, and if they would send it about 1 shade lighter. They were so nice and had no problems with my request. I went to the hair dresser to have her cut my hair and she was shocked at what good condition my hair was in just as she had been when it started feeling like straw. Until the pasat 2 years i had not had that problem. Not only that my hairdresser and I our friends since we don&#x27;t see each other often we r just kinda in our own little space when I am there. After she cut my haird and styling it she was like woiw look at this color it is so pretty. I told I tried eSalon on line (they don&#x27;t do color at the shop I go to) she got the other hairdresser to come over and look and feel my hair. They were so shocked that I did not have it done professionaily. I recieved my second box of color a couple of weeks ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The color was just alittle lighter which is good but the most amazing thing that I can not get over is the condition of my hair. I have changed no other product I use except now if I use all the creme and seriums I used to take care of the straw hair (which I no longer have), my hair is just greasy and limp.So I just wash, condition and put on what I have always put on for volume. As long as I can afford this and if you do not change anythimg about it (please, please don&#x27;t) I will be a forever customer. It is well worth the price. Best color I have ever had on my hair.</li>
            <li> Never have I dealt with a more supportive team.  I can email them and they actually respond.  Customer care is #1.  I would recommend this service to any one who regularly needs to go to a salon every month at extravagant prices.  You can do this and you should do this.</li>
            <li> I am very please, love the color!  Gray coverage was excellent...other dyes would leave my grays lighter than the rest of my hair.  This dye left my hair all the same color, and helped hide what I thought was thinning hair on top.</li>
            <li> I love the new color! My sister thinks it is more vibrant than the color I was using.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair color one can purchase without having to go to an expensive salon.  I just used it the first time and the results were awesome.  I plan on continuing using this product. I have been a faithful customer for over a year now.  They only continue to live up to their promises and their products.  They truly care about their customers and provide professional guidance and help 24/7.  If at any point the color becomes not what it was, they change the formula you were using.  They truly are a wonderful company and I stand by them 100%.</li>
            <li> Love the eSalon color system. They asked what color I would like and what my issues were.  I got to pick out the color with simple questions.  They suggested I send in a pic of myself so that they could see the color I currently was.  Did that.  Very simple to do.  This product and instructions were so easy, my husband could do it for me.  I looks better than going to a salon.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the absolute best hair color I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used  professional as well as box brands. I like to use demi or semi permanent color on my rather dark hair for shine and pizazz. The color that was recommended to me be eSalon was a medium brown with a pearlized copper. Very nice! Perfect! Not too dark with nice deep copper highlights. Not orange at all. Sweet little kit with plenty of product for my longish thick hair. eSalon hair color is so well conceived!! I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality. Also it is rare that I would write a rave review about anything....so be assured this is special!!</li>
            <li> Melanie Oliver bought this product and loved it.  Everything was packaged very nicely and directions were clear.  They had adjusted the color for me and they picked something very much like the color I had previously used with a drug store brand. However, unlike the drug store brands, it did not fade after a few weeks (I&#x27;m a red-head).  I am ready for coloring again and can&#x27;t wait to use this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve colored my hair myself with another brand I loved for years, but when I saw this product and how they used not only my picture and other details but also my goals and desires, I wanted to give them a try. I&#x27;ve been using eSalon for over 6 mos now and have been totally thrilled! I even edited my color after the 2nd month to go a little lighter, and they got it right on the mark. I also like the way they ask me afterwards if there are any concerns or changes I need to make.  It looks so natural that even my statist tells me how professional my hair looks. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Esalon gave me the color I have been searching for, for years! No one ever got it right until I tried Esalon. I don&#x27;t know how they did it but they did.  Even my husband said &amp;#34; At last you got it right!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First class product the colour was fab and the condition of my hair afterwards was glossy and soft</li>
            <li> I did my hair for the first time in my years. I loved using the brush. The next morning I was very pleased with the results. I went to dermatologist, he was checking my head, he said no gray.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to change up the color and sent in writing a description. The color came with explicit directions and turned out just as I had hoped.The e-salon team did a great job of interpreting what I wanted and explaining the new how-to. I recommend e-salon to all of my friends and family. The quality of the product seems equal to what I paid a lot more for at a salon.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because everything isn&#x27;t what it seems to be nowadays. But I have to tell you I double dared myself and tried the product and couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I dyed my hair privy to seeing the ad..of course I was mad at myself, then curiosity got the best of me. So I went for it and I&#x27;m never sorry. I tried telling my family about it they too are skeptical but when they see my hair...well need I say more. The color, the step by step directions just for me, the way the shampoo and conditioner smelled made me eel special. What a difference, I will stay on their list for updates. Thanks esalon.</li>
            <li> I love this. Have been using it since first heard of it last year. It&#x27;s like having a personal colourist all to myself. Never had such a happy outcome. Previously the expensive trip to the hairdresser - difficult to organise since I work very long hours and am often on call at weekends, has been fraught with anxiety. Even if the job is ok, it always needs redoing long before I can manage it again.&lt;br /&gt;This is lovely stuff, makes my hair look great and lasts. Instructions easy to follow and fool proof. Loads of opportunities to tweak colour if you feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m growing my hair long now because I know I can keep it looking good. No dark ends and great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this at such a reasonable price. No fuss. No appointments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you e salon. I hope the human beings behind this product know how much they&#x27;re appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana T.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased. I have never been able to achieve the color I wanted without brassiness using drugstore hair colors, and I can&#x27;t afford to have a stylist color my hair every couple of months. I was so impressed when I studied the contents of my package. The color and developer were customized as expected, but the thing that impressed me most was the customized instruction pamphlet! I didn&#x27;t have to do any guesswork to get great results, and I&#x27;ve already gotten several unsolicited compliments. Thank you so much; this is a wonderful service and well worth the reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The eSalon experience was FLAWLESS. I am a self appointed eSalon spokesperson, speading the word on the GREAT SERVICE and AMAZING OUTCOME. I had created a color disaster when I applied brown color over red with gold tones. Which left me with gold/greenish color. Then came eSalon to the rescue. I love my \\&quot;corrected\\&quot; hair color and so does everyone else. The new color has gotten many inquiries and compliments. THANK YOU, eSalon!!!!</li>
            <li> These coloring kits have everything the pros have. You get your colorant to mix with the activator. You get a packet of color guard which you use to protect your hairline, ears, etc. You also get a packet of stain remover in case  you get dye on you. You get 2 pairs of gloves, a packet of color safe shampoo to wash excess dye from your hair and a packet of color safe conditioner which leaves your hair soft like in the salons. Easy to choose and/or change your schedule for coloring. Everything is included in your order to make it easy and give you confidence enough to do your own coloring.  Best way to get salon quality color &amp; results for a third of the price. Been using them for several months and I am very happy with the scheduling and color options. Shipped right to your door.

            <li> Best product ever!  Professionalism personified.  The product, instructions, personal attention by the colorist - what more is there?  How about looking fabulous and saving hours and lots of money at a salon?  So happy l found eSalon.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their product for almost three years now. I originally started with the permanent color, but have just begun using their demi-permanent (washes out in a few weeks). The color is consistent across orders, the instructions are clear, their supplies are awesome -- 2 pairs of gloves! The shampoo and conditioner are wonderful as well. I get it auto-shipped every 6 weeks. I&#x27;m definitely a satisfied customer.     ETA: Customer service has always responded immediately and to my satisfaction whenever I&#x27;ve had an issue. They take care of you. (I contacted them via email)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the hair color that was composed for me at E Salon.  I love their product.  I just sent an email describing my fine hair and the color I wanted, and they put it together and sent it back to me.  It completely covers the grey, and the color is fabulous.  I definitely recommend E Salon for anyone who would like a color designed for them.</li>
            <li> I too am suspicious about any of these “Excellent” reviews. I came across eSalon through nCrowd deals and thought I’d try it since it “sounded” good and supposedly professional type coloury, so I purchased it. I received the package and was impressed with the presentation. However, was extremely disappointed. First it is extremely strong of chemicals and ammonia, which I do not use for my hair but I tried it not knowing. I’ve had professional hair colours and also drug store colours for 3 decades so I know what my hair is supposed to feel like and smell like, and after I put it on, it is SO VERY strong, I had to put my t-shirt up over my face to breathe. My husband had to leave the house he couldn’t stand it and I was in the bathroom. Also right away I could tell it was stripping my hair and the texture of my hair felt very bad, so after only 15-20 mins (half the time they said to)  I tried to rinse it out ASAP. And again, is so strong it actually wasn’t even rinsing out and my hair texture felt really bad, like straw, I was scared and kept rinsing forever, and had to also shampoo my hair &amp; rinse thoroughly 3 times to get it out! and I never have to do that. I slathered on my own intense conditioner and left on for 3 hours so it would reverse the dryness. So obviously I was not ever going to purchase this product again. God only really knows what’s in their formula.&lt;br /&gt;Then – today I note that this company eSalon has charged a brand new charge to my credit card of $29.95 !? for something I never purchased. I never even received anything further from them, and I never kept any of the paperwork from when I’d received the prior package. I went on their website to find the Contact phone number, which states to call Monday – Friday before 5pm Pacific time. Well it is 2:00pm MST here which is only 1:00pm there, on a Friday and conveniently their greeting states that they are closed. So I left a very stern message that I did not agree to any further charges or purchases and to refund me immediately. We’ll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Surprisingly, they did call me back quite quickly and said that when I purchased, there was a notification at Check Out, AND that by checking out, I was agreeing to this. I said I didn’t see that anywhere so it seems that it is very strategically place so that it isn’t noticeable, as I read everything because I have been duped by this kind of scheme before would never have agreed to this. That said, she was nice enough to refund me which will take a few business days, and turned off the auto-purchase on my account. The reason I haven’t received the product is because it is auto-charged first, once it goes through, they ship it, takes up to 10 days. The reason why their voice-mail greeting stated they were closed today is because tomorrow it’s July 4th So it’s a 2-day holiday?&lt;br /&gt;LESSON:  Unfortunately like many of these businesses eg. Perricone, etc. they shadily and sneakily put you on one of those AUTO purchase plans without you even knowing it, just by you checking out, you’re agreeing to very hidden terms and conditions, so BEWARE. And if you order by phone with these companies, record the full conversation and state that you do not agree to any Auto-Purchases or future charges to your credit card.and to refund me immediately.

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and salons over the years but this is the first time I actually had gray coverage. I will definitely  be recommending  e salon to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing a stylist for years now....every single time I see her (this has actually happened with 2 different stylist in the same matter) she cannot recreate the color she created to begin with!  It&#x27;s always too copper, too red or too dull and brown. And as a striving actress in NYC I just cannot have that....it has to look the same as my headshots or I don&#x27;t get work. My hair is a natural strawberry blonde and I dye it copper/red a little deeper and richer than my natural color.  And FINALLY i have found my perfect colorist....but she/he is online!  I sent them my requests and a photo of the color I was looking for and presto!  In the mail 3 days later I received the perfect!!!  affordable!!  and ready made color just for me!  The instructions were simple and every thing you would need was right in the kit!  I&#x27;m NEVER going back!  THANK YOU esalon for making my life easier, cheaper and much more beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for many years and have used drugstore brands, mixed my own at wholesale beauty supply outlets, and had my stylist color it. This product and service is the best of all choices. They did an amazing job getting the color right, the product arrives in a solid package exactly when they say it will, and there&#x27;s no offensive odor. This color has lasted longer than any I&#x27;ve ever used, including salon color. You can select the frequency of new product (number of weeks) and they communicate every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My back story ... the first time, with only a completed questionnaire and one photo, I liked the color. However, I&#x27;m used to tinkering with it, so I requested that they remove some red, add some blond. They did that and then I realized that they were right the first time. It was easy to order, easy to change, and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> beth ann robinson&lt;br /&gt;Jul 16 05:35 am (PDT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this product and service! I have told anyone who will listen and everyone wants to try it. I will be reordering soon. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Ann</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this service and the actual hair color. I was trying to decide between two colors and having the models picture to play with made it easy. I was surprised by the personalized packaging and detailed instructions. THIS is the BEST hair color I have ever used. The color was EXACTLY what I wanted. When you sign up, you are added to auto-ship which is perfect for me because I finally found a great product and won&#x27;t go back to the shelf again!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to every one I know. Color is perfect and multi toned! Easy customer service, you can up load a picture of yourself and tell them all of your preferences, and they listen! This is my fourth time using this product and I plan on using it for a long time!</li>
            <li> Without talking to me personally or seeing my hair, they sent me the most gorgeous color! Amazing!</li>
            <li> The online ordering process was very easy, I was presented with several hair color types to choose from, colors that would look good on me and that were possible considering my current hair color.  Once I received my color, it was easy to apply and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  The color is consistent and covered all my other color (I had a disaster prior to using eSalon).  I will absolutely use this again!</li>
            <li> I had a good experience with this product.  My daughter took a cosmetology course at school and applied the color which made it easier to use.  Not so sure I would have tried it by myself.  It came out great, it was soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I was away for the summer and did not want to wait to go home to my favorite hair salon man to cover my gray.  I described my hair, the original color, what I wanted it to look like and sent two photos.  When the product came, it was packaged very nicely and easy to use.  Yes, it smells strong, but cover up and it takes only about 30-40 minutes for whole process.  The color came out just lovely and natural.  I was quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Nan</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I ordered it but after took a bit of my hair to see what the color would be, I was surprised it was just the color I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It covers the gray so effectively and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I tried eSalon for the first time last week and I am thrilled with the results. I sent pictures of myself and a description of my hair and desired color on the website and quickly received a package with hair color, a brush, stain preventer, stain remover (which I didn&#x27;t need), shampoo and conditioner, and two pairs of gloves. My gray is completely covered, my roots are blended smoothly into the color of the rest of my [previously colored] hair, my hair color looks natural without the horrible monochromatic look that screams \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, and I don&#x27;t have the reddish tints that stylists insist on adding even when I say I do not want them. My hair feels so soft and it shines. I paid $125.00 at the salon a few months ago, and my hair didn&#x27;t look as healthy and natural as it does today, one week after I did it myself at home. I am a complete clumsy amateur at almost everything, but this system was designed to be fool-proof. They have a loyal customer in me now.</li>
            <li> I found the process of ordering personalized color very simple.  I answered the questions and chose the color I wanted.  I wanted to go back closer to my natural color instead of being lighter.  After receiving the color I was concerned I had picked a color that was too dark for me.  To my relief and somewhat surprise I put the color on and it was exactly the color I wanted.  I think it turned out great.  My daughter applied the color and we had a great time together.  After all is said and done the color is perfect.  I look forward to my next order and some day in the future perhaps changing things up a bit.  I recommend this service to everyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered my hair color from Esalon and it came in a very nice packaged container in a very timely manor. My hair color was dark brown same as my roots so I got a lighter brown to lighten it up. It looks amazing. The product is top notch in my book and I will for sure be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> The website is great and makes choosing the right color foolproof...the product is even more amazing....this is the best my hair has looked since I was 35! The grey coverage is super and the color is natural.  I went from using a temporary color that was supposed to be a warm chestnut brown but turned my hair copperish to choosing the esalon&#x27;s permanent dark blonde color. All of the brassy red tones are finally gone and my roots match! I was hesitant to go with permanent color using peroxide (have sensitive, older skin), but it actually made my hair better and the best part is the natural color - not dyed looking- and the roots blended perfectly. It&#x27;s great to not have to worry about coloring after a few shampoos too. I can&#x27;t thank them enough for making this possible since I cannot afford a monthly beauty salon treatment. Finally, they also conveniently supply all of the tools needed to make the do-it-yourself experience as easy as posibble.</li>
            <li> One very happy Brit! :) This product is exactly what I have been looking for!  Very simple to use, the results are great, good coverage with my desired colour and the shine is fantastic! Following all the hype and positive reviews in British newspapers and magazines, I thought I&#x27;d try this out of sheer curiosity as I like to colour and play around with my hair (usually just with a wash-in-wash-out product or semi-perm, different tones, etc).  My natural colouring is a &#x27;copper blonde&#x27; although it tends to go darker during the Scottish winters.  I have pale skin, blue/grey eyes.  I completed the questionnaire but didn&#x27;t send a photo.  I was very surprised at the shade as it is as close to my natural colour as I requested and it is gorgeous!  For me, it&#x27;s perfect and I would recommend this to anyone who is keen to try something new.  Many thanks to the eSalon team xx</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products only to have a complete hair disaster that had to be corrected at a salon until now.  eSalon created a formula that was perfectly matched and easy to apply and turned out perfect.  I am completely surprised that it turned out as well as it did.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong trying their hair dye.  I not only got exactly what I wanted, but it has lasted, even after 6 shampoos &amp; still going strong.  Finally, I made a great choice in &amp;#34;on-line&amp;#34; shopping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now with their monthly auto ship and love it! My daughter uses it as well. It certainly is comparable to salon color and they really do tweak color for you. I use the reds and have gone through different shades trying them out. They will adjust to achieve what your looking for. They even throw in little surprises along the way. It&#x27;s actually fun to get their package in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tammy Herstad</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and service. I have used it twice and love the results. I highly recommend this product and the ESalon Team!</li>
            <li> I received my first shipment in July. But I went to my stylist to get my hair colored, because I was going on a vacation and didn&#x27;t want to take the chance that eSalon might not turn out right. HA! Little did I know how amazing this product is. I just used my first eSalon shipment yesterday. My hair looks like I just stepped out of the salon. Seriously, my hair has that same shine and bounce you get from your stylist. I have shoulder length hair and it is full and soft, even though I applied the color only to my roots. The color really surprised me too.  The color I get from my stylist is a dark brown with golden highlights. When I use an OTC root touch up, I get a distinct line where that color is placed. But with eSalon there is no line. I&#x27;m very impressed that the eSalon color blended with my color and highlights so well.&lt;br /&gt;Though eSalon gives you a really nice brush, I chose to put the color on using the applicator bottle. I was in a bit of a hurry and did a pretty sloppy job - and yet my hair looks amazing!  I&#x27;m hooked after my first application. It couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. They send everything you need. The auto delivery service allows you to control what you want and when you want it. If you don&#x27;t want a shipment sent, you simply change the date online. They know they have a quality product and service so they don&#x27;t need to lock the customer into a set schedule. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging of this product. Came with everything you need. I would definitely purchase again. My sister is a hair stylist and she has given me direction in the past on coloring my hair but this was so much easier</li>
            <li> I loved it ....I see some negative feedback about hidden charges.... I have to disagree...I t is clearly stated that your will be charged for next shipments and. That you can cancel  at any time you wish to stop said shipments.... Ladies if you are not reading everything you are buying /agreeing to and blindly believe that everytime product is being sent its free ...well then ???......I am definitely going to continue with this product</li>
            <li> Best coverage on my grey around my face.  The color was a perfect match.  Exactly what I wanted.  Even my hairdresser commented on the color.&lt;br /&gt;Great product with all you need delivered right to your  home.</li>
            <li> I decided to try eSalon because I as tired of paying $100+ at the salon every 3 months. I was very pleased! They matched my color exactly. My hair is soft and shiny, and the product didn&#x27;t burn like the salon treatment. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been coloring my hair at home for years and was not satisfied with the results.  Not wanting to pay salon prices, I decided to try this.  By far the highest quality hair coloring I have ever used at home.  Easy to do and the color lasts for a long time.  I have stubborn grays but this covers them all.  Highly recommend buying the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; with the brush, bowl and clips.  Makes it SO much easier to apply the color.  Their color safe shampoo and conditioner are totally worth the price.  They are very high quality and turned my straw like hair into super soft hair.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  They are also good about adjusting the color until you have what you want.  High recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new esalon hair colour I used it for the first time and everyone has complemented me on my new colour also the condition is great at last I have found a hair colour that looks natural I just love it .</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair off and on for the past 10 years - ever since the gray started dulling down my natural color. I&#x27;d always just gone to the natural blonde shade it was in high school, using Garnier, Clairol, Loreal, and other name brands. I&#x27;d always been happy with those. When I saw an ad for eSalon, I decided to try it, and go with a more red shade, as my coloring works with it, my daughters, sister, and nieces are all red-heads. I figured, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t have a photo to send that showed my color properly, so I chose a shade that looked easy to move to, described my color and cut, and waited. The color arrived quickly, including a stain blocker to rub on your skin at the hairline to keep the color from - you guessed it - staining my skin, a stain remover to remove any staining. shampoo, conditioner, a brush applicator, two pairs of rubber gloves, and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were easy to follow, and not nearly as complicated as some others here have said. Really no different than the instructions with any of the other products I&#x27;ve used - don&#x27;t color clean hair, divide it into sections, holding the sections with plastic clips (metal clips will interact with the color and damage the hair. I don&#x27;t divide my hair because I have a pixie cut - nothing to clip!). Pour the developer into the color, shake well, and apply beginning at the roots, making sure to give special attention to any parts. Once you&#x27;ve covered all your hair, let it sit for a half hour. The only thing different from other hair color products was to add water to any color you have left until it&#x27;s about half water/half color, and add that to the coloring in your hair (best to do this in the shower, it can get messy) and work it in until it&#x27;s like a creamy shampoo. Rinse all the color out, then shampoo and condition as usual - I always use the shampoo and conditioner they send, it lasts for two shampoos as my hair is very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first color wasn&#x27;t red enough, and needed the gold punched up as well. I emailed my colorist and told her what I wanted, and she did exactly what I asked. The second was closer, but still not exactly what I wanted. I told my colorist that the gold level was fine, but I needed the red punched up just a shade. That third time was the charm! I have exactly the subdued copper color I want, gray is covered, my hair feels great, and is easy to manage, and even seems to be growing faster (I have to have it trimmed more often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend eSalon. Take advantage of your custom colorist - it&#x27;s free!gh, and needed the gold punched up as well. I emailed my colorist and told her what I wanted, and she did exactly what I asked.

            <li> This is a great product handled by professionals.  They work with their customers to get exactly what you are looking for.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and the results are amazing.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with their hair color and customer service.  I was unable to find a home hair color I was satisfied with.  Either it was too red or too brown. eSalon worked with me and tweaked it until I happy with the results.  It&#x27;s a little more money, but worth the extra cost since you can get just the shade you want.  Give them a them a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I started using eSalon because I was sick and tired of using the boxed stuff at the store and getting incomplete coverage.  I figured it would be worth a try and was better when comparing prices to the amount that I had to buy at the store to get complete white coverage.  The first order I had was really nice but the color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted. So I uploaded a few pics and explained to the colorist what I wanted to change about the color and the next shipment was PERFECT! I get at least 3 compliments a day when I am out and about. Perfect strangers will come up and tell me how beautiful the color of my hair is. I always point them to esalon.com and I know of a few that are satisfied customers themselves now. Do yourself a favor and try this out. You will be hooked. The auto shipments are nice and they keep up with your whites if you have that issue. But if you don&#x27;t want to do the auto shipments you don&#x27;t have to. Either way you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw an ad about eSalon but did not give it a second thought, then I read a review and decided to give it a try and it was one of the best decisions that I could have made.  I signed up, gave the specifics about my hair color and type and sent a couple of head shots.  I also mentioned to eSalon that I wanted a little more warmth to my hair color.  Soon after, I received my personalized hair color in the mail and loved the presentation. I used the color before a family event the following week and got a ton of compliments.  One of my sisters even described my color as stunning! I truly recommend eSalon to anyone who is just thinking about it.  It is really worth it!  Thanks eSalon!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.  Thought since I had to decide on a color as opposed to an actual person looking down on my hair color, my greys and choosing a color that this was going to be a disaster.  What if the color was too light?...Too dark?  Well it looks like Esalon knows exactly what they are doing.  I sent in a picture, and chose a color.  After receiving it (I waited two weeks to dye my hair out of fear it would turnout awful) I followed enclosed instructions and was completely flabbergasted with the results.  Incredibly soft hair, perfect color match to my existing color!  Nothing short of WOW!!  I would highly recommend those busy moms like me to dye their hair at home.  My 4 yr old daughter enjoyed watching me dye it.  She even served as an assistant!  : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to pay the extremely high prices to have someone color my hair.  I have been coloring my hair for years; however, I always wished a professional would tell me what color I should color my hair.  I tried eSalon.  I sent them my picture I took quickly on my cell phone when I placed an order for what color I thought I would want.  Shortly after sending my order, they sent an email to let me know they changed my color to a more flattering color for my skin tone.  They also said that if I did not like the color, they would send the color I originally ordered FREE.  I&#x27;ve used the color they sent and it is spot on.  I love it!  I use a sulfur free shampoo, so the color is not lightening.  I don&#x27;t work for them nor know anyone there.  I will be ordering from them from now on!</li>
            <li> They NAILED it!  Love, love, love the color!  I originally chose a color, but after I submitted a picture, they recommended a different color based on my current color, complexion, etc.  I am SO glad they did - the color they recommended was exactly what I described in my order.  The coloring process took a little longer than it does with the typical drug store color, but I think that&#x27;s because the coverage is so much better and the roots are treated differently than the ends.  Another positive - there was PLENTY of color for long, thick, curly, course hair - a challenge I have had with the drug store variety.  I am very happy with this service - especially the options to choose how frequently you want to recolor.</li>
            <li> Excellent products!  Makes my hair look great and covers all the gray!  I&#x27;ve recommended this to several women in my office and they are all fans now!</li>
            <li> I tried eSalon using their easy online process by answering color questions. My first color I was not completely satisfied with so requested a change for the next order. I was not happy with the next change either. They called and talked to me and I discovered that color terms I was using meant something different to color specialists. Once we were talking apples to apples I was able to convey the color I was trying to achieve. My next color was right on and I am truly happy. Thank you eSalon so much for working with me to get a color that I really am happy with now.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier. I recently wrote to them when they sent me notice, which they do every month, that it was time to get my order ready, &amp; asking if I had any changes I wanted to make. I wrote and asked it I could go just a little lighter, maybe 1 shade. When I got my order, they had lightened my order &amp; informed me of special instructions how to use it for the best results. I had gone to a stylist for over 20 years then moved to another state &amp; had trouble finding the right stylist. I saw an add on FB for eSalon &amp; took a chance, I&#x27;ll never go back to the regular store colors &amp; can use this at my convenience in the comfort of my home! I highly recommend this product, my hair has never been in better condition &amp; the color &amp; ease of use is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product, price and service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been a e.color custom for a few months now.  I love that my color is send to me just when I need it. I get an email when e.color is going to mix my color and asked if I would like to make any changes. I changed my color this last shippment, and I love it!  I just email what I wanted and the change was made and it is great.  I am 68 years old and mostly gray.  The color covers my gray, make my hair soft and looks fuller. You get all that is needed in the kit, and  cost less then what a salon would cost.  The color was mixed just for me and deliver to my door. What more could an old lady want!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Am pleasantly surprised at how well you matched my color! Not an easy thing to match a redhead!!</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t fill my order. I&#x27;m sorry, but with the claims they make to be as good as a salon, and the fact that I&#x27;ve had various shades of this same color for at least 6 years if not more, with NO PROBLEMS doing it myself and the last 3 years by a salon - and they can&#x27;t make one for my hair? I&#x27;m blonde. They say they can&#x27;t make one light enough! Ummm, it was already dark blonde with some ginger, now it&#x27;s golden blonde (with a little ginger) - sounds real hard, huh? I&#x27;ve never been told by anyone that it could not be done. I did it myself to start with! I&#x27;ve put off trying eSalon for years and now I know why! They said that they don&#x27;t have the high lift ingredients that L&#x27;Oreal does. Well, I never used any high lift products by L&#x27;Oreal. It was one excuse after another. When you think about it though - if you send a photo of your hair and you want to keep it the same color - how does a picture tell them? It doesn&#x27;t. I think if I could have told them the brand name and # from the stuff my salon uses, they would have filled it. But, that&#x27;s not the way they say it works on their ads. I have taken up doing my own manicures and wanted to do my own hair, because I work full time and have a grandbaby on the way - less appointments means happier me. I&#x27;ll get there, but not with &#x27;Custom&#x27; formulated Hair Color by eSalon. It&#x27;s not custom-formulated - imo, they just give you their formulation of the same thing you have been using. Have emails to share if anyone is thinking about using them.</li>
            <li> Just used my new hair color and LOVE it!! My husband had stars in his eyes when I showed him!</li>
            <li> I used the color and am very happy with it. My hair is jet black (I&#x27;m east Indian) and usually ended up with messy jobs at home and salons. The pharmacy colors stain my scalp and salons always leave my roots lighter (My roots are 80% grey). Forever unhappy and salons also rubbed my skin and bruised it few times when they tried to take the excesses off my forehead and temples : ((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveda Salon at Avenues Mall (Jacksonville, Florida) is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on.. I luv the way its not stained my scalp or hairline, lovvvvd the stain remover.. ever so gentle.. just wipe n wait 30 sec n its gone. Color, Shampoo n conditioner are great quality n left my hair soft n healthy. I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the customized color that the team at eSalon made for me.  I thought the color I wanted was a little darker...but their specialists modified my order to one a shade lighter.  They were absolutely right!  It&#x27;s perfect!  Just ordered the touch up wand for the in between &amp;#34;sparklies&amp;#34; that pop up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair since forever. I&#x27;m really good at it. But, now I have more grays and the shade just wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I wanted it. So, I tried eSalon. I am so very happy and impressed with this product. A colorist called me and spent atleast a half hour going over my formula with me. It arrived and there was more than enough product. The color is rich, natural looking and just perfect. I think that anyone who doesn&#x27;t try this is missing out of the deal of the century.&lt;br /&gt;The color is holding beautifully and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service and excellent price!  If you&#x27;re like me and spend at least $1,000 a year to cover the gray, try eSalon today!  Be sure to upload a picture if you want the color to match what you have now.  They&#x27;ll get it right!</li>
            <li> I am stunned! My eSalon package came today (really fast) and I have colored my hair. I have never done hair color at home before. This process is so easy! The color is perfect, PERFECT!!  The eSalon team recommended a color slightly lighter than I had picked and they were right on.  The color is not fading and there is lots of shine.  I am so glad that I did the final shine rinse in the shower since that part is a bit messy (just like the directions stated).  I am thrilled and my husband loves it also.</li>
            <li> The perfect color AND esalon was smart enough to send me enough color to not only color my roots but to color my ends bc they knew I would need to bc i was going with a darker color. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I will admitt, I was skeptic!!! And not too sure about the fact that after I picked the color I WANTED, they told me THEY picked a better color suited for me (but still in the color frame I wanted, just that they tweeked it). So I get my color made for me in the mail😃I was nervous but anxious to get started. When I mixed the color I was still nervous, but went ahead with the process! WOW!!!!!! eSalon specialists were SO right with the color they created for ME!!! I absolutley LOVE it!!!!!!! Fantastic!! I will never go to the pharmacy for a box color (where its a guessing game) or to my local salon ever again! Lol!! I&#x27;m sticking to this product!! Its the BEST in my opinion!! Thank you eSalon!!! You guys rock!! My husband keeps saying &amp;#34;I just love your hair color, it suites you perfectly!!&amp;#34; 😃😉😍😍💁💏</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for 20+ years.  I have had it professionally colored only a few times but typically color it myself from products purchased at the beauty supply store.  I have to say that the color I hoped to achieve through the &amp;#34;Made for You - Customized Hair Color&amp;#34; by eSalon is spot on!  The color is exactly what I described as wanting, the vibrant color doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; it appears very natural.  My hair seems healthier and shinier than before.  I won&#x27;t go back to the other method of doing my hair color.  I will stay with this product and will definitely recommend to those I know who use hair color.  This is fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is the most Awesome company! I have never been able to do anything to my hair myself.  However,  with the great professional help from eSalon I was able to color correct a mistake made by a professional hair stylist. eSalon made a mixture of color just for me, the package came with everything I could possibly use. It came with easy to use instructions,  if you can follow a recipe,  then you too can follow the made just for you instructions in the privacy of your own home. I have become a life member of eSalon, and feel that I have top professionals at the end of a call, or an email away;  which they answer within an hour or less. Highly recommend.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I loved this home hair color. Easy, fast and perfect color!</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage even over the copper colour my hair was and my greys, love the colour exactly what I wanted. The shampoo &amp; conditioner are great &amp; make my hair really shiny. Colour has not faded as much as if buying a dye from a shop or even from a salon, Iwill definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I first experience the eSalon, and the color was just perfect. I liked the whole concept, from how simple was to choose the color, to the system of sending me the color periodically. I&#x60;m a natural red hair, and the color was perfect, covered my grays, and gave my hair the beutiful tone it always had. Then I ordered a second time, with a request for changes for a lighter tone. And not only I hated it (because it was not lighter, just artifitially reder), but also I lost a lot of hair applying the product. Again, I liked the system: they canceled all my subsequent orders, and offered me a complementary try. Recently I received an email of them, and I decided to give it a try. So I ordered the exact same color I received the first time. Then I got an email that I should talk to the colorist. I think that call was very confusing, she said she could not understand what was wrong, and kind of suggested me to go ahead and cancel the order. She could not guarantee that I would be satisfied as in the first time I(with the same color), because she never saw my hair in person (but isn&#x60;t that their business). I was frustrated. So if they are willing to play real safe, why do they induce the customer to try once more with a complimentary product?</li>
            <li> Cynthia Mahoney&lt;br /&gt;Apr 23, 8:13 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to let you know that I LOVE MY NEW COLOR!! It is absolutely wonderful. I was a little afraid at first. My hair had gone through some drastic changes. The first color selection was way to dark.  But, this second time is a perfect match. The  color,is simply a wonderful, wonderful color.  I love my hair color I just wanted to say that this company is so great i have referred my fiends and family and let them know that I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I recently used my first order of hair color - not only was the color ideal, but the products made my hair feel healthy and look shiny.  It was a painless process, fast, and with 100% guarantee, no risk involved.  I am hooked and shall continue to seek my hair color from esalon.  I might add that due to a glitch in mail service, the team at esalon provided outstanding customer service.  These people walk the walk and talk the talk - a refreshing experience, and one I heartily recommend.  I am giving up my hairdresser for overall color - and am able to save money and feel I am getting a better quality of product.</li>
            <li> I have been so happy with my hair color since I started using eSalon products!  The color is amazing.  My hair is so soft and shiny.  When friends complement my color and ask who does my hair?  I say,  I do with the great products from eSalon!  Thank you so much eSalon!!!!</li>
            <li> e-Salon custom formulated the perfect color for me, they even made an additional suggestion that I had not thought of which enabled me to get the perfect color.  I love it.  I also love their additional products which help the color to last longer (the Devoted Hue Color enhancing mask and the Tinted Love Color Enhancing Treatment).  Red is a really hard color to keep up but I have not had that issue, it&#x27;s not brassy and my hair is very soft.  Great products and the price is very reasonable!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair color I have ever used. The color is perfect and it has covered the gray completely! My hair is soft and shiny. Even my husband has comment on how pretty the color is. I definitely will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> My hair is &#x27;unique&#x27; and not in a good way--thin, fine and, in humid weather, frizzy. Finding products that work best for my hair has been a major chore over the course of my 63 years of living. When I started turning gray and began coloring my hair, finding the right color was a major chore. Beauty shops didn&#x27;t even make the job any easier; ninety-nine percent of the time I left hairdressers disappointed. Even though I eventually stumbled on a color that was okay, it was just that &#x27;okay.&#x27; When I saw your ad I thought I&#x27;d try it. I answered the initial questions and supplied extra information in the comment box to explain that my hair tends to pull red and I don&#x27;t look good with any red tones...but then if I go for ash to prevent any red, it doesn&#x27;t look good either. Long story short(er) when I got my order and applied it, I almost super surprised with the results. The shade was perfect for me! My husband even said he liked it. Home Run! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands over the years to maintain my hair colour! When I left work to become a mother, my finances couldn&#x27;t afford the up keep and my hair looked terrible...until eSalon! Wow! This line of products are amazing and I look as if I&#x27;m still paying to have my hair professionally done! Also, they&#x27;re so affordable and the team at eSalon are highly attentive and work very hard to make sure you&#x27;re well looked after! The only thing they don&#x27;t do is bring you a coffee while you wait for your color to be done! Any chance they would include a coffee sachet and cookie with my shipment? That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s missing from the &#x27;real salon experience!&#x27; Absolutely wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Jules in England, UK</li>
            <li> I used E-Salon hair color for the first time this weekend.  I was excited to try it and followed the instructions.  I used the shampoo and conditioner they give you to put on after coloring.  My hair felt like it had a coating of glue or wax on it and as much as I kept trying to rinse it off I couldn&#x27;t.  I started to blow dry my hair and it was go gluey feeling that I couldn&#x27;t even dry it.  It was like I didn&#x27;t wash anything off.  I had to take another shower to try and shampoo to gunk off my hair and it still didn&#x27;t work!  Luckily I have long hair because I was going to a party that night and at least could put it in a pony tail!! The next morning I went to CVS to buy Neutrogena anti-residual clarifying shampoo.  I shampooed twice with it and my hair finally felt back to normal.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product because of the coating it leaves on your hair.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that!</li>
            <li> OMG.  My head itched so bad with this product I actually went to the doctor.  I thought I had ringworm because of hair loss and itching.  The doc asked if I&#x27;d used any new hair products and I told him about this.  He said I must be having a &amp;#34;reaction&amp;#34; to the product and to stop using it.  Believe me, I won&#x27;t touch it with a ten foot pole.  I had to use a prescription shampoo for several weeks to get my scalp to stop itching.  ALWAYS read the lowered starred reviews on a new product.  The 5 stars can be, and many times are, faked.  The lower stars are always genuine and give you a better idea of what people DON&#x27;T like about the product.  That&#x27;s what you want to know.  There are SO many very similar reviews on this product that it&#x27;s obvious they have been paid to write them.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. I&#x27;ve been searching for this&lt;br /&gt;ever since I started going gray at 25. Dynamic,&lt;br /&gt;comprehensive customer-service. I am now a&lt;br /&gt;total CONVERT. I will always use esalon. ARMOR&lt;br /&gt;is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product! My hair color, how soft and shiny ma hair are after the treatment. I&#x27;ll recommend to all my friends this product)): thank you, guys!</li>
            <li> Perfect color match!! Finally after many years of using box color, I now have  my original color back! My hair is so soft shinny now!  Love, Love, Love all of their products! It is very affordable and easy to use.  I discovered while applying the Feelin Smoothie product to my hair, that it is great for dry chapped hands. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks now, dry hands are history!  Be aware that when you first order you will be signed up for automatic delivery and make sure you upload a good picture in natural light so that they can formulate the your color want.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the eSalon hair colour when it was on a half price promotion. As someone who has been home colouring my hair for many, many years (at first just for a nice change and then over the last ten years out of necessity) I have tried many high street brands and have liked some much more than others. I went through the online questionnaire and uploaded a photograph and was advised that my color would be medium brown pearl. When it arrived (along with a conditioner and a spray on hair glosser which I had also ordered) it was like receiving a luxury gift! - everything was beautifully packaged. A week or so later it was time to use the color (I&#x27;m always slightly nervous about using a new brand in case the color isn&#x27;t what I was expecting) I was firstly impressed by how much product there was, I have struggled in the past with various other brands with there not being quite enough colorant to cover my hair (shoulder length and quite thick) but with the eSalon colorant there was ample. I was also impressed that you receive a sachet of shampoo and conditioner. I followed all instructions and I am now sooo in love with my hair! - The grey coverage is superb and the shine is amazing and my hair is very soft. It is now roughly two weeks since I used the eSalon color and there has been no noticeable fading of the colour. I will definitely be reordering :-)</li>
            <li> Good grey coverage, and even color. Color didn&#x27;t wash out. I would have given 5 stars except that the color was warm when I was expecting cool.</li>
            <li> I loved the custom formulated hair color by eSalon.  the color is unique,  the product leaves hair feeling healthy, smells good and the packaging convinced me that a personalized service was what I was getting.  salon perfect color at home......  yeah.&lt;br /&gt;im hooked for now.  keep up the good work  eSalon</li>
            <li> Thank you, eSalon, for a great product and an even better color selection process.  I filled out the questionnaire and submitted a photo; the consultant tweeked my color selection slightly from what I had stated in the questionnaire and it turned out beautifully.  It is just right.  It truly is customized color.  And, my hair feels lovely, so I know it is a kinder, gentler formulation than the drug-store brand I&#x27;ve been using.  Pleased all around and am on the auto-ship program for continued usage.  Will be trying out their additional products as well.</li>
            <li> After years of paying salon prices, and annoyed in general with the salon experience, I mustered the courage to do my color at home. I knew &amp;#34;box color&amp;#34; from the drug store was a bad idea, so I purchased Satin brand from the beauty supply store. It was good, but not great, and over time started to make my hair increasingly straw-like.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I saw a post online for esalon.com and decided to give it a try.  LOVE the color. It&#x27;s much more natural looking than the Satin mixture I was using, which tended to turn &amp;#34;reagan brown&amp;#34;, and weirdly orange with pink-ish undertones that were supposed to make up &amp;#34;mocha&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, my esalon result seems to be color that will last and stay more true till the next application.&lt;br /&gt;I left it in 40 minutes, but I don&#x27;t think that is necessary. I&#x27;ll try 30 next time. Very good at covering grey!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus the conditioner supplied with my color order is the best I&#x27;ve ever used at home. It leaves my hair incredibly soft!&lt;br /&gt;Took a selfie and emailed to my friend who thought it looked really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was the mess in my shower. Yikes. The dye goes everywhere during the shine and rinse. Had to use bleach spray to get it out of my grout.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know why salons have black sinks installed.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my shower stall is beige.&lt;br /&gt;However, I may not have diluted the leftover dye enough, and had too much in the bottle. I&#x27;ll try diluting less of the dye, for a smaller total amount for rinse and shine next time, and I think that will solve the mess problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I will definitely recommend this to all my friends!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now colored my hair 3 times, and made changes on color/formula, twice.  I am so impressed with this company.  The professionally mixed formula is always illustrated for me, so I know how much Mahogany, Ash, etc. are in the mix.  This time I wanted a shade lighter, so the instructions were to put the first bottle on my roots, and the second on the ends.  It has all blended so nicely!  The shine is unbelievable.  The instructions are detailed and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> The product is solid.  Gentle on hair and color much more nuances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service gets an A+.  Fast, personal and specific to your issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these guys.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Uniquely designed for the individual with wonderful results. Natural and long lasting, for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced.</li>
            <li> I used esalon for the first time in April. I was nervous about coloring my own hair but it come out great. I love the color. I have had lots of compliments! Thank you, esalon! I will be a repeat client.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed! Reds are tricky, and they mixed my formula perfectly. Take the time to fill out the profile carefully and upload good quality photos. My color is exactly what I ordered! Follow the instructions carefully, make sure you hit your part lines and hairline completely, and if possible, get a friend to help so you don&#x27;t miss any spots. My kit included two separate colors: one for the regrowth, and one for the ends. The two colors blend seamlessly and absolutely look like a salon job. I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ll miss the pampering of a salon visit, but our budget couldn&#x27;t support a $200 visit every 8 weeks. At $20 a pop, this is doable.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about ordering a hair color online, especially since I have had several questionable outcomes in an actual salon! But I read all of the descriptions and decided that I was going to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The questionnaire turned out to be very extensive, which made me feel like they were not all hype and would formulate based on my color and type of hair. I ended up choosing a color I &amp;#34;hoped&amp;#34; would mimic one from years ago that I loved. (I did not think to reach out to for help, I will definitely take advantage of that in the future)  but I included a description my goal color in the order. I was happy to find that I could choose Demi permanent instead of just permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got the kit, and was extremely surprised at the contents. I thought I was in for more than I bargained for, but the directions were clear and easy to follow! And something really simple that made me happy was they included two sizes of gloves. I have larger hands and most dye kits I either tear the gloves or end up getting my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was actually quicker than most at home products, I LOVE that the processing time is much less than what I am used to. Start to finish was literally the same as most box dyes need to develop and 1/4 of the time I spend in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt great! I absolutely love the color, it doesn&#x27;t look like box dye, I have color and movement. I hate how I look in photos so I avoid them at all costs, but I was so excited I took a few pics and posted them online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I thought I would respond to a couple of reviews, because why not. The dye smelled like other dyes, they all stink imo. They all caution to use in WELL VENTILATED areas. Esalon is a subscription, which I may cancel at any time, I was never under any other impression. I was actually really happy I could adjust the subscription frequency to suit my needs as most do not allow for that. So when my subscription is renewed, I expect them to process a payment and ship my order.</li>
            <li> Just wanted you all to know, I think your product idea is absolutely fantastic!! My order came and everything was perfect, worked perfect, and I&#x27;m so very very happy with the results. I think I&#x27;ll change my color next time to something funky and fun like bright red! :-) but, I give this product(s) five hundred stars and two thumbs way way up!!! You&#x27;ve got a client for life thank you thank you thank you. No more paying high salon prices and getting my hair cut by 17-year-old, gum-snapping, goth-looking idiots! Love to all!! Thank you! xxxxxxoooooo</li>
            <li> It is almost painfully obvious that &amp;#34;employees&amp;#34; have written most of the 5 star reviews. Never in my life would I ever use a product on my hair after reading that someone had a gob full of hair fall out!</li>
            <li> I tried e-salon for the first time this week and I absolutely loved it.  Will be ordering from there from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eSalon.com for close to a year, after my husband (yes, my husband) spotted something about it somewhere and made the suggestion. I have never sent them a picture, but based on my description of skin tone, natural hair color (not sure I actually remember what that is, except maybe gray), etc., as well as the sort of color I wanted, they mixed up my formula perfectly. I&#x27;ve never made an adjustment to it. The color covers the gray well and does an amazing job conditioning my hair as well. This is salon color at just a little more than grocery store price. As long as you&#x27;re comfortable coloring your own hair or have someone to do it for you, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong. I also recently tried the root cover wand and love that as well. It doesn&#x27;t do the best job at covering the gray roots, but it is enough of a mask that it gets me through until I can do a regular color. Also, it could be that I&#x27;m just not very experienced yet at using the wand, so the lack of full coverage at my part is a result of &amp;#34;user error,&amp;#34; rather than the product.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is the best product I&#x27;ve used to color my hair with.  I&#x27;m 45 with some grey. I only want to color every 12 weeks and I want it to look glossy and natural!  Once I&#x27;ve answerd their questions and uploaded a photo of me, they get working on the right color for me. I love that there are two bottles.  One for the roots and one for all over.  The instructions are crystal clear!! Everything u need is in the box, right down to two pairs of gloves.  I will be staying with this company and allowing them to send me my hair color every 12 weeks. Also, I hade mixture left over! I have very thick hair and I&#x27;m always struggling to squeeze out the last drops from other products!! Give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have never colored my hair at home and I was so worried going into this. My hair was lighter at the bottom and needed to be filled before being dyed. I have had my hair messed up a lot, even at salons. The step by step directions were easy to follow and the color turned out exactly how I wanted it to. My hair is so soft and shiny, the color gives it great dimension so it almost looks like I have highlights. An amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Most fabulous!!  Color is wonderful with no brassy tones.  Colors grays great!  And, when you want a little change, they are very accommodating.  I would not hesitate recommending eSalon to anyone and everyone that colors their hair and wants the quality of the salon with the expense of a home color.</li>
            <li> Love your product and the response from the staff is great. All so glad to help you, the service is so good also!</li>
            <li> When I first started receiving my hair color product I was asked to leave feedback. I gave positive feedback but I don&#x27;t think I had had enough time to know how great this product actually is. I&#x27;ve never had a color product leave my hair super shinny and then stay that shinny over 6 weeks later. Usually after two weeks my color turns dull and starts changing to a very unbecoming orange red color. Now my color looks the same every day and looks the same after I renew my color. My hairdresser loves my color and is very impressed with how shinny my hair is every time I see her for a haircut. I also use the color enhancing shampoo and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and really gives my color staying power. So I would just like to say &amp;#34;Thank you eSalon&amp;#34; for creating such a great product!</li>
            <li> Directions were easy. Color covered completely. Even though they asked if I wanted a lighter color I let them know I was happy with what I chose. They sent the product. I have been happy to see when I wash my hair I do not see the color coming out. That is a huge plus! I love the feel of my hair after this product. Thank you for making this so easy.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last week. I was impressed with how quickly it was delivered and the communication I received before the product was even shipped. I got the results I was hoping for, 100% gray coverage, a nice shiny outcome &amp; the color was spot on. I would recommend using this product if you have had some experience dying your own hair.</li>
            <li> Surprised and very pleased with the results.  The color is perfect, only to be endorsed by  the hairstylist who cuts my hair. How much better than that can it get.. I will definitely reorder with E-Salon...</li>
            <li> After years of coloring my own hair, with occasionally disastrous results, I tried eSalon for the first time and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are simple, easy to follow and clear, the formulation is just the right consistency (no goop and no drips!) and the color is perfect! Exactly the right amount of red, and the closest to my natural color I have ever found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra gloves and the stain remover are niceties that just added the perfect touch of salon details as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really liked being able to create my own hair color with the help of a stylist. The price for my first shipment was unbeatable. The second shipment was a little more but it is a great product and service and price. Love it.</li>
            <li> Regina Burris&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great experience. I am 57 and this is the first attempt at coloring my hair so I enlisted the help of my daughter-inlaw.  I could not be more pleased with the outcome! Oh My Gosh,&lt;br /&gt;What took me so long?????  Everyone has said that it looks soooooo natural.  Thanks E Salon</li>
            <li> Color turned out great,Will never use store bought again,thanks for all your help.&lt;br /&gt;WILL DEFINITELY USE E-SALON AGAIN</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a phone call from your team who spent a good deal of time discussing my requirements. I will be ordering again soon</li>
            <li> I work in Manhattan and have been getting my hair colored near work. Needless to say, it was very expensive. When I read about E-Salon I decided to try their custom colors. I love the product, my custom color is amazing, it is better then the expensive color I got in the city. Hope my hair stylist doesn&#x27;t read this. I am now a loyal client of E-Salon and saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I have received color 3 times and love the color and coverage.  I like to change my color slightly and they get it right every time - even if they needed to talk to me to make sure they understand what I wanted.  My natural hair color is a reddish brown.  As I have gotten older and the gray has taken over, I usually do a light golden brown or a reddish brown.  The color doesn&#x27;t fade.  Such a professional company - they have a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews, but felt this one definitely is worthy of one. About a year ago I moved and was so upset to lose my hairdresser. I hadn&#x27;t found another by the time the grays started taking over. I believe I first saw this product on Facebook and thought I&#x27;d give it a try...figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I am so pleased...used them several times and have never been disappointed. The gray coverage lasts longer than any other product I have used or had anyone else use on me. There is very little odor, and actually there is a hint of a very nice floral scent. My hair comes out feeling incredibly soft. I am looking forward to trying this all over, as I enjoy reading the reviews about how shiny it makes your hair as well. Also looking forward to trying the shampoo and conditioner. Thank you for making such a high quality product at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought and used the hair color.  Ok ...It looked ok to me.  But when I went to work....OMG.  Compliments all over the hospital for how great I looked.  Thank you.  I feel so much younger.  And the fact I added copper to my hair color,,,made my hair shine...and I do SHINE.  Thanks....  Ordered my next color yesterday.  I look so incredible.  And by the way..I really don&#x27;t look incredible most days.  I look mousey.  Thanks to Esalon</li>
            <li> This experience could not have turned out better. My hair color looks great. It was so easy and the best part is that I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 to get great looking hair color.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different store brands over the years and eSalon outshines 100 to 1.  There is absolutely no comparison.  It took a few times for me to get the perfect color, but I&#x27;ve got it now and it looks spectacular!!!  AND I purchased the color enhancer in my shade to use when your color gets lighter (before you color again) and it is absolutely beautiful!!  I just LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is so helpful and understanding and responds very quickly to any questions one might have.  I HIGHLY recommend  eSalon to everyone who wants superior results!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not an employee, and I know how to spell. That is for those who read these and are suspicious of spelling errors and exclamation sign usage (I thought that was what they were for, exclaiming excitement!!) Anyway, I love the color, I have adjusted it and am still adjusting it, a little with each order. I am not sure how anyone can expect someone who is not in the room with you to get an exact image of what the customer has in his/her head, I can&#x27;t even get that when I do go to a salon and pay $200+. So be realistic with your expectations. If your hair is falling out or feels slimy or waxy it could be an error on the part of the person using it because I have never had that problem. I have a large amount of grey in my hair and the coverage is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the auto-ship and the color, if you go into your profile you can change when you get your order and you can change your color as well. An email reminder is sent to you several days before your order is to ship so you can change the ship date if you want to. If you want it sooner that you have it set, go in and move it forward and they will get it to you, unless you change it to &amp;#34;tomorrow&amp;#34; then they will get it to you as soon as they can. I did not give this product a 5 star because I feel like nothing is perfect and there is always areas for improvement. If there was an area that I would like to see some improvement in it would be the smell, it is a little strong and if you are sensitive to that it could be a problem, but no more than an over the counter or salon product.</li>
            <li> I love the color of my hair from eSalon! Very vibrant and longer lasting than store bought brands. The shampoo and conditioner is keeping my color looking great.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t as happy with the Tint Love color I received, but they refunded my money and made it right.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product, product packaging, shipping packaging and marketing are really top notch.&lt;br /&gt;Color Love!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found my favorite color just yet, but it&#x27;s not for lack of trying on the part of the eSalon team. They have called me to chat about what I want and what&#x27;s possible to achieve; and even sent me a complimentary color when things just didn&#x27;t go the way we knew while transitioning from one color to another. I&#x27;ll definitely keep working with them!</li>
            <li> What a revolutionary service. After decades of costly professional hair colouring, I decided to go out on a limb and try eSalon. I filled in the online profile questions and submitted a photo of my desired colour. To my surprise, the following day, I received an email suggesting that the colour I had chosen seemed a bit too light and one of the eSalon colorists would adjust it slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived well before I expected it and now that I used the kit last evening. The colour is perfect. I am so impressed with the entire process and results. Thank you eSalon. As a newly retired person, I appreciate the savings as well as the overall wonderful service and product.</li>
            <li> I have been using eSalon for about a year now. I LOVE it. I love that it ships automatically, I love the way my hair looks and feels, I love the shine and the value! Recommend to everyone I meet who colors their own hair. My own hairdresser asked me where I went to get my hair colored instead of coming to her, LOL! She wasn&#x27;t happy when I told her I did it myself with eSalon.</li>
            <li> Everyone can be suspicious and I wonder about the poor reviews. I an a new customer of ESalon. And after the first coloring I spoke to their colorist and asked for some little corrections in the color and I just colored my hair and the formula is exactly what I need and want. it is easy, I do it at my convenience. i really don&#x27;t know where some of the comments come from.</li>
            <li> ESalon thank you for your wonderful staff and products!!! I am so happy that I found you!!! Your products are the only ones that I will be using.  Your prices are fantastic and make it affordable to use all of your wonderful products. Your customer service is 110%!!!!!! Sincerely, Teresa</li>
            <li> First time coloring my hair....it turned out perfect and just the color I wanted! I was nervous but...so far, so good! I&#x27;m so happy with the end result.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in a complete package.  Gray completely covered and color was perfect</li>
            <li> I have never done my own hair color. I was nervous doing so for the first time. My hair turned out amazing! My husband helped me apply the product. Instructions are very easy to follow. And to think I saved $150+ doing it myself! No more salons and now I can color my hair more often! My daughter tells me I don&#x27;t look like her Mommy. I&#x27;m blonde again! My hair was so silky smooth after applying the conditioner the kit came with.</li>
            <li> I love it prefect color. Easy to use and afterwards my hair looks and feel great. No harsh coloring that&#x27;s a plus... my hair is smooth and silky looking feels great . Thank You aSalon</li>
            <li> I just colored my hair for the first time using esalon. I am so happy! It&#x27;s the right color, my hair is so soft! Everyone has been asking me who colored my hair! I&#x27;m telling everyone about this. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I just completed coloring my hair after my request for a reformulation of the previous color.  This was only the second time I used the product. It was the EXACT color I wanted!!! I&#x27;m just so thrilled at the results. I&#x27;ve been wanting this color forever but could never get the result I wanted from OTC products or even at the beauty salons I visited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only followed the directions exactly, but watched their online tutorial.  It was so easy!  My hair looks healthy, shiny and better than ever!  Even hubby says it looks good (and that rarely occurs)! I could go on raving about it, but I highly recommend that you try it if you&#x27;re looking for hair color that&lt;br /&gt;is affordable, mixed to YOUR specifications and delivered to your doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is lovely, customized just for me &amp; I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance and tried it.  eSalon is ingenius and they have me for life!</li>
            <li> I h ave used the esalon hair color for about 4 times now and am happier about the color and shine my hair has over any other salon service I&#x27;ve ever had. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but the accuracy of what i ask for is the best. I have decided on changing a couple of color applications to suit the seasons and love what is sent to me. I am saving loads of money by not going to a salon for my color applications.Thanks eSalon</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I first saw the color of my hair.  It looked like a bad dye job but after a few days it turned out to be really nice.  The biggest problem is the gray started coming back after only a week.  That was a disappointment too.  When I ordered the product esalon pulled me back on the color to one color lighter which I was glad they did because the color they sent was more my color.  I feel the price is too high.  I can get the same thing out of a box for half the price so not sure if I will use this again. I used this a second time and was very disappointed.  The color was changed to a little darker which I liked but when I got done there was a lot of hair in the drain.  That has never happened before.  Also the color is lighter where the most gray was and does not look right.  Hair does not feel normal.  Not soft and their shampoo and conditioner is way too much for me to buy.  A lot of work for  what you get.  I will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the quality and with the talent of the colorists who created my formula from eSalon. Their communication and customer service are excellent!  I enjoyed exploring some of the other related products they offer.  My results were great and the process was easy!  Color block and stain remover were included.</li>
            <li> I have never been happier with my hair products. My hair is exactly the color I wanted. I also use their Shining Armor, Get Lifted, and On the bright side.  It has been 5 weeks since I did the hair color and my hair is still beautiful.  I&#x27;m 74 years old and have never had so many complements on my hair.  My husband whose comments have always been &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know why you have to color your hair&amp;#34;. Boy has he changed.  He know tells me my hair is beautiful and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband recently went through some major health issues and his hair was so dry from all the meds I started using the Shining Armor on his head.  After two weeks his hair is shining and no dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to a Salon for hair coloring.&lt;br /&gt;And, the customer service is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;If your unhappy with your hair, you need to try their products.&lt;br /&gt;Jan Parker</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair, with various results, for 20 years.  I have had good results at the salon, but at a very high cost.  I have gotten okay results at home, which was much more cost effective.  So, it seemed, my choices were beautiful results with a hefty price tag or iffy results that were more affordable.  Then a friend recommended esalon.com.  I answered a few questions about my skin and eye color and about the color, texture and length of my hair.  I uploaded a photo and chose a color goal.  Then I gave esalon&#x27;s colorists a few notes (I wanted my shade to be close to the shade that a celebrity has).  In a week, I had a color made specifically for me from three different shades, along with professional colorists tools and directions.  One hour later, I had a GORGEOUS, PROFESSIONAL HAIR color.  I have gotten so many compliments, and no one can believe that I did this myself!  There are visible hi-lites and low-lites.  My hair is soft and there is no more gray!  Best of all, the color is the EXACT shade I had seen in the magazines!  I have set up automatic delivery, so my color will come to me every 7 weeks.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Received my first shipment from eSalon...loved the look of the packaging...I guess I&#x27;m more impressed with the frou-frou than being green!  Opted to use the bowl and brush method, clipped my hair, and proceeded to apply product.  Wow, even the smell announced that this was no ordinary over the counter product.  It was like I was in the salon!!  Application was a bit more involved than my usual routine, but really, I think this showed how not thorough my usual routine was.  While I had to work a little harder, I am very pleased with the results &#x3D; great coverage, the color was spot on with the information I submitted.  I was so thrilled with the little gift of gloss I received and I look forward to my next shipment.  The fact that the shipments will be automatic is even better, I am more apt to color on a timely basis, and avoid the visor!!  Great product- (eSalon.com) I urge everyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and turning gray already!  My hair is thick and grows über fast so I gave up on professional color a while ago and went to the OTC color.  I color about every 6 weeks and honestly was buying whatever color brand was on sale in a dark brown/black.  So when I heard of eSalon I figured, why not- I&#x27;ve tried everything else and it can&#x27;t make my hair any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast forward 2 weeks and here I am to tell you that this is the most wonderful product ever.  My hair is totally revitalized.  I don&#x27;t think I realized how badly damaged my hair was until I touched my new soft and healthy looking hair.  The color is beautiful and the color enhancer they have keeps it looking like new.  As for gray coverage, I  don&#x27;t see a one and trust me with dark hair and young eyes I&#x27;d find them!  I&#x27;ll never try another product again.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who home dyes.</li>
            <li> It was very simple to do, I followed the directions exactly. The color holds up well to shampooing, it does not fade like the dept store brands. I do like the quality--it did not rub off on my white towel! That used to happen with the \\&quot;others\\&quot;.  The color was just what I wanted.  I am very happy to have salon quality at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m converted!!</li>
            <li> It was exceptional compared to the other products that I have tried to fix this problem. I wish you sold the shampoo and conditioner as it is the best, bar none, for color and conditioning that I have ever experienced. I would buy that as a regular hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I have been going to a hairdresser for my hair colour but the price is now so high I decided to have a go myself.  I chose eSalon because they offer a personal service and advice.  I received the colour in beautiful packaging with easy to follow instructions.  I am delighted with the colour and my hair is in lovely condition.  The only downside that I see is the time it takes to get here from USA so order at least 2 weeks before you need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate in recommending eSalon.</li>
            <li> eSalon is a great company. I love that they take the time to let you choose  your skin tone, eye color, length of hair. This is all in addition to the standard questions concerning if you&#x27;ve color treated, or permed your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that they custom make the color you decide upon from the many they provide that would be a good look for you. I feel this is better than being like thousands of women that go get the store-color in a box. eSalon has great prices. My hair is long and thick and instead of having to buy two or three boxes of the store-color I wanted-to have enough for my hair, eSalon custom mixed my color with exactly the amount I needed for one low price. They also have products that help you apply the color and products to keep your color fresh. They include easy to follow instructions. My color arrived and when I had finished applying it, it was gorgeous. It had high-lights and wasn&#x27;t dried out like some of the store-products do your hair. It colored the parts of my hair that were gray with no problem. Another perk is that it doesn&#x27;t look dyed. It looks natural. I would definitely recommend eSalon and it&#x27;s service and products to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have used several different products over the years with so-so effects, but when I use this color on my hair it was perfect!!!I will use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I just wanted you to know that I am thrilled with the results! This is the most true to my natural color and also the best &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; coverage I have ever had - natural looking reds are very difficult, but this turned out gorgeous. I love everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I took the chance to try something new. I will be recommending eSalon to all my friends. Thanks for great service and a great product.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my hair and take very good care of it, it is very long and very healthy, so if I endorse a product I&#x27;m pretty serious about it.  I tried this product because it had many great reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried other mix your own products before, but this stuff really is amazing.  I love the colour, the shine, it covered the few greys that I have, but the best part is how great my hair feels.  I highly recommend the gloss.  I saw no evidence of cutting corners, they even sent a battery with the timer and the clips were perfect for my hair.  I think the negative comment left by the individual about the brassy hair is unfortunate.  Brassy hair is a problem for some individuals and should be thoroughly addressed, she did mention the $300 colourist.  My only complaint is all the packaging.  I don&#x27;t like adding to the land fill.  Other than that, perfect.</li>
            <li> the product arrived nicely packaged,  easy to use,  no nasty smell or burning of scalp like the brand names,  love the fact that it included a barrier product and a stain remover,</li>
            <li> I love love love E-salon.  Wonderful choices of colors.  Best products from shampoo, conditioners and all the tools you would ever need. Wonderful colorists.  I would like to tell more people to try these products.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair was five different colors and they  fixed it... Plus I have the natural looking color from my youth back!</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for years and formulate my own colors by visiting Sallys and picking my tone, level and base.  I saw this company and was excited that my color could be delivered to my door anytime I wanted it.  I selected a medium brown which is very slightly darker than my current color.  I also pruchased a leave in conditioner and a styling cream.  Didnt like anything I bought.  My color turned out soooooo dark.  My co-workers asked me if it was black.  Followed the instructions perfectly.  The leave in and styling cream are a waste of money.  They dont do anything and don&#x27;t really even smell that great.  Super disapointed and am going back to my old color routine.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After two successful interactions with eSalon, I was informed that to continue receiving the color and the amount of color, I would be charged an additional fee. This is incredibly shady business practice- you lure customers in with a fixed price, and then surprise them with an additional cost-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not worth it. Stay far, far away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the hair color right away. I was a little nervous thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to really match.&lt;br /&gt;Well I was feeling brave on Monday and decided to just go ahead and do it. I love the color. It is just what I asked for. My hair is dark brown. It seems the store bought colors are always too black even though they say dark brown. I&#x27;ve also had a problem with my beautician recently making the same mistake and my hair looked jet black.&lt;br /&gt;I figured what do I have to lose by trying something new.&lt;br /&gt;I not only saved lots of money by not having to pay beauty parlor price and tip , but the color is perfect. I have only washed my hair twice so I don&#x27;t know how well it will keep it&#x27;s color yet, but as far as the match, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I did not use product for a while was scared. When I finally used the product it was easy not messey.  The color came out perfect I will use it again. Best color I ever had and I did it myself with eSalon&#x27;s help!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have been using eSalon for two years now &amp; I love the way my hair looks and the color lasts.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked or felt better, if I want to tweak my color a bit for summer or winter they always get it exactly right!</li>
            <li> I got the kit in the mail and when I read the name of the color they sent I thought this couldn&#x27;t be right but I went ahead and used it anyway. I only put it on the roots as instructed and it&#x27;s a perfect match. I don&#x27;t know how they  matched it so perfectly from a picture!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful coloring- had been covering my grey hair for years with drug store brands; My husband (who never notices anything after 29 years) immediately noticed my hair looked nice that first time I used esalon. He didn&#x27;t know what I did different, but I sure did!!  I loved it; later I decided I wanted a little lighter, and they did it just right- no problem.  I went for a once a year high end spa hair trim/cut and the beautician didn&#x27;t know I dye it myself and commented it looked great.  It comes out soft, shiney, and natural looking. I love the convenience and the accessories sent to help you. I bought from Sally beauty supply a plastic neck bib and some metal clips to go with my esalon set.  The directions are thorough and it is all very easy.  I make my esalon day a home spa day with all the works to go with this very nice service. THANKs esalon!!  :) MBH</li>
            <li> The color selection, and service was absolutely wonderful!  The instructions were easy to follow, and packaging was impressive.  I love, love my hair color!  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results after using your product.  My whole experience was a good one, and my hair turned out just as I had hoed.  Very natural looking. I&#x27;ll be using your service faithfully.</li>
            <li> It took 1 try before a great color. First time was a bit too bright but they adjusted once I inquired about a change. Next kit was great. Now, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel the best but I think that may be due to the awful ombré I had done before and trying to correct w/ this color. Going to try the E-salon conditioner and see if that helps. Oh...the tint to use in between has really helped as well. Only other complaint, I make a huge mess when I color. :( Have to do roots 4 times and tips 4 times, using two different colors and that is sort of a pain and very messy.</li>
            <li> I have been using the store bought hair color for years that is until I came across the information for eSalon&lt;br /&gt;and decided to try it.  Wow!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! eSalon customized my hair color specifically&lt;br /&gt;for me.  Wow! I was really surprised. The end result -FANTASTIC! I am ecstatic and completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you eSalon!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received my hair color yesterday, and colored my hair today&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;looks fantastic, I am really happy with the color, the procedure was very easy to follow&lt;br /&gt;with excellent results&lt;br /&gt;A very big thank you&lt;br /&gt;Christine</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work so I could &amp;#34;source out&amp;#34; the monthly trip to find hair color.  I have medium brown hair with10 % gray streaks and wanted to go more red with a color that did not look pink over my gray as it faded.  After going through the entire process I felt as if I was not being listened to. I ordered about three weeks prior to needing it to touch up for a business trip. When the product arrived, I could tell by looking at it that my hair would be brown following the application.  I tried writing, but the replies I received did not give me any confidence that they understood my situation and it was recommended that I do a strand test. Out of time, I used it, everything I suspected was confirmed. Mousy brown hair.  I was still hanging in there though, hoping that at least it would not wash out as quickly but it performed about the same as over the counter.  My hair was also more dry than with my regular over the counter product.  I will not re-purchase.  Over the years, I have got countless compliments on my hair using L&#x27;oreal.  If this is not going to perform better I will go back to it for half the price.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for 3 years and I have been using esalon for 8 months.  The first, third, and fourth times I used esalon, the color was great and lasted 6 weeks (apart from my new root growth).  Unfortunately, the color washed out of my hair very quickly every other time (yes, I use a color safe shampoo).  The first time it washed out esalon gave me a credit toward my next order.  The second time it washed out they sent me new color right away, and the new shipment looked great at first.  However, the color has now washed out after only two weeks, leaving behind white roots and very, very dull color.  For $25 the product should work more than 50% of time.  The service is outstanding, but that does not make my hair look better.  I&#x27;m going back to L&#x27;Oreal Preference.  The color is not as rich, but it lasts more than 1 to 12 days.</li>
            <li> After spending way too much money and time at salons I gave eSalon a try.  I could not be happier with the results.  It took 3 orders and the color is perfect!  I will never go back to a salon for color again.  I highly recommend this company if you are looking for good color at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> YES....I LOVE this product and THANK you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first eSalon box in July 2014. I started out med brown since it is closest to my natural hair color and my main goal was covering the gray. I have been dyeing my hair in some fashion since I was 15, so I have 30 years of experience of either doing it myself or going to the salon. I prefer the cost of doing it myself. Because I thought I knew everything about coloring my hair, I didn&#x27;t read the directions fully and put the color on all of my hair instead of just the roots. The roots were great, no gray. The rest was a darker brown. I didn&#x27;t think too much of it, and when it was time to color again, did the same thing with my new shipment. Great roots, everywhere else, even darker brown. This time I emailed eSalon and within 24 hours a  colorist called me to talk about what might be going on. The first thing she asked was how I was applying the color. To all of my hair. She explained that it was a root color, and I was coloring over color for the rest. She ordered a complimentary ends (everything but the roots), lighter color to be shipped with my next order to bring the rest of my hair back to the same color as my roots. It worked perfect. I have since gradually gone darker and more red, and have been contacted a couple of times by a colorist to make sure they understood what I wanted and to offer advice on the right way to move into new colors. All in all, I have been very happy with the color I have been sent each order. I like that I can choose when my next order will be sent. I even use half the developer and half the color each time because it really doesn&#x27;t take a full bottle to color the roots, and have had great success doing this. The only negative I would have would be the smell, but it&#x27;s not any different than going to the salon, or some of the colors you can buy at Sally&#x27;s or in the box. I am adding a few pics of my color over the last year. The inside pictures really don&#x27;t look as good as taking a picture in the sun, but I&#x27;m usually at my desk when I think about it. It still doesn&#x27;t look that red to me, but I have people compliment my shade of red all the time so it must look red to others.sk when I think about it. It still doesn&#x27;t look that red to me, but I have people compliment my shade of red all the time so it must look red to others.</li>
            <li> I have used esalon for two 3 months now . I was not happy with the first colour and asked for a very small change. I coloured my hair last Thursday and love it. I was at the hairdresser today and she asked what colour i had used as she thought it was really good. She also said the shine was excellant.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you esalon. !</li>
            <li> I am puzzled by all the negative reviews? I have had a wonderful experience with this product and all the things in the package to do a professional job on my hair. First let me say, I hate coloring my hair. It is a long and tedious job. In my financial hay day, I always went to a stylist to have my hair done. I am 50 now and unable to work because I am raising my 3 grandsons, so money is tight. I have been coloring for 35 years, premature gray and experimental. So now I have about 40% gray and because I hate coloring, I avoid it as long as possible and wear my hair in a ponytail. I am naturally a dark brunet with red highlights. Well if I do not buy an ash colored brown, I end up looking like I have had a copper explosion on the top of my head (the gray roots). Well the store bought ash medium or dark brown did not hardly even color the gray. Very lightly and lasting only a week or two. So when I placed my order with eSalon, I was specific as to what I wanted and expected from the coverage. I followed their instructions to a tee and my hair came out magnificent. My gray is covered and looks ever so slightly like salon highlights. I colored it 3 days ago and it I will not know how long the color will last and how long the gray stays covered. Taking into consideration of the new growth of course. I would definitely recommend eSalon. You have nothing to loose, full money back guarantee or new formulation of your color request will be sent to you. On a final note, the day I colored I had a Doctor&#x27;s appointment, so dressed nice and put on make up. When my husband of 28 years came home and saw me, and I quote &amp;#34;Damn baby you look like you did when met&amp;#34;. I went to the Doctor (female) she told how fabulous I looked also. LOVE eSalon :)</li>
            <li> this was my second time using this product.  the first time i thought that it was complicated, then i put on my glasses and it was easier to understand.  the color came out awesome and just what i wanted.  i also have a super sensitive skin, and psoriossis, and normal hair color makes my hair fall out and so does the stuff at the salon.  with this product there was no burning and no hair loss.  so needless to say i am thrilled.  i just recolored it same product and it looks amazing and conditioned.  i do not use their shampoo stuff that comes in the package,  i have been using wen for over a yr now and that is an awesome product too.  i just had my hair cut and the stylest asked where i have been getting my color done because it is awesome.  told here where i got the product and she was impressed and wanted the web site for both her and her friend.  so yippie i am a happy customer</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  I have used eSalon for the last 7-8 times I&#x27;ve colored my hair. Love how it covers the gray,  and I get lots of complements on how it looks so &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; .  My hair is soft and manageable and the color is great! I have recommended this to many friends and coworkers. The company is very helpful when you want a color change or to adjust frequency of future deliveries. Price is wonderful! I will definitely continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best at home hair color EVER!!!  The color is customized to the shade i could never get from store bought hair dyes.  The product is delivered in a case that includes EVERYTHING you need to dye your hair.  After ten days my color looks FANTASTIC and my hair feels FABULOUS.  Do not hesitate.....ORDER THIS TODAY!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using color for 43 years(oh, my, that long!!)! And it&#x27;s RED! THE hardest color to get right. Well, you guys got it soooo right! I am in love! Customer forever! Please don&#x27;t go out of business. This color is superb in coverage, especially the grays. Most other colors leave my gray a &#x27;funny&#x27; color. This colors it like the rest of my hair. I can&#x27;t &#x27;see&#x27; where my grays are. And it looks like it has natural highlights, too! Can&#x27;t believe how happy I finally am with color!&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lucy</li>
            <li> after dying my hair with a box color from the store for over 13 years, i finally have a color that no only is beautiful but it covers the grey around the frame of my face &amp; it stays colored...i am so happy with this product... although the other types tell you they cover the grey 100%, they don&#x27;t tell you it will only stay that way for about 2-3 washes...esalon has a great product that covers the grey &amp; keeps it covered..thank you esalon...my new best friend</li>
            <li> All I can say about the color  is I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After years of trying to hide my gray hair with over the counter hair dyes or paying the insane prices at hair salons, I found E Salons&#x27;s custom hair color.  It is fabulous.  The color is a perfect match with some shimmering highlights also.  The coverage on the gray was great and believe it or not it even smells good.  To sum it up quickly.  I LOVE EBERYTHING about this product.  And they mail it to your house!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to use, the customized color is perfect for me and it lasts. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about my hair color since using this that I plan to continue using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was initially skeptical about e-salon, but I&#x27;ve tried it twice now and I love the color and It seems to last a lot longer than shelf products.  I also like that they include two pairs of gloves, stain preventer, and stain remover. I will be using e-salon regularly now. Jen M</li>
            <li> Not prepared to pay the premium pricing to have my hair coloured in a salon I tried all the home colour mahogany/copper shades.  I never quite got the result I was looking for both in terms o application and colour and even when it was close the colour faded so quickly.  The eSalon product came in a great kit with clear instructions and was easy to use.  My friends and family have all noticed the difference and love the new look.  I got an email with the option to adjust the colour if I wanted to.  I have left it the same and am looking forward to the next shipment. I am not yet sure how the &#x27;tinted love&#x27; product will maintain the colour as I have only used it once.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Wonderful!  I moved out of state and have not found a new colorist, so I decided to try eSalon.  I filled out the profile and questionnaire and uploaded two photos- one current and one from my last color.  I wanted to go darker with violet undertones.  I received an email back from customer support saying they recommended, and mixed, a different shade based on what my pics were.  Admittedly, I was a little disappointed after reading this but I am surely not a professional colorist either.  The kit arrived quickly; it was well packaged and was personalized with my name, color, etc.. It was really nice to see a very personal approach from an online company!  I applied the colored and it was so purple I was so very worried! I rinsed it, dried my hair (followed all of the instructions to the letter) which by the way, were very different than box color!!!  I Love it!!! I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve ever been happier with my hair color. It&#x27;s like my stylist came to my house out-of-state and did what she always did with my hair. I highly recommend this company and they are willing to go the extra mile to make sure that you&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better than it has in years!!!  I was very impressed with the quality of the product, the care of the customer service and the packaging.  Thank you I am so excited about my&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful hair it is my best feature now and am getting so many compliments!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about it and I&#x27;m really happy with this product. The gray coverage has been great and the color is nice too.  I felt that the formula was a little runny so I am going to use the applicator brush the next time and see how that works for me. My hair looks natural and feels healthy.  I love all of the little extra touches too with the packaging and personal help.  I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Loved the product and how silky smooth my hair was after the treatment.  The shampoo and conditioner sample was also a nice surprise.  My color was a little darker initially, but when I called to ask how to change it, the representative was MORE than helpful.  We figured out the adjustment and I look forward to continued use of this product!  Not only is it a money saver (with SAME results as the salon I go to), but a valuable time saver as well.  Take the time to fill out the questions about your hair and buy it!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This might be one of the best hair color jobs I have ever had!  The color was perfect (I sent them 5 pictures of my current hair). My hair actually came out healthy and shiny. It was easy to use and so convenient.  If I am sitting in a salon, I am stealing time from my kids, my husband, and my job. The savings is what initially caught my eye, but the quality color will keep me coming back.  Wish I could get my hair CUT this way! :-)</li>
            <li> This was the first time using your product. They give you options if you wish to change the color formula - at this time I would not.  I did notice a bit more red in the back of my hair. When I do the 2nd touch-up I will see then if it was the color formula or me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to have \\&quot;total\\&quot; instructions instead of trying to guess the \\&quot;timing\\&quot; of the drug store box brand. I also like the fact that I can email or call with questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice service! I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a slight adjustment on the reorder, this is perfect, your product is the best I have ever used! I have never found a hair color so true to my own color and able to cover the stubborn grey hairs! Excellent product, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair my entire life....it has always been something I dread doing but I hate going to a salon. I have been unhappy with my color lately....they just don&#x27;t sell what I want in a box. I decided to try eSalon and I have never been this happy with my hair color. I sent them some pics of myself as they suggested. When I received the color it was packaged so nicely with little extras and I used a brush to apply the color for the first time. It was much easier than using the squirt bottle. The application process is a little different from any box color I have ever used, but not difficult.  My results were amazing! I love this color more than any color I have ever put on my hair.....I am sticking with eSalon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love e salon! Beautiful color, easy to apply. Better than a salon and much more reasonable! I&#x27;ve never colored my own hair before and was concerned but it was so easy and turned out just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love working with eSalon!! My first color was just a bit more golden (but gorgeous) than I wanted. eSalon staff fixed it and it is PERFECT!! The color lasts so much longer than my old box stuff too.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was really happy with the kit...the color was salon-quality, it provides good gray coverage and the applicator brush made it easy to apply. HOWEVER, the rinsing process is a nightmare. I&#x27;ve used the product twice, and each time, it takes two days to fully come out. It&#x27;s like trying to wash tar out of your hair. The second time, I even tried using less of the product and took two showers (because I ran out of hot water) and color-safe shampoo to cut through it. And I was still left with sticky hair. Granted, when it does finally come out it looks great, but it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle for me.</li>
            <li> I admit I had my doubts but I am very happy with how my hair turned out.  I followed the instructions to the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; and my hair looks vibrant and so natural!  It shines and feels great.  Don&#x27;t let this opportunity get away.  You must try it.  I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just wanted you all to know that your hair color is fabulous! Easy to use, great results. Love the packaging but feel bad about throwing it away each time. Your website is easy to use to adjust timing of order.&lt;br /&gt;I tell everyone where my terrific color comes from and how easy it is to use eSalon and have it delivered right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep up the good products and services you provide. Thank you to all the staff</li>
            <li> I love it!  They have a client for life.  No store product can match my red hair and I didn&#x27;t want a complete change, just a more vibrant look and they nailed it.  It became darker as the years went on and of course grayer but now I feel like 10 years younger.  Thanks eSalon!</li>
            <li> I love this color super easy to do and makes my hair healthy and shiny,  not like the other coloring boxes.  I have never had my hair my hair professionally colored but this stuff is awesome! I love this and plan on doing it another time or two!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and impressed that one can describe a color and the computer is able to pass on the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; color to the colorist. The dye is so thick that it does not drip down your face. The only comment I will make are packets of dye and conditioner that cannot stand up. It would be better if they were in bottles.</li>
            <li> I just tried eSalon for the first time; I was skeptical and haven&#x27;t colored my own hair in over 10 years, and I was very concerned I would ruin my hair color.  I have been getting it colored and highlighted at a salon for several years; I had doubts about spending $10 on hair color.  I am so happy about my hair color; it is the closest it has been to its natural color in a really long time.  The color did such a great job of hiding the gray around the front of my head; my hair is so soft and shiny.  It does not look like it has been colored; it looks completely natural.  I think I&#x27;ll be skipping the salon from now on; for a fraction of the price, I can have gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this professional quality product for us to use at home! I love your products!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! I have been using box colors for years and have been forced to accept the brassy highlight side-effect of them.  I decided to try eSalon because of their 100% guarantee, hesitant, but I jumped.  The box sat around my house for over a month, as I was afraid to try it.  Once my roots were too obvious, I decided to try the eSalon color.  I&#x27;m COMPLETELY satisfied!! The color is natural, they got my requests absolutely correct- it&#x27;s just simply perfect!! I&#x27;m going to be a loyal long-term customer!!!</li>
            <li> I just used my first order from eSalon, and it was perfect! Although I described what I wanted, when they saw my photo, they sent me a lighter color. I was prepared to be annoyed, but I tried what they sent me, and it was perfect. I&#x27;ll definitely use eSalon again.</li>
            <li> I love Love LOVE my color!  I had colored my hair for two decades using a product from the local Sally supply.  Well, they stopped making that line - AND they stopped making the copper colors!  I was devastated, though I called the manufacturer to find out how I could mix the product to get the same color, it was NOT the same.  No copper.  So I tried two different salons.  AWFUL - I looked ten years older with the colors they put on me.  Then, I saw an add for eSalon and thought &amp;#34;Why Not?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID!  They nailed it on the first try with only my description and a few pictures (of the wrong colored hair).  The products are FANTASTIC and the products are packaged to make it easy to do my hair.  I&#x27;m a life time eSalon customer.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY COLOR - I look ten years younger!</li>
            <li> Tried it because I realized I was spending over 2500. a year on my hair, and can&#x27;t stomach seeing those numbers.  I went darker and picked a shade that Vivian (eSalon specialist) felt was one shade too dark; so she recommended another.  What she picked was perfect.  It was exactly the color I had prior to going gray...and I&#x27;m pleased.  One recommendation to eSalon would be to provide the option to buy TONS of the color-safe shampoo they have.  It was great; even better than the Nexxus and Revlon salon shampoo I have now.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried esalon hair color. I wasn&#x27;t sure what my color was. Esalon helped me get started took my feedback and turned my color into the perfect color for me. I love the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the color pack. Thay even include a second set of gloves!</li>
            <li> This &#x27;thank you&#x27; has been a while coming with the holidays etc, but just wanted to let you know that I have had rave reviews from everyone regarding my hair color! Great product and please save my &amp;#34;magic formula&amp;#34; in my files. Very impressed with the kit which makes it very easy for my sister and I to have a ladies night in (although we save the wine until after we do our hair :) ). Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for many years now.  I&#x27;ve used several different boxed store colorings and I&#x27;ve used professional salons on occasion. Finally, after reviewing the information about eSalon, I decided to give it a try.  The box came in the mail; very professional presentation.  I read the directions carefully, several times, to make sure I knew what I was doing.  At first, I thought the kit contained product for two coloring sessions, but, then I realized that it is done in two steps, one for the roots and one for the ends.  The product mixes very watery, which made me skeptical at first.  It&#x27;s a bit messy and I had to clean up around me once I was done.  I&#x27;m glad I got into the shower for the last part, dumping the remainder of the &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; coloring mixed with water onto my hair and then rinsing it all out.  I used their enclosed shampoo and conditioner, as directed, right afterwards.  Then, outside of the shower, I toweled off and put the usual styling products into my hair.  I let my hair air dry, as I often do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was/is amazing!  There are highlights in it and they look natural.  The only way I&#x27;ve gotten highlights in the past was by deliberately applying them, at home or in the salon.  I am very happy with the color, from roots to ends.  It&#x27;s only been a few days, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  Many reviews mention that it lasts longer than salon color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that the ends of my hair became brittle right after using the coloring.  The next morning, I used morrocain (sp?) oil on damp hair and my hair dryer.  That put moisture back into my hair and my hair looked fabulous, once again.  Soon after I used the product, I received an email from the company, asking me to comment about my experience, and offering to help in any way needed.  I explained all of the above, and got a reply the next day.  They recommended that I use a conditioning mask the day before coloring my hair to put it into better condition for the coloring process.  I can do that, and will do that.  It&#x27;s worth it for the gorgeous color that this product provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s worth it.  I did it once, and I&#x27;ll do it again.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This was by far the best color I&#x27;ve had in a long time! A week later and color still looks bright and grey still covered. Any salon color I&#x27;ve had would&#x27;ve faded by now and grey showing! Love Esalon!</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Very pleased with quick service, and adjustments made as I requested.  Don&#x27;t think I have ever had a hair color that covers so well, without leaving dark ends.  Better than l ever expected.  Recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product which cover grey well, lasts, and has nice tones. Plus the staff are always willing to make adjustments upon request. ❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Loving the color.  It had never lasted so long.  Along with the shampoo and conditioner......awesome. I highly recommend it to anyone.💙❤️💜💗</li>
            <li> When I tried esalon&#x27;s &#x27;made for you&#x27; dark red, it is the only colour that actually stayed in my hair. Most reds wash out within a few weeks, but with eSalon&#x27;s colour, it actually stays until I re-colour every 2 months. I don&#x27;t have to go to store after store to get the colour I want, by the manufacturer I prefer (a lot of times the store I usually go to run out, or simply don&#x27;t order it often enough to keep it in stock), my hair colour is delivered to my door, on time, every time I re-colour my hair. The product is spectacular, and I&#x27;ll never use another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Shining Armor with my last order and it also is simply amazing. My hair breaks less, and having curly hair it usually gets frizzy--Shining Armor helps with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you eSalon for the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your product. My hair does not fade to a brassy color toward the end of the color cycle, which has always been my biggest complaint about hair color (even when a hair stylist colors my hair) and the color fades more slowly than other products I have tried. This costs more than hair color you can buy in the store, but much less than going to a salon, and the results are so much better and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> K to whoever crafted this color for me, I just tried it and it&#x27;s spot on. Never have I received this quality in hair color out of a box, ever! I&#x27;m a little shocked because I was super skeptical, especially after I received this email saying  &amp;#34;we crafted a new color for you&amp;#34; I figured oh boy...I&#x27;m going to wind up red. But not at all. My hair looks healthy, shiny, medium brown with sparkly highlights, not flat at all and thank heavens, not brassy!!! Thank you esalon, I&#x27;m a believer and now will become a long time customer. Btw, I never leave reviews, so this just shows how excited I am! No more $180 visits to the hair colorist for me! Also, I should mention, low odor, zero mess and super shiny hair!</li>
            <li> For someone who wants to color but can&#x27;t afford to spend a small fortune at a salon, eSalon is perfect. The color is great, the product is great. I&#x27;ve never had a single problem and as long as I&#x27;m coloring my hair, I&#x27;m a customer.</li>
            <li> I received the Tinted Love Color Enhancing Treatment.  This product is perfect for my red hair,! Keeps the fire in it but is not overpowering. Use just once or twice a week for a pick me up! I really like this product! :)</li>
            <li> eSalon is the best &amp;#34;Do it Yourself&amp;#34; hair coloring system!  They ship it right to your door!  It makes my hair very manageable and shiny!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Was worried I would not be pleased, but you can do this!  It was really so simple follow the instructions and you will also be convinced.  My hair color looked every bit as good as when I paid 3x&#x27;s the amount plus a tip.  Here&#x27;s a tip basic color you can do this Your self</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I have a lot of red in my hair and being a blond, I have had really bad self coloring experiences which resulted in running to the salon for $$$$$$ color correction...I spend over $200 a visit on my hair and the last time I went my roots looked the same...so I figured I&#x27;d try esalon...I did a test strip and was surprised...not brassy at all!!! So with the help of my hubby, I did my roots and was extremely pleased with the results and so was my pocketbook!!!</li>
            <li> Have not used hair colour yet but shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner excellent. Lease hair nice and soft and volume is great. Can&#x27;t wait to try the hair colour in the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Michel Knight&lt;br /&gt;Feb 26, 5:41 AM&lt;br /&gt;I love the new color. It matches perfectly. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really liked the color that the stylists choose for me based on my profile.  I will use again!</li>
            <li> Before I heard of eSalon, I was using Solfine colour and peroxide combo and even with 30% peroxide, my hair would eat through the colour in a matter of a few weeks and I was limited to colour choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I learned about eSalon, I said why not, you&#x27;ve tried everything else on the market, can&#x27;t hurt to try. Well, I gave the team my request and on my first coloration, it was decided I was not going back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My colour was a tad bit to dark brown and not mahogany enough, we went gradually and after 3 changes BAM on target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour is amazing, the accessories (stain protector, stain remover, REAL latex gloves) great and the lock in shampoo and the conditionner are simply to die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you&#x27;ll see what you&#x27;ll have gain.</li>
            <li> I was not sure ordering hair color on line.  Thinking of how color could be matched and the quality of the product.  It is really nice &amp; so much better than the drug store Sally products.  A very true color they matched just right .  I asked for a little adjustment and it was perfect.  The color lasts &amp; my hair not so dry and fake looking.  Would recommend.  Thanks eSalon and the price is great !</li>
            <li> I just used my eSalon hair color yesterday and I love the results!  I have been trying to tell my stylist what color I wanted, but she tends to go lighter &amp; brighter than I want.  I ordered the color that I thought would best match my own hair color and cover the gray.  The color was just what I wanted and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed a few days for it to &amp;#34;die down&amp;#34; before going out in public.  Great the first day!  My older daughters helped me apply it; nice thick mixture that didn&#x27;t drip.  Not sure it colored all my gray, but we may have needed to put more on or wait a little longer.  Next time! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product! Although I did only just put it on, I can tell this is awesome. People talk about the smell being strong, well it is absolutely not that bad compared to many other brands! It is a chemical it will have an odor. I did cancel my auto renewal because I hate having things control me but I am positive for this price and this quality I will be ordering again. I&#x27;ll update if things change after I wash it out. Product was here in just 3 days they give you enough dye to cover even my long thick hair.  And shampoo and conditioner included. Really glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with color. I will b recommending this to my friends. Totally satisfied with this service</li>
            <li> I just colored my hair last week from this order and wanted to let you know the results. I usually use a box from the store, but noticed lately that my roots (now turning gray) were a different color than the rest of my hair. Using your product, all of my hair is the same color, it is very shiny and soft. I LOVE your product. My husband was very impressed with your customer service as well. You now have a lifetime customer who is extremely happy...</li>
            <li> eSalon is fabulous. I love the custom color and they way they present so much help and care.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it a week ago, and go an email asking for my feedback. They are really staying tuned to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I am in good hands with eSalon and love the color they customized for me.</li>
            <li> A much better color than I would have picked out for myself!  I love what this hair color did for me, I feel beautiful again.  With their great price, how can you NOT try eSalon?  And knowing that they will tweak my color any time I wish, is so exciting.  I can go a little lighter in the summer and a little darker in the winter just as my hair does naturally!  Such soft hair and it is so well conditioned it is easier to style.  Love, Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a pet groomer, my name is Ana, and I run Ana Scissor Hands pet grooming, here in fantastic. westville Florida, I&#x27;m self employed, I trim my own hair,but was making deposits on the hair dresser, for I think was good 45.00, but didn&#x27;t quite liked but covered some of my grays, and it was good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 55 years old, and use to have jet black hair, there isn&#x27;t jet black natural hair, it looks so fake so I use cinnamon for the past 2 years, it hi lighted the whites it looked.good to me, so I saw eSalon.com I&#x27;m so flabbergasted, I foloe the instruction and voila ! My hair looks so beautiful, it&#x27;s like going back in time, I will recommend eSalon.com to all my clientele, friends and even foe! The kit was so neatly presented, with little developer bottles with my name! How about how personal, it had the description, on the instruction of how much of every color it got, so go ahead kiss your colorist good by, then you will have extra cash for doing mani- pedi and look like a goddess !</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  It did a better job of covering my grays and it matched my hair color perfectly.  Plus it comes with some nice little extras and great packaging.</li>
            <li> At my request, you remixed my dark brown color with more warm tones. Thank you for not charging me for the remix.  I like the warmer dark brown. The hair on the sides and back are clipped short so I need to color every 3 weeks. Feeling satisfied with your product. Thx.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair colouring experience I have ever had. With great trepidation I decided to do a full colour on my hair with my customised hair product from eSalon&#x27;s advice and instructions. My husband volunteered to assist me and we thoroughly enjoyed the process. My hair has never looked or felt better and that says a lot because until now i was getting my hair coloured at a Salon and paying 100s of dollars each time. For a fraction of the cost my hair looks just as good, if not better. And, the Customer Suppport is also just as good as their products ... brilliant!</li>
            <li> I just tried for first time 2 days ago.  So far so good.  They got the color right, everything you need comes in the kit. Nicely packaged.  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous from all the mixed reviews I read. I have been getting my hair dyed red for a while professionally, but my hairstylist is moving so I had to come up with another solution, e-salon is awesome! I got the exact color I wanted (no burgundy) the process was really simple and am so happy I found an affordable solution without having to go to the dreaded box. Thanks e-salon!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the products I have purchased from e-Salon over last 3 months.  My hair is now the exact color I have  wanted for years and the leave in conditioner has made my hair much easier to manage and looks healthier than it has in years.  At the age of 76 years, this is a total winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much e-Salon</li>
            <li> Best haircolor ever! No comparison to the boxed color. Love the golden highlights</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the result of my eSalon color. I was quite happily surprised at the perfect match, with out seeing my hair in person.  I would recommend eSalon to anyone that colors their hair at home. Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried my first bottle of eSalon about 2 weeks ago.  I was VERY skeptical about getting the right color, liking the product and finding one that would cover my white roots the same color as the rest of my hair.  I have been using OTC products for 20 years, but as my roots are now white, I was never able to get my white roots to color the same as the rest of the hair so was willing to spend a little more money to get that.  I must say that with eSalon my roots colored just as nicely as the rest of my hair and that was my main goal.  For my first order, I was told they made me a different color than I had originally ordered and was a little afraid to try it, but I loved the color I got!  I did NOT notice a strong smell while coloring my hair, but when I got into the shower to pour the remaining color (mixed with water) over my hair as the instructions said to do, that smell DID become overpowering.  My hair feels soft and was shiny and there is none of the gummy feel that I have read about?  I would prefer if they would send a larger package of shampoo and conditioner in exchange for the brush and 2nd pair of gloves.  If things change with the next application, I will come back and let you know - good or bad.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to do and love the color!</li>
            <li> The product is beyond fabulous! It comes with everything you need to do your hair.  The quality is salon quality and nothing like the box products you can buy.  It smells amazing, leaves your hair soft and shiny!  You have to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been paying so called professional hairdressers a lot of money and never getting the results I wanted. Too ashy, to dark then they would highlight my hair to make it look good. I didn&#x27;t want the double processing but didn&#x27;t have the choice. Anyway I ordered my color with the specifications I needed. I promised myself I would not look in the mirror so I wouldn&#x27;t freak out! Wow! The results were everything I have been trying to accomplish for the past two years! The color is so natural and colors grey amazingly well. My husband actually told me it looked very natural after I told him I had colored my hair. He would tell me if it was not acceptable. Anyway , I am so thankful and pleased! HALLELUYAH!</li>
            <li> I recently asked for minor tweak, needed to make it a bit softer (My color is dark brown)-&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the results.  It wasn&#x27;t too light and with the pale skin that a MN winter brings out in many of us, it was just right. Very pleased with their service and working me to get the color that looks best for my skin type and natural color that I still have left.</li>
            <li> Love the color kit with everything needed, plus an extra pair of colorist gloves for just in case. It was a kick to see my name on the bottles and the easy to follow personalized directions. I love love the color! Much better than the color I had tried previously. I liked that I was able to upload a photo and their colorists actually looked at it and adjusted my color order to a better shade than I had selected on my own.</li>
            <li> Looking for 10 stars to give to this fine product and excellent service. The result is like going to an expensive salon without the expensive price and....the expensive tip. Way to go eSalon !!  I think the e stands for excellent or exceptional or efficient of effortless or elected or...enjoyable. the list is endless and I am having fun with whoever reads this. No I don&#x27;t work for them, I am just a new customer.</li>
            <li> After a year with esalon, I&#x27;ll never go back to drugstore hair color - the product is worth every penny, and the service is great. In the recent frigid temperature (-30 degrees!), one bottle in my shipment broke. I let the folks at esalon know and they got a replacement out to me immediately, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I will make it simple.  I have had a great experience with this hair color.  I was paying so Much for something I used to do for a living.  It was hard because I still liked my time at the salon but I am now retired so trying to save here and there.  I have been very satisfied and changed my color for the first time.  I asked that it be subtle as I didn&#x27;t want to move too bold.  I just did it tonight and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> Saw the ad for eSalon on Facebook and decided to give it a try because store box color never turns out the color it should and I&#x27;m sick and tired of paying a fortune at the salon.  The color turned out perfect!!!  I struggled a little bit trying to do it by myself and had to get one of my daughters to help with the back.  The amount of product you get is Great!!!  Way more than with a box color.  I have very resistant gray hair and so I think next time I will let it sit for 40 min instead of 30 but I will check with a representative from eSalon first:-)  Overall, this is a fantastic product for an awesome price!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t colored my hair since I was very young. This was so easy! They helped me pick the right color and really knew how to give me the help that I needed.  What a great idea and a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> eSalon&#x27;s hair color is amazing!  I have bought drug store products for years and never had a color match as well as the one eSalon provided.  In addition, many of the products purchased from other sources burn my scalp, so I have several uncomfortable days after coloring my hair.  eSalon&#x27;s color is easy to apply and I love the fact that the stain resistant product to apply near the hairline is provided.  I just don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices charged by my hair stylist for coloring that I can now easily do myself.  This is a great product ... try it!!</li>
            <li> I was persuaded to try this product after reading hundreds (!) of excellent reviews for this product on amazon. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed with this product. Although the color came out all right, the quality of the color was similar to cheap box hair dyes. After the application my hair was left feeling lifeless and extremely dry, and it will now take me several weeks to revive my hair from this experiment. Also, in contrast to what I have read on so many other reviews online, the dye smelled really, very badly. I actually had to leave my bathroom in the process of coloring, because the smell was getting unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;I also read in many reviews that the colorists from the company helped many customers to pick out their color and took the extra effort. Frankly, the person I worked with did choose a color for me, but that really was it. She did not offer any other choices or really advise me on the colors that would fit my complexion. As far as I understand it, she just went by the picture I sent. I do understand that this is not a real salon and that it might perhaps be difficult to choose a hair color by looking at a picture. However, I was expecting something more based on the company&#x27;s ads.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great and I was happy that I got two bottles of color instead of one. Shipping was fast, but those two points were the best parts of this service. Really, I was left disappointed with this service.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time this weekend LOVE IT!  I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for years. I&#x27;ve used professional color as well as permanent and Demi permanent from the drugstore. Most recently I&#x27;ve been using Clairol Natural Instincts. While I liked those results I was never able to get the color I was looking for. Medium  Red Brown.  Finally I found it!!  So easy and looks awesome. And none of that funky dull color on the ends that can happen when you color over color.&lt;br /&gt;Just try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased color from eSalon and I am in love!!&lt;br /&gt;What a great sight, amazing product and fabulous deal! Happy girl :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you eSalon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for OVER 40 years. Finally NO brassiness!!! LOVE the color. I&#x27;m a faithful follower!!!</li>
            <li> I heard about E-Salon on facebook, and thought I&#x27;d try it instead of spending tons of money and time at a salon.  The first 3 times it barely covered the gray and my color, although adjusted each time, was not at all what I wanted.  But after sending pictures again, and receiving a root kit as well as color to adjust the rest, it is exactly what I wanted.  It&#x27;s the color of my hair before I started going gray, and I love it.  Now the color is even with highlights and I feel like a new person.  If you try this, don&#x27;t give up if it&#x27;s not the color you want in the beginning.. They will work with you and get it right.  It sure saves alot of money! Thank you E-Salon!</li>
            <li> I used my eSalon custom color for the first time last night... I was impressed with how the package came and what was included in it, first of all. Second was when I started opening bottles and mixing solutions, OMG the smell was straight out of a hair salon! No hair color product I ever bought OTC ever smelled like that, so I felt then that I had a hair salon-worthy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing was easy - there were only two products to combine and I put them in a bowl, stirred with the applicator brush that was included.  I followed the directions for application and even though the product never looked dark in the bowl, my hair and forehead/hairline was darker than dark.  The product was a little messier than I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m used to a weaker OTC product than this was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had enough product left over to mix back in the bottle with water and use to \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; my hair just before rinsing, and it all rinsed clean pretty easily (not so with some OTC products).  There was enough shampoo in the packet to thoroughly lather my hair, but there wasn&#x27;t enough conditioner so I had to use leftovers from other hair color products.  That was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I twisted my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair for the night, but even when it was wet, I was impressed with the richness of the color, the softness of my hair, and how even as dark as my forehead looked during application, I used the wipe in the kit before rinsing and there was no hair color stain left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took out the twists this morning, my hair was shiny, soft and the color looks rich and vibrant! I am delighted and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to OTC hair color products again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit contained:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Custom hair color&lt;br /&gt;Developer&lt;br /&gt;2 pair of gloves&lt;br /&gt;Applicator brush&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo packet&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner packet&lt;br /&gt;Stain guard&lt;br /&gt;Stain remover</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have strong red tones in my hair and wished to colour my hair with a none red result. I achieved it with this product. My friends thought I&#x27;d been and had my hair professionally coloured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was excellent and I an truly overjoyed with the results. I am having a regular delivery as this is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a go as you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all of the products that I have used. I find the staff to be very helpful. And I love that they worked with me to get the color just right.</li>
            <li> Fantastic..better than the high dollar salons.  Excellent instruction and very easy to use</li>
            <li> When my wife and I decided to give up life in the city for a big move to the country, I hadn&#x27;t really considered what that would mean for my hair. I&#x27;m a Leo lioness, and I take my mane very seriously. I had no idea it would be next to impossible to find a decent place to get our hair done anywhere near where we live, and I am in no way interested in a mullet with frosted tips. Hell hath no fury like a Lion with a brassy, frizzy bottle red that has been pushed past it&#x27;s expiry date. I was trying to compensate by buying shoes. Lots of shoes. Finally salvation came when my wife discovered eSalon and Made for You on Buzzfeed and she saved us from social ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of creating a profile and choosing our colour was fun and easy, and the product arrived quickly. We had so much fun playing hair salon together, and the instructions were easy to follow. We bought one kit of supplies to share, and it really came in handy. My wife was advised to change the colour she had originally selected, and the results were beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the full review, and check out photos of my hot wife here on my blog: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So very happy to recommend this, and our friends hope you start shipping to Canada soon!</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for over 40 years. I have used professional services as well as store brand at home products. eSalon specialized color and support is superior! I got exactly the color I wanted! The You Tube videos are extremely well done. For beginners, you can&#x27;t miss with all the information and support provided. Take the time to read about the company, you will be impressed! The supplies I bought are superior to other beauty supply stores. I will NEVER color my hair or purchase supplies from any one else!</li>
            <li> I just recently tried this and was very impressed with the whole process - even though I sent them a questionable picture of me and my hair, they were able to formulate the right color.  It went on dark at first, but after a few shampoos the true color and highlights came out.  The only criticism I have is that it didn&#x27;t cover the grey roots. Having said that, when I told the staff of my problem they immediately offered to refund my money or send me another formula with added info.&lt;br /&gt;  This is how customer service is supposed to work, no?  It couldn&#x27;t be easier, and I think it&#x27;s a superior product to what i would normally get at the grocery store!  More is included, not just color and shampoo/conditioner.  I am looking forward to trying it the second time, and if it works I will sign up for the subscription.  Sure beats spending over $100 at my salon.</li>
            <li> I am VERY HAPPY with my color. It&#x27;s a little darker than my natural color, and I love it! It is a beautiful copper color. I was so nervous, because I had never colored my hair myself, but the directions were very clear, and I did the strand test beforehand, which I highly recommend. Everything that I needed was included in the box. I highly recommend eSalon.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to have found eSalon.  I was struggling to find just the right shade of color.  When I&#x27;d find an over-the-counter option, it would quickly be discontinued...or would ravage my hair.  With eSalon, I can work within my schedule, save money and not sacrifice one ounce of quality.  PLUS...I can tweak my color for the seasons or if I just get an urge to try something a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They make it so easy.  Though it&#x27;s about double what you pay for the national brand hair colors, I think the quality is salon grade...if not better.  My hair is so much shinier and bouncier with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. If you&#x27;re reluctant at all...don&#x27;t be. Give them a whirl. You have nothing to lose and a great hair color and experience to gain!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was Very skeptical at first, I had seen some girls rave about it on youtube but they all had dark hair, except one that was blond (which I&#x27;m not) and she went darker.  I have naturally dark brown hair but I dye it a lot.  This year I spent 300 at an expensive salon to do a balayage hair color (which I only liked the first day)... Same story every year, i lighten to almost blond, then I cry to my friends because I feel like a skunk.  It wasn&#x27;t tragic but I just don&#x27;t feel like myself.  When I checked out esalon, they had best color from Allure magazine which had me intrigued, and for $10.00, I said what the heck... If I wreck it, I&#x27;ll fix it later.  I always read the bad reviews first and here are two comments I want to confirm.  First, smell.. Is not bad like another reviewer said, maybe because the worst smelling dye I used (once) and actually the harshest was L&#x27;Oreal Preference.  If you can tolerate that smell, this will be a piece of cake.  Second, customer service... I sent my pictures and wrote under comments what colors do well with me.  I was hoping they would come out with something unique, maybe something i had never tried before.  They didn&#x27;t call, which I was a bit disappointed and they sent me the same color I&#x27;ve been using for a long time (medium golden brown).  I was skeptical to use because again i had read the bad reviews and I was a bit sad because my 300 balayage color was going with it.  I had even turned off my auto shipment.  Well, I&#x27;m very happy to say I am turning the auto shipment back on, possibly buying the shampoo and conditioner which felt like a million bucks! The color looks like me finally but the gloss on my ends didn&#x27;t really get that dark so I now have a lot of dimension! It&#x27;s a beautiful medium brown with soft highlights!! My hair feels healthier than before since it was recently bleached but right now you can&#x27;t tell.  Super happy! My only suggestion (other than try it for 10 bucks/ plus shipping) is that if you have ANY concerns or ideas, call them. Don&#x27;t wait on them to call you. I plan to call next time when I change up my color.oncerns or ideas, call them. Don&#x27;t wait on them to call you. I plan to call next time when I change up my color.</li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from esalon as I didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold it. I am in the UK and heard from other people about this new colour product. I don&#x27;t usually colour my own hair, I go to a salon, but have been very disappointed with the colour and condition and was looking to find a new hairdresser. My sister helped me put the colour on but it was easy enough for me to do myself. The resulting colour is darker than I&#x27;m used to but it&#x27;s lovely, the shine and condition of my hair is great. There are really nice tones to the colour and it looks different in different lighting. I have had nothing but positive feedback on my hair and I have a few friends who now intend to try esalon for themselves.</li>
            <li> The color, texture and shine of my hair is better than it has ever been. I tell everyone about e salon. You guys are producing a wonderful product at an amazing price! Thanks</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  Directions were thorough and concise.  The color/shade is perfect for my complexion, your experts knew what I needed.  I would highly recommend this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all the products esalon offers.  I have a very hard to match natural color is mostly grey now.  Esalon staff has done an excellent job not only matching but making adjustments to the color at my request.  I love the feedback services they offer.  They give you information to help with everything from application to products that will enhance your hair color experience as well as promote healthy hair and long color life.  I have colored my hair for 10+ years due to greying early and used many different at home products as well as had professional hair coloring done.  Esalon products are by far the best I have used.  Yes they are more expensive than the drug store box brands but you pay for what you get and you get quality with esalon and expert advice.  Thanks esalon staff.</li>
            <li> This product is just perfect! I tried it for the first time last weekend. It was easy to use (just follow the instructions or go to the website for extra information) and the results are amazing. My hair colour is spot on, and my hair is soft and super glossy! I strongly recommend you try this product. It&#x27;s also very well priced so it&#x27;s a real £££ saver!</li>
            <li> Their service has always been exemplary! And, eSalon&#x27;s products are of great quality.</li>
            <li> After spending thousands of dollars at a high-end salon, I decided to try something a little easier on the budget. I was skeptical at first. I&#x27;m blonde and I&#x27;ve seen too many \\&quot;bottled blondes\\&quot; (brassy) to be scared away from the boxes in the drugstore. I figured, well, once and if I hate it, it will grow out or I&#x27;d go back to my expensive salon colorist. I have used this product for over a year now and am so very happy with the results. I use the True Blue once a week to keep my hair light and bright. The color is long lasting and does a good job at covering the gray. So glad I found eSalon.</li>
            <li> 2nd Application since becoming a new customer. Very pleased with the results!! The color was just what I asked for and more. Love the highlights. Amazing how this is done without meeting the client in person.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service.  My 1st order came damaged and they promptly mailed a me a new box.  No hassle!  Excellent products and excellent results.  Lasts as long as my $120 salon color.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I came across eSalon through Social Media and I thought their marketing presentation was impressive and decided to give it a try, so I place an online order.  I received the package and was again impressed with the presentation and their marketing personalization strategy. To my disappointment the product sent had Ammonia, which I had clearly stated in email exchanges could not be used in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the greatest disappointment came this morning when I receive a message from eSalon confirming a new charge to my credit card to an order I did not place!  The personalization strategy is not extended to customer services, as you can’t find an email or phone number to contact customer services. Fill the form and hope for a timely reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learnings: You can have a terrific business idea and sufficient money to put together a great marketing strategy, yet it will fail if your product does not deliver the results expected or your business practices hurts the same customers you are trying to retain.</li>
            <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for my custom color. I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;In fact I loved everything about the kit from the quick shipping to the custom color kit right down to the pink gloves!&lt;br /&gt;My hair never looked and felt so good. I will definitely order again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;Theresa K</li>
            <li> Love eSalon color for my gray coverage ! Even though it&#x27;s liqiud there were no drips ! The five stor colors wouldn&#x27;t cover all my gray so this is the best ! The shampoo with the kit smells wonderful too. My hair wasn&#x27;t too dry after either. Love eSalon color too, on point .</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was skeptical.  But after I colored I couldn&#x27;t believe how dead on the color I requested was.  perfect!!  Four days later and counting, my hair is soooo soft and gorgeous!!  Just unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my own hair for a long time now, and am very picky.  I have tried many different products and colors trying to get the exact color I wanted.  ESalon did it almost immediately!  They even called me at home to make sure they knew what I wanted.  The color is so beautiful and natural looking, and my hair feels tremendous!!!  I cannot say enough good about this product, and from other reviews I&#x27;ve read, everyone feels the same way.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product made just for you at your specifications.  What more could you ask for????  I promise you, if you try it, you will be a forever customer!!</li>
            <li> After trying to acheive the color  I wanted for so long, I decided to try eSalon. I truthfully did not expect to find an answer. I wrote in about the color I was trying to acheive (plum brown) without leaving my gray areas looking a fuschia/ punk rock red. I was amazed at how they got it so right. I am so pleased witb the color results immediately after coloring. Also, the product was mild to my scalp, covers my grays and left an awesome natural looking hue. The delivery is prompt and I am overall very glad I gave them a try. Dont hesitate to do so yourself. They aim to please.</li>
            <li> I started going grey at 16.  Have colored my hair for almost 40 years.  I used the esalon custom color for the first time yesterday.  What a fabulous product!  The color and shine are amazing.  Perfect coverage for grey resistant hair.  Perfect color from scalp to end.  My hair is soft and shiny.  The color is amazing.  They did a lighter chocolate brown color with a chocolate/mahogany/violet glaze over it.  My hair has NEVER looked this good.  Follow the instructions exactly...they are a little different.  The leave in conditioner is light weight and non-greasy.  I could not be happier. Have signed up for an every 4 week shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair colored at a very high end Houston salon 5 weeks ago.  Total bill was $145.  It looked okay.  This looks and feels fantastic, and at a fraction of the cost.  THANK YOU ESALON!</li>
            <li> After I colored my hair with my first order of eSalon, I noticed while I was drying it with a towel that it was very sticky. As a result I rinsed it four times x 20 minutes each time in my kitchen sink with the water spraying at full force. The water never cleared completely; there was a steady stream of bubbles coming out of my hair. I finally gave up and dried with my hair dryer. It was still sticky but not as bad as it had been. I looked at the ingredients on the developer and it said &amp;#34;castor seed oil.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked it up online and there were many websites touting castor seed oil for African American hair. The websites all talked about how sticky it is, and that it is good for thick hair. I am Caucasian of Irish, English descent with thin hair, as I told them in my interview. Why eSalon added it to my specially formulated hair color is beyond me. I figured it must have been a mistake. However, if it was, isn&#x27;t that scary? What other mistakes could they make for something we put on our crowning glory? Needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and sat down to write this review.</li>
            <li> Amazing hair color! I am so impressed how shiny the color is and not a color i would normally pick dark brown, i did the online question and told them no red, first time in a long time, there is no red tones. I love the service. Very friendly and talk by phone or email for questions and concerns. For me i love the Aveda salon but having a little one hard to make it there and sit with him there for three hours or so... I have tried boxed color many before too and normally not happy with them.I have reordered already and order the hair products too!</li>
            <li> I just tried my customized hair color in natural light blonde which is like a level 9 box color from a store.  I really love the color and it left my hair in really good condition.  It also evened out my roots with the rest of my color. I have dark blonde hair naturally which I normally dye it to a light natural blonde and have some highlights throughout. When I first put the new dye on the parts of my hair that are highlighted quickly turned blue! I thought, &amp;#34;oh no!&amp;#34;  Plus, the dye looked like it wasn&#x27;t going to dye my hair light enough and was going to look too golden, which I hate, however, once I got in the shower and rinsed, shampooed and conditioned and dried my hair, the results were awesome. The parts that were blue rinsed out completely and the the color was even throughout. It was exactly what I wanted and my hair was left in better condition than when I use box hair dye from the drug store. I&#x27;m completely satisfied!  I set up auto delivery for every 4 weeks. It will be a little more expensive than box color, but the added benefit of better conditioned hair in the long run is worth it to me. Plus, I can control the shipments on line and even skip an order if I need to. I am in control of the timing of the shipments, and can even make changes to the color. So, for anyone who says on their review that there isn&#x27;t a phone number to contact customer service , they are wrong. The phone number is on their website. Also, I read where a customer&#x27;s credit card was charged for an additional after the first order, we&#x27;ll just so you know, after you order the first time, you are automatically signed up for auto delivery, but can turn it off immediately online.  You just have to pay attention to what&#x27;s on the page and follow directions!  The person who said their credit card was charged again without authorization just did not pay attention to the options on the ordering page. They could have turned off the auto delivery option the very first time they ordered.It was not esalon&#x27;s fault!  Pay attention and don&#x27;t blame the company for your own oversight!  This is a real review from a real first time customer who is very satisfied! Thank you Esalon&#x27;s.com!</li>
            <li> Everything about my experience with eSalon has been positive and professional!  The colour I received in my initial order was exact to what I wanted and was expecting.  The instructions were spot-on.  I really admired the packaging / presentation,  too.  I also added some colouring tools to my initial order,  the bowl, brush and clips, and found that this simple addition made a considerable difference in ease of application and use.  The dialogue the stylist opened when I wrote and wondered if going lighter may be an option was tremendously helpful.  Rather than going along with what I thought I wanted, an honest, professionals opinion was given, and I appreciate that SO very much more than just having a sale and a potentially unhappy customer.  My second order is currently in the works and I cannot wait to get it!  Also considering purchasing other products for the upkeep and health of my hair!  A true convert!  I say to anyone mulling this service over to go for it!  I found it entirely worthwhile!</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!! They set you up to charge your credit card whether you want anything from them or not.  I do not like their product and found out I&#x27;m set up for an automatic order. Read their fine print carefully. I&#x27;m in the process of extracting myself from their poor business processes.</li>
            <li> excellent service and responsive . great products</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. After years of boxed colors and even more years at salon colors (not to mention the amount of money I wasted) this is the first product that matched my natural color! I started turning gray in my early 30&#x27;s so I needed something to cover that and enhance my natural color. ESalon nailed it! I will definitely order again and recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> If you are a natural red head and the gray hair is starting to come in, this is the best color you can find anywhere. They personally make your hair color, providing colors available, then you send them a photo so they can make adjustments to create your perfect hair color. I would [actually, already have] recommend eSalon to anyone. Especially those with red hair, it is by far the most difficult shade to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HKAT</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for over 15 years now. I have had it done in the salon a few times but usually bought box color and did it myself. I LOVE the results I get with eSalon! I have colored my hair 4 times now with eSalon and it has been a great experience. My hair color is very shiney and the color is amazing. We had to make adjustments to get to the right tone but it was wonderful. I just add in my comments for the colorists and they tweak my recipe per my instruction and voila, I have my customized color! I just started using their tinted love pigment depositing cream and it works fabulously! It adds just the right amount of copper back into my color to keep it bright and vibrant. I love the convenience of having the color mailed to my home each month as well. I LOVE LOVE eSalon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Esalon for a few months now, with absolutely no issues.  Color is exactly what they say it will be and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month I decided I wanted to go a little darker and redder.  All I did was upload a recent pic of my hair and ask for the color change...they did the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did my hair and the color is PERFECT!  I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they are true geniuses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making my hair color disasters a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the customized service and color.  The product is less &amp;#34;drippy&amp;#34; than and not nearly as &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;OTC&amp;#34; hair color.  Also, the illustrations and instructions that accompany the product are easy to follow, along with the hair clips, which are not only convenient but also durable.  The best aspect is that I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about the store&#x27;s not having my particular color when I need it because it is delivered directly to my house.  And, if I ever want to go a little lighter or a little darker--or even change colors completely--consulting with the colorists at eSalon is as simple as filling out a form online and waiting for someone to contact me; plus, I always have the opportunity to provide feedback following my usage of the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Customer service colorist listened to my concerns when I want to go lighter. I like the auto ship. One less thing off my mind. My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s ever been, since I stopped using drug store products.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it! My hair looks great, so much better than when I dyed it with boxed dye from the store.</li>
            <li> I have purchased color from eSalon three times.  Every kit comes with everything you will need -- shampoo, conditioner, gloves, a stain guard, and very detailed instructions. Each time I have asked for a slightly different shade.  Their Customer Service has been very helpful in trying to get the shade I have in mind. My hair does NOT come out straw-like after each application but is soft and shiny. This is an excellent option if box color does not quite meet your expectations. They also have an auto-ship so you don&#x27;t have to remember to place another order. And you pick the date.</li>
            <li> This service is amazing!!! They make it so simple to get quality hair color and you dont have to go to a salon and pay outrageous prices for someone to do it for you and also dont have to use the terrible chemicals in box color. The first round i got i was so impressed with packaging and presentation and the care they put into their product it was very refreshing, the color itself while not the exact color i was going for was still a nice color and everything worked perfectly to my expectations otherwise, and with a quick email asking for a reformulation on my color the next batch i got was exactly what i was looking for! So glad i stumbled across this website cuz it has changed my hair life! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been receiving my hair color from eSalon for over a year.  It&#x27;s the best color I&#x27;ve ever used.  I get so many compliments on it.  I recently asked them to adjust the color to make it a little lighter, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Everyone I&#x27;ve corresponded with is so helpful.  The instructions are easy to follow, and the website provides all the information you need.  I also love the convenience of having the color arrive in the mail and doing my hair when I want to and not having to go to a salon and wait around and then pay an exorbitant amount of money.  I also use eSalon&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner.  I am very happy with eSalon and all their products!</li>
            <li> I have experienced very little fading and was able to lengthen the time between coloring as a result. My air is shiny and in good condition. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A friend sent me a link and I decided to try this.  I really liked the color and it was easy. I went to my stylist today and he told me I was lucky to have hair that color!  He was surprised it came from a bottle. I was surprised he said something!  I was happy with the results before he said something but afterwards, I was really happy!  It&#x27;s only been a day, but so far, I love the results!  I&#x27;m asking for a tweak for my next delivery, but they have been very responsive and communicative.  The delivery cycle is every 5 weeks and I get emails letting me know I have time to change my order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely convenient, easy to use and I really enjoy being able to switch up the color when i want to.</li>
            <li> Finally, the color I have been searching for over many years.  And on the first try.  Easy application.  Beautiful shine.  I am sold.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd order and LOVE IT!  The 1st formula wasn&#x27;t perfect and they were very helpful with suggestions to alter it for round 2.  the 2nd time was perfect and I am so glad that they worked with me! It is the PERFECT shade of red!  UPDATE*** The 3rd order was AWFUL and I did not get good customer service at all.  They say they have a money back guarantee, but I never got a refund.  Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I was very pleasantly surprised by the easy of application, great coverage of gray and my hair came out the best I&#x27;ve seen since coloring it many years now. I am going to use this product only from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair either by myself or done by a professional and never has it looked this good!  It completely covers the gray doesn&#x27;t fade out and looks good all the way up to the next color treatment. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for many years using a hair stylist. Now that I am retired, I need to be more frugal. I am hesitant to use store brands. When I saw eSalon advertised, I was intrigued.  The coloration box arrived and I was a bit nervous.  However, it was easy to apply and the color is fabulous, just exactly what I hoped for.  I will be using eSalon from now one.  Thank you all for your help through this.</li>
            <li> Color was great and I loved the personalization on the bottles.</li>
            <li> Excellent products &amp; attentive service! My gray hairs were getting resistant to drugstore hair color. Salon hair color is too expensive for me. This is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> This is great! No brainer! Hair color delivered by mail. Made just for me. I don&#x27;t have to make appointment. They give advice on which color. My hair color was perfect. Left my hair feeling great. I&#x27;m a sooo on board for this. Can&#x27;t wait for next delivery. eSalon I&#x27;m lovin you!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had been born with this color hair. Highlights built in. Super soft and shiny Will purchase again !</li>
            <li> I love this product. It saves so much money, I am able to color my own hair and it looks like I went to the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using esalon color for about 6 months now. and I love it.  They came pretty close to matching my color from the pictures I sent on the first try and nailed it on the second which I&#x27;ve used consistently now for 5 months.  Yes, it takes some time to get used to doing it myself and learning the technique (I prefer the brush to the bottle when applying) but I can get it on now in less than 15 minutes.  I asked my regular hair stylist what she thought (and to be honest) and she said it was perfect and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like how the salon does it but I have to cover gray roots every three weeks and don&#x27;t want the hassle  of spending an 1/1/2  at the salon when I can do it at my convenience at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just emailed esalon to suggest they stop sending all the extra packets that I don&#x27;t ever use (stain guard, stain remover, shampoo and conditioner) and reduce the price a little.  They sent a nice reply so I&#x27;ll wait to see what they do.  I</li>
            <li> I had been trying for months to get my color just right at a salon. Esalon perfected it on the 2nd try. I&#x27;ve gotten  tons of compliments. Sure application can be a little messy (red) but the color and highlights are fantastic. Delivery is so convenient and their customer service is excellent. I wish dye wasn&#x27;t so drying, but this has been my best coloring experience ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update one year later: The color is beautiful but destroys your hair over time. Be very careful if you don&#x27;t have incredibly strong hair. I wish I would&#x27;ve simply gone with professional products and saved the life of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is just AMAZING!!!!!! It covered ALL my grey and was the exact, precise color I asked for!!</li>
            <li> This was much easier to use then I expected.  The color turned out beautifully, has been lasting, and fully covers my gray.  The instructions are easy to follow--I would recommend paying the few extra dollars for bowl, brush and clips for your first time.  I can&#x27;t believe that I haven&#x27;t been doing this all along!!!</li>
            <li> eSalon delivers a high quality color product with a few added advantages-&lt;br /&gt;1. Professional advice as to the correct custom shade for your skin tone and desired outcome.&lt;br /&gt;2. Delivery to your door.&lt;br /&gt;3. A satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;4. All for the price of a box color of inferior quality in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given eSalon 5 stars but there is always room for improvement and I look forward to seeing what else these folks will do.&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering from eSalon for sure.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because I have seen so many ads for it.  well all the items to do my hair were so neatly and perfectly packaged, I was quite surprised for the low introductory price I paid. Then I followed the directions exactly as written, and even though the color looked a lot darker on my head, when I rinsed it out, I was absolutely thrilled with the results!!  The color was exactly what I wanted, my incredible amounts of gray (or glitter as I like to call it) hair was completely covered, there was a sort of pearl essence to my hair, just like the colors name proclaimed. After shampooing and conditioning with the samples, my hair was soft, silky and shiny. And after several weeks the color has not faded, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw and it still looks amazing every day, even using my own brand of shampoo. I&#x27;m hooked! thanks ESalon, I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using  this color and I just ordered your amazing shampoo &amp; conditioner ...can&#x27;t wait to get it. you made a believer out of me!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the color that was created for me. I had picked one color and based on my photo and other info it was recommend to use something different for what I was looking to achieve. What things got adjusted to and created for me was perfect and exactly what I was actually looking for. I could not be happier. Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my experience with eSalon...the products were excellent and the customer service was even better....I highly recommend eSalon for home hair coloring! I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> I loved the color, the personal service, and the follow up.  I would have given 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t remember signing up for regular delivery every so many weeks.  The color was great.  I have very long hair and only color the roots for gray and very white hairs peeking through.  After coloring hair, the ends of hair seemed like straw; but after washing twice, then using the conditioner all over, hair was soft and manageable.  I had an incredibly hard time coloring my own hair, due to previous neck surgery (6 years ago).  I don&#x27;t think I am willing to do it again, due to the awkwardness of holding arms up, etc.  It&#x27;s just too hard for me.  The hair color was perfect, though.  I sent in several pictures of myself at different times of the year and the recipe was dead on accurate.  Thanks eSalon for all of your follow up and caring about your product.  I would recommend this color.</li>
            <li> I love this product, color is excellent, no more grey hair, easy to use. It was very helpful to talk on Skype with someone who  gave an advice.Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love the way eSalon operates I put all of my information in when I was going to color my hair paid. I was not expecting the color to come by the time I needed to color my hair and was not looking forward to using color from the store was I surprised when I received my package the very day I needed it! The package is great everything is packaged to help me use it for the best result.</li>
            <li> I am African American and using the hair typing system, I have 4 A,B &amp; C hair.  I have now used eSalon for over a year and I love it.  I get a permanent color as I am covering gray that I am not quite ready to accept!!  The colorists have been very helpful in helping me make adjustments and to understand just how color works on our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect color! it&#x27;s was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Hair color us great, just like my hair and nice and soft!</li>
            <li> LOVE love so much that I posted about it on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;http://gullycreekcottage.com/2015/03/03/covering-my-shades-of-gray/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my own hair for 7+ years now after moving (therefore not able to go to the stylist who I&#x27;d trusted for 7+years before.). I was apprehensive, but figured I would try it.  I LOVE LOVE the color and their other products.  The gloss works great for extending shine in between coloring, but this color lasts at least 2 weeks longer than the store-bought color I was using.  And my hair feels MUCH better.  The stylist consultants are responsive.</li>
            <li> Tried for the first time a couple weeks ago.  I will most definitely continue to use this service. I love the personalized attention. The service is easy and user friendly. You can upload your pics and receive feedback on your color choice.  Perhaps it is my color but even the solutions smell better than boxed.  As good as salon at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found you! Great product, great service, great hair color - and it leaves my hair in better condition than before I started. What more can a girl ask - keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I was so suspicious when I read about Esalon.&lt;br /&gt;I have more than 75% grey(roots) and for me hair coloring is terrible desicion every time.&lt;br /&gt;What brand,hair color....who really does grey coverage.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the survey about my hair I was like......O come on!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have time for this,but I am glad that I did it.&lt;br /&gt;My grey hair(roots) is completely colored and the color of my hair is BELIEVE ME 100% the same as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;How did they did this?&lt;br /&gt;The things that are free in the package....the best hair shampoo ever and the conditioner is beyond incredible.&lt;br /&gt;So,yes,I would recommend Esalon for everyone but as I said,the promised 12 weeks of coverage so let&#x27;s see what is going to happen in the future.&lt;br /&gt;And btw I am a man.&lt;br /&gt;Lol</li>
            <li> I just used eSalon&#x27;s hair coloring product and I loved it. I hadn&#x27;t dyed my hair in years but I got tired of the gray hair and had heard good things about the product so I tried it. I found the ordering process simple. I liked the fact that the service and product was personalized. After viewing my&lt;br /&gt;completed intake and the pictures I&#x27;d sent they advised me to go a little lighter-instead of light brown they advised dark blond. I was very pleased with the product. The color is perfect and it had the best gray coverage I&#x27;ve ever had. I also bought their shampoo, conditioner and styling cream and I loved those products as well. I have fine straight hair and my hair is soft, shiney and had great body. Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair felt GREAT after coloring and using the shampoo and conditioner supplied in the kit.  Strong smell of ammonia; used in a ventilated bathroom.  It&#x27;s a little messy, but the instructions that came with the kit warn you of this first.  I wanted my hair a little redder, so I think I should have looked at samples of their colors, instead of just using their survey questions to develop the right color for me.  But I was able to let them know this after my coloring experience, so next delivery can be adjusted (I hope!).  Covers grey completely!  I will try the next shipment to see if they can get the color right; if not, I will discontinue the automatic delivery system.</li>
            <li> Without question these products are superior to store bought... Packaging , customer service are above average as well. I am an auto renewal customer ( has it been 2 years ? ) convenient  ..... The most challenging part is getting back of my head covered ... My husband and I joke that I am now sleeping with my colorist.! ( is this too &amp;#34;off color ! &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I decided to try eSalon hair color for the first time this past fall in October.  My hair which is naturally red has been slowly losing it&#x27;s red color and becoming lighter and lighter, I&#x27;m assuming turning white as that is what happens with redheads.  I have never dyed my hair before and decided to give this a try.  I was nervous at first so I went with the demi permanent color that matched my natural hair color.  The process was easy and there was some difference but not what I thought it would be.  I decided to go a little darker 8 weeks later in December but kept the demi permanent.  Still no change with my hair except it looked a little brighter and less washed out strands.  So when it was time to color my hair, my colorist at eSalon recommended I try the permanent hair color.  This I did and with the same color I had just tried back in December.  Wow!!  What a difference!  I was very nervous because the directions said I was to only apply to my roots and not the rest of my hair.  I was very skeptical and had even emailed my colorist with my doubts but I was reassured all would be well and it worked and my hair looks great!!  No more grayish-white hairs and I look years younger with the darker color.  I&#x27;m so happy I found eSalon and I can tell you any questions you may have about about color, directions, etc. are all answered timely via email.  I also love that they supply you with pretty much everything you will need such as 2 pair of gloves, packets of shampoo, conditioner, stain guard and stain remover (which I did not need).  I also purchased some other items to help me with the process;  A cape, hair clips, application brush and bowl and timer.  I will be using this service for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eSalon for about a year and a half after years of paying too much for hair coloring in the salon. Recently, I asked for a lighter shade and was given custom instructions for application. Thank you, eSalon, for not only supplying customized hair color which meets my needs perfectly but also following up with the perfectly matched instructions.</li>
            <li> My hair color is awesome.  I am getting so many compliments on it.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect outcome. Exactly the color I wanted. I have been told by stylists many times that I have hard hair to color and was a little scared to try this but it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> The product is packaged beautifully, every thing you need to do the job is included, even Stain Guard and product to remove any stains after you are done. . Directions were easy to follow but it does help to have every thing laid out before you start. That being said, it was the messiest hair color I have ever used. I ended up using 2 pairs of gloves and 2 caps. Ran down my back, shirt, face, neck, in globs.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long the color last I probably won&#x27;t use again.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Nice packaging, good color saturation, nice results.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Too messy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t topically take the time to write reviews, but this product is amazing! Their customer service is unparalleled and the product is wonderful. My hair looks great. I have recommended this product to everyone I know and I will be a customer for a very long time. So glad I found eSalon!</li>
            <li> I was leary about trying this product. However,  I loved the personalization, quality, price, and most importantly, the way my hair turned out. It&#x27;s the perfect color, my hair is shiny and healthy looking and the entire process was effortless to do.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using their products. The auto ship is awesome. I don&#x27;t have to make time to go to the beauty store.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer or shinier after using at home hair color. Easy to apply and great coverage. I invested in the auto delivery option but you don&#x27;t have to. Easier and cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> the tone is absolutely perfect, not brassy at all, and perfectly matches my natural color. Looks as good as the color from a salon visit!</li>
            <li> What a fantastic  product!  It turned out to be just the right color, which over the counter boxed colors could not give me.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were easy to follow, and the online support by the company was great to have.&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was pleased &amp; amazed with your product, as well as the convenience.  At $10 for your first bottle of custom mixed hair color how can you go wrong? After answering 10 easy questions or so &amp; uploading a current picture of myself a bottle arrived at my doorstep with almost exactly the color I was looking for. The best part is I can tweak my color for my next order at no extra charge. There was nothing bad about the product or my experience! Try it today. Why are you waiting?!</li>
            <li> Totally amazing depth and dimension -- made for me...totally-rocking gorgeous!!!!! Oh my goodness!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I never color my hair anymore because the color is never what I want and my hair is left dry and unmanageable, only to end up brassy and coarse within a couple weeks. This hair color was the exact opposite of what I have experienced with hair color in the past. The color is so natural and rich. At the same time my hair is soft and shiny. I tell everyone I know to use this color. I&#x27;m so happy with it!</li>
            <li> We are now full time RVers , so I don&#x27;t have a salon anymore.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to &#x27;find&#x27; someone to color my hair, (plus pay the high cost) so I thought I would give e-salon a try.  I thought I might have to change the formula a couple of times - just because I always have trouble because my hair grabs color fast. But the color was perfect! So much so my husband noticed and loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is starting to come in silver grey.  Over the counter colors did not cover the grey and faded after a few washings.  Then I saw an ad for Made for you color.  I sent them a photo of my hair color and told them I liked the light to medium blonde color and wanted to cover the increasing grey new growth.  The color they sent was perfect.  Then after a few months I noticed the new growth was stubborn and resisting the color so the beautician that places the color on my hair suggested they increase the strength of the developer.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in good condition and the creme rinse they provide leaves it silky soft.  So glad I found this company.  They are easy to work with and make any changes you may need.</li>
            <li> Love my hair color! It is the exact color of my hair use to be ,before the gray started showing up!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months before trying. Lovely presentation and a few freebies also. The color they picked for me was a better choice and it came out great.  I used a golden blonde color, close to my own. It was a bit confusing with having to section your hair off (I have long hair) and made it a bit messy also but in the end I just kind of winged it and the ends came out slightly darker and after a few days looked better. I will order this again and see if it&#x27;s easier to use the second time around.  The color was great and looks like a professional color job. It may be more than the box  kind but certainly less than a salon. It really covered the grey and now waiting to see how long it will last.  My hair has felt softer after with other brands but think it&#x27;s more a conditioner issue, and may just depend on one&#x27;s hair type.  Looking forward to my next experience! Thank You E-Salon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suspicious about these reviews. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for over 25 years.  For the last several years I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal color and a developer from Sally Beauty.  I&#x27;ve had really good luck with that.  No straw feeling afterwards,  good gray coverage, long lasting and little frizz which I can easily manage with a frizz serum but I got curious and decided to give esalon a try.  I filled out the questionnaire and sent a picture.  I indicated that I wanted my hair a little darker.  They sent me a root kit which made no sense to me as I wanted my hair darker and I didn&#x27;t know how you would do that if you didn&#x27;t dye it all but I called and they assured me that the rinse and shine process would do that.  So I decided to take the &amp;#34;expert&#x27;s&amp;#34; advice.  I dyed it and when I went to wash it a gob of hair came out and my hair felt like straw,  just like when I used a box dye in the past.  So I went to dry it and my hair was the exact same color as before.  Now,  two days later and it&#x27;s even lighter and my frizz serum which I have used for years won&#x27;t even take care of the frizz.  I think I&#x27;m going to have to go have the ends trimmed which I just did which is disappointing since I&#x27;m trying to grow it out.  I&#x27;m going back to my L&#x27;Oreal again.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.  I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.  I bought it directly from their site.</li>
            <li> I love this service. The color is exactly what I want and I don&#x27;t get any green or brassy tones</li>
            <li> Tried eSalon for the first time last week and I am absolutely happy with the results.  Cheaper than the salon ($125) and way better than the box coloring kit.  Looks natural and eSalon got the color right.  No need for changes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to let you know how awesome my experience was. The colorist recommended a different shade then what I ordered. I was a bit nervous when it arrived but decided to apply to see how it would come out.&lt;br /&gt;Loved that the odor was not ammonia smell. Easy application, loved the gloves. Ran outside after shampoo to check the color. Liked it but wanted to see it dry. Went out with hubby and saw a co-worker at the restaurant where she didn&#x27;t realize I had colored said it looked so natural. Friend&#x27;s and daughters said it was awesome. I&#x27;m sold!!!!! Last test is how long it will hold up. I wear a short cut so average time is two haircuts. I&#x27;ve referred your site to friends and let them know the great experience I had. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I think your products are excellent! I have never had my hair color so nice that I stop by mirrors just to look at it and say &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34; I also love the Perfect endings leave in conditioner, It is great!</li>
            <li> Karen Stendahl&lt;br /&gt;Mar 26, 4:01 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair the same color for 40 years. I was more then a liittle afraid of using the ESalon color but as soon as I blew my hair out my first reaction was ,,THERE I AM!!!! Love it.</li>
