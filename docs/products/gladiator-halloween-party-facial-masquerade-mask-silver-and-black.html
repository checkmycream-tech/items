            <li>for build quality... not a lot to say, the mask looks nice..</li>
            <li>Order at your own discretion.</li>
            <li>Unlike many &amp;#34;one size fits&amp;#34; masks... the nose and cheek area of this mask conform to my face rather nicely for once.  </li>

            <li>So the mask looks MOSTLY as pictured.  </li>
            <li>its more like a play toy than a mans mask.</li>
            <li>It makes me want to go to more mask events</li>
            <li>so I can use it more.</li>

            <li>Both items were perfect and he received several complements at the prom!  </li>
            <li>Design was nice and fit my face.  </li>
            <li>Has ribbons to tie on your head, rather than cheap elastic, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought 5 more and don&#x27;t even want to use them.</li>
            <li>This was OK.</li>
            <li>but when my husband attempted to manipulate it to better frame his face, it broke.</li>
            <li>It looks nicer in the pic kind of cheap in person</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like much better quality than what it is.</li>
            <li>The glasses actually fit on top of the mask (but I wish we&#x27;d thought of that ahead of time.)  </li>
            <li>It looked like cheap plastic, but it would have been okay for the one night he needed it for.  </li>
            <li>Overall great construction, I wish the paint was better</li>
            <li>The seller shipped the item very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, decent quality, good buy.  </li>
            <li>Fit fine.</li>
            <li>Ultra cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>I tried to bend the plastic out so it could fit on my head</li>
            <li>This mask was well made did not look cheap</li>
            <li>It was cheap, so  </li>
            <li>My husband painted wedding colors on the mask (lime green) on one side and just outlined the eyes and the swirls, it looked great !!!!</li>
            <li>cheap...</li>
            <li>cheaply made, guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>pretty okay</li>
            <li>the quality is good however the in person appearance is different from the pic.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just bummed it broke so quickly.</li>
            <li>it came rather quickly and in time for our event, however the strings attached to the mask came off before he could tie them together.</li>
            <li>Super fun party,</li>
            <li>I went out and bought a Sharpie Paint Pen and colored in more black to get a nice effect.</li>
            <li>This is a great little deal.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, but well made and comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>My son got to wear it at home for fun.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, he took it on and off several times throughout the night, and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>but overall it served its purpose and he looked nice in it.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the ~$4</li>
            <li>other than that the quality was good for the price,.  </li>
            <li>Upon delivery, the sides of the mask were so scrunched to each other, I knew there would be no way of it fitting comfortably on my face.  </li>
            <li>My husband looked hot in this mask for a Mardi Grad party and it was sturdy too.  </li>
            <li>You can get better quality masks for the same price if not cheaper.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m married.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look for a better one next Halloween.</li>
            <li>Very nice mask, thick durable plastic.</li>
            <li>the mask was so narrow that it would be a better fit for a child&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I doubt it would fit a normal sized adult&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>I am a male (using my gf&#x27;s Amazon account) and the mask does fit well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>He said it worked for everything he needed and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>To much work??</li>
            <li>There are far better masks on Amazon for similar prices.  </li>
            <li>The picture looks halfway decent, and at $6 plus s/h i thought it would be a little better quality than the cheap $1 masks at the party stores, it is small and is very slightly better than the plastic party store ones</li>
            <li>I originally tried to glue them back on, but the glue made the paint come off of the sides.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could&#x27;ve been better was to make the ribbons slightly longer so that tying them in the back of your own head would be easier.</li>
            <li>the ribbon to tie it around your face was actually very rough and cut the top of my husband&#x27;s ears when he wore it for a test run.</li>
            <li>When I tried to gently try and stretch it out to be normal face shaped....</li>
            <li>Love the black and silver combo.  </li>
            <li>I will however not recommend this particular mask to anyone.</li>
            <li>But on the other side, it does seem very sturdy, and does fit a man&#x27;s face well.</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy at first because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>The tie strap is probably the most frustrating part, but on the whole well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It was definitely well worth the $5 something we paid for it.</li>
            <li>I found no defects with it... and it is made of nice sturdy thick plastic</li>
            <li>So i wound up repainting it, AND  sewing a new elastic piece on</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for a new years masquerade ball.  </li>
            <li>Anywho, I was able to remove the string from one of the halves and attach it to the other half, allowing me to attach one half to my face, kind of making me look like the Phantom of the Opera.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something of higher quality, but this was enough to serve the purpose.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the cheap thing snapped in half upon trying it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a masquerade event and it was a classy hit.  </li>
            <li>so I should be useable for a few years (if you are cheap like me and recycle costume elements from year to year)</li>
            <li>I did buy another last cut also from them that showed up bubble wrapped and very protected.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, you get what you pay for, but don&#x27;t have high expectations with this mask.</li>
            <li>The mask is half black and half silver and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and the masks looked like they were squeezed in to fit in small package.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrive in just a few days, it was also fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>This thing was super narrow.</li>
            <li>Showed up warped and cracked in half when tried to wear it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This mask broke in half when I first pulled it out of the wrapping and put it on my face.  </li>

            <li> This mask broke in half when I first pulled it out of the wrapping and put it on my face.  </li>
            <li> With my natural charm and above average looks, this mask elevated my ambiance to God Status.</li>
            <li> This mask is very durable and thick plastic, The black paint on the one side wasnt very well done.</li>
            <li> The photo clearly shows a black and metallic silver finish, but that is not what I received.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t really show that half of the mask is totally black.</li>
            <li> the mask was a bit too narrow for the face, so i gently tried bending it, it snapped in half...</li>
            <li> I barely touched the mask and it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> It took so long to arrive (like three weeks!)</li>
            <li> Bought for a masquerade ball for my bf (average, adult-sized male).</li>
            <li> I give them a 3 bc the first mask arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> 1 was grey &amp; black, the other was grey  &amp; white.</li>
            <li> The mask arrived in a matte black and white finish.</li>
            <li> Elastic ban should be a selection because the string was difficult to maintain a tight fit.</li>
            <li> It was what we expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered several mask to have a few 2 chose from.</li>
            <li> we spent on it.  </li>
            <li> Plastic was extremely brittle and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do buy- be VERY careful when handling it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was half black</li>
            <li> It split in half before I could even wear it.  </li>
            <li> However, I took a black paint marker and colored it in.</li>
            <li> and it snapped in half.</li>

            <li> Not only did it arrive in just a few days, it was also fantastic quality. I was a little iffy at first because it was so cheap but it has exceeded my expectations! Ty</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent in both quality and fit. Better than the pictures. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Very elegant style mask and unique, that&#x27;s its appeal.  I didn&#x27;t know it was half black, I thought it was all silver, still, nice and will work well with what I need it for.</li>
            <li> Great mask for the price.  It looks good and fits well on the face.  The tie strap is probably the most frustrating part, but on the whole well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice mask, thick durable plastic. The mask is half black and half silver and it looks great. However, the paint isn&#x27;t perfect. I went out and bought a Sharpie Paint Pen and colored in more black to get a nice effect. Overall great construction, I wish the paint was better but I can&#x27;t complain. Very handsome mask</li>
            <li> Showed up warped and cracked in half when tried to wear it for the first time. But it looked nice.</li>
            <li> This mask was made well and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the design and needs to use it for a party or whatever!</li>
            <li> the mask was a bit too narrow for the face, so i gently tried bending it, it snapped in half...</li>
            <li> So the mask looks MOSTLY as pictured.  The dark area was really black, and this thing looked like it had been poorly spray-painted.  But on the other side, it does seem very sturdy, and does fit a man&#x27;s face well.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t really show that half of the mask is totally black. its more like a play toy than a mans mask.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a masquerade event and it was a classy hit.  Cheap price, decent quality, good buy.  It makes me want to go to more mask events so I can use it more.</li>
            <li> Ultra cheap plastic.  Poorly made.  It split in half before I could even wear it.  VERY cheap.  There are far better masks on Amazon for similar prices.  Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> We bought this mask for a masquerade ball. It was very cheaply constructed and painted. There were a few imperfections on the mask itself that we had to try to fix once it arrived and the ribbon to tie it around your face was actually very rough and cut the top of my husband&#x27;s ears when he wore it for a test run. I had to switch it out for some elastic before the ball. Overall, it was an inexpensive mask, and for the deal we got on it, we weren&#x27;t too upset with the quality.</li>
            <li> My husband looked hot in this mask for a Mardi Grad party and it was sturdy too.  Super fun party, and we all looked great thanks to Amazon and it tad bit of glitter.</li>
            <li> Unlike many &amp;#34;one size fits&amp;#34; masks... the nose and cheek area of this mask conform to my face rather nicely for once.  Of course, your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for build quality... not a lot to say, the mask looks nice.. I found no defects with it... and it is made of nice sturdy thick plastic so I should be useable for a few years (if you are cheap like me and recycle costume elements from year to year)</li>
            <li> This mask is very durable and thick plastic, The black paint on the one side wasnt very well done. However, I took a black paint marker and colored it in. I got tons of compliments for this mask, great buy!</li>
            <li> The photo clearly shows a black and metallic silver finish, but that is not what I received. The mask arrived in a matte black and white finish. It literally looks like a poor spray paint job. I am a male (using my gf&#x27;s Amazon account) and the mask does fit well. The bands are made of some type of nylon material that you can tie together. Sewing the band to prevent it from breaking isn&#x27;t a bad idea. Ultimately, you get what you pay for, but don&#x27;t have high expectations with this mask.</li>
            <li> It looks like a mask you would buy at the dollar store. Even though I thought it was inexpensive when I ordered it, now I think it was overpriced, just because of the low quality. The seller shipped the item very quickly. I received my order within 3 days, and I&#x27;m happy about it, since I needed it right away for a party.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these identical masks for my son for his Venetian Masquerade-themed senior prom.  (I purchased two because some of the ratings had indicated that the mask cracked when it was fit to one buyer&#x27;s face and another experienced some displeasure with the coloring.)  Both items were perfect and he received several complements at the prom!  The only thing that could&#x27;ve been better was to make the ribbons slightly longer so that tying them in the back of your own head would be easier.</li>
            <li> It arrived broke in half!! i font know if this happens often or an isolated issue, but im a little disappointed since this was time sensitive!</li>
            <li> I bought and received two of these masks - both were broken in the packaging as soon as I opened the boxes.</li>
            <li> Design was nice and fit my face.  Elastic ban should be a selection because the string was difficult to maintain a tight fit.</li>
            <li> Broke the same day we got it! wasn&#x27;t made well and I will not be buying another one again. Thanks</li>
            <li> The mask looks and feels very cheap. The artwork/painting to depict the fading in of the grey and black colors was poorly executed. You can get better quality masks for the same price if not cheaper. I will however not recommend this particular mask to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great little deal.  Very inexpensive, but well made and comfortable to wear.  The only thing we didn&#x27;t think of is that my fellow wears glasses.  The glasses actually fit on top of the mask (but I wish we&#x27;d thought of that ahead of time.)  Anyway... great price for this inexpensive but well-made mask.</li>
            <li> The mask did not fit my husband&#x27;s face. It looks good though. My son got to wear it at home for fun.</li>
            <li> Bought for a masquerade ball for my bf (average, adult-sized male). Fit fine. Has ribbons to tie on your head, rather than cheap elastic, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Remember you get what you pay for. I opened the package and the masks looked like they were squeezed in to fit in small package. The sides bent in so I tried to unbend it. I barely touched the mask and it snapped in half. I bought 5 more and don&#x27;t even want to use them.</li>
            <li> This thing was super narrow. I doubt it would fit a normal sized adult&#x27;s head. I tried to bend the plastic out so it could fit on my head and it snapped in half. I tried to mend it with electrical tape. I looked stupid at the party and was ashamed. I went home alone that night... and I&#x27;m married.</li>
            <li> Fits great.  good quality mask</li>
            <li> Great design.  A little flimsy.  Looks great on.</li>
            <li> With my natural charm and above average looks, this mask elevated my ambiance to God Status. Wear with swag and confidence.....Gabriel</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for a masquerade ball at my school. He said it was very comfortable. It seemed a little flimsy but it didn&#x27;t break so I thought it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a plastic black and silver mask. My son wore this mask to his school masquerade dance. It was what we expected. Nice quality, he took it on and off several times throughout the night, and had no problems whatsoever. It was definitely well worth the $5 something we paid for it.</li>
            <li> This mask broke in half when I first pulled it out of the wrapping and put it on my face.  Maybe my face is too fat . . . Anywho, I was able to remove the string from one of the halves and attach it to the other half, allowing me to attach one half to my face, kind of making me look like the Phantom of the Opera.  It turned out pretty okay, I&#x27;m just bummed it broke so quickly.</li>
            <li> I give them a 3 bc the first mask arrived broken.  I had to send it back and was refunded.  They didn&#x27;t offer to replace.  I had to re buy the mask.  The second time they decided to add siding into the box so it didn&#x27;t bounce around and break.  Improvement but this should have been done from the beginning.  Since I had to reorder my self and send broken one back bc they didn&#x27;t pal it properly they only get a 3. I did buy another last cut also from them that showed up bubble wrapped and very protected.</li>
            <li> This mask was well made did not look cheap would recommend ordering this mask to anyone ordered several mask this was one of my favorits</li>
            <li> The picture looks halfway decent, and at $6 plus s/h i thought it would be a little better quality than the cheap $1 masks at the party stores, it is small and is very slightly better than the plastic party store ones but it broke in less than 5 minutes of me wearing it...</li>
            <li> My brother got this for a project at school. He said it worked for everything he needed and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the mask was bent inward when we received it. A tiny attempt to spread it out caused it to snap in 2. We were very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product arrived 2 weeks after Mardi Gras although I ordered it a month prior, and it showed up broken.  It was cheap, so  didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but this was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was used for the groom at the bridal shower. My husband painted wedding colors on the mask (lime green) on one side and just outlined the eyes and the swirls, it looked great !!!!</li>
            <li> This was OK. We bought this along with a Laser cut metal one for my daughter and her date for the Year 12 Masquerade Ball. Basic plastic mask but did the job on the night</li>
            <li> The item came damaged, in other words: it was bent, broken. It took so long to arrive (like three weeks!) that I didn&#x27;t even bother trying to send it back or get it replaced. Order at your own discretion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mask for my husband. it came rather quickly and in time for our event, however the strings attached to the mask came off before he could tie them together. I originally tried to glue them back on, but the glue made the paint come off of the sides. So i wound up repainting it, AND  sewing a new elastic piece on so he could slip it on and off without untying. To much work?? i agree. the mask itself seemed sturdy, the paint job done on it was only so/so. but overall it served its purpose and he looked nice in it.</li>
            <li> The mask looks good but when my husband attempted to manipulate it to better frame his face, it broke.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a metallic finish or look, this mask did not have that., (I was disappointed). other than that the quality was good for the price,.  I ordered several mask to have a few 2 chose from. Once I received them, I realized that although the description changed the mask was almost the same. 1 was grey &amp; black, the other was grey  &amp; white. In recommending it I can only say u get what u pay 4. the quality is good however the in person appearance is different from the pic.</li>
            <li> just like in the picture</li>
            <li> It looks nicer in the pic kind of cheap in person I thought it would be a darker shade of gray and a silver but its black and gray</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for a new years masquerade ball.  It looked like cheap plastic, but it would have been okay for the one night he needed it for.  When we got to the party, he went to put it on and it snapped in half.  Bummer- he had no mask for the masquerade :(  Not even worth the ~$4 we spent on it.  If you do buy- be VERY careful when handling it!</li>
            <li> Upon delivery, the sides of the mask were so scrunched to each other, I knew there would be no way of it fitting comfortably on my face.  When I tried to gently try and stretch it out to be normal face shaped....it snapped in two.  Very cheap plastic.  Don&#x27;t even bother with this!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something of higher quality, but this was enough to serve the purpose. I&#x27;ll look for a better one next Halloween.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Colors are awesome. Love the black and silver combo.  The plastic is good quality. The strap is a little week.</li>
            <li> cheap...the mask was so narrow that it would be a better fit for a child&#x27;s face.  Regardless, the cheap thing snapped in half upon trying it on.  Plastic was extremely brittle and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> eye holes are the correct size. wore for several hours at a formal ball. ties in the back instead of an elastic band.</li>
            <li> cheaply made, guess you get what you pay for. The picture makes it look like much better quality than what it is.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and had to return</li>
            <li> It broke before I used it but good product.</li>
