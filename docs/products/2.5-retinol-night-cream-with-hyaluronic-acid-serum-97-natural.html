            <li>I understand what purging is now as I seriously experienced this episode.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and now just hoping it works on my wrinkles night after night.</li>

            <li>The product is just great.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at the difference it makes and how great it feels when I put it on my face.  </li>

            <li>The product does not stink or smell and goes on very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of articles online about retinol cream on some very popular websites (oprah.com, allure.com, etc.).</li>
            <li>This product is ideal in texture -- very pleasant and easy to use, no scent.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Very impressed and pleased with this cream.</li>

            <li>VERY HAPPY WITH RESULTS, WILL BE BUYING THIS AGAIN :)</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The owner of the company requested feedback and even though I am 100% satisfied with this wonderful, effective product, the company is replacing it because of a defective dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product 4 months ago after using another retinol cream that also got good reviews.  </li>
            <li>As you age, it is imperative that you have good skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a good 12 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a good sign when you are using a product for your face.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see any change for the good...</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it felt like a moisturizer after I applied it.</li>
            <li>Amazon is always good .</li>
            <li>It feels good, good smell, I like it.</li>
            <li>Very nice creamy texture goes on well and leaves a nice finish to the touch.</li>
            <li>Key West H&amp;B BEST Retinol  Night Cream is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nice pleasant fragrance and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a tremendous product!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased &amp; this is now my go to product twice a day.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After the chemical peels and micro-dermabrasion my skin felt softer and looked great for about a month but after that the scars got more pronounced again.</li>
            <li>I love it and have experienced results.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact for some reason I have experienced better results than I did with the stronger retinol cream I have by prescription.  </li>
            <li>You can honestly tell the moment you put this retinol cream on your face, that there is a quality, a good amount of retinol in this product.  </li>
            <li>As of right now I am very happy with the product and optimistic that it will deliver.</li>
            <li>It is a very pleasant cream, feels good on the skin, I use it every night with no ill effect.</li>
            <li>Great products and great customer service equals loyal customers and referrals and they do amazing at both.</li>
            <li>I look forward to continuing to use this product and see even better results!</li>
            <li>It comes in a 1.7oz air pump bottle, which I love!</li>
            <li>My favorite was when my mom told me I look well rested!</li>
            <li>I hope it just keeps getting better!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Great product, easy to spread on face and neck.</li>
            <li>I use this amazing retinol cream after steaming my face for 15 minutes for maximum absorption.</li>
            <li>Received my product in just two days in perfect condition and my skin is responding very well to this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream</li>
            <li>My skin gets a nice glow.</li>
            <li>This cream is really nice.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather use it at night since it&#x27;s effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a product to try however all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice bottle, it has a yellowish concentrate texture with a &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I received this product at no charge in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly look forward to putting it on at night.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly without any residue which is great for me since I&#x27;ve been applying it before I go to sleep</li>
            <li>The best thing is I have very sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Amazing customer service, they are very accessible and amazingly helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have gotten so many compliments on my skin :) Try it!</li>
            <li>One of the most effective retinol creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working wonderfully with my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff does as good or better job than the products I got from the doctor and is so easy to get on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it!  </li>

            <li>Amazing product that really works great.  </li>

            <li>I have VERY fair skin and developed a tan and freckles (which is basically sun spots, yuck!)  </li>
            <li>This product is a good value, absorbs quickly and super-effective.  </li>
            <li>I was given this product for free in exchage for my unbiased opinion,  and let me tell you, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to love it the way I do!</li>
            <li>This night cream is a perfect cocktail of 97% natural and 71% organic ingredients that aim at diminishing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and premature aging from sun exposure.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am beginning to see a smoother, better toned skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but never before have I come across anything that works quite like this.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I ordered another bottle to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is a great value.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>maybe needs more time.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My complexion is noticeably more even.</li>
            <li>I do love scents so it had one, it wouldn’t have bothered me.</li>
            <li>I really want to stress that this is a great Retinol Cream for those of you who are looking for more youthful skin.</li>
            <li>My wife was able to try this product for free, the opinions are her own.</li>
            <li>Retinol creams can help with so many things, like wrinkles, clogged pores, and even acne.</li>
            <li>I’ve found that the morning after I use it, my skin looks and feels clearer and more even-toned.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying your retinol cream.  </li>
            <li>You will love the results.</li>
            <li>I also love the company.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency, there are no parabens</li>
            <li>For the money, you can&#x27;t get a better cream.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>I do look forward in the weeks to come to see greater results.</li>
            <li>I love this retinol cream.  </li>
            <li>This Retinol moisturized my skin more then drying it out.</li>
            <li>this product is lovely, its not greasy at all, and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or breakouts at all,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>noticed my skin looking more hydrated, brighter and smoother..  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I needed to use a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Finally the price is what I find the greatest point of it.  </li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>have been hunting for an effective organic, paraben free produce for a while, so</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I am hoping after 4 weeks that my skin will improve even more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>scent aside, I am in love with this product and hopeful of the impact it will have on my complexion if I continue using it.</li>
            <li>skin products for alot more money and their minute results come never come close to these.</li>
            <li>So now, I continue to use this product, my skin looks better and better each week, and I slather my face in sunscreen before I leave the house.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>, it did not irritate my skin which most products do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>I will update after I have time to test it out more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to apply -- 3 pumps cover my face easily</li>
            <li>started using this one and loved it right away.</li>
            <li>but it doesn’t smell as nice or “clean” as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>This product really is amazing, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight &amp; non greasy so skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong, but it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>It is also great knowing it is mostly natural and mostly organic.</li>
            <li>They provide a superior product and back it up with superior service.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results so far and look forward to seeing how much more youthful my skin will continue to look!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just made by a company that makes this cream and just sells it to people who use their own labels for their business.</li>
            <li>Great night cream with natural retinol.</li>
            <li>:) I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>so far I am happy with it ..</li>
            <li>The skin on my neck is also becoming smoother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>and I am overly excited to see how much better my skin can get.</li>
            <li>I am in total awe of how good my skin looks!</li>
            <li>But, it makes up for it with how easy it spreads.</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement in my skin very quickly and it continues to improve.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser pump make for easy application.</li>
            <li>and it is a strong 2.5% retinol.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a strong odor which is also beneficial.</li>
            <li>This product has smoothed out the fine lines around my mouth and eye area.</li>
            <li>Retinol helps to prevent fine lines, wrinkles and firms the skin.</li>
            <li>And I am so lucky I did!</li>
            <li>but I love how quickly it absorbs and the feelings that it has.</li>
            <li>Really have enjoyed this product!  </li>
            <li>Was hoping for some change to my skin by now, as have been applying religiously morning &amp; night for 3 weeks without any noticeable difference, so certainly couldn&#x27;t call it the BEST</li>
            <li>and I see huge differences in my crows feet</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is huge, I am including a picture of it being held so you can see.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t survive exposure to light at all.</li>
            <li>Overall -- great product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product and value.</li>
            <li>Great customer service, would definitely use again.</li>
            <li>(I love to smile-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Key West retinol for about 5 weeks now and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I used it for 6-8 months, skin was smooth, but I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening or clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li>cream feels so light on my skin</li>
            <li>I notice my lines on my forehead started to smooth out</li>
            <li>I got this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li>I got this product because it is silicone free</li>
            <li>which is important to me</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Key West Health &amp; Beauty has a really great product.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s skin now.</li>
            <li>(Believe me, I checked, and even though others said their 2.0% retinol was the highest available, this has 2.5% retinol.)  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I finally found this product!!</li>
            <li>I got to try this (free) for my review.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a wonderful product and while it may not completely remove your fine lines and wrinkles, it&#x27;s the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it has every thing you need and more!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and easily</li>
            <li>To get a product this effective in a high end department store you would probably pay quadruple the price.</li>
            <li>I love the pump bottle, so you can easily dispense just as much as you need.</li>
            <li>For those starting for acne, I would start 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase and be sure to use a topical blemish spot treatment, and you will be sooo happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>And I am a peace knowing it is mostly organic haha!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Ive only been using this for about 2 weeks so far but let me tell you this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle, organic and good for your skin, and has both short- and long-term benefits.</li>
            <li>My skin looks good, feels smooth, and I&#x27;ve been complimented on my complexion several times.</li>
            <li>This is by far a better product!  </li>
            <li>She reports that her skin feels silky smooth and she is experiencing some dead skin flaking off but is very happy with how much finer and smoother the newer areas look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will continue to use this product because it really improves her skin.</li>
            <li>If miracles could come true, one did for me while using this product.</li>
            <li>I read a bunch of reviews on the company and the product before I purchased, and everything I read stood true.  </li>
            <li>I will give a full review after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am really loving this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>Not only does the name make me want to go on vacation; it is 40 degrees in Cincinnati right now, but it also makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>This particular retinol cream has a very light scent that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>skin is more moist and dewy; my pores appear smaller and my skin appears to have tightened up (or maybe it&#x27;s just that the skin is more plumped up with moisture) but it has reduced sagging and wrinkles for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a question about using it under the eyes and got a quick response from the owner.  </li>
            <li>When I received the above cream it felt nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, effective, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>This company provides an all natural (mostly organic) product with the highest amount of retinol available OTC.  </li>
            <li>Received the order quickly ...</li>
            <li>It also feels very light and gentle, which I love because my face is sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores.  </li>
            <li>I still am healing from those two weeks with a few marks and hints of the breakout,  but it is like the calming after the storm where you can see the beautiful sunlight ahead.</li>
            <li>I have experienced none of the dryness or irritation I have experienced with other retinol products, and I have been using this every night for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>However....I stuck with it and got passed it and everything is healing with no new breakouts and my skin is GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>(married 5 years) to see me!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li>But to my surpirse and happiness I have new clear skin below and the spot doesnt show even an inkling of returning.</li>
            <li>I had no flaking, dry spots, redness, nothing but smooth hydrated, and most important, unwrinkled skin.   </li>
            <li>I have very dry, fair, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that no true retinol product can be kept in a clear bottle like this since retinol is incredibly photosensitive.</li>
            <li>My huge line in my forehead is almost completely gone, and the fine lines around my eyes have dissapeared.</li>
            <li>I am aware that retinol can cause sunburns specially with extended sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I know anyone can buy lotion bases on line and add different actives and make their own lotion to sell.</li>
            <li>I also read that if you stick with it, it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The product is a nice moisturizer but for $38,&lt;br /&gt;you can buy a lot of equally moistureizing face creams.</li>
            <li>I can see a nice difference in my skin, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>I have good skin but lately after use getting more compliments.</li>
            <li>I would say that it is nice addition to the various skin care products I already use .</li>
            <li>: I received this item complimentary to review this item.</li>
            <li>I have used vitamin C creams with some success, but this has shown no difference what so ever.</li>
            <li>It works b/c retinol always makes my skin feel different when it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>This helps to make her skin look more natural</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t thin either to where it doesn&#x27;t do its job, its the perfect texture.  </li>
            <li>The Key West Health &amp; Beauty 2.5% Retinol Cream came in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li>The cream was not greasy at all and absorbed into the skin rapidly and did not leave any sticky after effect on the skin.</li>
            <li>That is because leaving it on and going out in the sun makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight exposure.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I understand skin care takes time, and finding the right product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li>and it absorbs pretty quickly, leaving my skin moisturized without feeling at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Also it absorbs pretty quick into your skin.</li>
            <li>and so my skin does not do well with many skin care products; My facial skin either gets easily clogged up or left dehydrated with a layer of oily residue that just sits on top of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a difference right away</li>
            <li>so this cream had the right amount of retinol to help my skin without over drying it.</li>
            <li>I emailed the company with a question about the product and they answered right away.  </li>
            <li>Another thing is the lines on the right side of my mouth are smoothing out.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m in the retinol purge period</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job and the price was right.</li>
            <li>product feels so creamy that it is tempting to stop right there.</li>
            <li>glad I try it, since using the Retinol Cream together with my Pure Body Natural Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is has an easy to use pump that doesn&#x27;t leave residue around the top like a lot of other pumps do.</li>
            <li>Key west health &amp; beauty&#x27;s night cream is a great product that is designed to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles, and bags under your eyes when used as directed.</li>
            <li>I have been using it regularly for 2 weeks and in that short time have seen great improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out her face, instead it makes her look more youthful.</li>
            <li>They really care about your results and check up on you, offer tips and are quick to respond to questions about the lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t harsh like alot of its competitors.</li>
            <li>our hormones and skin changes and retinol will very much help this.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I have a very high end job and meeting with clients with a face covered in pimples-AHH!  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product and will be buying more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>Those interested in acne results, keep reading!:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>During a Diamond Microdermabrasion last week my esthetician told me my skin looked better than ever.</li>
            <li>It does make a difference, and many women that are younger ask me what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li>and my skin has a smooth and clear appearance.  </li>
            <li>I intend to order more as I’m running low now.</li>
            <li>but I could tell the difference when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I apply it faithfully and within the first two weeks</li>
            <li>First go this for my wife, but then I stole it.</li>
            <li>because I thought I needed a higher percentage of&lt;br /&gt;retinol</li>
            <li>You are getting more product for the same price as the 1oz sizes.   </li>
            <li>Many of the smaller wrinkles have disapeared.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad because I know it will last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After the first week I noticed that my skin was a lot softer.</li>
            <li>I read something online that made me realize I was using too MUCH product!  </li>
            <li>This actually made my skin look better than anything I&#x27;ve done.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and will definitely keep using.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream consistently at night for about a month.</li>
            <li>this makes it feel smooth, and soft</li>
            <li>I love the Retinol Night Cream by Key West Health and Beauty because it addresses all my concern:</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I first cleanse my face and then apply the product.</li>
            <li>Made skin seem clear and blemish free, cleared up brown spots, would definately buy this again.</li>
            <li>But as for this Retinol Cream, it does neither: When I apply the cream it quickly gets absorbed into my face leaving my face well moisturized with no heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>I fully intend to continue respecting retinol as a key ingredient in skin care products and believe Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream delivers as a quality product that is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I won&#x27;t buy any other face cream.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a little soon to see much difference in the lines on my face, but it feels good on my skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I love natural cosmetics that won’t do much damage to your skin due to toxic chemicals we find in most of them.</li>
            <li>It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t take long at all to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>As a general moisturizer its fine thought.</li>
            <li>It comes in a great size: 1.7 fl oz/50 ml, which is much bigger than other creams I’ve had.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that I could afford to purchase each month as I plan on using it pretty much</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t seem very strong compared to other retinol products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>but it clearly shows it&#x27;s working as a good quality retinol product should) but not irritating at all due to the encapsulated retinol.</li>
            <li>I am following the directions/suggestions written by the manufacturer and find this Night Cream easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was already using a retinol cream so changing to Key West was an easy transition.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry face like most retinol creams do.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a higher percentage of retinol.</li>
            <li>After using this cream for nearly 2 months, there&#x27;s a tremendous difference in the texture and firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I find that most creams make my skin feel sticky or dry</li>
            <li>Strong and effective (gives me some slight dryness and flaking the next day - I&#x27;ve just used it twice</li>
            <li>Since my last review, my wrinkles have gone from pretty much faded, to many of them completely gone!    </li>
            <li>and it certainly seems to suit my skin.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the Good N Natural retinol cream in jars.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and fine lines and wrinkles diminished.</li>
            <li>I do believe my pores are smaller; fine lines?  </li>
            <li>I use this cream every morning, and I see a definite improvement in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS when I go outside, but because my skin seemed fine, I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The scars on my cheeks are very noticeable as they are large and pitted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 &amp; have been blessed with pretty good skin, but the delicate skin just under my eyes was becoming slightly loose from my habitual eye rubbing.</li>
            <li>In combination with Tamanu Oil, my face is much smoother, as it has reduced the size of my acne scarring / pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Expected the pump to work better.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Although the cream came very well packaged and delivered on time I am very disapointed in the cream .</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I can not believe how fast this works.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t notice much of an effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Also, I discovered something by accident that really helped.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work</li>
            <li>I am REALLY noticing a difference with this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night, and I have found&lt;br /&gt;that gently massaging the Retinol Cream into my face and problem areas on my face,  also helps.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important that retinol be used only at night and then removed from your skin in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and have been loving how it makes my skin both look and feel.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft, smooth, even and I now have a natural glow.</li>
            <li>First of all, the product arrived early and was exactly what it stated it would be on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I received Key West Retinol Night Cream two days ago, and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also twice as large as other bottles of retinol cream (and priced a lot better).</li>
            <li>I have been reading about how important retinol is for older skin, so I began researching the different brands/prices.  </li>
            <li>have been using this for a few weeks straight, and I have noticed that my skin has become much more radiant, the dry spots are clearing up, and my skin just looks so much more youthful.</li>
            <li>and she is really liking this particular product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and my skin looks better then it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>and I see that the problem area, my top lip, has improved and the lines are much softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for only 2weeks now and while my fine lines and bags have not disappeared completely, I can see a hugh difference from before I started using it.</li>
            <li>help with moisture retention on my face, eradicating what fine lines I have on my face and a formula that will work with my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In between the different product I use, I let each product absorb first before applying another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream has a creamy texture but absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used other retinol creams and always experienced a slight burning .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent sized product and moisturizers quite well.</li>
            <li>Then i read the ingredient list on the back of the container, which they don&#x27;t show you when purchasing over the internet or Amazon, and sure enough retinol was NOT even listed as an ingredient...which explains why the product does not work.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly like that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could do anything more than my current skin care regimen (and diet) that would make a difference enough to see....</li>
            <li>as I get older, without going through a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>After the 2nd week I could see that my overall skin tone was getting better.</li>
            <li>Really liking it so far!</li>
            <li>So, I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a high end cream but at an affordable price point.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to use it if you have oily skin and acne because retinol helps to prevent breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone who is on the fence, to try this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>have used all of the high end &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Kind of similar to other retinol product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product works very well, and contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This has really helped clear up the discoloration/sun spots/overall dullness of my complexion.  </li>
            <li>If you’re one of those moms who want to try to go green, and not only with what you eat, reaching for the Key West’s line of organic products would be a great start.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, not a heavy perfume but</li>
            <li>I believe this product has really helped clear up some of the discoloration issues that I suffer from and lessened some of the wrinkles that I have started to notice popping up here</li>
            <li>i normally don&#x27;t take the time to write any reviews.  </li>
            <li>For the price you pay for this, I definitely think you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff works so well that my skin got quite red out in the spring sunshine right after I began using it.  </li>
            <li>It is very cost effective with a little going a long way.</li>
            <li>Not bad if you are just looking for a night cream but after several years of applying real retinol on my skin daily, I understand what retinol does and how your skin should respond to it.  </li>
            <li>It seems that all the new products that I am using just seem to be working together perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use less makeup, other wise you could look too made up.</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t understand why I looked so red, as I normally would not burn like that</li>
            <li>I love this cream most because it is NOT full of icky chemicals and unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>i have had no problems with peeling or and rashes, which for me, I am very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, rubs in well, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized after.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>The one she offered me was loaded with so many other ingredients and was tested on animals (big no no for me), so I started doing research and found this</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This Retinol Cream that I received, at no cost, from Key West Health &amp; Beauty is exactly what I’m looking for in beauty products.</li>
            <li>You really can use this anytime, but I’ve been using it mainly at night for personal preference.</li>
            <li>I am in my 50s and always have had supple soft skin most likely due to genes and never using soap on my face.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a retinol cream to help with fine lines &amp; even had my doctor write me a prescription for Retin-A (which I never filled).</li>
            <li>I also am noticing the marks of neck creases not going away when my neck is straight (dagger!), but nothing more or less than a typical gal my age.  </li>
            <li>This creamy cream is a a little heavy for me, but i&#x27;m oil skin, but definitely good absorbtion tho.</li>
            <li>basically clear themselves out</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to see if it would help clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so clear -</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother than ever and so clear.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>My face glows and is so soft.</li>
            <li>I am 56 year old and it is mandatory that I use a retinol product at night.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and my face shows it.  </li>
            <li>this is a natural product and is run by a family based company.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 49 years young.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also made of natural organic ingredients with no alcohol or parabens</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars, but the container is not see thru so you cannot tell how much cream is left in the bottle</li>
            <li>Any time I can use natural and organic products, I feel like I’m doing my skin and body</li>
            <li>THIS IS 50+ YEARS OLD WOMEN.  </li>
            <li>This retinol cream is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn’t contain any perfume since, like I said, the product is natural.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks a lot healthier.</li>
            <li>After reading that too much retinol can affect your skin that way, I cut back to once a day.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Maybe too early to see any results?</li>
            <li>I wake up with glowing, soft skin.</li>
            <li>the ones I have are enough to get me very concerned about what skin care products to use.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft.</li>
            <li>5 star rating as far as product efficiency.</li>
            <li>One “pump” worth of cream was enough to do my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a full review.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s slowly but surely working on my biggest problem areas.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this cream, the brown spot actually became dry and then flaked off, which at first scared me!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I am amazed by the difference I see after only six weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the appearance, health and texture of their skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  not only this product</li>
            <li>After my morning shower, I apply my normal serum product and then the Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream.</li>
            <li>This was a half hour after I used the product the first day!</li>
            <li>I started using this cream and not only have my crows feet started to disappear, but the skin on my face shows new life.  </li>
            <li>I recently changed up my skincare routine, added in some new products, this being one of them.</li>
            <li>I like how only 1 pump of the cream is enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical in the beginning before using the product as I have a very oily skin, large pores and prone to acne with the usage of any kind of cream, so I stick to water based serums mostly.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>No other product has ever done that</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>Retinol is one of the things that I look for when purchasing night time creams, as I am in my mid thirties and require a little help with the fine lines that I am starting to notice.</li>
            <li>If you use it daily over a long period of time it can do everything from smoothing wrinkles, fading blotches, reduce scarring &amp; large pores and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other positive aspect of this product is that it does not cause my skin</li>
            <li>Oh, and I do appreciate simple and clear instructions.</li>
            <li>It does not make my skin  red, even though I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I changed to Key West because it&#x27;s a natural product with no nasties</li>
            <li>and I only used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old Female with combination skin.</li>
            <li>There were no rough spots.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin, and the older</li>
            <li>I had used prescription retinoids in the past (diluted and combined with creams) and they did benefit my skin, but they were always full of things like parabens and were a hassle to get since I had to go to the doctor and pay a lot for them.</li>
            <li>I have used other face creams in the past and while effective I found them to be more expensive than this one</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my breakouts are becoming less and less as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (with a day off in between) but my skin clarity and tone have already noticeably improved, and the pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>One in particular which I had spent a lot of money on, did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually report back how I feel about a product, but since I&#x27;ve tried other Retinol night creams (and paid MORE), I want to this time.  </li>
            <li>the hollow lines around the eyes are being to fill in with new collagen.</li>
            <li>During the first few weeks of using retinol product you are likely to breakout as rapid cell turnover causes clearing out of junk that was in pores.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream fairly consistently for a few months and it helped my facial skin stay smooth, replenished and moisturized without leaving a heavy oily mess on my face.</li>
            <li>And, by the way, this company offers a full money-back guarantee if you are not happy with the product, which just added to my confidence in purchasing from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.  </li>
            <li>The last time I ordered I went with entirely different brand because I&#x27;m tired of paying so much when I can get exactly the same ingredients in a different brand.</li>

            <li> It goes on very nicely and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The owner of the company requested feedback and even though I am 100% satisfied with this wonderful, effective product, the company is replacing it because of a defective dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product 4 months ago after using another retinol cream that also got good reviews.  </li>
            <li> As you age, it is imperative that you have good skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a good 12 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a good sign when you are using a product for your face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any change for the good...</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it felt like a moisturizer after I applied it.</li>
            <li> Amazon is always good .</li>
            <li> It feels good, good smell, I like it.</li>
            <li> Very nice creamy texture goes on well and leaves a nice finish to the touch.</li>
            <li> Key West H&amp;B BEST Retinol  Night Cream is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice pleasant fragrance and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a tremendous product!!!</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After the chemical peels and micro-dermabrasion my skin felt softer and looked great for about a month but after that the scars got more pronounced again.</li>
            <li> I love it and have experienced results.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact for some reason I have experienced better results than I did with the stronger retinol cream I have by prescription.  </li>
            <li> You can honestly tell the moment you put this retinol cream on your face, that there is a quality, a good amount of retinol in this product.  </li>
            <li> As of right now I am very happy with the product and optimistic that it will deliver.</li>
            <li> It is a very pleasant cream, feels good on the skin, I use it every night with no ill effect.</li>
            <li> Great products and great customer service equals loyal customers and referrals and they do amazing at both.</li>
            <li> I look forward to continuing to use this product and see even better results!</li>
            <li> It comes in a 1.7oz air pump bottle, which I love!</li>
            <li> My favorite was when my mom told me I look well rested!</li>

            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Great product, easy to spread on face and neck.</li>

            <li> This cream is really nice.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather use it at night since it&#x27;s effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received a product to try however all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice bottle, it has a yellowish concentrate texture with a &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I received this product at no charge in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly look forward to putting it on at night.  </li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly without any residue which is great for me since I&#x27;ve been applying it before I go to sleep</li>
            <li> The best thing is I have very sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service, they are very accessible and amazingly helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I have gotten so many compliments on my skin :) Try it!</li>
            <li> One of the most effective retinol creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working wonderfully with my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff does as good or better job than the products I got from the doctor and is so easy to get on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product is a good value, absorbs quickly and super-effective.  </li>
            <li> I was given this product for free in exchage for my unbiased opinion,  and let me tell you, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to love it the way I do!</li>
            <li> This night cream is a perfect cocktail of 97% natural and 71% organic ingredients that aim at diminishing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and premature aging from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am beginning to see a smoother, better toned skin.  </li>

            <li> love it, will buy it again</li>

            <li> I ordered another bottle to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is a great value.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  </li>

            <li> My complexion is noticeably more even.</li>
            <li> I do love scents so it had one, it wouldn’t have bothered me.</li>
            <li> I really want to stress that this is a great Retinol Cream for those of you who are looking for more youthful skin.</li>
            <li> My wife was able to try this product for free, the opinions are her own.</li>
            <li> Retinol creams can help with so many things, like wrinkles, clogged pores, and even acne.</li>
            <li> I’ve found that the morning after I use it, my skin looks and feels clearer and more even-toned.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying your retinol cream.  </li>
            <li> You will love the results.</li>
            <li> I also love the company.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency, there are no parabens</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t get a better cream.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I do look forward in the weeks to come to see greater results.</li>
            <li> I love this retinol cream.  </li>
            <li> This Retinol moisturized my skin more then drying it out.</li>
            <li> this product is lovely, its not greasy at all, and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or breakouts at all,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> noticed my skin looking more hydrated, brighter and smoother..  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I needed to use a lot more.  </li>
            <li> Finally the price is what I find the greatest point of it.  </li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> have been hunting for an effective organic, paraben free produce for a while, so</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I am hoping after 4 weeks that my skin will improve even more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> scent aside, I am in love with this product and hopeful of the impact it will have on my complexion if I continue using it.</li>
            <li> skin products for alot more money and their minute results come never come close to these.</li>
            <li> So now, I continue to use this product, my skin looks better and better each week, and I slather my face in sunscreen before I leave the house.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> , it did not irritate my skin which most products do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> I will update after I have time to test it out more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to apply -- 3 pumps cover my face easily</li>
            <li> started using this one and loved it right away.</li>
            <li> but it doesn’t smell as nice or “clean” as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> This product really is amazing, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight &amp; non greasy so skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong, but it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> It is also great knowing it is mostly natural and mostly organic.</li>
            <li> They provide a superior product and back it up with superior service.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results so far and look forward to seeing how much more youthful my skin will continue to look!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just made by a company that makes this cream and just sells it to people who use their own labels for their business.</li>
            <li> Great night cream with natural retinol.</li>
            <li> :) I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> so far I am happy with it ..</li>
            <li> The skin on my neck is also becoming smoother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> and I am overly excited to see how much better my skin can get.</li>
            <li> I am in total awe of how good my skin looks!</li>
            <li> But, it makes up for it with how easy it spreads.</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement in my skin very quickly and it continues to improve.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser pump make for easy application.</li>
            <li> and it is a strong 2.5% retinol.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a strong odor which is also beneficial.</li>
            <li> This product has smoothed out the fine lines around my mouth and eye area.</li>
            <li> Retinol helps to prevent fine lines, wrinkles and firms the skin.</li>
            <li> And I am so lucky I did!</li>
            <li> but I love how quickly it absorbs and the feelings that it has.</li>
            <li> Really have enjoyed this product!  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for some change to my skin by now, as have been applying religiously morning &amp; night for 3 weeks without any noticeable difference, so certainly couldn&#x27;t call it the BEST</li>
            <li> and I see huge differences in my crows feet</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is huge, I am including a picture of it being held so you can see.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t survive exposure to light at all.</li>
            <li> Overall -- great product.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product and value.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, would definitely use again.</li>
            <li> (I love to smile-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Key West retinol for about 5 weeks now and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6-8 months, skin was smooth, but I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening or clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li> cream feels so light on my skin</li>
            <li> I notice my lines on my forehead started to smooth out</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it is silicone free</li>
            <li> which is important to me</li>
            <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Key West Health &amp; Beauty has a really great product.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s skin now.</li>
            <li> (Believe me, I checked, and even though others said their 2.0% retinol was the highest available, this has 2.5% retinol.)  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I finally found this product!!</li>
            <li> I got to try this (free) for my review.</li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a wonderful product and while it may not completely remove your fine lines and wrinkles, it&#x27;s the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it has every thing you need and more!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and easily</li>
            <li> To get a product this effective in a high end department store you would probably pay quadruple the price.</li>
            <li> I love the pump bottle, so you can easily dispense just as much as you need.</li>
            <li> For those starting for acne, I would start 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase and be sure to use a topical blemish spot treatment, and you will be sooo happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> And I am a peace knowing it is mostly organic haha!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Ive only been using this for about 2 weeks so far but let me tell you this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle, organic and good for your skin, and has both short- and long-term benefits.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good, feels smooth, and I&#x27;ve been complimented on my complexion several times.</li>
            <li> This is by far a better product!  </li>
            <li> She reports that her skin feels silky smooth and she is experiencing some dead skin flaking off but is very happy with how much finer and smoother the newer areas look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will continue to use this product because it really improves her skin.</li>
            <li> If miracles could come true, one did for me while using this product.</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews on the company and the product before I purchased, and everything I read stood true.  </li>
            <li> I will give a full review after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am really loving this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> Not only does the name make me want to go on vacation; it is 40 degrees in Cincinnati right now, but it also makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> This particular retinol cream has a very light scent that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> skin is more moist and dewy; my pores appear smaller and my skin appears to have tightened up (or maybe it&#x27;s just that the skin is more plumped up with moisture) but it has reduced sagging and wrinkles for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a question about using it under the eyes and got a quick response from the owner.  </li>
            <li> When I received the above cream it felt nice and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, effective, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li> This company provides an all natural (mostly organic) product with the highest amount of retinol available OTC.  </li>
            <li> Received the order quickly ...</li>
            <li> It also feels very light and gentle, which I love because my face is sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores.  </li>
            <li> I still am healing from those two weeks with a few marks and hints of the breakout,  but it is like the calming after the storm where you can see the beautiful sunlight ahead.</li>
            <li> I have experienced none of the dryness or irritation I have experienced with other retinol products, and I have been using this every night for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> However....I stuck with it and got passed it and everything is healing with no new breakouts and my skin is GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> (married 5 years) to see me!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li> But to my surpirse and happiness I have new clear skin below and the spot doesnt show even an inkling of returning.</li>
            <li> I had no flaking, dry spots, redness, nothing but smooth hydrated, and most important, unwrinkled skin.   </li>
            <li> I have very dry, fair, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that no true retinol product can be kept in a clear bottle like this since retinol is incredibly photosensitive.</li>
            <li> My huge line in my forehead is almost completely gone, and the fine lines around my eyes have dissapeared.</li>
            <li> I am aware that retinol can cause sunburns specially with extended sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I know anyone can buy lotion bases on line and add different actives and make their own lotion to sell.</li>
            <li> I also read that if you stick with it, it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The product is a nice moisturizer but for $38,&lt;br /&gt;you can buy a lot of equally moistureizing face creams.</li>
            <li> I can see a nice difference in my skin, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have good skin but lately after use getting more compliments.</li>
            <li> I would say that it is nice addition to the various skin care products I already use .</li>
            <li> : I received this item complimentary to review this item.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C creams with some success, but this has shown no difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> It works b/c retinol always makes my skin feel different when it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> This helps to make her skin look more natural</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t thin either to where it doesn&#x27;t do its job, its the perfect texture.  </li>
            <li> The Key West Health &amp; Beauty 2.5% Retinol Cream came in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li> The cream was not greasy at all and absorbed into the skin rapidly and did not leave any sticky after effect on the skin.</li>
            <li> That is because leaving it on and going out in the sun makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight exposure.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I understand skin care takes time, and finding the right product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> and it absorbs pretty quickly, leaving my skin moisturized without feeling at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Also it absorbs pretty quick into your skin.</li>
            <li> and so my skin does not do well with many skin care products; My facial skin either gets easily clogged up or left dehydrated with a layer of oily residue that just sits on top of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference right away</li>
            <li> so this cream had the right amount of retinol to help my skin without over drying it.</li>
            <li> I emailed the company with a question about the product and they answered right away.  </li>
            <li> Another thing is the lines on the right side of my mouth are smoothing out.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m in the retinol purge period</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job and the price was right.</li>
            <li> product feels so creamy that it is tempting to stop right there.</li>
            <li> glad I try it, since using the Retinol Cream together with my Pure Body Natural Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is has an easy to use pump that doesn&#x27;t leave residue around the top like a lot of other pumps do.</li>
            <li> Key west health &amp; beauty&#x27;s night cream is a great product that is designed to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles, and bags under your eyes when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly for 2 weeks and in that short time have seen great improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out her face, instead it makes her look more youthful.</li>
            <li> They really care about your results and check up on you, offer tips and are quick to respond to questions about the lotion.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t harsh like alot of its competitors.</li>
            <li> our hormones and skin changes and retinol will very much help this.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I have a very high end job and meeting with clients with a face covered in pimples-AHH!  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product and will be buying more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Those interested in acne results, keep reading!:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> During a Diamond Microdermabrasion last week my esthetician told me my skin looked better than ever.</li>
            <li> It does make a difference, and many women that are younger ask me what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> and my skin has a smooth and clear appearance.  </li>
            <li> I intend to order more as I’m running low now.</li>
            <li> but I could tell the difference when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I apply it faithfully and within the first two weeks</li>
            <li> First go this for my wife, but then I stole it.</li>
            <li> because I thought I needed a higher percentage of&lt;br /&gt;retinol</li>
            <li> You are getting more product for the same price as the 1oz sizes.   </li>
            <li> Many of the smaller wrinkles have disapeared.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad because I know it will last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After the first week I noticed that my skin was a lot softer.</li>
            <li> I read something online that made me realize I was using too MUCH product!  </li>
            <li> This actually made my skin look better than anything I&#x27;ve done.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and will definitely keep using.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream consistently at night for about a month.</li>
            <li> this makes it feel smooth, and soft</li>
            <li> I love the Retinol Night Cream by Key West Health and Beauty because it addresses all my concern:</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I first cleanse my face and then apply the product.</li>
            <li> Made skin seem clear and blemish free, cleared up brown spots, would definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> But as for this Retinol Cream, it does neither: When I apply the cream it quickly gets absorbed into my face leaving my face well moisturized with no heavy residue.  </li>
            <li> I fully intend to continue respecting retinol as a key ingredient in skin care products and believe Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream delivers as a quality product that is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I won&#x27;t buy any other face cream.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little soon to see much difference in the lines on my face, but it feels good on my skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I love natural cosmetics that won’t do much damage to your skin due to toxic chemicals we find in most of them.</li>
            <li> It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t take long at all to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> As a general moisturizer its fine thought.</li>
            <li> It comes in a great size: 1.7 fl oz/50 ml, which is much bigger than other creams I’ve had.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that I could afford to purchase each month as I plan on using it pretty much</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t seem very strong compared to other retinol products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> but it clearly shows it&#x27;s working as a good quality retinol product should) but not irritating at all due to the encapsulated retinol.</li>
            <li> I am following the directions/suggestions written by the manufacturer and find this Night Cream easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was already using a retinol cream so changing to Key West was an easy transition.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry face like most retinol creams do.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a higher percentage of retinol.</li>
            <li> After using this cream for nearly 2 months, there&#x27;s a tremendous difference in the texture and firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I find that most creams make my skin feel sticky or dry</li>
            <li> Strong and effective (gives me some slight dryness and flaking the next day - I&#x27;ve just used it twice</li>
            <li> Since my last review, my wrinkles have gone from pretty much faded, to many of them completely gone!    </li>
            <li> and it certainly seems to suit my skin.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the Good N Natural retinol cream in jars.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and fine lines and wrinkles diminished.</li>
            <li> I do believe my pores are smaller; fine lines?  </li>
            <li> I use this cream every morning, and I see a definite improvement in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS when I go outside, but because my skin seemed fine, I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The scars on my cheeks are very noticeable as they are large and pitted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 &amp; have been blessed with pretty good skin, but the delicate skin just under my eyes was becoming slightly loose from my habitual eye rubbing.</li>
            <li> In combination with Tamanu Oil, my face is much smoother, as it has reduced the size of my acne scarring / pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Expected the pump to work better.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Although the cream came very well packaged and delivered on time I am very disapointed in the cream .</li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how fast this works.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t notice much of an effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Also, I discovered something by accident that really helped.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work</li>
            <li> I am REALLY noticing a difference with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night, and I have found&lt;br /&gt;that gently massaging the Retinol Cream into my face and problem areas on my face,  also helps.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important that retinol be used only at night and then removed from your skin in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and have been loving how it makes my skin both look and feel.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft, smooth, even and I now have a natural glow.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product arrived early and was exactly what it stated it would be on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I received Key West Retinol Night Cream two days ago, and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also twice as large as other bottles of retinol cream (and priced a lot better).</li>
            <li> I have been reading about how important retinol is for older skin, so I began researching the different brands/prices.  </li>
            <li> have been using this for a few weeks straight, and I have noticed that my skin has become much more radiant, the dry spots are clearing up, and my skin just looks so much more youthful.</li>
            <li> and she is really liking this particular product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and my skin looks better then it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> and I see that the problem area, my top lip, has improved and the lines are much softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for only 2weeks now and while my fine lines and bags have not disappeared completely, I can see a hugh difference from before I started using it.</li>
            <li> help with moisture retention on my face, eradicating what fine lines I have on my face and a formula that will work with my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In between the different product I use, I let each product absorb first before applying another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream has a creamy texture but absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used other retinol creams and always experienced a slight burning .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent sized product and moisturizers quite well.</li>
            <li> Then i read the ingredient list on the back of the container, which they don&#x27;t show you when purchasing over the internet or Amazon, and sure enough retinol was NOT even listed as an ingredient...which explains why the product does not work.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly like that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could do anything more than my current skin care regimen (and diet) that would make a difference enough to see....</li>
            <li> as I get older, without going through a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> After the 2nd week I could see that my overall skin tone was getting better.</li>
            <li> Really liking it so far!</li>
            <li> So, I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Feels like a high end cream but at an affordable price point.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to use it if you have oily skin and acne because retinol helps to prevent breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone who is on the fence, to try this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> have used all of the high end &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Kind of similar to other retinol product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product works very well, and contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This has really helped clear up the discoloration/sun spots/overall dullness of my complexion.  </li>
            <li> If you’re one of those moms who want to try to go green, and not only with what you eat, reaching for the Key West’s line of organic products would be a great start.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, not a heavy perfume but</li>
            <li> I believe this product has really helped clear up some of the discoloration issues that I suffer from and lessened some of the wrinkles that I have started to notice popping up here</li>
            <li> i normally don&#x27;t take the time to write any reviews.  </li>
            <li> For the price you pay for this, I definitely think you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff works so well that my skin got quite red out in the spring sunshine right after I began using it.  </li>
            <li> It is very cost effective with a little going a long way.</li>
            <li> Not bad if you are just looking for a night cream but after several years of applying real retinol on my skin daily, I understand what retinol does and how your skin should respond to it.  </li>
            <li> It seems that all the new products that I am using just seem to be working together perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use less makeup, other wise you could look too made up.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t understand why I looked so red, as I normally would not burn like that</li>
            <li> I love this cream most because it is NOT full of icky chemicals and unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very sensitive to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> i have had no problems with peeling or and rashes, which for me, I am very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, rubs in well, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized after.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> The one she offered me was loaded with so many other ingredients and was tested on animals (big no no for me), so I started doing research and found this</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This Retinol Cream that I received, at no cost, from Key West Health &amp; Beauty is exactly what I’m looking for in beauty products.</li>
            <li> You really can use this anytime, but I’ve been using it mainly at night for personal preference.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50s and always have had supple soft skin most likely due to genes and never using soap on my face.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a retinol cream to help with fine lines &amp; even had my doctor write me a prescription for Retin-A (which I never filled).</li>
            <li> I also am noticing the marks of neck creases not going away when my neck is straight (dagger!), but nothing more or less than a typical gal my age.  </li>
            <li> This creamy cream is a a little heavy for me, but i&#x27;m oil skin, but definitely good absorbtion tho.</li>
            <li> basically clear themselves out</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to see if it would help clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so clear -</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother than ever and so clear.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> My face glows and is so soft.</li>
            <li> I am 56 year old and it is mandatory that I use a retinol product at night.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and my face shows it.  </li>
            <li> this is a natural product and is run by a family based company.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 49 years young.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also made of natural organic ingredients with no alcohol or parabens</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars, but the container is not see thru so you cannot tell how much cream is left in the bottle</li>
            <li> Any time I can use natural and organic products, I feel like I’m doing my skin and body</li>
            <li> THIS IS 50+ YEARS OLD WOMEN.  </li>
            <li> This retinol cream is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn’t contain any perfume since, like I said, the product is natural.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> After reading that too much retinol can affect your skin that way, I cut back to once a day.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Maybe too early to see any results?</li>
            <li> I wake up with glowing, soft skin.</li>
            <li> the ones I have are enough to get me very concerned about what skin care products to use.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft.</li>
            <li> 5 star rating as far as product efficiency.</li>
            <li> One “pump” worth of cream was enough to do my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a full review.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly but surely working on my biggest problem areas.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this cream, the brown spot actually became dry and then flaked off, which at first scared me!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I am amazed by the difference I see after only six weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the appearance, health and texture of their skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  not only this product</li>
            <li> After my morning shower, I apply my normal serum product and then the Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream.</li>
            <li> This was a half hour after I used the product the first day!</li>
            <li> I started using this cream and not only have my crows feet started to disappear, but the skin on my face shows new life.  </li>
            <li> I recently changed up my skincare routine, added in some new products, this being one of them.</li>
            <li> I like how only 1 pump of the cream is enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical in the beginning before using the product as I have a very oily skin, large pores and prone to acne with the usage of any kind of cream, so I stick to water based serums mostly.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> No other product has ever done that</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Retinol is one of the things that I look for when purchasing night time creams, as I am in my mid thirties and require a little help with the fine lines that I am starting to notice.</li>
            <li> If you use it daily over a long period of time it can do everything from smoothing wrinkles, fading blotches, reduce scarring &amp; large pores and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other positive aspect of this product is that it does not cause my skin</li>
            <li> Oh, and I do appreciate simple and clear instructions.</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin  red, even though I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I changed to Key West because it&#x27;s a natural product with no nasties</li>
            <li> and I only used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old Female with combination skin.</li>
            <li> There were no rough spots.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin, and the older</li>
            <li> I had used prescription retinoids in the past (diluted and combined with creams) and they did benefit my skin, but they were always full of things like parabens and were a hassle to get since I had to go to the doctor and pay a lot for them.</li>
            <li> I have used other face creams in the past and while effective I found them to be more expensive than this one</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my breakouts are becoming less and less as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (with a day off in between) but my skin clarity and tone have already noticeably improved, and the pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> One in particular which I had spent a lot of money on, did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually report back how I feel about a product, but since I&#x27;ve tried other Retinol night creams (and paid MORE), I want to this time.  </li>
            <li> the hollow lines around the eyes are being to fill in with new collagen.</li>
            <li> During the first few weeks of using retinol product you are likely to breakout as rapid cell turnover causes clearing out of junk that was in pores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream fairly consistently for a few months and it helped my facial skin stay smooth, replenished and moisturized without leaving a heavy oily mess on my face.</li>
            <li> And, by the way, this company offers a full money-back guarantee if you are not happy with the product, which just added to my confidence in purchasing from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.  </li>
            <li> The last time I ordered I went with entirely different brand because I&#x27;m tired of paying so much when I can get exactly the same ingredients in a different brand.</li>
            <li> 49 year old female that has spent my fair share of time in the sun :-(  </li>
            <li> I am 45 years old with chronic acne (worse than as a teen) and very, very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other nite on clear skin.</li>
            <li> One other thing that I am concerned about is my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started with every other day the first week or so, then moved to every evening for another week or so, and now I am starting to go to twice a day (I read and heard how retinol can be tough on your skin if you go straight to once or twice a day).</li>
            <li> You will definitely have this cream for a long time, as it takes a dot to cover the entire face.</li>
            <li> The first night I tried it, my teenage son who pays very little attention to stuff like this, commented that my face looked tighter!</li>
            <li> Within a few days my skin was feeling much softer and smoother and though it didn’t feel dry, I also didn’t have a greasy or oily feel.</li>
            <li> I incorporated this into my regular bedtime routine which is cleanse face, pat it dry, apply a peel I&#x27;m trying out, apply my Vitamin C Serum and then apply the Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and reducing appearance of deep lines</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, tired of looking for that miracle in a bottle or pill, has a vanity full of every type of serum, you need to try this.</li>
            <li> My old acne scars from previous years have gone away, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cannot comment on this for anti-aging, or anti-wrinkles because I am only in my late 20s and don&#x27;t really have that issue yet.</li>
            <li> Please note that this may be a personal preference as I am extremely picky about how things smell; especially when they are being applied to or around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for a month,I used twice a day and so far i can see a little bit of fade on my &amp;#34;little wrinkles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference.</li>
            <li> So far, I’ve been using it everyday since I received the order.</li>
            <li> I spent daily time in the sun and got sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I know Retinol creams often make your skin sensitive because they help remove the outer, dead layers.  </li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: I have not seen drastic results nor expected any (as with any skin care product) in this short period of use.</li>
            <li> I hope it will continue to improve, as I plan on using this for the long run.</li>
            <li> Hi, to update my previous review, I just purchased my 2nd bottle of the Key West 2.5% Retinol Night Repair.</li>
            <li> The cream isn&#x27;t super thick like a heavy lotion</li>
            <li> I will go back to using my other cheaper retinol cream .</li>
            <li> will continue to order this cream and would like to try other Key West</li>
            <li> I like that when I put it on it does not feel greasy, but my skin definitely feels moisturized, which is not always the case with other retinol creams.  </li>
            <li> She also said she is doing some dry brushing to help this process.  </li>
            <li> By the time I brush my teeth after application, it’s dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to be drawn and dry.  </li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks, but there IS a difference in appearance of my skin (and with makeup on, I can tell that my pores are smaller &amp; skin is smoother).</li>
            <li> I used this every single night for 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> My face has NEVER been this soft and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for the past five weeks, so I figure it&#x27;s plenty of time to form an early opinion.</li>
            <li> I only need a pump, maybe a pump and a half if my face is dry that day to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Having a retinol cream as part of my beauty regime certainly helps slow down the ageing process.</li>
            <li> Crow&#x27;s feet are less noticeable after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this cream at half the cost of similar products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen big changes to the wrinkles yet, but will keep using the product to give it time since I was already using another retinol product previous to this one.  </li>
            <li> I only use it at night with 2 other products, 1 for the eyes and the other for the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Since using it, I haven&#x27;t a single break out!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it  doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other retinol products I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works on my dark spots!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over three weeks now and by the end of the second week, people were already complimenting me on my skin!</li>
            <li> I only changed to once a day a little over a week ago</li>
            <li> Non greasy and wont dry out your skin like other products.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my skin softer, &amp; instant improvement in wrinkles at the mouth &amp; neck area in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one flaw of that their Retinol Cream has is something that I have run into a few times with different products that I use or have used.</li>
            <li> I have only used this cream a few times</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, dark spots appear lighter, pores look smaller, lines seem less visible.  </li>
            <li> This is certainly not 2.5% retinol.</li>
            <li> but it has been a complete failure.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I use it 1-2 times a week as needed.</li>
            <li> She mentioned that her skin color seems a lot less dull perhaps from the old skin sloughing off.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount of the product is needed, and I applied the cream at night.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have never had that with any other retinol face product before.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to using other products by this Beauty Company.</li>
            <li> used this at night to reduce the chances of getting a reaction due to the sun.</li>
            <li> I researched other Retinol products and decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount, and it feels luxurious on my face.  </li>
            <li> Visible difference from other retinal cream.  </li>
            <li> Not sure dispenser works properly.  </li>
            <li> At 54 years of age, I am very careful of the products i choose to use, and this will be one of the permanent ones for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> As with any product, I am very careful to avoid getting it close to the eye as it can be an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using twice a day and, although my pores were getting smaller, after 6 weeks or so, I actually looked worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with the Dark Spot remover</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my pores on my face diminishing, &amp; dark spots lightening...</li>
            <li> but I have to give it a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Yep....and paid 18 dollars less.</li>
            <li> I am in my low 30&#x27;s and my skin started breaking out the past few years, from one or two blemishes to 5-6 at a time (I never had problem skin!).</li>
            <li> The odd thing is my face doesn&#x27;t peel, probably because I moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li> I also like how it made my skin less oilier.</li>
            <li> i have been using the cream two time a day as per instruction (which are not very clear on how to applay the cream on the spots to cure) and I have seen any change or at least a shadow of the spots.</li>
            <li> And 100% cheaper and less extreme compared to other options like surgerys, needles, or hard chemical based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t see any of the usual result that i had seen from using other products that contain &amp;#34;retinol&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> feel a little disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Promise to post if I do see an improvement by the time I finish the cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is tight, firm, I have a glorious glow, and I am believer in this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and alot of products,  especially those made of retinol, cause bad irritation.</li>
            <li> Crazy how I wasn&#x27;t this aware of ingredients in the past.</li>
            <li> Cream not smooth And have not noted any improvement in skin After one month of use.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of.money and my time.</li>
            <li> Well I must put a warning here for those getting this for any acne or problem skin: I had read a few places about retinol causing &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;---where</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I feel as though I have wasted my money .</li>
            <li> so you know you&#x27;re not harming your skin/face with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> this go round.</li>
            <li> The one thing I was missing from my skin regimen was a dependable night cream.</li>
            <li> It looks classy and expensive.</li>
            <li> The retinol cream neither dried up my skin nor did it cause any</li>
            <li> actually, I think my wrinkles are worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately one month now and am noticing that my pores are much smaller.  </li>
            <li> My skin started sagging and just looked harsh.  </li>
            <li> I just let it soak it and then applied the retinol, waited a few minutes and then applied the moisturizer again.  </li>
            <li> It dries and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy greasy feeling, or any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Noticed dramatic reduction in red spots all over face, and lines too.</li>
            <li> I have very fine lines on my forehead and there is no improvement at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well...after a month of using this, my skin is so tight and not a wrinkle in sight!</li>
            <li> This was not at all irritating to my dry skin; and I still needed to use moisturizer when using.  </li>
            <li> Small amounts.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> , what I mean is .There is no more blotchiness.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way, when my palms were exfoliating and peeling.</li>
            <li> and it has not irritated my skin in the least.</li>
            <li> It has lasted at least one month, and I&#x27;m still using it.  </li>
            <li> However, I have not had any negative reactions to the product, either.</li>
            <li> She tried it for a couple of weeks and the lines began to slowly disappear.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist wanted to prescribe a retinol product for this and told me as we got &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; (how rude!)</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any redness at all, nor any flakiness even though I have been using it twice a day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> I get the worse</li>
            <li> Worst of all I had a new wrinkle on my forehead!  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I must say that the product did not work.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is not an expensive product for the amount you needed</li>
            <li> In fact, it has a faint aloe scent to it</li>
            <li> Needless to say my skin started showing signs of aging (crows feet, etc).  </li>
            <li> Silly me...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use it all around your eyes, including your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I turned off all the lights before going to bed; that is how bad it was.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get any bad reactions from it at all.</li>
            <li> Now, I am not saying that the cream smells bad.</li>
            <li> I have had bad skin for all 60 yrs of my life, as well as being a sun goddess, adding some sun spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Disappointed expecially because is very expensive for the quantity.</li>
            <li> This is crap.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> have horrible acne scars all over my face.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a tremendous product!!! I was using a name brand at 0.5% at twice + the price. This leaves my skin softer, &amp; instant improvement in wrinkles at the mouth &amp; neck area in just a few days. Very pleased &amp; this is now my go to product twice a day. Also, no redness or peeling with fingertip amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and have been loving how it makes my skin both look and feel. Only a small amount of the product is needed, and I applied the cream at night. I love the pump bottle, so you can easily dispense just as much as you need. One “pump” worth of cream was enough to do my entire face and neck. Within a few days my skin was feeling much softer and smoother and though it didn’t feel dry, I also didn’t have a greasy or oily feel. I look forward to continuing to use this product and see even better results!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I am amazed by the difference I see after only six weeks of using the product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few days</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients! Did not nor dI currently experience dryness. Skin looks and feels smoother. Wrinkles around eyes and forehead are diminishing. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent cream. In combination with Tamanu Oil, my face is much smoother, as it has reduced the size of my acne scarring / pores on my cheeks. I am still waiting to see if it will eventually reduce the size of my acne scarring / pores on my nose. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I have been using it every other day. I am going to start using it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin has never been so soft. I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Does nothing whatsoever. It&#x27;s important to note that no true retinol product can be kept in a clear bottle like this since retinol is incredibly photosensitive. It can&#x27;t survive exposure to light at all. If you;re using this expecting anti-scar or anti-wrinkle benefits, please educate yourself before buying. As a general moisturizer its fine thought. But there&#x27;s no retinol in this.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for about a month now and I am beginning to see a smoother, better toned skin.  I experienced no irritation (I have been using retinol for awhile) and there is no fragrance -- a definite plus.  I like that the owners send an info sheet after purchase explaining how and when to use.  Overall -- great product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this for about 2 weeks so far but let me tell you this stuff is awesome.I have tried so many products but never before have I come across anything that works quite like this. My huge line in my forehead is almost completely gone, and the fine lines around my eyes have dissapeared. My face glows and is so soft. I have had people tell me that I glow in the face.. Great product you must try!</li>
            <li> I like this. I&#x27;ve been using and buying this brand of retinol cream despite the cost. It works for my face without being drying. The last time I ordered I went with entirely different brand because I&#x27;m tired of paying so much when I can get exactly the same ingredients in a different brand. Yep....and paid 18 dollars less. Now I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just made by a company that makes this cream and just sells it to people who use their own labels for their business. I know anyone can buy lotion bases on line and add different actives and make their own lotion to sell.</li>
            <li> This creamy cream is a a little heavy for me, but i&#x27;m oil skin, but definitely good absorbtion tho.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and value. Strong and effective (gives me some slight dryness and flaking the next day - I&#x27;ve just used it twice so my skin is still adjusting to it - but it clearly shows it&#x27;s working as a good quality retinol product should) but not irritating at all due to the encapsulated retinol. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (with a day off in between) but my skin clarity and tone have already noticeably improved, and the pores look smaller. Very impressed and pleased with this cream.</li>
            <li> Expected the pump to work better. Difficult to use. Cream not smooth And have not noted any improvement in skin After one month of use.</li>
            <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work, but they have organised a replacement.  Great customer service, would definitely use again.</li>
            <li> Really have enjoyed this product!  Crow&#x27;s feet are less noticeable after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I had used prescription retinoids in the past (diluted and combined with creams) and they did benefit my skin, but they were always full of things like parabens and were a hassle to get since I had to go to the doctor and pay a lot for them. This stuff does as good or better job than the products I got from the doctor and is so easy to get on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more moist and dewy; my pores appear smaller and my skin appears to have tightened up (or maybe it&#x27;s just that the skin is more plumped up with moisture) but it has reduced sagging and wrinkles for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to apply -- 3 pumps cover my face easily and it absorbs pretty quickly, leaving my skin moisturized without feeling at all greasy. Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Not at all oily/greasy sticky feeling going on.  Very lightweight.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my face and the softness of it.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and I&#x27;m very sensitive to breakouts.  Definitely recommend this product and will be buying more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> my wife likes all Skin Medica products</li>
            <li> I am following the directions/suggestions written by the manufacturer and find this Night Cream easy to use. The product was shipped promptly and was packaged well. I will buy this product again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of.money and my time. I&#x27;ve used this retinol for 3 months now and there is no improvement. I have very fine lines on my forehead and there is no improvement at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this product 4 months ago after using another retinol cream that also got good reviews.  This is by far a better product!  I love this.  It doesn&#x27;t break my face out and it works to reduce the apearance of wrinkles.  I had a question about using it under the eyes and got a quick response from the owner.  It can be used under the eyes, so I have started using it there as well.  I also use it on my neck and chest area.  2 pumps covers everything and the bottle lasts about 3 months.  It also has a place where you can see how much is left.  I have recently started my second bottle and am about to order my third because I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for wrinkle results-skip to my last paragraph. Those interested in acne results, keep reading!:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a retinol cream that is not tested on animals and organic (as much as possible) for about a year. I am in my low 30&#x27;s and my skin started breaking out the past few years, from one or two blemishes to 5-6 at a time (I never had problem skin!). My dermatologist wanted to prescribe a retinol product for this and told me as we got &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; (how rude!) our hormones and skin changes and retinol will very much help this. The one she offered me was loaded with so many other ingredients and was tested on animals (big no no for me), so I started doing research and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it about a month ago and still have about 1/2 bottle left. I started with every other day the first week or so, then moved to every evening for another week or so, and now I am starting to go to twice a day (I read and heard how retinol can be tough on your skin if you go straight to once or twice a day). Well I must put a warning here for those getting this for any acne or problem skin: I had read a few places about retinol causing &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;---where all your pores/blackheads, etc. basically clear themselves out and you have a 1-4 weeks of embarrassing skin. I also read that if you stick with it, it is worth the wait. Let&#x27;s just say, I understand what purging is now as I seriously experienced this episode. When I washed my face at night, removing my makeup, I was actually embarrassed for my husband (married 5 years) to see me! I turned off all the lights before going to bed; that is how bad it was. I almost gave up on using it thinking there was no end to this. Not to mention I have a very high end job and meeting with clients with a face covered in pimples-AHH!  However....I stuck with it and got passed it and everything is healing with no new breakouts and my skin is GORGEOUS. I still am healing from those two weeks with a few marks and hints of the breakout,  but it is like the calming after the storm where you can see the beautiful sunlight ahead. My old acne scars from previous years have gone away, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Total bonus** Being on the younger side (31), I do not have tons of wrinkles just yet, but do have some settling in between my eyebrows and the start of crows feet (I love to smile-it&#x27;s inevitable). I also am noticing the marks of neck creases not going away when my neck is straight (dagger!), but nothing more or less than a typical gal my age.  Well...after a month of using this, my skin is so tight and not a wrinkle in sight! I am amazed! This was not the reason I started using it, but goodness what a great bi-product!  My skin is tight, firm, I have a glorious glow, and I am believer in this bottle. Really amazing product and buying more bottles to be sure it never goes out of stock. For those starting for acne, I would start 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase and be sure to use a topical blemish spot treatment, and you will be sooo happy with the results!  It may not affect you the way it did me since everyone is different, of course!</li>
            <li> This product is very good. My skin was noticeably firmer after using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty nice! It&#x27;s a decent sized product and moisturizers quite well.</li>
            <li> I am a face cream junkie and have tried hundreds of products. 49 year old female that has spent my fair share of time in the sun :-(  I had a precancerous spot removed 2 years ago on my face, (it was burned off), and it left an unsighly brown spot. I have tried everything and sometimes some products seem to make it fade but it comes back. Since I have been using this cream, the brown spot actually became dry and then flaked off, which at first scared me! But to my surpirse and happiness I have new clear skin below and the spot doesnt show even an inkling of returning. During a Diamond Microdermabrasion last week my esthetician told me my skin looked better than ever. She didnt even try to sell me any products! I give this products a thumbs up. And the price is just unbeatable for the results!! I would pay 3x what I paid!!  Very happy with it and will be a repeat purchaser!!</li>
            <li> You can honestly tell the moment you put this retinol cream on your face, that there is a quality, a good amount of retinol in this product.  It does not make my skin  red, even though I do have sensitive skin.  I like the way it feels on my skin and what my face looks like the next morning.  I have never had that with any other retinol face product before.  One in particular which I had spent a lot of money on, did nothing for me.  So, I would highly recommend this product.  I am 56 year old and it is mandatory that I use a retinol product at night.  It does make a difference, and many women that are younger ask me what I use on my face.  As you age, it is imperative that you have good skin.  Use less makeup, other wise you could look too made up.</li>
            <li> Love the night cream. The smell is great, and now just hoping it works on my wrinkles night after night.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased with this product!!! leaves my face feeling wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I love it.  Received my product in just two days in perfect condition and my skin is responding very well to this product.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference right away and my skin has a smooth and clear appearance.  I&#x27;m glad that I tried it out.</li>
            <li> All I can say is AMAZING!!  This stuff is working great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I see huge differences in my crows feet etc...  I&#x27;ve been using it with the Dark Spot remover and I just cannot believe the difference in my skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I tried this and it is working. I can feel the skin surround my eyes and forehead are more hydrated. And this product does not stink or smell and goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this product. I am not seeing any appreciable results. The product is a nice moisturizer but for $38,&lt;br /&gt;you can buy a lot of equally moistureizing face creams.</li>
            <li> Although the cream came very well packaged and delivered on time I am very disapointed in the cream . I have found no difference in mY skin at all . I have used other retinol creams and always experienced a slight burning . So you know the retinol is working . But not with this . I done my research as well and this one had the best reveiws . I feel as though I have wasted my money . I will go back to using my other cheaper retinol cream . And have better results .</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream but it didn&#x27;t seem very strong compared to other retinol products I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;m suspicious of the way they calculate percentages or they are buffering this to the point where it seems ineffective.</li>
            <li> As a working mom of 3 i normally don&#x27;t take the time to write any reviews.  However, in this case I felt compelled to do so.  When I received the above cream it felt nice and smooth but i didn&#x27;t see any of the usual result that i had seen from using other products that contain &amp;#34;retinol&amp;#34;.  Then i read the ingredient list on the back of the container, which they don&#x27;t show you when purchasing over the internet or Amazon, and sure enough retinol was NOT even listed as an ingredient...which explains why the product does not work.  Save your money, don&#x27;t buy this product...buy something else where you can confirm the retinol ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for others.  DGS</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and my face shows it.  This Retinol cream is unlike anything I have ever tried.  It performs as promised and I instantly saw results.  My pores are smaller and fine lines and wrinkles diminished. Non greasy and wont dry out your skin like other products.  Key West Health and Beauty has hit the mark with this product.  Well worth every penny!  Love it, Love it, Love it!  I look forward to using other products by this Beauty Company.</li>
            <li> I love the cream. I intend to order more as I’m running low now. So far, I’ve been using it everyday since I received the order. I can see a nice difference in my skin, especially on my neck. Thank you for providing this cream at half the cost of similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Key West retinol for about 5 weeks now and am happy with the results. I was already using a retinol cream so changing to Key West was an easy transition. I changed to Key West because it&#x27;s a natural product with no nasties and it certainly seems to suit my skin. Having a retinol cream as part of my beauty regime certainly helps slow down the ageing process.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have good skin but lately after use getting more compliments. I&#x27;m 47 and told look 35.</li>
            <li> I was totally impressed with the product. I have tried many retinol creams but I could tell the difference when I first used it. I can not wait to let my daughter try it too as it will probably help with her acne.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact this is a natural product and is run by a family based company. Go Local!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!</li>
            <li> Great product for me.  I have sensitive skin so this cream had the right amount of retinol to help my skin without over drying it.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> love it, will buy it again</li>
            <li> I would not buy again.  It feels to me like a regular night cream.  Not bad if you are just looking for a night cream but after several years of applying real retinol on my skin daily, I understand what retinol does and how your skin should respond to it.  This is certainly not 2.5% retinol.</li>
            <li> Kind of similar to other retinol product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience stronger effects.</li>
            <li> I gave this BEST retinol night cream to my sister to try along with a Vitamin C serum and she is really liking this particular product.  She said she applies it in the evening after her shower and after the Vitamin C serum has fully penetrated.  She reports that her skin feels silky smooth and she is experiencing some dead skin flaking off but is very happy with how much finer and smoother the newer areas look.  She mentioned that her skin color seems a lot less dull perhaps from the old skin sloughing off.  She also said she is doing some dry brushing to help this process.  I agree her skin does look really nice!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting something awesome from this. I have been using another face cream with retinol for years but I wasn&#x27;t happy with it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this one and loved it right away. My skin is so soft and my skin looks better then it has in a long time. The best thing is I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and I didn&#x27;t get any bad reactions from it at all.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, and contains natural ingredients.Make sure you wash your hands with soap after using.I learned the hard way, when my palms were exfoliating and peeling.I always put on a Vaseline lip balm before using or your lips will peel.The odd thing is my face doesn&#x27;t peel, probably because I moisturize afterward.My skin gets a nice glow.A little goes a long way, and I use it 1-2 times a week as needed.If you are going to be out in the sun, DON&#x27;T use.You will get a sunburn.To get a product this effective in a high end department store you would probably pay quadruple the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it awhile now and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Very nice creamy texture goes on well and leaves a nice finish to the touch. I would say that it is nice addition to the various skin care products I already use . The 4 star rating is only because I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but will be purchasing again . Feels like a high end cream but at an affordable price point.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years young. I have been using this cream for about a month now. Twice a day. Small amounts. I can not believe how fast this works. My deep wrinkles on my forehead and expecially between my eyebrows above my nose, have almost disappeared. I ordered another bottle to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> thought it was really awesome. If it stays at the price it is at I will be ordering again.  I am on a budget</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and definitely see a difference. Plus it is ORGANIC and there is no irritation.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say. I finally found a product that works on my dark spots! My face has NEVER been this soft and the price is unbelievable. Since using it, I haven&#x27;t a single break out! I apply it faithfully and within the first two weeks, I saw my skin began to even out beautifully. I can only see my skin improve week by week and it&#x27;s slowly but surely working on my biggest problem areas. No other product has ever done that and I am overly excited to see how much better my skin can get. I highly recommend this product, it has every thing you need and more!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for three months. I have seen some improvement in my skin. I have purchased this twice and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have been using this retinol cream for about 6 weeks and it is doing everything promised.  It works very well and is a great value.</li>
            <li> Key west health &amp; beauty&#x27;s night cream is a great product that is designed to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles, and bags under your eyes when used as directed. I have been using it for only 2weeks now and while my fine lines and bags have not disappeared completely, I can see a hugh difference from before I started using it. The cream absorbs quickly without any residue which is great for me since I&#x27;ve been applying it before I go to sleep and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting all over the pillow or bed spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also made of natural organic ingredients with no alcohol or parabens so you know you&#x27;re not harming your skin/face with harsh chemicals. Overall, this is a wonderful product and while it may not completely remove your fine lines and wrinkles, it&#x27;s the next best thing. And 100% cheaper and less extreme compared to other options like surgerys, needles, or hard chemical based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, 5/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this item complimentary to review this item.</li>
            <li> I was given this product for free in exchage for my unbiased opinion,  and let me tell you, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to love it the way I do! I have very sensitive skin and alot of products,  especially those made of retinol, cause bad irritation. This product has smoothed out the fine lines around my mouth and eye area. It has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t harsh like alot of its competitors. I am very pleased with the results so far and look forward to seeing how much more youthful my skin will continue to look!</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in your skin. First go this for my wife, but then I stole it. Ended up ordering her another batch.</li>
            <li> I use this every night for about a week now and laready see a difference in my skin. My skin is so soft, smooth, even and I now have a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old with chronic acne (worse than as a teen) and very, very oily skin.  I would never, ever consider using a moisturizer.  Ever.  I purchased this product to see if it would help clear up my acne.  I have been using it regularly for 2 weeks and in that short time have seen great improvement in my skin.  Not miraculous as I still have had blemishes, but certainly remarkably improved.  I have not experienced any redness at all, nor any flakiness even though I have been using it twice a day, morning and night. Best news:  The deep lines between my eyebrows from squinting at a computer screen all these years, have virtually disappeared!  Amazing!  I would have given 5 stars, but the container is not see thru so you cannot tell how much cream is left in the bottle and I don&#x27;t particularly like that.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to spread on face and neck. I saw results after a couple of weeks. I use it morning and evening and it has not irritated my skin in the least.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I saw results immediately.  My face glows.  i have had no problems with peeling or and rashes, which for me, I am very sensitive.  This product did not bother my skin in anyway.</li>
            <li> have been using it for 2 weeks now. no difference whatsoever! maybe needs more time.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C creams with some success, but this has shown no difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> I was not overly impressed. I&#x27;ve used this product for a good 12 weeks.  I do believe my pores are smaller; fine lines?  I would say they are not reduced.  This was not at all irritating to my dry skin; and I still needed to use moisturizer when using.  I used this every single night for 12 weeks. The product does not stink or smell and goes on very nicely.  I just don&#x27;t notice much of an effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over three weeks now and by the end of the second week, people were already complimenting me on my skin! This has really helped clear up the discoloration/sun spots/overall dullness of my complexion.  I use this amazing retinol cream after steaming my face for 15 minutes for maximum absorption. I will definitely be ordering more when I run out! I love this cream most because it is NOT full of icky chemicals and unpronounceable ingredients.  It&#x27;s natural, effective, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Lasts a long time and reducing appearance of deep lines</li>
            <li> It works b/c retinol always makes my skin feel different when it&#x27;s effective. My skin looks great but I have been also using a sonic machine 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I use this about 5-6 nights a week for about 6 weeks and I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin. My complexion is noticeably more even. Really liking it so far!</li>
            <li> I spent daily time in the sun and got sunburn.  I have VERY fair skin and developed a tan and freckles (which is basically sun spots, yuck!)  Worst of all I had a new wrinkle on my forehead!  So  I got this stuff hoping it would reverse it...  Not only did my sunspots go away,  everything else did!  My skin looks so clear - EVEN MY ACNE went away!  And acne scars!!  The darkness under my eyes cleared up!  I looove this stuff and put it on every night!  And I am a peace knowing it is mostly organic haha!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I must say that the product did not work. i have been using the cream two time a day as per instruction (which are not very clear on how to applay the cream on the spots to cure) and I have seen any change or at least a shadow of the spots. Disappointed expecially because is very expensive for the quantity. Sorry to say but it has been a complete failure. My spots are still there!!!!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the Good N Natural retinol cream in jars. I used it for 6-8 months, skin was smooth, but I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening or clearing of my skin. I took a chance on this product this go round. I am in total awe of how good my skin looks! I no longer wear foundation, I get compliments on my skin all of the time, and my skin is flawless!!! I am a lifetime customer after just 2 weeks of use. On the fence? DO IT! BEST SERUM EVER!</li>
            <li> Any time I can use natural and organic products, I feel like I’m doing my skin and body a favor.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t notice a scent with this Retinol Cream. I do love scents so it had one, it wouldn’t have bothered me. BUT there are some who prefer no scent.&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels so light on my skin, I can’t tell I have it on. After my morning shower, I apply my normal serum product and then the Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream. It absorbs quickly and easily and I can wear it under my makeup. By the time I brush my teeth after application, it’s dry and I can then put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream on my face and neck once a day and I’m happy with the results. I apply it to my hands and feet once a day as well, except I do these areas at bedtime. I really want to stress that this is a great Retinol Cream for those of you who are looking for more youthful skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks so it&#x27;s a little soon to see much difference in the lines on my face, but it feels good on my skin with no irritation.  I emailed the company with a question about the product and they answered right away.  Excellent customer service!  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My wife was able to try this product for free, the opinions are her own. My wife was happy to try this product because she had some lines on her forehead. She tried it for a couple of weeks and the lines began to slowly disappear. She also likes how the product feels on her face. It does not dry out her face, instead it makes her look more youthful. I&#x27;m sure she will continue to use this product because it really improves her skin. It is also great knowing it is mostly natural and mostly organic. This helps to make her skin look more natural and she also looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually report back how I feel about a product, but since I&#x27;ve tried other Retinol night creams (and paid MORE), I want to this time.  Wow!  I am really impressed!  I didn&#x27;t think I could do anything more than my current skin care regimen (and diet) that would make a difference enough to see....BUT I SEE IT!  It has only been a few weeks, but there IS a difference in appearance of my skin (and with makeup on, I can tell that my pores are smaller &amp; skin is smoother). This product is a good value, absorbs quickly and super-effective.  I&#x27;m spreading the word and so glad this exists for us out here in Amazon-land!!!</li>
            <li> Retinol creams can help with so many things, like wrinkles, clogged pores, and even acne. This particular retinol cream has a very light scent that dissipates quickly. It is non-greasy, rubs in well, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized after. You really can use this anytime, but I’ve been using it mainly at night for personal preference. This is a huge bottle, organic and good for your skin, and has both short- and long-term benefits. I’ve found that the morning after I use it, my skin looks and feels clearer and more even-toned.</li>
            <li> Retinol helps to prevent fine lines, wrinkles and firms the skin. I only use this cream at night.  I feel my skin very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to use it if you have oily skin and acne because retinol helps to prevent breakouts.  You must use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> Best product I have every bought</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying your retinol cream.  I&lt;br /&gt;use it nightly.  I have been using a low percentage retinol cream for&lt;br /&gt;many years (ROC) so I am not having any issues with redness. I switched&lt;br /&gt;to your product because I thought I needed a higher percentage of&lt;br /&gt;retinol as I get older, without going through a dermatologist. I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order this cream and would like to try other Key West&lt;br /&gt;products.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! You will love the results. My skin is smoother than ever and so clear. I also love the company. They really care about your results and check up on you, offer tips and are quick to respond to questions about the lotion. Since using this product, I have gotten so many compliments on my skin :) Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This cream is really nice.  I love the consistency, there are no parabens and it is a strong 2.5% retinol.  For the money, you can&#x27;t get a better cream.  I highly recommend anyone who is on the fence, to try this.  It will become your go to cream.  Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the ingredients and its ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every evening before bed and find my skin improving. I do look forward in the weeks to come to see greater results. I understand skin care takes time, and finding the right product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> I love this retinol cream.  I began noticing improvements in my skin almost immediately.  My skin is smoother, dark spots appear lighter, pores look smaller, lines seem less visible.  I have experienced none of the dryness or irritation I have experienced with other retinol products, and I have been using this every night for a few weeks.  Will definitely purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Great night cream with natural retinol. Doesn&#x27;t dry face like most retinol creams do. Size and price of product also great.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH RESULTS, WILL BE BUYING THIS AGAIN :)</li>
            <li> Hi, to update my previous review, I just purchased my 2nd bottle of the Key West 2.5% Retinol Night Repair. If miracles could come true, one did for me while using this product. Since my last review, my wrinkles have gone from pretty much faded, to many of them completely gone!    I volunteer for kindergarten, and the teacher I helped last yr thought I had a face lift during the summer. Lol. That compliment was one of the nicest I&#x27;ve ever received.   This is a white cream, so you know where to put it, or not, depending on what you are trying to achieve.   I have very dry, fair, flaky skin. This Retinol moisturized my skin more then drying it out. I had no flaking, dry spots, redness, nothing but smooth hydrated, and most important, unwrinkled skin.   It comes in a 1.7oz air pump bottle, which I love! One squirt covers your entire face and neck. You are getting more product for the same price as the 1oz sizes.   If you&#x27;re like me, tired of looking for that miracle in a bottle or pill, has a vanity full of every type of serum, you need to try this. You&#x27;ll be amazed in a very short time.   Their customer service, consists of a husband and wife team and they are wonderful!   I can go on and on, but trust me...give this a try! You have nothing to lose but wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Truly THE best retinol cream ever!</li>
            <li> THIS IS 50+ YEARS OLD WOMEN.  USE THIS PRODUCTS AND NEED TO TELL YOU.  THIS PRODUCTS WORKING. YOU WILL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE.   I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical in the beginning before using the product as I have a very oily skin, large pores and prone to acne with the usage of any kind of cream, so I stick to water based serums mostly.&lt;br /&gt;but this product is lovely, its not greasy at all, and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or breakouts at all,&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my skin looking more hydrated, brighter and smoother..  I already ordered my second bottle!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in two days. I have been using it for a month and I see that the problem area, my top lip, has improved and the lines are much softer and less noticeable. However, I did see some improvement as soon as I started to use the product. I I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> this product is great</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin. One plum is all you need to cover your face and neck. I notice my lines on my forehead started to smooth out and I only used it 3 times so far. Another thing is the lines on the right side of my mouth are smoothing out. My lines are not that deep at all they are mildly deep. Also it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin greasy or oily. Also it absorbs pretty quick into your skin. I got this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it is silicone free which is important to me (they cause me to break out). Right now I&#x27;m in the retinol purge period (week 2 of using it). During the first few weeks of using retinol product you are likely to breakout as rapid cell turnover causes clearing out of junk that was in pores. However after only 2 weeks my blackheads are disappearing and pores have shrunk. It is not too drying like retinol prescriptions I have tried. I really like this product. I am a 26 year old Female with combination skin.</li>
            <li> The one thing I was missing from my skin regimen was a dependable night cream. This is the one! I love it. I can actually pronounce the ingredients and identify what they actually are and their purpose. I think that&#x27;s a good sign when you are using a product for your face. Crazy how I wasn&#x27;t this aware of ingredients in the past. No harsh smell and absorbs into skin quickly. Oh, and I do appreciate simple and clear instructions. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love natural cosmetics that won’t do much damage to your skin due to toxic chemicals we find in most of them. That’s why I’m happy when I come across beauty products that I can recommend to you, Mama. This Retinol Cream that I received, at no cost, from Key West Health &amp; Beauty is exactly what I’m looking for in beauty products. This night cream is a perfect cocktail of 97% natural and 71% organic ingredients that aim at diminishing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and premature aging from sun exposure. It comes in a great size: 1.7 fl oz/50 ml, which is much bigger than other creams I’ve had. The scent doesn’t contain any perfume since, like I said, the product is natural. But, it makes up for it with how easy it spreads. You will definitely have this cream for a long time, as it takes a dot to cover the entire face. If you’re one of those moms who want to try to go green, and not only with what you eat, reaching for the Key West’s line of organic products would be a great start.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Many of the smaller wrinkles have disapeared.  My skin looks smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> After using the night cream for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Ordered my 2nd bottle today. My pores are smaller. My lines and wrinkles have diminished. Smoother clearer skin.</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is really great.  I have used other face creams in the past and while effective I found them to be more expensive than this one and I needed to use a lot more.  I have been using this product once a day for about a week and I can already notice a difference.  I really like the smell, not a heavy perfume but almost a &amp;#34;scentless&amp;#34; smell.  I only need a pump, maybe a pump and a half if my face is dry that day to do the job.  The cream isn&#x27;t super thick like a heavy lotion but it isn&#x27;t thin either to where it doesn&#x27;t do its job, its the perfect texture.  I like that when I put it on it does not feel greasy, but my skin definitely feels moisturized, which is not always the case with other retinol creams.  Finally the price is what I find the greatest point of it.  The size of the bottle is huge, I am including a picture of it being held so you can see.  I have never had a bottle this big before and I am glad because I know it will last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> feels great so far so good</li>
            <li> The Key West Health &amp; Beauty 2.5% Retinol Cream came in a nice bottle. It looks classy and expensive. I like the simple design of their label because I think that sometimes, simplicity is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the bottle and the cream is dispensed through a built-in pump. The cream has a creamy texture, white color and is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this once a day at night. I incorporated this into my regular bedtime routine which is cleanse face, pat it dry, apply a peel I&#x27;m trying out, apply my Vitamin C Serum and then apply the Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream. In between the different product I use, I let each product absorb first before applying another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream has a creamy texture but absorbs very quickly. It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. I like how only 1 pump of the cream is enough for my whole face. It helped unclog my pores and reduced my acne break-out. I also like how it made my skin less oilier. The retinol cream neither dried up my skin nor did it cause any peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this at night to reduce the chances of getting a reaction due to the sun. I am aware that retinol can cause sunburns specially with extended sun exposure. Applying sunscreen can prevent this but I&#x27;d rather use it at night since it&#x27;s effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product to try however all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for some change to my skin by now, as have been applying religiously morning &amp; night for 3 weeks without any noticeable difference, so certainly couldn&#x27;t call it the BEST .&lt;br /&gt;I have been hunting for an effective organic, paraben free produce for a while, so feel a little disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Promise to post if I do see an improvement by the time I finish the cream.</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement in my skin very quickly and it continues to improve.  It looks younger, smoother, softer, with smaller pores.  This product is ideal in texture -- very pleasant and easy to use, no scent.  Packaging is sanitary and preserves the product.  Lasts a long time. No irritation with nightly use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice bottle, it has a yellowish concentrate texture with a &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; smell. I used twice a day in the morning before my sun protection morning cream and at night after my night routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for a month,I used twice a day and so far i can see a little bit of fade on my &amp;#34;little wrinkles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is not an expensive product for the amount you needed it to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommended.♥&lt;br /&gt;http://mysangrelatina.com/key-west-health-beauty-retinol-cream-review-23432</li>
            <li> It was ok. I expected more from a higher percentage of retinol.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for three weeks...don&#x27;t see any change for the good...actually, I think my wrinkles are worse.  I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> I received this product at no charge in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have horrible acne scars all over my face. The scars on my cheeks are very noticeable as they are large and pitted. I have tried numerous products. I have had chemical peels and micro-dermabrasion done as well. After the chemical peels and micro-dermabrasion my skin felt softer and looked great for about a month but after that the scars got more pronounced again. I can&#x27;t afford to keep going back to the dermatologist. I read a lot of articles online about retinol cream on some very popular websites (oprah.com, allure.com, etc.). All the articles say that retinol cream works but it could take a while to see results. If you use it daily over a long period of time it can do everything from smoothing wrinkles, fading blotches, reduce scarring &amp; large pores and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my research I started looking online for a retinol cream to use. I chose to go with this one because it has the strongest amount of retinol without needing a prescription. The bottle is also twice as large as other bottles of retinol cream (and priced a lot better). I wanted a product that I could afford to purchase each month as I plan on using it pretty much forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and applied it each night. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. Surprisingly it felt like a moisturizer after I applied it. My skin felt very soft. After the first week I noticed that my skin was a lot softer. There were no rough spots. My skin did not get red or irritated. I did apply sunscreen every morning so that probably did help. After the 2nd week I could see that my overall skin tone was getting better. Sometimes I get red or darkened blotchy spots on my face. Those seem to have gone away. My skin feels soft and looks a lot healthier. I am hoping after 4 weeks that my skin will improve even more. As of right now I am very happy with the product and optimistic that it will deliver.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately one month now and am noticing that my pores are much smaller.  I haven&#x27;t seen big changes to the wrinkles yet, but will keep using the product to give it time since I was already using another retinol product previous to this one.  I will post a follow up review in another month.    I am editing my review as of today (11/01/2014).  I read something online that made me realize I was using too MUCH product!  I was using twice a day and, although my pores were getting smaller, after 6 weeks or so, I actually looked worse.  My skin started sagging and just looked harsh.  After reading that too much retinol can affect your skin that way, I cut back to once a day.  Boy, what a difference....almost immediately!  Also, I discovered something by accident that really helped.  One evening, I accidentally put on my moisturizer before the retinol.  I just let it soak it and then applied the retinol, waited a few minutes and then applied the moisturizer again.  This actually made my skin look better than anything I&#x27;ve done.  When I woke in the morning, the parenthesis wrinkles around my mouth were almost entirely gone.  They were noticeably plumped.  Now, that is my standard routine!  Love this product and will definitely keep using.  I only changed to once a day a little over a week ago so I know the improvements will only continue.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong, but it&#x27;s OK.  Still waiting to see result after two months use.</li>
            <li> It is a very pleasant cream, feels good on the skin, I use it every night with no ill effect. I love it.</li>
            <li> Key West Health &amp; Beauty has a really great product. Not only does the name make me want to go on vacation; it is 40 degrees in Cincinnati right now, but it also makes my skin feel amazing! Even family members and friends have commented about how great I look. My favorite was when my mom told me I look well rested! I believe this product has really helped clear up some of the discoloration issues that I suffer from and lessened some of the wrinkles that I have started to notice popping up here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one flaw of that their Retinol Cream has is something that I have run into a few times with different products that I use or have used. The smell. Now, I am not saying that the cream smells bad. In fact, it has a faint aloe scent to it but it doesn’t smell as nice or “clean” as I would like it to. Please note that this may be a personal preference as I am extremely picky about how things smell; especially when they are being applied to or around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent aside, I am in love with this product and hopeful of the impact it will have on my complexion if I continue using it. This is a must try!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping that it would help with some sun/age spots. After six weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.  I really wanted it to work but I have to give it a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This product really is amazing, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight &amp; non greasy so skin absorbs it quickly. I&#x27;ve noticed my pores on my face diminishing, &amp; dark spots lightening... For the price you pay for this, I definitely think you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every morning, and I see a definite improvement in the fine lines. The deeper lines are still present, but they seem to be softer in appearance. I will purchase again to continue improvement.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. I am in my 50s and always have had supple soft skin most likely due to genes and never using soap on my face. This product is truly amazing!!!!!!!! Not alot is needed. I only use it at night with 2 other products, 1 for the eyes and the other for the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;. The fragrance is very very light as is the texture of the cream. The skin on my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s skin now. There is color in my face which is almost illuminating while diminishing any flaws.&lt;br /&gt;I have used all of the high end &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; skin products for alot more money and their minute results come never come close to these.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream consistently at night for about a month. ( I write the date on the bottom of my products to keep track of when I started. It helps me to decide whether to buy them again or not ).  My skin looks good, feels smooth, and I&#x27;ve been complimented on my complexion several times. I just ordered some of this for my friends birthday. I also wear Josie Maran sunscreen every day. I&#x27;m 51.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so my skin does not do well with many skin care products; My facial skin either gets easily clogged up or left dehydrated with a layer of oily residue that just sits on top of my face. But as for this Retinol Cream, it does neither: When I apply the cream it quickly gets absorbed into my face leaving my face well moisturized with no heavy residue.  It also feels very light and gentle, which I love because my face is sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores.  I have been using this cream fairly consistently for a few months and it helped my facial skin stay smooth, replenished and moisturized without leaving a heavy oily mess on my face. :) I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that really works great.  I read a bunch of reviews on the company and the product before I purchased, and everything I read stood true.  I had an issue that I emailed the company about (and not about the product itself) and the owner of the company emailed me back and helped me work out the solution.  Amazing customer service, they are very accessible and amazingly helpful.&lt;br /&gt;  The product is just great.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of different creams and never noticed a difference, but this one...I started noticing a difference within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m 27 and up until recently, I never wore sun screen.  Needless to say my skin started showing signs of aging (crows feet, etc).  I started using this cream and not only have my crows feet started to disappear, but the skin on my face shows new life.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I needed anything until this product.  Honestly, I won&#x27;t buy any other face cream.  I am now a loyal customer.  I&#x27;ve been recommending this product to everyone and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;  Great products and great customer service equals loyal customers and referrals and they do amazing at both.</li>
            <li> This serum is the answer for anyone looking to improve their skin, texture, elasticity, lines, discoloration.. The first night I tried it, my teenage son who pays very little attention to stuff like this, commented that my face looked tighter! This was a half hour after I used the product the first day! My skin sucked the serum in like it knew what was good for it! The combination of vitamin E, retinol and astaxanthin is what sold me on it! It&#x27;s one product with all three ingredients! I&#x27;m going to stock up on this wonderful magic potion!</li>
            <li> I have ordered a handful of products from Amazon, and I may have written a review or two, but I am compelled to write a review for this wonderful company.  First of all, the product arrived early and was exactly what it stated it would be on Amazon.  I had done hours of research on Retinol creams in order to select one I thought would be best without getting it from a dermatologist.  This company provides an all natural (mostly organic) product with the highest amount of retinol available OTC.  (Believe me, I checked, and even though others said their 2.0% retinol was the highest available, this has 2.5% retinol.)  And it works quite well!  I know Retinol creams often make your skin sensitive because they help remove the outer, dead layers.  The directions told me to use sunscreen ALWAYS when I go outside, but because my skin seemed fine, I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen.  Well, this stuff works so well that my skin got quite red out in the spring sunshine right after I began using it.  At first I couldn&#x27;t understand why I looked so red, as I normally would not burn like that and I&#x27;d just started using this product, then it hit me.  This cream was removing my outer layers of skin and that &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; skin was exposed to the sun.  Silly me...I need to follow directions!  So now, I continue to use this product, my skin looks better and better each week, and I slather my face in sunscreen before I leave the house.  And, by the way, this company offers a full money-back guarantee if you are not happy with the product, which just added to my confidence in purchasing from Key West Health &amp; Beauty.  And, lest I forget, the company sent me a personal email following my purchase, giving me their contact information and asking me to contact them with any questions or concerns.  They provide a superior product and back it up with superior service.  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a full review. But what I have noticed is my skin color is one color, what I mean is .There is no more blotchiness. I will give a full review after a longer period of time. But so far so good. Amazon is always good . I buy from there often.</li>
            <li> Key West H&amp;B BEST Retinol  Night Cream is wonderful. One of the most effective retinol creams I have used.  After using this cream for nearly 2 months, there&#x27;s a tremendous difference in the texture and firmness of my skin. Deeper wrinkles appear reduced.  It is very cost effective with a little going a long way. I would definitely repurchase this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the appearance, health and texture of their skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe too early to see any results?</li>
            <li> Received the order quickly ...so far I am happy with it ..I have sensitive skin and it  doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other retinol products I have tried in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for the past five weeks, so I figure it&#x27;s plenty of time to form an early opinion. I bought this on a whim. I was looking for a retinol cream to help with fine lines &amp; even had my doctor write me a prescription for Retin-A (which I never filled). I&#x27;m 37 &amp; have been blessed with pretty good skin, but the delicate skin just under my eyes was becoming slightly loose from my habitual eye rubbing. I would say in the last couple weeks I started noticing that the skin around my eyes was noticeably tighter. In fact, there isn&#x27;t any looseness at all anymore. The skin on my neck is also becoming smoother. I wake up with glowing, soft skin. I hope it just keeps getting better! If I could afford to, I would use this over my entire body. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use it all around your eyes, including your eyelids. It hasn&#x27;t caused any dryness or irritation like Retin-A can.</li>
            <li> Although I bought Best Retinol in June, I&#x27;ve just begun to use it at night and I can feel my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY noticing a difference with this product.  I use it every night, and I have found&lt;br /&gt;that gently massaging the Retinol Cream into my face and problem areas on my face,  also helps. The deep congestion that I have been struggling with forever,&lt;br /&gt;is clearing.  The other positive aspect of this product is that it does not cause my skin&lt;br /&gt;to be drawn and dry.  I am so happy that I finally found this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been reading about how important retinol is for older skin, so I began researching the different brands/prices.  I decided on this one for the price, retinol strength and reviews.  I am not disappointed.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin on my face and neck.  It is softer, the years of sun damage/age spots are fading.  I am a true believer.  At 54 years of age, I am very careful of the products i choose to use, and this will be one of the permanent ones for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product. The delivery was fast. I like the packaging. The dispenser pump make for easy application. The cream was not greasy at all and absorbed into the skin rapidly and did not leave any sticky after effect on the skin. My skin felt refreshed without any stinging or after effect. My skin loves this product.</li>
            <li> It feels good, good smell, I like it.</li>
            <li> I researched other Retinol products and decided to try this one.  I am amazed at the difference it makes and how great it feels when I put it on my face.  This product lasts a long time.  It only takes a small amount, and it feels luxurious on my face.  I honestly look forward to putting it on at night.  It has lasted at least one month, and I&#x27;m still using it.  I am placing a second order today to ensure that I never run out!  My facer is looking great!</li>
            <li> I received Key West Retinol Night Cream two days ago, and so far I love it. My skin is already softer, and looks like it is healthier which is always a plus. I find that most creams make my skin feel sticky or dry this makes it feel smooth, and soft, it did not irritate my skin which most products do.&lt;br /&gt;It is has an easy to use pump that doesn&#x27;t leave residue around the top like a lot of other pumps do. I would recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> Just received this so not really enough time to evaluate. Product was as described. Very attractive bottle. Nice pleasant fragrance and non-greasy. If it works i will buy again.</li>
            <li> Retinol is one of the things that I look for when purchasing night time creams, as I am in my mid thirties and require a little help with the fine lines that I am starting to notice. I don&#x27;t have a lot but the ones I have are enough to get me very concerned about what skin care products to use. One other thing that I am concerned about is my sensitive skin. I love the Retinol Night Cream by Key West Health and Beauty because it addresses all my concern: help with moisture retention on my face, eradicating what fine lines I have on my face and a formula that will work with my extra sensitive skin. So far, I am really loving this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I got to try this (free) for my review. And I am so lucky I did! I love it!  My skin is glowing!  I have pretty good skin to begin with. So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference. But this does! My face is so soft. And I swear I look younger.  Great product! A must have.</li>
            <li> Before this, I didn&#x27;t have a daily night cream to use. I suffer from dry skin, and the older I get the worse it seems to be. I recently changed up my skincare routine, added in some new products, this being one of them. I now have this as my daily night time cream that I use after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few weeks straight, and I have noticed that my skin has become much more radiant, the dry spots are clearing up, and my skin just looks so much more youthful. I have noticed that my breakouts are becoming less and less as well. It seems that all the new products that I am using just seem to be working together perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the cream itself. It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t take long at all to absorb into the skin. It dries and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy greasy feeling, or any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on this for anti-aging, or anti-wrinkles because I am only in my late 20s and don&#x27;t really have that issue yet. I use these types of products as a preventative measure. So far it seems to be working wonderfully with my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks only in the evening. I first cleanse my face and then apply the product. It is a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; but it is also a cream. It goes on very nicely and feels good on my skin. As with any product, I am very careful to avoid getting it close to the eye as it can be an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels so creamy that it is tempting to stop right there. However, the current buzz-z-z-z suggests that after applying the retinol cream you apply a moisturizer. So I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important that retinol be used only at night and then removed from your skin in the mornings. That is because leaving it on and going out in the sun makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight exposure. So I exercise caution in this respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I have not seen drastic results nor expected any (as with any skin care product) in this short period of use. However, I have not had any negative reactions to the product, either. I fully intend to continue respecting retinol as a key ingredient in skin care products and believe Key West Health &amp; Beauty Retinol Cream delivers as a quality product that is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> The 2.5% they must be referring to is 2.5% of the cream is like .0005% strength Retinol.  This is crap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at bedtime and have seen very good results in my complexion. My skin is clearer and brighter.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  I will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I have had bad skin for all 60 yrs of my life, as well as being a sun goddess, adding some sun spots and wrinkles. After  only a couple weeks, I have noticed an improvement in my skin. I hope it will continue to improve, as I plan on using this for the long run.</li>
            <li> I love it and have experienced results.  As a matter of fact for some reason I have experienced better results than I did with the stronger retinol cream I have by prescription.  I definitely will be getting it again.  I have used your product by the instructions on the tube.  It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Visible difference from other retinal cream.  5 star rating as far as product efficiency. Not sure dispenser works properly.  Have to finagle cream out.  The owner of the company requested feedback and even though I am 100% satisfied with this wonderful, effective product, the company is replacing it because of a defective dispenser.  I highly recommend  not only this product, I am very impressed with the integrity of this company.</li>
            <li> Noticed dramatic reduction in red spots all over face, and lines too. Made skin seem clear and blemish free, cleared up brown spots, would definately buy this again. It got rid of the &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; wrinkles on my chin, nothing  ever did that before. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have only used this cream a few times but I love how quickly it absorbs and the feelings that it has. It does not have a strong odor which is also beneficial. I will update after I have time to test it out more.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream!! Your skin will feel like silk!!</li>
            <li> Yes!  this is a great product. glad I try it, since using the Retinol Cream together with my Pure Body Natural Vitamin C Serum also sold on amazon the hollow lines around the eyes are being to fill in with new collagen. I use it every other nite on clear skin.</li>
