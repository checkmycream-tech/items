            <li>I love the fragrance which I find to be suble but refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I think if continue it will be even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I continue to use it and continue to be pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This is My FAvorite slimming firming cream ...</li>
            <li>: The latest shipment I received of this product (seller: AmericaRX) is NOT the product I used to receive.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty happy with this, I like the smell and texture, it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy or oily, you don&#x27;t need too much</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have ever used, hands down!  </li>
            <li>Notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that I see a huge difference in firming.</li>
            <li>Seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>cheap gmo ingredients will give no permanent results</li>
            <li>Light, not oily and</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say it tightens in any amazing way</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually firms your skin, but it smells and feels so great that I don&#x27;t even care.  </li>
            <li>Sounds like a commercial maybe, but it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
            <li>NO NASTY SMELL and well worth the money</li>
            <li>or I got a counterfeit batch, but the lotion I received has a cloying floral scent (think cheap drugstore brand) and does NOT absorb well at all.</li>
            <li>It has a cloying, flowery, strong sweet scent.</li>
            <li>:) i think i have to keep consistently using it for a while.</li>
            <li>No obviously visible results, but my skin absorbs it quickly and it has a pleasant scent for a lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is amazingly effective at restoring the natural suppleness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>not sticky feeling and absorbed quickly by my skin.</li>
            <li>looks much better - toned and soft!</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>More like a lemon scent (but mixed with candle wax - scent free wax).</li>
            <li>Soaks right in so no greasiness.</li>
            <li>Mild scent and not too greasy, need more time to give a proper review.</li>
            <li>It arrived sooner then expected, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion and though I have not been diligent in applying the lotion daily I have seen some tightening of the skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work miracles of course, but improves texture and elasticity more than I thought possible.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves the skin feeling soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really works!</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem more natural than most other lotions that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Makes the skin very smooth and the softness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure this is helping with my wrinkles - but it smells great and is leaving my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly and it works really well with a derma roller I also ordered at the same time, the results are noticeable.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Works very well have seen a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, I got it quicker than I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>Had my doubts but really works.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again without reserve.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizers your skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, it&#x27;s not strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs well, leaving my clothes and bed linens without the residue I find with many other products.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion it makes the older skin (sags and wrinkles) look not so noticeable.</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t slump too much, I have a smooth, wrinkle-free stomach.  </li>
            <li>Still on the first bottle but does make my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>may be more evident because of the amount of weight and the potential for loose skin involving my particular situation (weight loss in excess of 100 lbs).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 64 year old male who over the last 2 years lost 60 pounds and gotten into really good physical shape, but...  </li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin and keeps it soft all day.</li>
            <li>Still too new with me to say whether it works or not.</li>
            <li>but I still try new products when I come across them on the off chance</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough though for just regular lotion.</li>
            <li>and very natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Cheap, not worth the money</li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li>And it makes your skin feel really soft all day.</li>
            <li>so far I have not seen in results</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my flabby skin yet, but I am still hopeful.  </li>
            <li>In a few months I will be able to tell if it actually tightens the skin.</li>
            <li>As to whether or not it really works - my skin is smooth, and while not exactly taut, it&#x27;s not particularly saggy either.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle clean smell.</li>

            <li> My skin feel very soft, and notived slight tighting.</li>

            <li> It may have helped some but not the results I was expected.</li>
            <li> It smells softly of pink grapefruit.</li>

            <li> but, a little bit.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Smell is not floral, but not strong either.</li>
            <li> but boy was shocked when I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was recommended the usual things: aloe vera, cocoa butter lotion, bio oil, vitamin e oil, etc.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure if this lotion is helping firming my skin or not.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> so it is hard to tell if it is working.  </li>
            <li> This is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and trying to slow the age process.  </li>
            <li> it would be another failure</li>
            <li> I used it a week in a row, didn&#x27;t notice a serious difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately one week.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t waste my money on products that are 3-4 times as expensive anymore!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has seemed to fix some of my stretch marks. I&#x27;m still using it and I will update with my long term results.</li>
            <li> I was expecting firmer skin. It may have helped some but not the results I was expected. I won&#x27;t recommend product</li>
            <li> I bought Reviva Labs Body Firming Lotion for the price...a great deal!  But I will buy it again for the quality.  I have purchased much more expensive products with less results.  I was happy to find this product on Amazon for a great price and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t waste my money on products that are 3-4 times as expensive anymore!</li>
            <li> Mild scent and not too greasy, need more time to give a proper review.</li>
            <li> cheap gmo ingredients will give no permanent results</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells softly of pink grapefruit. Not overpowering in any way, though. And if you use it once or twice a day, you WILL notice a difference in the firmness of your body. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, and the firmness you get will go away when you stop using the product, but it does work. It also keeps my skin quite moisturized, which is definitely a bonus, but I find in the winter I need to use a supplementary product to keep from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Impressed so far.  I believe it does work as a &amp;#34;body firming&amp;#34; lotion to a degree, but do not expect miracles.  I changed my lifestyle (eating / exercise) about a year ago and began searching for a way to keep loose skin to a minimum during my weight loss progression. I was recommended the usual things: aloe vera, cocoa butter lotion, bio oil, vitamin e oil, etc.  I use those products as well, but when I added this lotion to the lineup there was definitely a noticeable improvement.  I&#x27;m not saying this will work for everyone and the benefits may be more evident because of the amount of weight and the potential for loose skin involving my particular situation (weight loss in excess of 100 lbs).  If you are attempting to tone up some loose skin from a 20 lb fluctuation in weight I honestly have no idea of the efficacy of this product.  I just know it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about 30 days. Ive noticed a slight improvement. Hopefully more to come. Satisfied for the price of the product!</li>
            <li> Cheap, not worth the money</li>
            <li> Still on the first bottle but does make my skin soft.  Hope it helps with the lose skin after weight loss... time will tell.</li>
            <li> This is thick and creamy. It don&#x27;t really have a smell. And it makes your skin feel really soft all day.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a subtle clean smell. It really hydrates my skin and keeps it soft all day. No need to reapply. My skin has been so dry since I moved to the Midwest  and this is the only thing that has kept my skin hydrated. Also I&#x27;ve lost 26 pounds in the last 6 wks so I need some help with elasticity. This lotion is helping with firming up my loose skin and it&#x27;s also definitely making my skin look younger. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am trying to tone a stubborn mommy-tummy and applied a few different toning creams. I was positively impressed with this one after the very first application. Although this is not a miracle cream, it does nourish my skin and leave a very subtle fragrance. I do not know if it is the workout or the cream or both but I am definitively more toned after one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I now have used it for over 6 months and I have to admin my skin looks much better - toned and soft! I plan to use it through my second pregnancy as well.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week but it does what any body lotion would do.  In a few months I will be able to tell if it actually tightens the skin.</li>
            <li> Reviva Labs Body Firming Lotion is a great lotion for a great price.  and very natural ingredients. I love it!</li>
            <li> Happy with the timely shipping on this product. Still too new with me to say whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Notice a huge difference. Will buy again once out.</li>
            <li> I have tried this lotion for a week now, and haven&#x27;t noticed a change. I will give it a month and write another review.</li>
            <li> This a has a very light scent and the lotion seems to hydrate nicely. I cannot say that I see a huge difference in firming.</li>
            <li> Only been using the cream for a few weeks so it is hard to tell if it is working.  Very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion while coming across it during online research for skin firming products. Very happy with it. I now ordered the 3-pack (which saves you money) &amp; will continue using this lotion as long as I can. It doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, but you will notice tighter skin a few weeks later. Shipping was fast &amp; the company sends emails to ensure you are happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> so far I have not seen in results</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately one week.  To date there is no visible improvement.  It is a nice lotion even if the firming effects don&#x27;t take effect.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of skin firming products and went in assuming it wouldn&#x27;t work. I lost a lot of weight years a go and have been dealing with the issue of sagging skin since. Nothing has ever worked at all but I still try new products when I come across them on the off chance something will help. I purchased this assiming it would be another failure but boy was shocked when I noticed a difference the first time I used it. I immediately recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work. ...</li>
            <li> Fall in love with the product. Leaves my skin very soft. Definitely love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have had 2 kids and I lost the wait but couldn&#x27;t get ride of the access skin this stuff is amazing. my body looks great</li>
            <li> i have lost a lot of weight. i&#x27;ve lost 120 lbs+ in a year. i&#x27;m 22 and i have lots of excess skin in my stomach and thighs. this is my second 3-pack purchase but i&#x27;m not sure if this lotion is helping firming my skin or not. it is however a solid lotion. not sticky feeling and absorbed quickly by my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Feels great going on and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Works very well have seen a difference in my skin great product.will continue to purchase and I like this lotion a lot.</li>
            <li> It will take a while to see if the product works, but the purchase and delivery process were perfect</li>
            <li> love the lotion.it glides on ..its not whatsoever sticky...but you can feel the moisture going into your skin...and it shows...love this product</li>
            <li> The ingredients speak for themselves. :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this is helping with my wrinkles - but it smells great and is leaving my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion and though I have not been diligent in applying the lotion daily I have seen some tightening of the skin. Time will tell if it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> My skin feel very soft, and notived slight tighting.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever!!!  I have purchased this lotion not only for myself, but for friends and family too!!!  Light, not oily and yes, it does work if you use it regularly!</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and it works really well with a derma roller I also ordered at the same time, the results are noticeable.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty happy with this, I like the smell and texture, it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy or oily, you don&#x27;t need too much and it has a pleasant smell. You are recommended to use it after a shower on slightly damp skin, which I have done for a few weeks. Big question do I think it is helping tighten my loose belly skin? Yes! I&#x27;m also exercising too, so maybe that&#x27;s also helping hence the  4 stars, but I&#x27;m going to keep going with this.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and smell.  Soaks right in so no greasiness.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice feeling lotion that soaks in well.</li>
            <li> Nice I use it on my face it makes me look refreshed. My friend asked if I get botox .... lol.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day everyday. I really can&#x27;t say it tightens in any amazing way but it feels so good and my skin feels soft! I don&#x27;t notice a scent so I have been layering my perfume with it. For me this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Made me itch gave it away.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for about a week now and I already see a difference! And the price is great!! Double win!!</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner then expected, I was very pleased. I love its smell and tecture. Will update later with results, I have a lot of skin stretched after second pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion it makes the older skin (sags and wrinkles) look not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used, hands down!  I don&#x27;t know if it actually firms your skin, but it smells and feels so great that I don&#x27;t even care.  The ingredients seem more natural than most other lotions that I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> No obviously visible results, but my skin absorbs it quickly and it has a pleasant scent for a lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product noticed results in about a week. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this all over but it worked great on my lower belly. My sister can expect this soon.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and felt smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost 90 pounds, and this is the best skin firming cream I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles of course, but improves texture and elasticity more than I thought possible.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I got it quicker than I thought I would.  I wanted to use the product for a bit before reviewing it, so I could actually post something that might help.  The fragrance is nice, it&#x27;s not strong and overpowering.  It goes on smooth and leaves the skin feeling soft, but not greasy.  Lastly, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in how the skin in the suggested application areas is growing tighter.  I&#x27;ve never found anything to help tighten the tummy after 3 babies, but this seems to be doing the trick.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as I continue to lose weight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts but really works. I apply it about 3-4 times a day! Seeing a huge difference. Had my baby 4 months ago (c-section) and stomach was starting to look horrible. Can&#x27;t believe this product is so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but living in the high desert with dry, aging skin led me to start looking at options. This product is amazingly effective at restoring the natural suppleness of my skin.  I love the fragrance which I find to be suble but refreshing. The lotion absorbs well, leaving my clothes and bed linens without the residue I find with many other products.  Packaging was good and the delivery was timely.  I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Great lotion for slackened skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get beyond the fragrance. It has a cloying, flowery, strong sweet scent. I&#x27;m a guy who&#x27;s just shed 30 pounds and wanted something to help tighten loose skin. Judging from the reviews, this will work, but not for me. I&#x27;m now looking for a similar unscented product.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and the smell of this lotion. Easy to put on, lasts all day, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and EVERYTHING irritates my skin!). I&#x27;ve even used this on my face and had no adverse reaction, and I usually start to feel a &#x27;burn&#x27; instantly with anything else except extreme sensitive-skin lotions. I bought the 3 pack, and ended up giving one away to a friend who was in awe of it! I would absolutely buy this again without reserve.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i want to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks. I used it a week in a row, didn&#x27;t notice a serious difference but, a little bit. It smells good though. :) i think i have to keep consistently using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Has good amounts of elastin and collagen.  Makes the skin very smooth and the softness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for 5 days and can tell slight difference.  I think if continue it will be even more noticeable.  I&#x27;m 45 and trying to slow the age process.  I did my research on Internet  and this was one of the highest rated.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how well this stuff has worked.  I&#x27;m a 64 year old male who over the last 2 years lost 60 pounds and gotten into really good physical shape, but...  I was frustrated by the saggy skin - abs and backside.  I&#x27;ve never used &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products, but had to try something.  I found the Reviva lotion, got it, and within a few weeks there was MAJOR improvement with my problem skin.  I continue to use it and continue to be pleased with the results.  As long as I don&#x27;t slump too much, I have a smooth, wrinkle-free stomach.  Sounds like a commercial maybe, but it&#x27;s great stuff and I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my flabby skin yet, but I am still hopeful.  I love the  smell and it does make my skin feel good without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It really moisturizers your skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works! I was hesitant to believe it until I tried it. My skin has shown dramatic tightening and feels young again. Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks since I received it, but I like it.  I have also been using this on my face!  Says it is firming!  What do I have to lose?</li>
            <li> Feels great to the touch, not too greasy. Smell is not floral, but not strong either. More like a lemon scent (but mixed with candle wax - scent free wax). But it is not overpowering or anything. Once you apply, it absorbs well, and I don&#x27;t feel the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the scent is almost neutral: men or women could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results: cannot say yet: have not used it for long. I will review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Believed other reviews. Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. It was cheap enough though for just regular lotion.</li>
            <li> This is My FAvorite slimming firming cream ... NO NASTY SMELL and well worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this 3-pack of lotion three times now!  It has a very faint citrus scent that fades almost immediately and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I&#x27;m in the process of losing a considerable amount of weight and am using this (along with the collagen night cream by Reviva) to take care of my skin as best I can through the process. As to whether or not it really works - my skin is smooth, and while not exactly taut, it&#x27;s not particularly saggy either. I started using this before losing weight and it may well be helping my skin adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The latest shipment I received of this product (seller: AmericaRX) is NOT the product I used to receive. I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or I got a counterfeit batch, but the lotion I received has a cloying floral scent (think cheap drugstore brand) and does NOT absorb well at all. I&#x27;d have to rate the current batch &amp;#62;1 star as I can&#x27;t even use it. AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>
