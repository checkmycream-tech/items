            <li>I can get a nicely defined eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>Fills in sparse eyebrows with a nice feathery touch...</li>
            <li>The design is exceptional for making the finest lines (which helps to create the most natural and flawless look).</li>
            <li>The pencil point broke very easily.  </li>
            <li>However, I have to say that this is, BY FAR, the best brow pencil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best eyebrow pencil, looks natural and is easy to use, I&#x27;ve tried them all and this pencil is no.1</li>
            <li>This pencil give you a nice fine point for feathering in brows.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and secondly I love</li>
            <li>Love the color and the fact I don&#x27;t have to sharpen the pencil.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite pencil I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>

            <li>Love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>love the brow pensil....</li>
            <li>you will love</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful eyebrow pencil; it goes on easily, looks natural, and wipes off easily in the event of those 6am-on-the-way-to-work indiscretions.</li>
            <li>I loved it the first time but the liner fell out of the holder within a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>Have used for years with great satisfaction, but new design is faulty.</li>
            <li>Love how you can create the look of fine hairs with this.</li>
            <li>Excellent pencil and love the brush on the other end.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have gotten skimpy as I get older and this gives me the look of beautiful full eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Great pencil for making your brows look natural and not drawn on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply strokes to fill in the brow.</li>
            <li>Blendable, easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product so much I decided to try again.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, no smear, can make fine hair like strokes for a more natural look, love this brow pencil.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky and can find it - great, till next time.</li>
            <li>The texture of the pencil itself is also perfect, it has a hard wax consistency which I find preferable for the brow lines staying in place and not smearing.</li>
            <li>It goes on really nicely and naturally.</li>
            <li>Also the shade of brown is true and not reddish or off.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and more natural looking than powder.</li>
            <li>but it is not swoon worthy.</li>
            <li>Shipment and deliver is quick.</li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This is the only one I love, you get a really fine line that blends in with the eyebrows you have</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many eyebrow pencils and this by far has been the most natural looking.</li>
            <li>This one gives the most natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I liked this brow pencil, only problem is that mine broke after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>excellent for filling in thin brows</li>
            <li>This is a pricey pencil and has always been worth the price, but no longer.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day and comes right off with my makeup</li>
            <li>Pricey for the short, single lead you get but does a very good job.</li>
            <li>tiny precision tip is wonderful to apply as you can truly make thin, more eyebrow hair looking strokes.  </li>
            <li>very very reluctantly.</li>
            <li>I have been using brow pencils for my white blond eyebrows for about 15 years and have never found a better pencil than this one.</li>
            <li>I accepted the fact that I lost my mind to spend so much money on an eyebrow pencil, but after applying it and finding it stayed on, I feel it&#x27;s well worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like a crayon, so I can feather it up precisely, and when I use the attached brush, it makes my brows look completely natural.  </li>
            <li>It draws on easily and really looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to buy this product because it costs so much more than other eyebrow pencils I have used, but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use that much.  </li>
            <li>This is frustrating since it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve even used the brush on the end more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have very spare eyebrows</li>
            <li>Really a tool...</li>
            <li>Although I really like the product I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Net net, the pencil is worth it, but make sure to store it horizontally.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil but the color is not right for me.</li>
            <li>a side note, the texture of this pencil reminds me of the old red &amp;#34;Maybelline&amp;#34; pencil my Mom always wore and still available today.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a mechanical pencil if it is raised to high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>(This is not a complaint - just an observation:  </li>
            <li>and I need a new one?</li>
            <li>Brunette has more red hue than expected.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with another pencil in another color which gives me a very natural look.</li>
            <li>Very natural look if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and the thin tip makes quick, even, strokes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I got it EARLY</li>
            <li>Natural color.</li>
            <li>and it fills them in as if they were natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even done them as a last minute need and my brows came out looking very well shaped.</li>
            <li>I had always found them to be the perfect long wearing pencil but disliked the wide application point and waste of product when sharpening, problem solved!</li>
            <li>It is very dark, yet remains a true brown.</li>
            <li>Be warned - this is NOT dark brown as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Bare MInerals and they were out of stock, so</li>
            <li>A final cool design perk is the firm mini brush on the end for finishing.</li>
            <li>Not sure why but the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; disappeared quickly in 2 pencils -</li>
            <li>Will work fine for medium to dark brown or black hair.</li>
            <li>I read that Julianne Hough&#x27;s make up artist uses this brow pencil in brunette for her dramatic eyebrows which I love.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t go back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because it is very delicate and breaks off easily if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>As a result I have spent a few minutes on the bathroom floor, more than once, hunting down the offender.</li>
            <li>The pencil&#x27;s Brunette shade appears to be black when applied, but it&#x27;s your decision as to how much to apply for a subtle or bold look.</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long, using it on an every day basis.</li>
            <li> This is a firm pencil that goes on in thin strokes and offers full coverage where my brows are sparse.</li>
            <li> This pencil works like a mechanical pencil and the makeup part is harder than regular eyebrow pencils.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually try new beauty products, as I seem to get &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; and return to what I am already using.  </li>
            <li> Last two purchases were extremely disppointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years  - tried other brands and have always come back to Kevyn Aucoin.</li>
            <li> Hate to call it a brow pencil because it&#x27;s so much more!</li>
            <li> Use mine every single day!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is not like other ones that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have tried powders,a lot of other pencils, &amp;#34;stay all day&amp;#34; paint with brushes and none met all the criteria.</li>
            <li> This is the only brow pencil I have found, anywhere, that has a fine lead (like an automatic pencil) for adding small \\&quot;brow hairs\\&quot; - all other pencils give me a very artificial look.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been using Bare MInerals and they were out of stock, so I decided to try something different..very very reluctantly. I love this pencil.&lt;br /&gt;First, I got it EARLY and secondly I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and the thin tip makes quick, even, strokes. The brush at the end is great. I use it both before and after I use the pencil side. Probably not the way it was intended but it works for me. I probably won&#x27;t go back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> This is the only brow pencil I have found, anywhere, that has a fine lead (like an automatic pencil) for adding small \\&quot;brow hairs\\&quot; - all other pencils give me a very artificial look.  I use this in conjunction with another pencil in another color which gives me a very natural look.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Brunette has more red hue than expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil, looks natural and is easy to use, I&#x27;ve tried them all and this pencil is no.1</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Previously I used Trish McEvoy brand.  For me they were equally good.  I could tell no difference. The pencil&#x27;s Brunette shade appears to be black when applied, but it&#x27;s your decision as to how much to apply for a subtle or bold look. Will work fine for medium to dark brown or black hair.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this product because it costs so much more than other eyebrow pencils I have used, but it is worth every penny.  This eyebrow pencil is not like other ones that I have used.  This one gives the most natural looking eyebrows.  I have tried the creamier eyebrow pencils as well as the powder and wax combo.  This pencil works like a mechanical pencil and the makeup part is harder than regular eyebrow pencils.  It draws on easily and really looks natural.  My eyebrows have gotten skimpy as I get older and this gives me the look of beautiful full eyebrows.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This pencil works well but it is not swoon worthy. I find it helpful to use when filling in sparse areas but not great with outlining the brow. It is a is a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the fact I don&#x27;t have to sharpen the pencil.  Easy to apply strokes to fill in the brow.</li>
            <li> The best precision eyebrow pencil ever! Love how you can create the look of fine hairs with this. So easy to use and more natural looking than powder.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a pencil that,fills in for sparse brows,thin to look like individual hairs,not waxy and stays on all day.This pencil meets all the requirements! I have tried powders,a lot of other pencils, &amp;#34;stay all day&amp;#34; paint with brushes and none met all the criteria.I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this brow pencil, only problem is that mine broke after 2 uses. I wish that the distributor would have just offered to send me a replacement, instead of receiving a refund.</li>
            <li> I read that Julianne Hough&#x27;s make up artist uses this brow pencil in brunette for her dramatic eyebrows which I love. It is my favorite pencil I&#x27;ve ever tried. Only problem is, how do I know when it&#x27;s running out and I need a new one? I guess I should buy one now just in case. Excellent pencil and love the brush on the other end.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I can get a nicely defined eyebrow.  Shipment and deliver is quick. Sometimes it is hard to apply - not all the time.  Had a problem once and the item was replaced immediately without question.  (This is not a complaint - just an observation:  Not sure why but the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; disappeared quickly in 2 pencils - I am beginning to think that it breaks and falls out, or it gets stuck inside.  I have had 3 pencils in a year and I don&#x27;t use that much.  All 3 &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; the lead.  I just ordered and received 2 more pencils so will keep a watch on what happens.)</li>
            <li> Great match to my eyebrow color!  Great products lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brow liner 3 times. I loved it the first time but the liner fell out of the holder within a week. I liked the product so much I decided to try again. It was perfect. This last time the pencil was broken when I got it and wouldn&#x27;t stay in the holder. This is frustrating since it is a great product. I may have to find a different seller. Could be the delicate packaging it needs.</li>
            <li> This pencil give you a nice fine point for feathering in brows. Very natural look if applied correctly. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great pencil for making your brows look natural and not drawn on.  I have red/brown hair and this pencil was a great match. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, no smear, can make fine hair like strokes for a more natural look, love this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased more than my share of brow pencils looking for the perfect one and for me this is it. The design is exceptional for making the finest lines (which helps to create the most natural and flawless look). The pencil isn&#x27;t sharpened but instead is extended and indeed has the finest point I&#x27;ve found in a brow pencil. I also appreciate not chewing up half my product in a sharpener as it repeatedly breaks off. I chose the color &amp;#34;Brunette&amp;#34; which is perfect in my opinion. It is very dark, yet remains a true brown. The texture of the pencil itself is also perfect, it has a hard wax consistency which I find preferable for the brow lines staying in place and not smearing. A final cool design perk is the firm mini brush on the end for finishing. In a word, perfection.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the texture of this pencil reminds me of the old red &amp;#34;Maybelline&amp;#34; pencil my Mom always wore and still available today. I had always found them to be the perfect long wearing pencil but disliked the wide application point and waste of product when sharpening, problem solved!</li>
            <li> I really like it. It looks very natural. I&#x27;ve had many eyebrow pencils and this by far has been the most natural looking. I have sparse eyebrows being that I am Asian. I do not like the unnatural colors for eyebrow pencils. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because it is very delicate and breaks off easily if you are not careful. I have learned to work with it so it does not break on me. It&#x27;s like a mechanical pencil if it is raised to high it will break. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t last long, using it on an every day basis.</li>
            <li> I have been using brow pencils for my white blond eyebrows for about 15 years and have never found a better pencil than this one. It goes on really nicely and naturally. I will never look back!</li>
            <li> Fills in sparse eyebrows with a nice feathery touch...</li>
            <li> Pricey for the short, single lead you get but does a very good job. Not refillable. Good staying power. Natural color.</li>
            <li> This is a firm pencil that goes on in thin strokes and offers full coverage where my brows are sparse.</li>
            <li> excellent for filling in thin brows</li>
            <li> I love this pencil but the color is not right for me. Too dark. Couldn&#x27;t find a med brown color. If I could, I would buy it</li>
            <li> I accepted the fact that I lost my mind to spend so much money on an eyebrow pencil, but after applying it and finding it stayed on, I feel it&#x27;s well worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny precision tip is wonderful to apply as you can truly make thin, more eyebrow hair looking strokes.  It stays on all day and comes right off with my makeup cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a terrible time finding a decent color since my previous pencil is no longer made.  I got the Kevyn Aucoin brunette and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used the brush on the end more than I expected.  Overall, I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I have very spare eyebrows and it fills them in as if they were natural. The &#x27;lead&#x27; is very very small so you can replicate those individual hairs and not over do it. I&#x27;ve even done them as a last minute need and my brows came out looking very well shaped. Love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This used to be best brow pencil on the market, but no longer. Last two purchases were extremely disppointing. The amount of &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; in the pencil has been reduced significantly - very disappointing. But, the worst thing is the &amp;#34; lead&amp;#34; now easily falls out of the pencil. If you are lucky and can find it - great, till next time. If not, then no recourse but to buy another pencil. This was never an issue with this pencil in the past. Have used for years with great satisfaction, but new design is faulty. This is a pricey pencil and has always been worth the price, but no longer.  Am so sad about this 😢.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all- brow kits, brushes, you name it. This is the only one I love, you get a really fine line that blends in with the eyebrows you have so it doesn&#x27;t look fake or require a lot of time to blend. Also the shade of brown is true and not reddish or off.</li>
            <li> Really a tool... A wonder</li>
            <li> The pencil point broke very easily.  I had to press hard to get any mark at all and point immediately broke.  I threw it in the trash after trying it once.</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually try new beauty products, as I seem to get &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; and return to what I am already using.  However, I have to say that this is, BY FAR, the best brow pencil I have ever used.  It isn&#x27;t like a crayon, so I can feather it up precisely, and when I use the attached brush, it makes my brows look completely natural.  It doesn&#x27;t smear and it stays on all day.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was four stars and I dropped it to three because the pencil&amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; falls out. This happened twice. Although I really like the product I won&#x27;t buy it again. It disappears!</li>
            <li> Be warned - this is NOT dark brown as advertised.  This is at best a medium brown. I can&#x27;t peak for quality as I cannot use the color - looks very fake and obvious against my dark brown eye brows.</li>
            <li> love the brow pensil....I use the blond and the brunette color. love them because they go on so nice! you will love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used. Blendable, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years  - tried other brands and have always come back to Kevyn Aucoin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Hate to call it a brow pencil because it&#x27;s so much more! Use mine every single day!</li>
            <li> I love this!  It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> Wonderful...perfect combination of color and tool.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great alternative to L&#x27;Oreal Microliner!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eyebrow pencil; it goes on easily, looks natural, and wipes off easily in the event of those 6am-on-the-way-to-work indiscretions. At the same time, KA packaging department needs to re-think the packaging; the thin brown strip easily becomes detached from its base inside the plastic. Worse, there is no cap to keep it from falling out. As a result I have spent a few minutes on the bathroom floor, more than once, hunting down the offender. Net net, the pencil is worth it, but make sure to store it horizontally.</li>
