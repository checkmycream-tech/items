            <li>My feet do look alot better than they did yesterday</li>
            <li>am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and then I used Diamancel and my heels are smooth!  </li>
            <li>Great product, really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I have ever tried on my calloused feet.</li>
            <li>If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  </li>
            <li>Just nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Good for smoothing feet, not so much for sloughing.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use, this is simply the most effective foot file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Now, for the price of one great pedicure, I have a tool that works just as well at home and will obviously last for years.    </li>
            <li>think I need something more powerful than something that makes one&#x27;s heels smooth.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>I also have the coarse file and it&#x27;s great too, can&#x27;t use it as often.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous buffer.</li>
            <li>my feet feel perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this foot file for more than five years and it still works just as well as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Great for in between visits to the Spa, to keep your feet looking and feeling like a fresh PEDI, until your next visit</li>
            <li>I use it after the shower when my feet are clean.</li>
            <li>My go to file, perfect enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to wear down at all even though I gave it a pretty good use!  </li>
            <li>First time in years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance</li>
            <li>I paid $50 for it and thought I was probably splurging on something that wouldn&#x27;t turn out to be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  </li>
            <li>Well, everyone was right.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many different things to get rid of the callus without success.  </li>
            <li>I did use the ped-egg first</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to use the ped-egg first anymore and will just use the Diamancel from now</li>
            <li>I kept putting off buying this since it seemed pretty pricey compared to the $5 ones I&#x27;ve been buying</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>I purchased an inexpensive soft toothbrush to clean the foot buffer.)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look strong enough to tackle my heels.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>Not so much...  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really reduce the calluses the way I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  </li>
            <li>if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t moisturize first like I normally do.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have grit in it, just a nice thick cream with refreshing peppermint for that extra pampered feeling.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.  </li>
            <li>Use it on dry feet for smooth results.</li>
            <li>Only weekly medical-grade pedicures kept them soft and comfortable but I can&#x27;t afford that luxury anymore.</li>
            <li>Previously, I was using foot files from the salon store - these cost anywhere from $5 to $15 per file and last a few months at best.</li>
            <li>It got rid of most of the callus on my heel in just three uses with few minutes each time.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one in case I ever lose my first one.</li>
            <li>Honestly, 5 minutes later and both calluses (the other on the outside of the foot, below the pinkie toe) were about halfway gone.  </li>
            <li>For those who want to cut to the chase, yes, this baby was able to work on a serious callus in pretty short order.  </li>
            <li>I only bought this cause people raved and said it fixed their really cracked heels.</li>
            <li>are as soft as a babies</li>
            <li>has completely make the cracks and callouses go away.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft.</li>
            <li>The ball of my foot has a major callus that I&#x27;ve tussled with all my adult life.  </li>
            <li>Use it on dry feet (yes really) before you shower and then slather on the lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>The UPS truck dropped it off and I literally sat right down and got to work with it.  </li>
            <li>Even so, a few minutes with this little beauty cleans things up right quick.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet in soft and under control especially during sandal season.</li>
            <li>I would use lotion every night and then, about once a week, soak in the hot tub, then use a high-quality sloughing lotion (not cheap), then use the foot file in the shower... nearly wear out my wrist and not come close to pedicure results.</li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny if you suffer from dry, rough and cracked heels.</li>
            <li>I saw improvement right away, but over the next few days I worked on each foot every day for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The thing is, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn&#x27;t stick properly, and is unsightly.  </li>
            <li>No dry skin or callousy skin forms later on.</li>
            <li>I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.  </li>

            <li> The thing is, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn&#x27;t stick properly, and is unsightly.  </li>
            <li> No dry skin or callousy skin forms later on.</li>
            <li> I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.  </li>
            <li> But I suggest if you have really thick callus build up that you go with the more heavy duty version of this buffer.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the ball spot had gotten to the point where the skin was so smooth and hard that even the blades couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anything, and slid right off.  </li>
            <li> Are you embarrassed to get a pedicure because your heels are dry and gross?  </li>
            <li> The answer actually is to put the padding NEXT to the callous - along the big toe down to the side of the ball of the foot.  </li>
            <li> The ball of your foot hurts, so your instinct is to put padding where it hurts, as I did for a long time myself.  </li>
            <li> Since the transfer is sending pressure away from the big toe and outwards, I&#x27;ve also developed a callus on the outside of the foot below the little toe, like a little tripod balance.  </li>
            <li> The foot then responds by building up dead skin, and mine gets thick quickly.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the blades have cut me a few times, but they have been the go-to tool to cut off thick skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hard heals, too much going barefoot.  </li>
            <li> The difference between this and any other foot buffer is that it actually removes the dead/dry/calloused skin instead of just ripping it to shreds.  </li>
            <li> I started out with dry feet and then thought I might try soaking my feet to soften up the skin.  </li>
            <li> Well, this thing says dry</li>
            <li> (I take care of the rest of my body while they dry.)</li>
            <li> Dry thoroughly and then put a glycolic cream on them.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a foot file that is to be used on DRY skin, but it is terrific - and worth the cost of the investment.</li>
            <li> It does take off lots of white dead skin but after using it tons of times, with Flexitol and socks, I realize it helps a little but never ever makes my feet fully soft, so</li>
            <li> I wait until they&#x27;re very dry.</li>
            <li> I seriously thought I would just have to live with it and just hide my feet.  </li>
            <li> I spent about 2 hours buffing and grinding with this tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading about \\&quot;rough heels\\&quot; and thinking \\&quot;I</li>
            <li> A lot of places incorrectly say it&#x27;s when your second toe (next to the big one) is longer than the big one, but this is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I may even invest in the other model (hopefully I can find that review again).  </li>
            <li> Gets off a lot of dry dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about dry cracked heels anymore unless I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and haven&#x27;t used it in a while.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t after slightly less cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive enough that you may not want to replace it daily.  </li>
            <li> It is the ONLY thing that has ever made a dent on my ridiculous feet.</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune on a variety of tools, lotions, creams etc to help with the roughness of my heels.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t oil my feet when wet from the shower like I usually do.</li>
            <li> I tried home electronic pedicure kits but they couldn&#x27;t do a thing for the thick dry skin on my heels.    </li>
            <li> But I figured with a little bit of elbow grease this model would work.  </li>
            <li> They need to be replaced ever few years, depending on how often you use them.</li>
            <li> Do you apologize as the technician uses a razor to scrape layers of dead skin off your feet?</li>
            <li> But way after they&#x27;ve dried thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The awful flakiness is gone, the cracks are now gone and my soles are starting to actually look pink!</li>
            <li> This removes a serious amount of dead skin!</li>
            <li> I did this with thick moleskin and couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it made.  </li>
            <li> Cover in thick socks and watch TV or something.</li>
            <li> Useless product and not worth the money</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I turned to this \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; - which is an innocuous name for a file that works seriously well.   </li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have tried everything else without results-- don&#x27;t despair.</li>

            <li> I only bought this cause people raved and said it fixed their really cracked heels. It does take off lots of white dead skin but after using it tons of times, with Flexitol and socks, I realize it helps a little but never ever makes my feet fully soft, so it&#x27;s kind of pointless. I wasn&#x27;t after slightly less cracked heels.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It got rid of most of the callus on my heel in just three uses with few minutes each time.  I have always had very thick callus on my heels.  Over the years I have tried many different things to get rid of the callus without success.  It is great to find a product that really does what it claims to do.  If you have problems with callus, get this product without hesistation.  It is comfortable to use as well; the handle has a nice cushion grip.  I also got the #20 buffer, but it does not seem to work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Love it use it all the time</li>
            <li> I should have probably gotten the buffer that someone referred to as a cheese grater for your feet as I do have alot of callus build up on the bottom of my feet.  But I figured with a little bit of elbow grease this model would work.  Not so much...  I spent about 2 hours buffing and grinding with this tool and it didn&#x27;t really reduce the calluses the way I had hoped.  I may even invest in the other model (hopefully I can find that review again).  I started out with dry feet and then thought I might try soaking my feet to soften up the skin.  Well, this thing says dry and that&#x27;s what it means!  Even though I dried my feet the buffer didn&#x27;t work very well on the moistened skin, it just kinda rolled up.  It started working better again as my feet got dryer.  My feet do look alot better than they did yesterday so this is definitely a good product.  It didn&#x27;t seem to wear down at all even though I gave it a pretty good use!  But I suggest if you have really thick callus build up that you go with the more heavy duty version of this buffer.</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune on a variety of tools, lotions, creams etc to help with the roughness of my heels.  I seriously thought I would just have to live with it and just hide my feet.  After reading reviews about Diamancel,  I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did.  I was amazed at how well it worked.  When I received it, I thought \\&quot;how can this thing help\\&quot;.  It didn&#x27;t look strong enough to tackle my heels.  Boy, was I wrong.  I did use the ped-egg first and then I used Diamancel and my heels are smooth!  First time in years! I have only used it once (tonight) since I just received it today but I was so impressed with how well it did after just one use, that I just had to review this.  I won&#x27;t have to use the ped-egg first anymore and will just use the Diamancel from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was done, I used Heel Genius Foot Cream and my heels are as soft as a babies bum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price scare you off.  It is well worth every penny if you suffer from dry, rough and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Great product, really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have ever tried on my calloused feet. I have purchased about four of these now. They need to be replaced ever few years, depending on how often you use them. But I used to have really bad cracked heels, and using this about four days a week has completely make the cracks and callouses go away. It&#x27;s pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to use, this is simply the most effective foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. My heels are prone to extreme cracks - painful and ugly. Only weekly medical-grade pedicures kept them soft and comfortable but I can&#x27;t afford that luxury anymore. Now, for the price of one great pedicure, I have a tool that works just as well at home and will obviously last for years.    Previously, I was using foot files from the salon store - these cost anywhere from $5 to $15 per file and last a few months at best. I would use lotion every night and then, about once a week, soak in the hot tub, then use a high-quality sloughing lotion (not cheap), then use the foot file in the shower... nearly wear out my wrist and not come close to pedicure results. I tried home electronic pedicure kits but they couldn&#x27;t do a thing for the thick dry skin on my heels.    Now, in just a few minutes, without a lot of trouble or effort, I can buff my heels to a comfortable state. (note: I purchased an inexpensive soft toothbrush to clean the foot buffer.) I was skeptical about a foot file that is to be used on DRY skin, but it is terrific - and worth the cost of the investment.</li>
            <li> None of the reviews here at the time of my purchase really answered what I wanted to know.  I&#x27;m reading about \\&quot;rough heels\\&quot; and thinking \\&quot;I think I need something more powerful than something that makes one&#x27;s heels smooth.\\&quot;    Still, I was torn between this, the Diamancel #11 and the #20 callus device.  The ball of my foot has a major callus that I&#x27;ve tussled with all my adult life.  The #20 looked like it might be akin to a cheese shredder and I already have devices like that- they do work, but leave your skins ripply and ripped up looking.  Maybe #20 was not as unkind as that, but maybe the #11 would be quite enough.  For those who want to cut to the chase, yes, this baby was able to work on a serious callus in pretty short order.  The UPS truck dropped it off and I literally sat right down and got to work with it.  Honestly, 5 minutes later and both calluses (the other on the outside of the foot, below the pinkie toe) were about halfway gone.  I can plainly see this works very quickly and will have these painful thick spots gone with a little more work, and leave my skin in much better shape.  If you have a ball of the foot callus, you might want to read on below for more thoughts, but if you just want to know if this buffer will work on a terminal stage callus, the answer is heck yeah.  - - - - - - - - - -   The recurrent callus on the ball of my one foot is the result of a Morton&#x27;s toe.  Not to bore you, but when you walk, the pressure gets transferred forward from your heel up to your big toe.  If that transfer doesn&#x27;t happen correctly, you end up moving the pressure to the ball of the foot.  The foot then responds by building up dead skin, and mine gets thick quickly.  Left to its own devices, that callus would allow me to tap dance barefoot if it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.  Since the transfer is sending pressure away from the big toe and outwards, I&#x27;ve also developed a callus on the outside of the foot below the little toe, like a little tripod balance.  Isn&#x27;t nature wonderful?   I have a freaking collection of files, rollers with blades, a flatter thing with a Solingen steel blade in it, a PediEgg, a knockoff of a PediEgg, acid laced callus discs and so on.  All have their merits and failings.  Most of the stuff files your skin, or acts like a cheese shredder.  For efficiency, the bladed items couldn&#x27;t be beat.  Yes, the blades have cut me a few times, but they have been the go-to tool to cut off thick skin quickly.  Unfortunately the ball spot had gotten to the point where the skin was so smooth and hard that even the blades couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anything, and slid right off.  That&#x27;s why I turned to this \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; - which is an innocuous name for a file that works seriously well.   If you get calluses on the ball of your foot, you might have a Morton&#x27;s toe too.  A lot of places incorrectly say it&#x27;s when your second toe (next to the big one) is longer than the big one, but this is wrong.  It&#x27;s an internal thing that has to do with bone lengths and is not always visble.  The ball of your foot hurts, so your instinct is to put padding where it hurts, as I did for a long time myself.  The answer actually is to put the padding NEXT to the callous - along the big toe down to the side of the ball of the foot.  Then that part of your foot hits the ground before the ball and takes the pressure in the right path.  I did this with thick moleskin and couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference it made.  The thing is, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy about doing this, as the moleskin gets wet with daily showering, doesn&#x27;t stick properly, and is unsightly.  It&#x27;s also expensive enough that you may not want to replace it daily.  I think the answer for me might be to get a full foot length insole and cut away most of the toe area, leaving just the big toe area down to aside of the ball, and shift it from shoe to shoe.  Anyway, if that doesn&#x27;t work well, no biggie, because this buffer is going to do a terrific job keeping the ball callus away.  Best wishes to fellow sufferers!  [If any issues arise regarding the longevity of the buffer, I&#x27;ll come back and edit.]</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works so well on my heels and I also use it when I give my hubby a pedi. Cleans him up nicely too.</li>
            <li> My go to file, perfect enough for daily use. Seems like it will last a long time. I also have the coarse file and it&#x27;s great too, can&#x27;t use it as often.</li>
            <li> Great for in between visits to the Spa, to keep your feet looking and feeling like a fresh PEDI, until your next visit</li>
            <li> Useless product and not worth the money</li>
            <li> Gets off a lot of dry dead skin.  I have very dry hard heals, too much going barefoot.  This had helped a lot.  May actually wear sandals this summer without being embarrassed of my feet!</li>
            <li> Works well but I think I should have got a stronger one.  I have tough feet in the summer!</li>
            <li> Do the soles of your feet resemble  pieces of ragged leather? Are you embarrassed to get a pedicure because your heels are dry and gross?  Have you tried foot files, buffers, graters, creams, lotions, ointments and scrubs? Do you apologize as the technician uses a razor to scrape layers of dead skin off your feet? Do you hope nobody in your yoga class notices your hideous feet? If you answered yes, this file is for you. It is the ONLY thing that has ever made a dent on my ridiculous feet. After receiving the file, I worked on each foot for about 10 minutes. I saw improvement right away, but over the next few days I worked on each foot every day for 5 minutes. The awful flakiness is gone, the cracks are now gone and my soles are starting to actually look pink! This tool is amazing! Seriously, if you have tried everything else without results-- don&#x27;t despair. This works! Socks no longer catch on the roughness, I can wear sandals with confidence, and lotions actually absorb into the skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous buffer. I kept putting off buying this since it seemed pretty pricey compared to the $5 ones I&#x27;ve been buying but everywhere I kept reading how great it is. Well, everyone was right. It is amazing. Keeps my feet in soft and under control especially during sandal season.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind on the market. I was replacing the one I purchased from 16 years ago.</li>
            <li> Works great on my calluses. Just wished there was a curved model.</li>
            <li> This file works miracles. My feet are the softest they have ever been! Love this file!</li>
            <li> Good for smoothing feet, not so much for sloughing.</li>
            <li> I bought this foot file at a spa after a pedicure in which it was used.  I paid $50 for it and thought I was probably splurging on something that wouldn&#x27;t turn out to be worth it.  I was wrong.  Even at $50, this thing is completely awesome and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  It&#x27;s good it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon.  The difference between this and any other foot buffer is that it actually removes the dead/dry/calloused skin instead of just ripping it to shreds.  If you want to do that, just grab some sandpaper - same difference.  This thing works.  I don&#x27;t worry about dry cracked heels anymore unless I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and haven&#x27;t used it in a while.  Even so, a few minutes with this little beauty cleans things up right quick.</li>
            <li> Effective  on callouses and the best I have seen.</li>
            <li> This is the second one in case I ever lose my first one. Can&#x27;t take a chance of not having this great buffer. My feet are so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this foot file for more than five years and it still works just as well as the first time I used it. Use it on dry feet (yes really) before you shower and then slather on the lotion afterwards. I love Foot Patrol by Bliss the best for this. It&#x27;s called an exfoliating cream but it doesn&#x27;t have grit in it, just a nice thick cream with refreshing peppermint for that extra pampered feeling. [[ASIN:B005S9S8Q6 Bliss Foot Patrol 2.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Use it on dry feet for smooth results. But do it over a trash can... This removes a serious amount of dead skin!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so gentle. I use it after the shower when my feet are clean. But way after they&#x27;ve dried thoroughly. I don&#x27;t oil my feet when wet from the shower like I usually do. I don&#x27;t moisturize first like I normally do. I wait until they&#x27;re very dry. (I take care of the rest of my body while they dry.) Then I get in there and work this tool. Rinse them off. Dry thoroughly and then put a glycolic cream on them. Cover in thick socks and watch TV or something. By the time I take my socks off to go to bed my feet feel perfectly smooth. And they&#x27;re not all chopped up the way a scraper leaves them. No dry skin or callousy skin forms later on. Just nice smooth skin. This is the best tool for finishing your heels. I love it.</li>
            <li> Best buffer ever!  Really!</li>
