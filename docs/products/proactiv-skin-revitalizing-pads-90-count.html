            <li>The package indicates that for the best results, you are to use Step 1 Skin Smoothing Exfoliator in the evening-I did not have this, so I did not practice this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have been using these face pads and we&#x27;re very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I was impressed</li>
            <li>Still, I don&#x27;t have great skin, so was eager to try these revitalizing pads.  </li>
            <li>That is a great idea.</li>
            <li>I experienced no itching.</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging uncovers wonderful products.  </li>
            <li>I have had no issues yet and was so very happy to see this doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; in any way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs or irritation, and I think my skin is looking more even-toned.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is a good product line</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;d say this garners 3 stars - it has retinol which is good for the skin</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;d say this garners 3 stars - it has retinol which is good for the skin</li>
            <li>Very interesting.</li>
            <li>some kind of glow, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a working Mother, I tend to put my family&#x27;s needs before my own.</li>
            <li>I first used this product at an ideal, testing time - in the midst of an acne breakout.</li>
            <li>Yes, some of the very fine lines aren&#x27;t as pronounced as before, but the wrinkles along the nasolabial folds, and the forehead are still crevices.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light, you do not feel as if you are wearing a moisturizer at all when you are wearing this product.</li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>If you search Amazon Beauty, you will find Retinol Cream 2 oz for $14, a much better deal.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the Proactiv+ Skin Revitalizing Pads.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>OK, not literally.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice the minimization of wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t think I have that many yet</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see notable pore size reduction yet.</li>
            <li>This product was ok</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the liquid and a 30 day supply of pads come in separate packs.</li>
            <li>I do wear sunscreen, but I have not noticed any more sensitivity to the sun using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion there are equally as effective acne treatments available at lower cost.</li>
            <li>I still think my skin looks firmer and more plump, but the acne was a bummer.  </li>
            <li>I hope your experiences are better.</li>
            <li>However, now that I have used this product, I plan to make taking care of my skin a more important priority in my life.</li>
            <li>The good news is that these pads didn&#x27;t really do me any harm.</li>
            <li>It seems to be an okay moisturizer, but with what your paying for, I thought there would be some significant difference to my skin...</li>
            <li>Good packaging, as every 30 days you pour a new bottle on to 30 pads in a plastic container.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I do have oily, pimple prone skin.</li>
            <li>SAID, I&#x27;m docking a star, because I haven&#x27;t had hugely visible results.</li>
            <li>Once we used our free sample, we went ahead and purchased another three month supply.</li>
            <li>This product is not a makeup remover, it is a moisturizer, unlike any I&#x27;ve used before because of how light it</li>
            <li>that this is being marketed as a cosmetic to improve skin appearance (minimize pores, smooth imperfections, etc.).</li>
            <li>Just felt like there was a light layer of product on it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s especially good for travelers because the pads do help remove the last traces of makeup and are very refreshing at night after a long day of traveling and/or</li>
            <li>Be sure you clean your face before using this product, Proactive suggests several products they make but any good face wash should do.</li>
            <li>The pads are lightly textured, so my skin feels clean after using.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and I (in our mid-40&#x27;s) have noticed significant improvements in our skin quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin looks like at the end of 90 days.</li>
            <li>However, there IS a unique feeling to the area after you apply the pads.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed the crisp, clean fill of the product which use at nighttime.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv+ has created a wonderful product to freshen up tired skin and to make a person feel better, after they&#x27;ve had a tiring day and want to sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I shake everything that I pour into another container) and then apply to a clean face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I clean my skin, you wipe your face and neck with a wipe.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I used the pads faithfully every night on clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These revitalizing pads contain Retinol and are marketed to &amp;#34;improve the appearance of fine lines, pores, and wrinkles&amp;#34; Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in 3 weeks, but then again I did not use it faithfully each night as for several days I was out of town and had forgotten to pack this</li>
            <li>After nightly use, her skin is not oily and the overall appearance is good.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to evaluate if after use for twenty days the solution is still effective.  </li>
            <li>I said, they do help remove the last traces of dirt and makeup and that is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still using the pads to finish out the full 90 days.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply the pads every evening before going to bed; just remember to wash your face first to remove residue, sunscreen, moisturizers, etc., so the pads can work to their full extent.</li>
            <li>That sensation went away quickly, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be reordering since the results are nice, but maybe not sixty-dollar nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these pads for 15 days now in place of my regular nighttime retinol cream (Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream) and have not seen any change in the appearance of fine lines, pores, or skin tone or feel.</li>
            <li>This keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as rough on your face as those face scrubs with giant honking chunks of stuff in them, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because those things seem to take off layers of skin, and that&#x27;s kind of concerning.</li>
            <li>This works ok so far</li>
            <li>As to the price point and whether it&#x27;s worth it -- over 60 dollars for a 90-day supply -- well that&#x27;s just going to be something for individuals to decide for themselves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a natural redhead and so have sensitivities to many things.  </li>
            <li>This equates to 3 months or 90 days&#x27; worth.</li>
            <li>But, to be fair it says to use it in a regimen with other Proactive products.</li>
            <li>Without all the other skin care products you&#x27;re supposed to use with these pads, isolating just the pads for review doesn&#x27;t seem fair.</li>
            <li>I liked the results much better - my skin was clear, soft, and supple the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some retinol-containing products are just too strong and cause a rash or irritation, but this product is mild enough for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pour the contents of one of the bottles over a stack of pads in a jar.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this on the outer portions of my face first, which tend not to be too acne-prone.  </li>
            <li>I decided to throw caution to the wind and put it on my entire face, then add my acne products on top in my problem areas.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and I have quit using foundation altogether since it is so hot and just gone to face powder only.</li>
            <li>Within the first 3-5 days of using the skin revitalizing pads</li>
            <li>first day I noticed smoother skin that stayed smoother and softer overnight.  </li>
            <li>The first week that I used this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great system because you set up 30 pads at a time so the rest don&#x27;t dry out, and the small container is super easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li>first cleaned my face with my normal, mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet brave enough to use it on the center of my face, where I can get cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>my skin is slowly looking better and better.</li>
            <li>Pads contain so many skin soothing ingredients, I was surprised that my sensitive skin tingles after using.  </li>
            <li>This is a very competent product that I think is just a little overpriced.</li>
            <li>I have always, even from a young age, been met with the comment you do not look that old, a matter of good genetics because it is the same for my mother and my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Something really smart this company does is bottle the solution and let you pour and soak the pads.  </li>
            <li>Three bottles of Proativ Skin Revitalizing Serum sit beside a large jar of Skin Revitalizing Pads.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not causing any major issues to my skin (no bad reactions).getting used to it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not causing any major issues to my skin (no bad reactions).</li>
            <li>So much that I stopped using it and therefore didn&#x27;t get the desired results.  </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything either.  </li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>The exfoliation did feel gentle to me.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in how my skin feels in just two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remove the lid from one of the bottles after shaking really well, and immerse the pads into the jar with serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gently pad your face and leave it on all night.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice that, but I could tell there was some product on my face.</li>
            <li>so they work to gently exfoliate the skin -</li>
            <li>This product comes with 3 glass bottles full of the revitalizing formula, Skin Revitalizing Solution; a jar, and two packages of pads (I am not sure how many pads are included, I did not count).  </li>
            <li>I saw nice results -- smoother skin -- within just a few days.</li>
            <li>I think this can happen sometimes when your skin gets very clean and devoid of oil, it reacts by breaking out.  </li>
            <li>There is a warning on the package that you may not be able to use it every day if it dries or reddens your skin--in that case you can use it every other day or so.</li>
            <li>You combine one set in the jar provided and your last pads are as fresh as the first ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pads did leave my skin feeling very clean, even without using the other products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, just different.</li>
            <li>Now that was somewhat surprising since the Proactive acne cleansing stuff that you get in the starter kit tended to make my face feel tight and make it extremely red for days on end.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an interesting application method, but it seems like a gimmick since there&#x27;s no reason that I can see that would require the fluid to be applied this way, plus the bottles/pads/pad container add up to a lot of extra packaging.</li>
            <li>instructions recommends using the Proactive + skin smoothing exfoliator prior and then using the Proactive + 3 step regimen in the morning for best results so this is product is part of an expensive system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular product is meant to be used once a day (evenings) for 30 days</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so I had really high hopes for the skin revitalizing pads</li>
            <li>--maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>and maybe I&#x27;m just picky or had expectations that were too high.</li>
            <li>I also have some fine lines, but I&#x27;m not really worried about those.</li>
            <li>I don’t know if I used the exfoliator side the first night, but I certainly did the second night.  </li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your skin feeling soft and  the smell is so much nicer than some products that smell like alcohol.</li>
            <li>You really want to be aware of this and especially if you are already sun sensitive, which I am.  </li>
            <li>For the first few nights, I did not apply moisturizer and my skin the next morning was ok.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have commented that they leave your skin feeling smooth -</li>
            <li>and then you start a new vial.</li>
            <li>however I often notice that I have a break out when I start a new product</li>
            <li>The first step to using this product is to break open one of the bottles.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt that Pro-Active works; The ingredients, including retinol, are pretty much standard problem skin care menu items.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Proactive products in the past and been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>My normal daily routine is a cleansing moisturizer, a mild exfoliator, and daily moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure it looks slick and professional, but the only thing that really counts is what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently mostly clear, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m coated in acne medicine</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and these haven&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for nearly a month, and I do like the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>And some people are sensitive to them.</li>
            <li>When I tell anyone how old I am</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with redness or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I can tell thus far.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my 2 pimples had dried up - interesting since this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an acne treatment.</li>
            <li>Rosacea flare-ups weren&#x27;t affected -- either for good or for ill.</li>
            <li>other words, expect this product to clean really deep.</li>
            <li>I have used lower priced (but still high priced) items and obtained the same results.</li>
            <li>They simply smooth on and have very little, if any, scent to them.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels better after starting this product only a few days ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see improvement in the appearance of my large pores, but so far there are only subtle differences, nothing significant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see improvement in the appearance of my large pores, but so far there are only subtle differences, nothing significant.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re supposed to use up or throw out what&#x27;s left after 30 days then start a new vial.</li>
            <li>This product did not cause my skin to overly dry out, or to become really oily.</li>
            <li>Cleans right down to the bone.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the extra money you&#x27;re spending on it as opposed to any other moisturizer?  </li>
            <li>I get occasional breakouts along my jawline and chin and since using these those breakouts have completely stopped.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had occasional adult acne</li>
            <li>so this wasn&#x27;t that big of a surprised</li>
            <li>Some nights I exfoliate my face, other nights I used a gentle cleanser before applying a wipe which you leave on your skin overnight, no other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>have dryer skin, some fine lines, a few wrinkles, but I have noticed that my skin is now slightly rough.  </li>
            <li>Next apply the Skin Revitalizing treatment before bed, using one pad ( should be pre-dampened ) covering your entire face, stay clear of your eyes because this will burn.</li>
            <li>He works outside for much of each day and as a result, his arms were in rough shape.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but if a company wants me to pay more than six times as much for basically the same ingredients as my regular skincare product, it had better give me six times the results, which this one fails to do.</li>
            <li>how well I will do with this long term because of my highly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>not so I just left it bare.</li>
            <li>After my first few days of use I had an acne break out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference yet, but I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if its long term use will benefit me enough to keep using but so far trust its not hurting.</li>

            <li> Good packaging, as every 30 days you pour a new bottle on to 30 pads in a plastic container.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I do have oily, pimple prone skin.</li>
            <li> SAID, I&#x27;m docking a star, because I haven&#x27;t had hugely visible results.</li>
            <li> Once we used our free sample, we went ahead and purchased another three month supply.</li>
            <li> This product is not a makeup remover, it is a moisturizer, unlike any I&#x27;ve used before because of how light it</li>
            <li> that this is being marketed as a cosmetic to improve skin appearance (minimize pores, smooth imperfections, etc.).</li>
            <li> Just felt like there was a light layer of product on it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s especially good for travelers because the pads do help remove the last traces of makeup and are very refreshing at night after a long day of traveling and/or</li>
            <li> Be sure you clean your face before using this product, Proactive suggests several products they make but any good face wash should do.</li>
            <li> The pads are lightly textured, so my skin feels clean after using.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I (in our mid-40&#x27;s) have noticed significant improvements in our skin quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin looks like at the end of 90 days.</li>
            <li> However, there IS a unique feeling to the area after you apply the pads.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed the crisp, clean fill of the product which use at nighttime.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv+ has created a wonderful product to freshen up tired skin and to make a person feel better, after they&#x27;ve had a tiring day and want to sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I shake everything that I pour into another container) and then apply to a clean face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I clean my skin, you wipe your face and neck with a wipe.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I used the pads faithfully every night on clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These revitalizing pads contain Retinol and are marketed to &amp;#34;improve the appearance of fine lines, pores, and wrinkles&amp;#34; Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in 3 weeks, but then again I did not use it faithfully each night as for several days I was out of town and had forgotten to pack this</li>
            <li> After nightly use, her skin is not oily and the overall appearance is good.  </li>
            <li> It is too early to evaluate if after use for twenty days the solution is still effective.  </li>
            <li> I said, they do help remove the last traces of dirt and makeup and that is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the pads to finish out the full 90 days.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply the pads every evening before going to bed; just remember to wash your face first to remove residue, sunscreen, moisturizers, etc., so the pads can work to their full extent.</li>
            <li> That sensation went away quickly, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be reordering since the results are nice, but maybe not sixty-dollar nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for 15 days now in place of my regular nighttime retinol cream (Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream) and have not seen any change in the appearance of fine lines, pores, or skin tone or feel.</li>
            <li> This keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as rough on your face as those face scrubs with giant honking chunks of stuff in them, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because those things seem to take off layers of skin, and that&#x27;s kind of concerning.</li>
            <li> This works ok so far</li>
            <li> As to the price point and whether it&#x27;s worth it -- over 60 dollars for a 90-day supply -- well that&#x27;s just going to be something for individuals to decide for themselves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a natural redhead and so have sensitivities to many things.  </li>
            <li> This equates to 3 months or 90 days&#x27; worth.</li>
            <li> But, to be fair it says to use it in a regimen with other Proactive products.</li>
            <li> Without all the other skin care products you&#x27;re supposed to use with these pads, isolating just the pads for review doesn&#x27;t seem fair.</li>
            <li> I liked the results much better - my skin was clear, soft, and supple the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some retinol-containing products are just too strong and cause a rash or irritation, but this product is mild enough for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pour the contents of one of the bottles over a stack of pads in a jar.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on the outer portions of my face first, which tend not to be too acne-prone.  </li>
            <li> I decided to throw caution to the wind and put it on my entire face, then add my acne products on top in my problem areas.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and I have quit using foundation altogether since it is so hot and just gone to face powder only.</li>
            <li> Within the first 3-5 days of using the skin revitalizing pads</li>
            <li> first day I noticed smoother skin that stayed smoother and softer overnight.  </li>
            <li> The first week that I used this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great system because you set up 30 pads at a time so the rest don&#x27;t dry out, and the small container is super easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li> first cleaned my face with my normal, mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet brave enough to use it on the center of my face, where I can get cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> my skin is slowly looking better and better.</li>
            <li> Pads contain so many skin soothing ingredients, I was surprised that my sensitive skin tingles after using.  </li>
            <li> This is a very competent product that I think is just a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have always, even from a young age, been met with the comment you do not look that old, a matter of good genetics because it is the same for my mother and my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Something really smart this company does is bottle the solution and let you pour and soak the pads.  </li>
            <li> Three bottles of Proativ Skin Revitalizing Serum sit beside a large jar of Skin Revitalizing Pads.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not causing any major issues to my skin (no bad reactions).getting used to it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not causing any major issues to my skin (no bad reactions).</li>
            <li> So much that I stopped using it and therefore didn&#x27;t get the desired results.  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything either.  </li>
            <li> Really like it</li>
            <li> The exfoliation did feel gentle to me.  </li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in how my skin feels in just two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remove the lid from one of the bottles after shaking really well, and immerse the pads into the jar with serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gently pad your face and leave it on all night.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice that, but I could tell there was some product on my face.</li>
            <li> so they work to gently exfoliate the skin -</li>
            <li> This product comes with 3 glass bottles full of the revitalizing formula, Skin Revitalizing Solution; a jar, and two packages of pads (I am not sure how many pads are included, I did not count).  </li>
            <li> I saw nice results -- smoother skin -- within just a few days.</li>
            <li> I think this can happen sometimes when your skin gets very clean and devoid of oil, it reacts by breaking out.  </li>
            <li> There is a warning on the package that you may not be able to use it every day if it dries or reddens your skin--in that case you can use it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> You combine one set in the jar provided and your last pads are as fresh as the first ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These pads did leave my skin feeling very clean, even without using the other products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, just different.</li>
            <li> Now that was somewhat surprising since the Proactive acne cleansing stuff that you get in the starter kit tended to make my face feel tight and make it extremely red for days on end.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an interesting application method, but it seems like a gimmick since there&#x27;s no reason that I can see that would require the fluid to be applied this way, plus the bottles/pads/pad container add up to a lot of extra packaging.</li>
            <li> instructions recommends using the Proactive + skin smoothing exfoliator prior and then using the Proactive + 3 step regimen in the morning for best results so this is product is part of an expensive system.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular product is meant to be used once a day (evenings) for 30 days</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so I had really high hopes for the skin revitalizing pads</li>
            <li> --maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> and maybe I&#x27;m just picky or had expectations that were too high.</li>
            <li> I also have some fine lines, but I&#x27;m not really worried about those.</li>
            <li> I don’t know if I used the exfoliator side the first night, but I certainly did the second night.  </li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your skin feeling soft and  the smell is so much nicer than some products that smell like alcohol.</li>
            <li> You really want to be aware of this and especially if you are already sun sensitive, which I am.  </li>
            <li> For the first few nights, I did not apply moisturizer and my skin the next morning was ok.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented that they leave your skin feeling smooth -</li>
            <li> and then you start a new vial.</li>
            <li> however I often notice that I have a break out when I start a new product</li>
            <li> The first step to using this product is to break open one of the bottles.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt that Pro-Active works; The ingredients, including retinol, are pretty much standard problem skin care menu items.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive products in the past and been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> My normal daily routine is a cleansing moisturizer, a mild exfoliator, and daily moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure it looks slick and professional, but the only thing that really counts is what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently mostly clear, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m coated in acne medicine</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and these haven&#x27;t bothered me at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for nearly a month, and I do like the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> And some people are sensitive to them.</li>
            <li> When I tell anyone how old I am</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with redness or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I can tell thus far.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my 2 pimples had dried up - interesting since this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an acne treatment.</li>
            <li> Rosacea flare-ups weren&#x27;t affected -- either for good or for ill.</li>
            <li> other words, expect this product to clean really deep.</li>
            <li> I have used lower priced (but still high priced) items and obtained the same results.</li>
            <li> They simply smooth on and have very little, if any, scent to them.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better after starting this product only a few days ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see improvement in the appearance of my large pores, but so far there are only subtle differences, nothing significant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see improvement in the appearance of my large pores, but so far there are only subtle differences, nothing significant.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re supposed to use up or throw out what&#x27;s left after 30 days then start a new vial.</li>
            <li> This product did not cause my skin to overly dry out, or to become really oily.</li>
            <li> Cleans right down to the bone.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the extra money you&#x27;re spending on it as opposed to any other moisturizer?  </li>
            <li> I get occasional breakouts along my jawline and chin and since using these those breakouts have completely stopped.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had occasional adult acne</li>
            <li> so this wasn&#x27;t that big of a surprised</li>
            <li> Some nights I exfoliate my face, other nights I used a gentle cleanser before applying a wipe which you leave on your skin overnight, no other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have dryer skin, some fine lines, a few wrinkles, but I have noticed that my skin is now slightly rough.  </li>
            <li> Next apply the Skin Revitalizing treatment before bed, using one pad ( should be pre-dampened ) covering your entire face, stay clear of your eyes because this will burn.</li>
            <li> He works outside for much of each day and as a result, his arms were in rough shape.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but if a company wants me to pay more than six times as much for basically the same ingredients as my regular skincare product, it had better give me six times the results, which this one fails to do.</li>
            <li> how well I will do with this long term because of my highly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> not so I just left it bare.</li>
            <li> After my first few days of use I had an acne break out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference yet, but I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if its long term use will benefit me enough to keep using but so far trust its not hurting.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s so smart because when I&#x27;ve bought these pad type products in the past, so often they are almost dried out even when I first open them and usually don&#x27;t last long moist otherwise,  This alleviates that issue.  </li>
            <li> Maybe all three products need to be used for results or maybe I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Her report; Yes, some early slight but visible effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Now, the Proativ+ didn&#x27;t make my face feel dry, it didn&#x27;t make it peel, and it didn&#x27;t make it red, so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> You get a jar of dry pads, extra pads, and three bottles of serum.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive, but well working product that was easy to figure out how to use and apply.  </li>
            <li> They also leave my skin feeling uncomfortably dry outside my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if this product only softens my skin and gets rid of the rough skin I think  I will adding it to my routine.</li>
            <li> Seriously gets down into the deep spots on your skin, and clears you right up.</li>
            <li> Open one bottle of the solution and pour it over and into the pad holder, the holder comes with 30 pads inside, the other 60 pads are bagged separately in the box.</li>
            <li> It does leave my face feeling dry, so I have to apply a moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Patted my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I have continued to use the product and no additional major breakouts have occurred in the few weeks</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I have continued to use the product and no additional major breakouts have occurred in the few weeks</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight tingling and minor stinging in my eyes even after taking extra care staying away from my eyes</li>
            <li> I actually got a skin compliment the other day!</li>
            <li> but if the solution becomes harsh of I notice any other effects, positive or negative, I will update.</li>
            <li> Expect it to exfoliate a bit too, because the texture of the pads themselves is fairly rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle with acne (4 decades).</li>
            <li> These pads aren&#x27;t as rough either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a month, and I have noticed no difference in my unevenly pigmented skin.  </li>
            <li> My Skin definitely looked and felt cleaner and clearer after a few days of using the product.</li>
            <li> Cap tightly, shake slightly back and forth not up and down</li>
            <li> only thing I did notice after a few weeks of using the product what that my skin was a little dry every morning</li>
            <li> After using the pads, he found his arms to be smoother and less dry.</li>
            <li> product it meant to be used in conjunction with other Proactiv+ products.  </li>
            <li> Also, retinol products increase sun sensitivity, so sunscreen or other protection from sun is recommended while using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> They work as well as any other product on the market that I&#x27;ve tried (Biore, Olay, Aveeno, MaryKay).</li>
            <li> Not seeing any noticeable difference in my skin from using these, other than feeling cleaner.  </li>
            <li> You get a little bottle of liquid, dry pads, and a container.</li>
            <li> I do notice less redness but not much on the other two</li>
            <li> These are pads for skin rejuvenation which contain an active ingredient, retinoids.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the price.</li>
            <li> But the last 3 nights I decided to let the solution sit on my face for 5 minutes until it dried and then applied my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and my husband has even used the pads on his arms, after wiping down his face.</li>
            <li> Revitalizing Pads come with a small jar for the pads, three sets of 30 dry pads, and three bottles of the retinol.</li>
            <li> These pads are not cleansers, so they are not designed to take off make-up or other products, and it would waste their effectiveness to treat them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a product we will continue to use.</li>
            <li> husband is suffers from adult acne and often has breakouts over his entire face.</li>
            <li> After about three weeks, I did notice that my skin became less oily during the day.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve used it less than 7 consecutive days.</li>
            <li> I had visibly less redness in my cheeks which have always been a problem area for me.</li>
            <li> The wipes are sealed and you need to put them in the little round tub that comes in the box.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to replace a round of filler or botox.</li>
            <li> skin does feel lighter in the few weeks that I have used this product at night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure all the additional botanical extracts (cucumber, chamomile, green tea, aloe) contribute anything but a little sizzle to the steak.</li>
            <li> So I will have to give it an update after having used it for at least 14 days without a missed day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to post an update after at least another month or at the end of the 90 days using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to post an update after at least another month or at the end of the 90 days using the product.</li>
            <li> Since using the pads, the acne has slowly gone away and he has not yet had another breakout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking at the cost of this it appears expensive, but when it is averaged out over a two or three month period, the time that I believe this will last me, I do not believe this is expensive.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think it is less expensive than my moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they tend to be irritating also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The container holds 30 pads, so it is broken up into 3 sets of 30 pads and three bottles.</li>
            <li> which would make me unable to use it.  </li>
            <li> This is a difficult item to review.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the revitalizing pads aren&#x27;t bad, they just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> After I read some of the reviews I was afraid it would</li>
            <li> The pad was disgusting to look at even after I washed my face with my usual face wash soap.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Nothing bad happened--no redness, peeling, or irritation.  </li>
            <li> So, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t completely awful acne, just a handful of annoying</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are pads for skin rejuvenation which contain an active ingredient, retinoids. This is a thing; retinoids are the only proven topical remedy for wrinkles. However, they tend to be irritating also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these to my girlfriend to try; she is 56 and a beauty but concerned about her skin. She used these according to directions for two weeks. Her report; Yes, some early slight but visible effect on wrinkles. But also, some reddening and skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the price of these pads - $65 bucks for 90 pads. If you search Amazon Beauty, you will find Retinol Cream 2 oz for $14, a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the Proactiv+ Skin Revitalizing Pads.  Now that was somewhat surprising since the Proactive acne cleansing stuff that you get in the starter kit tended to make my face feel tight and make it extremely red for days on end.  So much that I stopped using it and therefore didn&#x27;t get the desired results.  Now, the Proativ+ didn&#x27;t make my face feel dry, it didn&#x27;t make it peel, and it didn&#x27;t make it red, so that&#x27;s a plus.  However, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything either.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a couple of weeks daily, and my skin looks the same as ever.  It seems to be an okay moisturizer, but with what your paying for, I thought there would be some significant difference to my skin...some kind of glow, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, does the Proactiv+ work?  I guess.  Is it worth the extra money you&#x27;re spending on it as opposed to any other moisturizer?  Definitely not.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I (in our mid-40&#x27;s) have noticed significant improvements in our skin quality. Our faces look fresher, are not getting any acne or blemishes, and some wrinkle lines are reduced. It is easy to apply the pads every evening before going to bed; just remember to wash your face first to remove residue, sunscreen, moisturizers, etc., so the pads can work to their full extent. These pads are not cleansers, so they are not designed to take off make-up or other products, and it would waste their effectiveness to treat them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a product we will continue to use. Once we used our free sample, we went ahead and purchased another three month supply. Really like it and my husband has even used the pads on his arms, after wiping down his face.He works outside for much of each day and as a result, his arms were in rough shape. After using the pads, he found his arms to be smoother and less dry. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Okay. I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference yet, but I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month. Good packaging, as every 30 days you pour a new bottle on to 30 pads in a plastic container. This keeps it fresh. It does leave my face feeling dry, so I have to apply a moisturizer after. I hope this doesn&#x27;t reduce it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Cleans right down to the bone. OK, not literally. I&#x27;m exaggerating. I used these pads after doing some deep frying, and having my entire face feeling like a grease ball. The pad was disgusting to look at even after I washed my face with my usual face wash soap. Seriously gets down into the deep spots on your skin, and clears you right up. I tend to have oily skin, so this wasn&#x27;t drying to my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT SAID, I&#x27;m docking a star, because I haven&#x27;t had hugely visible results. Yes, some of the very fine lines aren&#x27;t as pronounced as before, but the wrinkles along the nasolabial folds, and the forehead are still crevices. Looks like I&#x27;ll have to suck it up and deal with those, or go sort out a plastic surgeon, because they&#x27;re stubborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, expect this product to clean really deep. Expect it to exfoliate a bit too, because the texture of the pads themselves is fairly rough. It&#x27;s not as rough on your face as those face scrubs with giant honking chunks of stuff in them, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because those things seem to take off layers of skin, and that&#x27;s kind of concerning. Don&#x27;t expect it to replace a round of filler or botox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious how well I will do with this long term because of my highly sensitive skin.  I have had no issues yet and was so very happy to see this doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; in any way.  After I read some of the reviews I was afraid it would which would make me unable to use it.  Something really smart this company does is bottle the solution and let you pour and soak the pads.  That&#x27;s so smart because when I&#x27;ve bought these pad type products in the past, so often they are almost dried out even when I first open them and usually don&#x27;t last long moist otherwise,  This alleviates that issue.  Please note as we are going into summer that it says you will need a sunscreen if using this.  You really want to be aware of this and especially if you are already sun sensitive, which I am.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use because I&#x27;d like to see if i can improve a couple of areas on my face.  The exfoliation did feel gentle to me.  It wasn&#x27;t bad but if the solution becomes harsh of I notice any other effects, positive or negative, I will update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle with acne (4 decades). I&#x27;m currently mostly clear, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m coated in acne medicine 24/7.  Still, I don&#x27;t have great skin, so was eager to try these revitalizing pads.  You get a jar of dry pads, extra pads, and three bottles of serum. You prepare/wet 30 pads at a time, and apply to your face at bedtime.  You don&#x27;t put anything else on your face, which made me hesitate. No acne meds? I decided to try this on the outer portions of my face first, which tend not to be too acne-prone.  I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs or irritation, and I think my skin is looking more even-toned. I&#x27;m not yet brave enough to use it on the center of my face, where I can get cystic acne.  So far, I like it.  Update, one month in:  I use this product nightly. I decided to throw caution to the wind and put it on my entire face, then add my acne products on top in my problem areas. Nothing bad happened--no redness, peeling, or irritation.  What did happen is my skin is slowly looking better and better. I actually got a skin compliment the other day!</li>
            <li> Proactiv+ has created a wonderful product to freshen up tired skin and to make a person feel better, after they&#x27;ve had a tiring day and want to sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had any type of end of the day beauty routine.  As a working Mother, I tend to put my family&#x27;s needs before my own. Skincare is very low on my list of priorities.  However, now that I have used this product, I plan to make taking care of my skin a more important priority in my life. This is an expensive, but well working product that was easy to figure out how to use and apply.  This product comes with 3 glass bottles full of the revitalizing formula, Skin Revitalizing Solution; a jar, and two packages of pads (I am not sure how many pads are included, I did not count).  The first step to using this product is to break open one of the bottles.  Then, you place all of one of the containers of the pads into the jar, and pour the bottle over it.  Cap tightly, shake slightly back and forth not up and down (this is my added step, it may not be necessary but I shake everything that I pour into another container) and then apply to a clean face.  The package indicates that for the best results, you are to use Step 1 Skin Smoothing Exfoliator in the evening-I did not have this, so I did not practice this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel lighter in the few weeks that I have used this product at night.  This product did not cause my skin to overly dry out, or to become really oily. I didn&#x27;t notice the minimization of wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t think I have that many yet so that is probably why.  This product does not have a sunscreen.  It goes on very light, you do not feel as if you are wearing a moisturizer at all when you are wearing this product. This product is not a makeup remover, it is a moisturizer, unlike any I&#x27;ve used before because of how light it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to spend on it, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like these. I like it that they have it set up so you can mix up your liquid with your pads every 30 days. That is a great idea. This stuff leaves your skin feeling soft and  the smell is so much nicer than some products that smell like alcohol. These pads aren&#x27;t as rough either. I can already tell a difference in my skin texture. My skin looks better and I have quit using foundation altogether since it is so hot and just gone to face powder only. I have fairly sensitive skin and these haven&#x27;t bothered me at all. Overall this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have been using these face pads and we&#x27;re very happy with the results. I get occasional breakouts along my jawline and chin and since using these those breakouts have completely stopped. Since I do not suffer from severe acne, I chose to only use one pad a day, at night after removing my makeup. This process has worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is suffers from adult acne and often has breakouts over his entire face. Since using the pads, the acne has slowly gone away and he has not yet had another breakout. This is a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> Nothing minimizes my crater-sized pores. I keep this in mind at all times, when dealing with products that claim to shrink your pores. So, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I do have oily, pimple prone skin. I use ProActive X out in the morning and I used these pads at night. After about three weeks, I did notice that my skin became less oily during the day. My skin had a noticeable glow and NOT a shine! I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin looks like at the end of 90 days.</li>
            <li> Contents of Box:&lt;br /&gt;3 glass bottles of Proactiv+ Solution&lt;br /&gt;3 packages of Revitalizing Pads (30 ct. each)&lt;br /&gt;1 reusable storage jar for moistened pads&lt;br /&gt;This product it meant to be used in conjunction with other Proactiv+ products.  I did not have those products, only the pads.  I have been using them for nearly a month, and I do like the way my skin feels.  The pads are lightly textured, so my skin feels clean after using.  It feels as if my skin is plumped up and that may help diminish the appearance of pores.  Since the Proactiv+ Pads contain so many skin soothing ingredients, I was surprised that my sensitive skin tingles after using.  That goes away after a bit, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with drying or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I wanted to try this product is because it&#x27;s supposed to help even out skin tone.  It&#x27;s only been a month, and I have noticed no difference in my unevenly pigmented skin.  Maybe all three products need to be used for results or maybe I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough.  I will finish up the three month supply and see if there&#x27;s any change.</li>
            <li> I tried these pads because I&#x27;ve always had HUMONGOUS pores on and around my nose. I also have super-sensitive skin &amp; rosacea. The good news is that these pads didn&#x27;t really do me any harm. Rosacea flare-ups weren&#x27;t affected -- either for good or for ill. However, after 1 month, I didn&#x27;t see any change in how my pores looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers said that the pads made their skin itch. I experienced no itching. However, there IS a unique feeling to the area after you apply the pads. I interpreted this feeling as &amp;#34;tiny bubbles&amp;#34; popping or fizzing. It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, just different.</li>
            <li> This Proactiv+ Skin Revitalizing Pads (90)  and (3) Bottles of Skin Revitalizing Solution are enough to treat your face for 90 days. Open one bottle of the solution and pour it over and into the pad holder, the holder comes with 30 pads inside, the other 60 pads are bagged separately in the box. Be sure you clean your face before using this product, Proactive suggests several products they make but any good face wash should do. Next apply the Skin Revitalizing treatment before bed, using one pad ( should be pre-dampened ) covering your entire face, stay clear of your eyes because this will burn. In the morning wash off with a damp wash cloth and if you&#x27;re set to go. I did notice a slight tingling and minor stinging in my eyes even after taking extra care staying away from my eyes but it didn&#x27;t last too long. My face looks and feels better after starting this product only a few days ago so I feel this treatment is helping me every day. Time will tell if its long term use will benefit me enough to keep using but so far trust its not hurting.</li>
            <li> This works ok so far but I don&#x27;t see notable pore size reduction yet. Its suppose to reduce wrinkles and redness too. I do notice less redness but not much on the other two it claims to help. But, to be fair it says to use it in a regimen with other Proactive products. Also I&#x27;ve used it less than 7 consecutive days. So I will have to give it an update after having used it for at least 14 days without a missed day.</li>
            <li> This product was ok but I feel for the price point I should have seen some results after use (for ~3 weeks).  It didn&#x27;t break out my skin but I didn&#x27;t observe any noticeable change.</li>
            <li> Some retinol-containing products are just too strong and cause a rash or irritation, but this product is mild enough for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pour the contents of one of the bottles over a stack of pads in a jar. Then wipe your face with a pad in the evening, and leave the product on overnight. I saw nice results -- smoother skin -- within just a few days. A set of &amp;#34;charged&amp;#34; pads should be used up within 30 days. There&#x27;s a 90-day supply (three bottles of product and 90 pads) in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure all the additional botanical extracts (cucumber, chamomile, green tea, aloe) contribute anything but a little sizzle to the steak. And some people are sensitive to them. Also, retinol products increase sun sensitivity, so sunscreen or other protection from sun is recommended while using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is being marketed as a cosmetic to improve skin appearance (minimize pores, smooth imperfections, etc.). As to the price point and whether it&#x27;s worth it -- over 60 dollars for a 90-day supply -- well that&#x27;s just going to be something for individuals to decide for themselves. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be reordering since the results are nice, but maybe not sixty-dollar nice.</li>
            <li> Within the first 3-5 days of using the skin revitalizing pads I had visibly less redness in my cheeks which have always been a problem area for me. I love the fact that the liquid and a 30 day supply of pads come in separate packs. You combine one set in the jar provided and your last pads are as fresh as the first ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did notice after a few weeks of using the product what that my skin was a little dry every morning but I use plenty of moisturizer but it wasn&#x27;t enough to stop me from using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for 15 days now in place of my regular nighttime retinol cream (Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream) and have not seen any change in the appearance of fine lines, pores, or skin tone or feel. They also leave my skin feeling uncomfortably dry outside my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an interesting application method, but it seems like a gimmick since there&#x27;s no reason that I can see that would require the fluid to be applied this way, plus the bottles/pads/pad container add up to a lot of extra packaging. Sure it looks slick and professional, but the only thing that really counts is what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but if a company wants me to pay more than six times as much for basically the same ingredients as my regular skincare product, it had better give me six times the results, which this one fails to do.</li>
            <li> My Skin definitely looked and felt cleaner and clearer after a few days of using the product. My only complaint would be the price. I have used lower priced (but still high priced) items and obtained the same results. This is a very competent product that I think is just a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> My only experience with Proactiv is television commercials and my daughter used it for blemishes in college for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond middle-age.  When I tell anyone how old I am I have always, even from a young age, been met with the comment you do not look that old, a matter of good genetics because it is the same for my mother and my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dryer skin, some fine lines, a few wrinkles, but I have noticed that my skin is now slightly rough.  My normal daily routine is a cleansing moisturizer, a mild exfoliator, and daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revitalizing Pads come with a small jar for the pads, three sets of 30 dry pads, and three bottles of the retinol. You shake the solution and pour it into the jar over the pads. The pads have an exfoliator side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I noticed smoother skin that stayed smoother and softer overnight.  I don’t know if I used the exfoliator side the first night, but I certainly did the second night.  I can really tell a difference in how my skin feels in just two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the cost of this it appears expensive, but when it is averaged out over a two or three month period, the time that I believe this will last me, I do not believe this is expensive.  In fact, I think it is less expensive than my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural redhead and so have sensitivities to many things.  I have not had any problems with this product.  I am an outdoors person.  I do wear sunscreen, but I have not noticed any more sensitivity to the sun using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this product only softens my skin and gets rid of the rough skin I think  I will adding it to my routine.</li>
            <li> This is a difficult item to review.  Without all the other skin care products you&#x27;re supposed to use with these pads, isolating just the pads for review doesn&#x27;t seem fair. You are supposed to use these pads nightly AFTER using Pro-active&#x27;s Exfoliator ($40) and then follow up with their 3 Step program Kit ($60).  So at a minimum this is a $160 investment. There is no doubt that Pro-Active works; The ingredients, including retinol, are pretty much standard problem skin care menu items.  These pads did leave my skin feeling very clean, even without using the other products.  In my opinion there are equally as effective acne treatments available at lower cost.</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging uncovers wonderful products.  Three bottles of Proativ Skin Revitalizing Serum sit beside a large jar of Skin Revitalizing Pads.  An extra set of pads are also included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the lid from one of the bottles after shaking really well, and immerse the pads into the jar with serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the crisp, clean fill of the product which use at nighttime.  Gently pad your face and leave it on all night.  Fights oily buildup that can occur overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for all ages.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a way to tighten my pores.  The first week that I used this product I was impressed, my skin looked tighter, it had a youthful glow about it.  After 7 days I started breaking out around my nose and mouth.  I think this can happen sometimes when your skin gets very clean and devoid of oil, it reacts by breaking out.  I plan to stick with it and will update if the acne improves.  I still think my skin looks firmer and more plump, but the acne was a bummer.  It wasn&#x27;t completely awful acne, just a handful of annoying blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I clean my skin, you wipe your face and neck with a wipe.  The wipes are sealed and you need to put them in the little round tub that comes in the box.  You pour one bottle over the pads and use those thirty pads before opening another set.  Some nights I exfoliate my face, other nights I used a gentle cleanser before applying a wipe which you leave on your skin overnight, no other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product contains retinol and is packaged with 3 bottles and 3 sets of pads in order to improve the effectiveness of the Retinol solution.  My wife has only been using the product for a few days but the results look promising.  She has oily skin and wrinkles and her skin is no longer taut.  After nightly use, her skin is not oily and the overall appearance is good.  It seems to be improving the look of her enlarged pores and overall skin texture.  It is too early to evaluate if after use for twenty days the solution is still effective.  The overall quality of her skin is definitely improved</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a good product line so I had really high hopes for the skin revitalizing pads--maybe my expectations were too high. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the revitalizing pads aren&#x27;t bad, they just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have the standard combo skin type and wanted to use the pads to see if I could reduce the pore size of the skin on my nose and chin. I also have some fine lines, but I&#x27;m not really worried about those. Anyway, I used the pads faithfully every night on clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way the product is set up. You get a little bottle of liquid, dry pads, and a container. You put the pads in the container, shake up the liquid and pour the liquid over the pads. The container holds 30 pads, so it is broken up into 3 sets of 30 pads and three bottles. It&#x27;s a great system because you set up 30 pads at a time so the rest don&#x27;t dry out, and the small container is super easy to pack for trips. I think it&#x27;s especially good for travelers because the pads do help remove the last traces of makeup and are very refreshing at night after a long day of traveling and/or meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, they do help remove the last traces of dirt and makeup and that is good. However, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all. There is a warning on the package that you may not be able to use it every day if it dries or reddens your skin--in that case you can use it every other day or so. I have fairly sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with redness or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the pads to finish out the full 90 days. Maybe it will just take a couple of months for a noticeable improvement in my skin. If I do see a change, I&#x27;ll return to this review and document it. As it is, I have not seen any difference. Sorry--maybe it&#x27;s just me and maybe I&#x27;m just picky or had expectations that were too high. I hope your experiences are better.</li>
            <li> I first used this product at an ideal, testing time - in the midst of an acne breakout. Not too severe, just the monthly, hormonally-induced arrival. The product arrives with three bottles of solution, three packages of 30 pads, and one container. This equates to 3 months or 90 days&#x27; worth. The instructions say to place 30 pads in the plastic container and pour one bottle of solution over it and to use them all within 30 days. I suppose because its effectiveness dwindles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first cleaned my face with my normal, mild cleanser. Patted my skin dry. Then applied one pad all over my face. At this time I was unsure if I could apply moisturizer or not so I just left it bare. The next morning, my 2 pimples had dried up - interesting since this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an acne treatment. For the first few nights, I did not apply moisturizer and my skin the next morning was ok. But the last 3 nights I decided to let the solution sit on my face for 5 minutes until it dried and then applied my usual moisturizer. I liked the results much better - my skin was clear, soft, and supple the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommends using the Proactive + skin smoothing exfoliator prior and then using the Proactive + 3 step regimen in the morning for best results so this is product is part of an expensive system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: water, polusorbate 20. etjpxydiglycol, retinol, cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract, chamomila recutita (matricaria) flower extract, camelia sinensis leaf extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, sodium hyaluronate, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, sorbic acid</li>
            <li> nothing groundbreaking here that I can tell thus far. I&#x27;ve used Proactive products in the past and been pleased with them. They work as well as any other product on the market that I&#x27;ve tried (Biore, Olay, Aveeno, MaryKay). This particular product is meant to be used once a day (evenings) for 30 days and then you start a new vial. These revitalizing pads contain Retinol and are marketed to &amp;#34;improve the appearance of fine lines, pores, and wrinkles&amp;#34; Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in 3 weeks, but then again I did not use it faithfully each night as for several days I was out of town and had forgotten to pack this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also do not give the cooling (or burning) sensation that you often get with a freshner/toner. They simply smooth on and have very little, if any, scent to them. (which I like!) Other reviewers have commented that they leave your skin feeling smooth - I didn&#x27;t really notice that, but I could tell there was some product on my face. I want to say it felt sort of sticky, but then when I actually felt my face with my fingers it did not feel sticky. Just felt like there was a light layer of product on it. That sensation went away quickly, though. I do like the fact that these have the retinol in them and will continue to use until I&#x27;ve gone through all 3 vials (which is a 90 day supply - you&#x27;re supposed to use up or throw out what&#x27;s left after 30 days then start a new vial. Very interesting. I suppose that has something to do with the chemicals losing their potency, but then I&#x27;m not a chemist so that&#x27;s just a guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads have a texture to them so they work to gently exfoliate the skin - can&#x27;t really go wrong with that. After my first few days of use I had an acne break out. Now I&#x27;m 50 and I&#x27;ve always had occasional adult acne so this wasn&#x27;t that big of a surprised and I can&#x27;t definitely say it was caused by these pads. however I often notice that I have a break out when I start a new product and my skin is getting used to it. Anyhow, I have continued to use the product and no additional major breakouts have occurred in the few weeks I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;m hoping to see improvement in the appearance of my large pores, but so far there are only subtle differences, nothing significant.  I&#x27;ll have to post an update after at least another month or at the end of the 90 days using the product. For now, I&#x27;d say this garners 3 stars - it has retinol which is good for the skin and it&#x27;s not causing any major issues to my skin (no bad reactions).getting used to it.
