    <ol>
            <li>, this lotion is awesome!</li>
            <li>Goes on silky and gives wonderful goldon color.</li>
            <li>Smells great too!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li>Best tanning lotion ever!</li>
            <li>20 something dollars and 50 dollars is nothing to pay for these lotions, because they are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a non greasy formula that provides a pleasant after tan smell and feel, coupled with \\&quot;cell speak\\&quot; which softens and bronzes the skin.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pricy, but great product.</li>
            <li>$, they make the skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>The compliments I receive are amazing.</li>
            <li>My Mom even tried it and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t rate the lotion quality</li>
            <li>I used to own a tanning salon</li>
            <li>I love how this product doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, but works just as well or even better than a tingle!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent and no nasty after tan smell!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self was very smooth and non-oily.</li>
            <li>(a.k.a you feel like you are getting a better deal).</li>
            <li>I might buy this product again if something better or more interesting does not come out to try.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast, smells great [limes]</li>
            <li>(when you work with them all the time you know most of them by scent)</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love this lotion but the pump never pumps like it</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>The technology and ingredients in the Cypher lotions are top of the line, and prove to be more advanced than the rest of the 2011 tanning lotion competitors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinnned and this product really helps me achieve a great tan!</li>
            <li>This lotion is the most advanced I have tried this year.  </li>
            <li>I used this lotion for the first time today, and it is the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>The step 2 Dark tAn optimizer smells like limes, how wonderful :)</li>
            <li>I feel like I paid full price for 1 shoe!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly happy with the color I achieved after one use and for the first time I found a product that really didn&#x27;t make me smell like a tanning bed when I was done.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced tanner who purchased this product several weeks ago.</li>
            <li>The bottle was \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;, it smelled fantastic, and the lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure who got the best of me...</li>
            <li>I personally like feeling like I am getting the most for my money, however it is nice to be pampered with the newest luxury lotions on the market from time to time.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks great and the lotion does not leave your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely ridiculous even though its a great effective product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Seller :)</li>
            <li>and I got a full bottle, sealed in shrink wrap.  </li>
            <li>Fair warning, if you are sensitive to certain products I would NOT advise getting this.</li>
            <li>SO glad I didn&#x27;t end up buying it, because something in the ingredients actually irritated my skin and it turned bright red and itchy!</li>
            <li>None the less, it&#x27;s still a good product, just not what I ordered or wanted</li>
            <li>Great product, worth the money- at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>just because regular bottles utilize space better.    </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to open up the top yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was my first California tanning product</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t really many left around now that haven&#x27;t been run out by the chains.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve achieved my first step in the tanning process I began to use the Optimizer.</li>
            <li>I can still pass for the mid forties especially now with my skin so brown and bright.</li>
            <li>Someone is just taking their discount, buying from their distributor, and selling a much slimmer margin than your salon (which needs to sell lotions at the margins they do to pay the bills and keep the doors open, tons more</li>
            <li>(I purchased from another site that ive had good luck with in the past, not Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to run out fast</li>
            <li>Completely misrepresented!!!  </li>
            <li>I refuse to pay the normal salon price which is over $100!</li>
            <li>G NEW for 2011!</li>
            <li>There are many lotions out there that do a similar job (such as get you tan) without the \\&quot;filet\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>Black market much!!!!</li>
            <li>I tease my girls that what they pay for in a tanning salon I get for free of course minus the cost of the lotion.</li>
            <li>I ordered the NEW for 2011 CypherTM</li>
            <li>It was a new one to the Cypher collection.</li>
            <li>Mike was wonderful, but I do have to say that I unfortunatley will probably not use the lotions due to still being nervous that something is wrong with them.</li>
            <li>I used it twice and threw the rest away because I was very concerned about what was really in the bottle seeing how my \\&quot;new un-opened bottle\\&quot; was either used or California products make pretty bottles to cover there less than \\&quot;partial\\&quot; product they supply.</li>
            <li>The next day I got ready to apply my lotion and</li>
            <li>WOW I can&#x27;t believe anyone would even think about buying something your going to put on your skin having no idea where in the world</li>
            <li>It gets you super dark</li>
            <li>(Am seriously grateful I was able to sample before buying.</li>
            <li>This is better than paint it black or any other tanning lotion i&#x27;ve used in the almost 4 years that i&#x27;ve been tanning.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had nothing but success with California Tan&#x27;s Cypher products I was anxious to try this new bronzer.</li>
            <li>if im getting my moneys worth due to what I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>i really like this product from the non-tanning scent to how dark it makes me and you will be darker the day after you tan from this product.</li>
            <li>But be forewarned look at the content amount, because its not very much just like the cypher bottle due to the extreme amount of fine fragrance, tanner, and collagen-esque product ingredients within it.    </li>

            <li> Needless to say I was less than pleased with my \\&quot;un-opened NEW product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I finally looked inside the bottle to find my bottle was less then 1/2 full or my bottle was less than 1/2 empty depending on how you want to look at things.</li>
            <li> should (and this is my second bottle), it only spits out a little at a time - take forever to get enough.</li>
            <li> When going to Palm Beach or some other big box chain store, I&#x27;ll buy from Amazon and take the $100 per bottle savings.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve tried about 10 other products since then and they all fell short of my expectations in a lotion after trying this one.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for very long and can&#x27;t get the lotion out anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought the cypher facial bronzer and step 2 dark tan optimizer at the salon for $75 and over 100</li>
            <li> I have always been very skeptical about whether or not tanning lotions actually do what they say they are meant to do, but this one clearly works very well.</li>
            <li> and then the second time i purchased it i received a half empty bottle.  </li>
            <li> just to name a few of the ones I like that do a similar job.    </li>
            <li> The price is reflective of its technilogical superiority over the other brands and lotion lines, but its like eating a filet or a NY strip.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is put up with the small bit of fat and you have a bigger piece of filet</li>
            <li> I will not order anymore due to this.</li>
            <li> When signing up for Palm Beach Tan, the employee who was walking me through their various lotions had me try this one on my hand as a small sample.</li>
            <li> Step2 Dark Tan Optimizer in the purple bottle, but</li>
            <li> Step 2 Dark Tan Optimizer By California Tan</li>
            <li> Like Millenium&#x27;s Blackest Black, Paint it Black; Designer skin&#x27;s Luminary, Black, Mood (tingle) etc.</li>
            <li> Very little needs to be applied.</li>
            <li> I was shipped the wrong product (Cypher Step1 in blue bottle)&amp; did not realize it was not what I ordered until after I sampled it to see what it smelled like.</li>
            <li> I have been using CT exclusively for years- not to date my self, but for over 20 at least....</li>
            <li> The reviews saying it isn&#x27;t real are a load of crap.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this packaging but its difficult</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine how horrible it would have been if i had put this on my entire body!)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this incident has made me cautious about buying tanning products from Amazon; which I have done for years!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the packaging of this lotion that&#x27;s terrible or the seller I purchased from.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s disgusting!!)</li>
            <li> Also The Cypher Face is had purchased along with thit bottle, smells awful....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A lot of reviews focus on the amount.  There is only 6.8 oz! Don&#x27;t expect 12 oz. just because regular bottles utilize space better.    The technology and ingredients in the Cypher lotions are top of the line, and prove to be more advanced than the rest of the 2011 tanning lotion competitors.  It&#x27;s a non greasy formula that provides a pleasant after tan smell and feel, coupled with \\&quot;cell speak\\&quot; which softens and bronzes the skin.  This lotion is the most advanced I have tried this year.  The price is reflective of its technilogical superiority over the other brands and lotion lines, but its like eating a filet or a NY strip.  All you have to do is put up with the small bit of fat and you have a bigger piece of filet (a.k.a you feel like you are getting a better deal). I personally like feeling like I am getting the most for my money, however it is nice to be pampered with the newest luxury lotions on the market from time to time.  I do not use this lotion every time I go to tan, but on the days I want to feel pampered, I am using it.     There are many lotions out there that do a similar job (such as get you tan) without the \\&quot;filet\\&quot; feeling. Like Millenium&#x27;s Blackest Black, Paint it Black; Designer skin&#x27;s Luminary, Black, Mood (tingle) etc. just to name a few of the ones I like that do a similar job.    If you want perfume, go for Australia Gold&#x27;s Vogue.  But be forewarned look at the content amount, because its not very much just like the cypher bottle due to the extreme amount of fine fragrance, tanner, and collagen-esque product ingredients within it.    I might buy this product again if something better or more interesting does not come out to try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the packaging of this lotion that&#x27;s terrible or the seller I purchased from. (I purchased from another site that ive had good luck with in the past, not Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to run out fast or maybe it&#x27;s just the packaging.

I like the idea of this packaging but its difficult and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to open up the top yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then the packaging, this lotion is awesome! Goes on silky and gives wonderful goldon color. My Mom even tried it and really liked it. She said she saw results from it as well.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent and no nasty after tan smell! Did not leave me feeling sticky or greasy eiether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to buy this lotion again, but im unsure if im getting my moneys worth due to what I mentioned above. I refuse to pay the normal salon price which is over $100! Absolutely ridiculous even though its a great effective product.</li>
            <li> This is better than paint it black or any other tanning lotion i&#x27;ve used in the almost 4 years that i&#x27;ve been tanning. Absorbs fast, smells great [limes] and there&#x27;s no after tan smell. It gets you super dark and I will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, but works just as well or even better than a tingle! Thanks Seller :)</li>
            <li> It doesnt streak or leave an orange tint. I&#x27;m very fair-skinnned and this product really helps me achieve a great tan!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the first time today, and it is the best I have tried so far. I have always been very skeptical about whether or not tanning lotions actually do what they say they are meant to do, but this one clearly works very well. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I ordered the NEW for 2011 CypherTM Step2 Dark Tan Optimizer in the purple bottle, but I was shipped the wrong product (Cypher Step1 in blue bottle)&amp; did not realize it was not what I ordered until after I sampled it to see what it smelled like. None the less, it&#x27;s still a good product, just not what I ordered or wanted</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cypher in the purple &#x27;as pictured&#x27; but when i received the product it was the blue container, next level under the purple, and did not have bronzer.  Completely misrepresented!!!  I will not order anymore due to this.</li>
            <li> When signing up for Palm Beach Tan, the employee who was walking me through their various lotions had me try this one on my hand as a small sample. SO glad I didn&#x27;t end up buying it, because something in the ingredients actually irritated my skin and it turned bright red and itchy! Fair warning, if you are sensitive to certain products I would NOT advise getting this. (Am seriously grateful I was able to sample before buying. Can&#x27;t imagine how horrible it would have been if i had put this on my entire body!) I went with the hypoallergenic products from Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Botanica line instead.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced tanner who purchased this product several weeks ago. It was my first California tanning product and I was very excited to try it. The bottle was \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;, it smelled fantastic, and the lotion it&#x27;s self was very smooth and non-oily. It was everything I had ever heard about California products. I was pleasantly happy with the color I achieved after one use and for the first time I found a product that really didn&#x27;t make me smell like a tanning bed when I was done. I couldn&#x27;t wait to go back the next day and use it again. The next day I got ready to apply my lotion and the pump wouldn&#x27;t work; not a big deal, these things happen. With my \\&quot;5 minutes\\&quot; ticking I rushed to open the bottle and shake some on my hand. I kept shaking and shaking and nothing came out. I finally looked inside the bottle to find my bottle was less then 1/2 full or my bottle was less than 1/2 empty depending on how you want to look at things. With time still ticking I put the lid on, beat the bottle, and finally got enough lotion out to apply it; just as my time started. Needless to say I was less than pleased with my \\&quot;un-opened NEW product\\&quot;. I honestly can&#x27;t rate the lotion quality it&#x27;s self. I used it twice and threw the rest away because I was very concerned about what was really in the bottle seeing how my \\&quot;new un-opened bottle\\&quot; was either used or California products make pretty bottles to cover there less than \\&quot;partial\\&quot; product they supply. Unfortunately, this incident has made me cautious about buying tanning products from Amazon; which I have done for years! I&#x27;m not sure who got the best of me...I feel like I paid full price for 1 shoe!</li>
            <li> WOW I can&#x27;t believe anyone would even think about buying something your going to put on your skin having no idea where in the world it  came from! You have no way of knowing if the stuff is expired and growing mold and putting mold on your skin (this can happen I have seen it and it&#x27;s disgusting!!) or it could just be overpriced Jergins... do yourself a favor and pay the extra money and buy it in a certified tanning salon...ESPECIALLY since only certified tanning salons are even allowed to order from Cal Tan! Black market much!!!! This is gross, just gross!!!!</li>
            <li> I had written a concerned e-mail to the seller about they quality of the lotions. I was contected same day and was reassured that their products are legit and so on. Mike was wonderful, but I do have to say that I unfortunatley will probably not use the lotions due to still being nervous that something is wrong with them. How ever, I am a worrier. By no means a reflection on the service I recieved, was given everthing as promised. Also The Cypher Face is had purchased along with thit bottle, smells awful....anyone else use that and thought the same thing? The step 2 Dark tAn optimizer smells like limes, how wonderful :)</li>
            <li> I bought the cypher facial bronzer and step 2 dark tan optimizer at the salon for $75 and over 100$, they make the skin feel amazing. Amazons prices are exellent 20 something dollars and 50 dollars is nothing to pay for these lotions, because they are great. They have  coq10 in it the which helps improve skin.[[ASIN:B004BGL89G NEW for 2011! CypherTM Step 2 Dark Tan Optimizer By California Tan 6.8 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> i really like this product from the non-tanning scent to how dark it makes me and you will be darker the day after you tan from this product. Very satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> So there isn&#x27;t a lot in the bottle, but you know that going in. It&#x27;s the case with all these products. The reviews saying it isn&#x27;t real are a load of crap. I used to own a tanning salon and I know the mark ups on these products and what they can be had for based on the retail price. Someone is just taking their discount, buying from their distributor, and selling a much slimmer margin than your salon (which needs to sell lotions at the margins they do to pay the bills and keep the doors open, tons more overhead)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy local from a local salon owner if going to their place. There aren&#x27;t really many left around now that haven&#x27;t been run out by the chains. When going to Palm Beach or some other big box chain store, I&#x27;ll buy from Amazon and take the $100 per bottle savings. People did it to me all the time when I owned my place, and if it was a legit brand and product I never told them they couldn&#x27;t use it in my beds. I only ever found a refilled bottle one time. (when you work with them all the time you know most of them by scent)</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a total of 3 times.  Once from my salon for an arm and a leg and then the second time i purchased it i received a half empty bottle.  After that I didn&#x27;t purchase this product again for about a year.  However I&#x27;ve tried about 10 other products since then and they all fell short of my expectations in a lotion after trying this one.  So this 3rd time I tried again and I got a full bottle, sealed in shrink wrap.  I&#x27;ll never use another lotion again!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love? Kind of pricy, but great product. I have been using CT exclusively for years- not to date my self, but for over 20 at least....Great product, worth the money- at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but the pump never pumps like it should (and this is my second bottle), it only spits out a little at a time - take forever to get enough.</li>
            <li> I will not start my summer tanning without California Tan products. I bought the Optimizer about three weeks ago. It was a new one to the Cypher collection. Since I&#x27;ve had nothing but success with California Tan&#x27;s Cypher products I was anxious to try this new bronzer. After I&#x27;ve achieved my first step in the tanning process I began to use the Optimizer. Well I can&#x27;t explain the tan I have! !!!  I used  this bronzer out in the sun for maybe 4-5 days and I have to say I already have the tan of my life. The compliments I receive are amazing. My skin looks great and the lotion does not leave your skin feeling dry.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and I must say that these products did not turn my skin into a leathery look or feel. I can still pass for the mid forties especially now with my skin so brown and bright. I tease my girls that what they pay for in a tanning salon I get for free of course minus the cost of the lotion. I&#x27;m tanner than I have ever been. Now my girls sit outside with me and tan using the Optimizer.  Very little needs to be applied. The product smells and feels terrific. I can&#x27;t wait until I get out in the sun and continue to get darker or even maintain the tan I have now! !! It&#x27;s also a terrific moisturizer. A MUST HAVE for your tanning regiment.</li>
