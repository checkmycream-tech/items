            <li>Quick Shipment and Good material</li>
            <li>The shipping was okay being that fact that its coming from overseas.</li>
            <li>These were my first pair of jogger pants and they&#x27;re actually nice.</li>
            <li>but these fit so well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>the Quality is cheap</li>
            <li>the multiple pockets let me carry a lot just a great pair of pants when I&#x27;m dancing with my buds</li>
            <li>For some everyday pants or to workout in the gym, these are the perfect match for you.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a looser fit esp between the legs.</li>
            <li>They fit like I wanted them too</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the doubled-up front pockets which are a nice addition.</li>

            <li>I mainly chose these for the zippered pockets.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They are wearable though and the material seems high quality.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good material, but the only way they looked good was if I streched my legs because other wise it just looks like your wearing diapers, and the front pockets are just like random unnecessary blocks.</li>
            <li>I think these are extremely fashionable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>the black is nice and dark and they look way more expensive than the price I paid!</li>

            <li> the black is nice and dark and they look way more expensive than the price I paid!</li>
            <li> I normally wear a 36W/30L and the XXL is bit tight.</li>
            <li> material is really uncomfortable, not breathable and cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Very tight legs and the &amp;#34;harem&amp;#34; part, that makes the style, is so short, almost look like a diaper.</li>
            <li> They were not worth 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wear these to a very dark place, where they cant see the circle of the dropped crouch...</li>
            <li> I was afraid they&#x27;d be too tight since I have soccer legs (big calves and thighs)</li>
            <li> but I was slightly disappointed with the fact that the pockets weren&#x27;t real that had zippers on them.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful fabric!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not waste your money.The crotch looks like a camel toe.</li>
            <li> They did not meet size expectation from the sizing chart. PERIOD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5ft8 and got the xxl. they fit perfect!!! I was afraid they&#x27;d be too tight since I have soccer legs (big calves and thighs) but these fit so well. the zippers are awesome! the black is nice and dark and they look way more expensive than the price I paid! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I normally wear a 36W/30L and the XXL is bit tight. Definitely aren&#x27;t baggy like the pic. They are wearable though and the material seems high quality.</li>
            <li> I think these are extremely fashionable and comfortable. They look great in any outfit but I was slightly disappointed with the fact that the pockets weren&#x27;t real that had zippers on them.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Didn&#x27;t fit and cheaply made. Seller was no help. Don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
            <li> the Quality is cheap&lt;br /&gt;and i order XXL and shes like L !!!</li>
            <li> Awful fabric! And they are all in chinese size! Do not buy it!</li>
            <li> Quick Shipment and Good material</li>
            <li> material is really uncomfortable, not breathable and cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.  went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> O.K...... Like the style&amp;function(zippred pockets)not so thrilled by the material...</li>
            <li> Great fit a little loose for me I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9 and got the xxl so anyone within that height range these are good for you the material is nice and sturdy the multiple pockets let me carry a lot just a great pair of pants when I&#x27;m dancing with my buds</li>
            <li> Im 5&#x27;9, 133lbs. and slim cut. These were my first pair of jogger pants and they&#x27;re actually nice. The shipping was okay being that fact that its coming from overseas. The material is good as well as the quality. For some everyday pants or to workout in the gym, these are the perfect match for you.</li>
            <li> Very tight legs and the &amp;#34;harem&amp;#34; part, that makes the style, is so short, almost look like a diaper. I was looking for a looser fit esp between the legs.</li>
            <li> I got these, and they looked great. They&#x27;re a good material, but the only way they looked good was if I streched my legs because other wise it just looks like your wearing diapers, and the front pockets are just like random unnecessary blocks. They were not worth 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> A 2XL is the equivalent of a Medium.</li>
            <li> Love the pants, very comfortable, worth the long wait (3 weeks). Problem with them is the back pockets are non-use, just for show. I was surprised by the doubled-up front pockets which are a nice addition. I mainly chose these for the zippered pockets. I may alter this pair to add back pockets. They fit like I wanted them too, I am 5&#x27; 11&amp;#34; size 32 waist and got XXL, stops right at my ankles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wear these to a very dark place, where they cant see the circle of the dropped crouch...I&#x27;m just going to buy another type.</li>
