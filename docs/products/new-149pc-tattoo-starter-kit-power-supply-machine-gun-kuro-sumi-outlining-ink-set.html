            <li>and it works good</li>
            <li>Good product to begin with.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but everything else is amazing</li>
            <li>I liked it alot till i started tattooing&lt;br</li>
            <li>it would also be nice if it came with more inks and needles and tips.</li>
            <li>but i can transfer the ink into more suitable containers.</li>
            <li>dont stay in place very cheap material</li>
            <li>again i am still 1000% satisfied with the product...</li>
            <li>I got it Jan.7th :)</li>
            <li>got the kit on time everything works except the most important thing....</li>
            <li>thanks good for beginners like me</li>
            <li>Got in on time has great function would say 5 stars but it doesnt run on lo or mediam voltage only hi other than that everything that was in the description came with the set perfect for the price i obly used it twice</li>
            <li>The power supply and clip cord are fine, I think.</li>
            <li>The rest of the kit is nice,  the gun seems to be a nice one for outlining, not to much vibration and doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>an started tattooing just needs more supplys in the kit but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it well worth it</li>
            <li>I was excited I ordered Jan.4th</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m to excited thanks :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice kit for the money, the needle garments that come with it are a bit to soft</li>
            <li>Other than that great price for everything i got</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great buy for a starter kit.</li>
            <li>and it runs very consistently.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Impressed about the fast shipping especially during holidays  the only negs I have about this set is I wish the ink where packaged in bottles not twist off tabs</li>
            <li>but all i really needed was the power and cords so no biggie worth the money</li>
            <li>i only wish that the ink containers were screw off top bottles instead.</li>
            <li>did my first tattoo today</li>
            <li>Did really good ill buy more stuff from here</li>
            <li>, that it came with a ink cap tray, and that it had stainless steel tips other than that price is GREAT for low budget starters like my self that have no clue how to tattoo</li>
            <li>(real skin from my arm).</li>
            <li>/&gt;everything else in the package is really good.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>And fast shipment also.  </li>
            <li>so I returned it and had to pay the whole shipping cost out of pocket</li>
            <li>At least I got a good power supply out of it though.</li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve expected it to break since it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Because I do not want to waste any more money buying a new power supply and clip cord.</li>
            <li>, they let play in the needle wich you don&#x27;t want, the ink is good ink but can become messy when opening the single shots up.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that you have to make sure you use 2 rubber bands instead of 1 when keeping the needle down.</li>
            <li>I really just hope that the only problem is the machine.</li>
            <li>it arrived 3 days early with standard shipping.</li>
            <li>so far all the equipment is working properly.  </li>
            <li>the only thing i did not like was the fact that the ink is not resealable...not a major problem though...</li>

            <li> Purchasing this has helped my brother out a lot</li>
            <li> got it opened it and put together and  the dam thing broke but all i really needed was the power and cords so no biggie worth the money</li>
            <li> I recieved it before the scheduled delivery date...everything was there...the only thing i did not like was the fact that the ink is not resealable...not a major problem though...i think there could have been instructions with the starter set as another issue...again i am still 1000% satisfied with the product...thank you amazon...and the providers of the products</li>
            <li> Got in on time has great function would say 5 stars but it doesnt run on lo or mediam voltage only hi other than that everything that was in the description came with the set perfect for the price i obly used it twice and it runs very consistently.</li>

            <li> Well worth the money. it arrived 3 days early with standard shipping. The ink it came with is suprisingly good quality. it wasnt watered down and its dark and holds well in the skin (real skin from my arm). i only wish that the ink containers were screw off top bottles instead. but i can transfer the ink into more suitable containers. it would also be nice if it came with more inks and needles and tips. but for 30 dollars its money well spent.</li>
            <li> I liked it alot till i started tattooing&lt;br /&gt; It sparks jumps and has a kick to it. Other than that great price for everything i got</li>
            <li> Did really good ill buy more stuff from here the best part was they tell u when its going to be there and it comes a day be for thank alot</li>
            <li> did not like rubber bands,gromments and pair of glove&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;gloves rip as soon as you grab it .&lt;br /&gt;grommets dont stay in place very cheap material&lt;br /&gt;rubber bands are crap...&lt;br /&gt;everything else in the package is really good.&lt;br /&gt;its what i expected from this.&lt;br /&gt;i would recomend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The power supply and clip cord are fine, I think. But the tattoo machine itself shorted out about 20 minutes after I started using it. I have to turn the power supply up to the maximum to get it to work at all.The front spring and contact screw constantly spark together, and sometimes it only runs if there is no needle attached. I really just hope that the only problem is the machine. Because I do not want to waste any more money buying a new power supply and clip cord. I guess I should&#x27;ve expected it to break since it is so cheap. At least I got a good power supply out of it though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice kit for the money, the needle garments that come with it are a bit to soft, they let play in the needle wich you don&#x27;t want, the ink is good ink but can become messy when opening the single shots up.  The rest of the kit is nice,  the gun seems to be a nice one for outlining, not to much vibration and doesn&#x27;t get hot.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  And fast shipment also.  Would buy from seller again..</li>
            <li> got the kit on time everything works except the most important thing....the tattoo machine, good thing I have 2 machines the power supply is good I have done several tattoos already and it works good the ink is one time use so se it and don&#x27;t store it just throw it away</li>
            <li> Good product to begin with. But it over heats if kept running for longer than an hour. The ink is not good quality just use for practice skin</li>
            <li> Great buy for a great price. Started using it at soon as i got it and it works perfect. The only problem is that you have to make sure you use 2 rubber bands instead of 1 when keeping the needle down. Other than that its a great buy for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> poor packaging and thrown in box didnt work when got it</li>
            <li> I just got mines about at 6:36pm today. Impressed about the fast shipping especially during holidays  the only negs I have about this set is I wish the ink where packaged in bottles not twist off tabs, that it came with a ink cap tray, and that it had stainless steel tips other than that price is GREAT for low budget starters like my self that have no clue how to tattoo I&#x27;m to excited thanks :)</li>
            <li> This product was great got it in two days an started tattooing just needs more supplys in the kit but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it well worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about over a month now excellent so far all the equipment is working properly.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I opened it pit it together to test it and one set of the wires on the foot pedal so I have to buy another one but everything else is amazing</li>
            <li> It is not a good machine for a person just starting out. It did not come with instructions on how to put the machine together and it kept going on and off....&lt;br /&gt;I was very unhappy with my purchase so I returned it and had to pay the whole shipping cost out of pocket and they only refunded the purchase price without taxes, and no shipping cost....</li>
            <li> just got the package today everything was in it! . did my first tattoo today I was excited I ordered Jan.4th I got it Jan.7th :) thanks good for beginners like me</li>
