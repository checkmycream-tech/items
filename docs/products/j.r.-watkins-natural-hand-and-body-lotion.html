            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

            <li>A nice, rich lotion, not at all greasy, and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feels so buttery and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, although it makes me hungry, because it&#x27;s not just lemon-scented so much</li>
            <li>It is a clean refreshing snell, I don&#x27;t care for flowery smells when going to bed.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and smells lemon fresh(but not too strong), not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smells so funky I wouldn&#x27;t even be comfortable adding it to a holiday gift bag.</li>

            <li>Love it smells so fresh</li>
            <li>It smells like a lemon icing for a fabulous cake.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good body lotion with a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Every review is true.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want a really sweet smelling one, get the grapefruit.</li>
            <li>My stomach actually rumbled the first time I opened a bottle (although without the reward of a wonderful lemon treat, the Pavlovian response has pretty much since dissipated).</li>
            <li>but it absorbed into my skin well without leaving my legs feeling greasy (even though I used more than I really needed to).  </li>
            <li>It feels a bit sticky to me and doesn&#x27;t have the kind of lasting effects as the St</li>
            <li>I LOVE lemon scented items, especially when they have that cr√®me or batter scent along with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s an ingredients list on the product page, but it doesn&#x27;t match up exactly with my package, so here are the ingredients on mine</li>

            <li>Leaves my skin soft for the full day.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells like pure Heaven.  </li>
            <li>fresh lemon sugar smell and 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell -- it doesn&#x27;t have a real lemon smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast absorbing and silky (not greasy at all)</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells so much like lemon cake batter</li>
            <li>This stuff soaks in pretty quickly, no greasy film, makes my skin feel soft and smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lemony sweet with that extra something.  </li>
            <li>but that is not necessarily a bad thing as the lotion goes further.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I bought it last year and won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>Good thick lotion!</li>
            <li>I use lemon cream lotion both for my face and my body, it is light and non-greasy but most importantly it is free of the \\&quot;bad stuff\\</li>

            <li>is moisturized quite nicely; it&#x27;s soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s because it is natural.</li>
            <li>PLUS, not only does it smell just divine, the lotion itself is high quality.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it, it&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s worth its price.</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin from working outside at an equestrian facility and this heals my hardworking hands even in the winter.</li>
            <li> However, the smell does not remain on the skin long.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this as my signature scent for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only other lotion I will use is Aveda!</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s possible the formula changed slightly since this product was listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the smell sticks around for awhile, unlike with some other body lotions.  </li>

            <li> Leaves my skin soft for the full day.  Great lemon scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> if you are tired of expensive lotions that smell like cheap perfume (bath and body works) this is the lotion for you. fresh lemon sugar smell and 100% natural. I have very dry skin from working outside at an equestrian facility and this heals my hardworking hands even in the winter. an adult smell as well, I have even caught my husband stealing my lotion a time or 2 for his hands in the winter. I know he loves the smell. please don&#x27;t ever discontinue</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell -- it doesn&#x27;t have a real lemon smell.  It smells very artificial.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3-pack of this lotion after taking a whiff of it at a local Target. Well, I should have thought about what it would be like having to smell lemon cream each and every day. Not for me. Not for my girlfriend, either. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it... it&#x27;s smells so funky I wouldn&#x27;t even be comfortable adding it to a holiday gift bag. Great smell, just not to wear more than once a month.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I bought it last year and won&#x27;t go back to anything else. I specifically like the lemon cream scent, lavander smells good too. I did not like green tea scent, smells as it has expired. I use lemon cream lotion both for my face and my body, it is light and non-greasy but most importantly it is free of the \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot; you find in face and body lotions (free of parabens, sodium laurel sulfates, dyes, mineral oil and petrolatum). Would definitely recommend it, it&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s worth its price.</li>
            <li> I have always known about Watkins products since I was little but they are so hard to find.  A couple of years ago, I saw this Lemon lotion at Target and bought some.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it since though.  I LOVE lemon scented items, especially when they have that cr√®me or batter scent along with it.  This lotion smells like pure Heaven.  It&#x27;s lemony sweet with that extra something.  PLUS, not only does it smell just divine, the lotion itself is high quality.  It&#x27;s fast absorbing and silky (not greasy at all) it leaves you soft for a long time.  The scent lingers too.  Just wonderful!  I got three 11oz bottles for $21 and some change!  What a great deal from this seller.  I was so happy to find this on Amazon for such a great price!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion!  No parabens or sulfates. Goes on smooth and smells lemon fresh(but not too strong), not sticky at all.  The only other lotion I will use is Aveda!</li>
            <li> A nice, rich lotion, not at all greasy, and moisturizes well.  I love the lemony cookie smell (not at all like furniture polish, as some lemon body products can smell).  The lemon layer of the scent dries away after a few hours, but there is a subtle vanilla-ish smell that I can smell the next day!</li>
            <li> Most lotions this creamy and softening leave you feeling kind of greasy.  This stuff soaks in pretty quickly, no greasy film, makes my skin feel soft and smells AMAZING.  In an email from the company they told me they don&#x27;t do animal testing, though I doubt the ingredients are vegan.  I stock up and have two or three at home, one in my car, and one at work.  I hope I never run out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it moisturizes nicely. Have it at home work and in car. I used to get it at Walgreens but they stopped carrying it so I buy it here. Price is good.</li>
            <li> Oh my God!  This lotion smells wonderful!  Makes you want to lick your hands!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells AMAZING... you will want to eat it. Seriously it smells like a lemon meringue pie.</li>
            <li> Smells like yum!  Good thick lotion!</li>
            <li> awesome.  great moisturizer and smells great too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. It smells like you&#x27;re wearing cake.</li>
            <li> Love this line -I have hand soap to match in three bathrooms</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awesome &amp; it came in a 3-pack. Not only that, but it does an excellent job moisturizing. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this lemon cream lotion off and on for years. When I don&#x27;t make my own, this is my go to.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite.  Yes, it smells so much like lemon cake batter that I actually tasted it  (don&#x27;t).  My favorite thing is that it&#x27;s paraben-free.  Very good purchase.</li>
            <li> smells like Girl Scout lemon shortbread cookies so it might make you hungry! Solution is very thIn but that is not necessarily a bad thing as the lotion goes further. The smell cannot be beat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this stuff around for years, but had never actually tried it until recently.  It smells really good, although it makes me hungry, because it&#x27;s not just lemon-scented so much -- it reminds me more of lemon bars.  And the smell sticks around for awhile, unlike with some other body lotions.  (But don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty thick but it absorbed into my skin well without leaving my legs feeling greasy (even though I used more than I really needed to).  I love that the fragrance is natural (says so on the package), since I have sensitivity reactions to a lot of artificial fragrances.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial dyes.  I feel like the skin where I used this is moisturized quite nicely; it&#x27;s soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s an ingredients list on the product page, but it doesn&#x27;t match up exactly with my package, so here are the ingredients on mine; it&#x27;s possible the formula changed slightly since this product was listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, apricot kernel oil, glyceryl stearate, shea butter, cocoa seed butter, cetearyl alcohol, fragrance, sodium stearoyl lactylate, glycerin, coconut oil, avocado oil, phenoxyethanol, allantoin, Orbignya oleifera seed oil, jojoba seed oil, panthenol, Calendula officinalis flower extract, matricaria flower extract, Tilia cordata flower extract, Centaurea cyanus flower extract, Anthemis nobilis flower extract, Hypericum perforatum extract, lavender oil, tocopheryl acetate, guar gum, Aloe barbadensis leaf juice, potassium sorbate, benzoic acid, dehydroacetic acid, citric acid, sodium hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good body lotion with a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years, I love this smell.  It is a clean refreshing snell, I don&#x27;t care for flowery smells when going to bed.</li>
            <li> Love it smells so fresh</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it makes me smell like a lemon cake. However, the smell does not remain on the skin long. I imagine it&#x27;s because it is natural.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it smells delicious</li>
            <li> Every review is true.  I bought it for the smell but the lotion is awesome.  Leaves your skin smooth and soft.  Smells like my favorite dessert...  Lemon cake!  My little one shows some signs of eczema but this stopped it.  If you don&#x27;t want a really sweet smelling one, get the grapefruit.</li>
            <li> The lemon cream is to die for! My coworker told me once it smells like herbs. Creamy and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Oh my lord - the scent! It smells like a lemon icing for a fabulous cake. My stomach actually rumbled the first time I opened a bottle (although without the reward of a wonderful lemon treat, the Pavlovian response has pretty much since dissipated). Suffice to say, if you&#x27;re a lemon fan, this is the lotion for you. So far as other qualities, like those having to do with lotion-y (not eating) attributes, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good, not great. It feels a bit sticky to me and doesn&#x27;t have the kind of lasting effects as the St Ive&#x27;s line (which I see now says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;exclusively for Prime Members&amp;#34; - probably served in the exclusively for Prime Members Country Club - pah!). I got the 3- pack at a terrific bargain of $3-something and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells absolutely wonderful. It kind of reminds me of cake batter, both in consistency and smell. However, it is not sickeningly sweet. I love how it feels so buttery and smooth on my skin. I also appreciate that the scent lingers quite a while, without being overwhelming or nauseating. I am so glad that I purchased so many bottles of this lotion. I plan on using this as my signature scent for a very long time.</li>
