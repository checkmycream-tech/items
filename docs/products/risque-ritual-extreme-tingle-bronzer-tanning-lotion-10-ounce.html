            <li>but I had heard good things.  </li>
            <li>It reddens the skin without creating blotches, and it smells soo good.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as hundred dollar tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Like the tingle, feels like a mild sunburn, but disappears after a couple hours and turns into a nice tan!!!!</li>
            <li>It alo smells great amd goes on smooth,wish it was more inside.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very nice hot tingle and a beautiful color .</li>

            <li>You get amazing results that don&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>You come out with really nice color.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice color.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Tingly and after tan fragrance smell is nice.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tingle I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say Risque Ritual works MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>I love Love LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Very light to me</li>
            <li>I payed 80 dollars for it at a tanning place, im glad i found it on here</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is cute too.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I would not be able to handle the tingle in the lotion.</li>
            <li>the better the tan.</li>
            <li>no one tans to get an ok color</li>
            <li>but it still goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this seller.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle factor plus bronzer.</li>
            <li>and thats what is important!</li>
            <li>Ha! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of my skin was ok.  </li>
            <li>Oh my god I love this tingle lotion.</li>
            <li>Between both these are my two favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, smell etc..</li>
            <li>after awhile though, works best alternating as most lotions or mixed with a stronger tingle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is thicker, but that just means its more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the tingle.</li>
            <li>I have worked on the tanning industry for 7 years and this is on of my favorite bronzing tingles.</li>
            <li>Overall, PERFECT lotion!!</li>
            <li>Very nice all-around tingle tan cream for the price and for the outcome.</li>
            <li>I FINALLY found a Lotion I LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought two more bottles after tanning</li>
            <li>Use caution if you are sensitive to this type of tanning product but if used right you will get great color!</li>
            <li>Good Lotion, not as much tingle as I would like.  </li>
            <li>and this really is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Yes this has a strong tingle.</li>
            <li>This tingle is NOT so strong.</li>
            <li>Tingle is strong but not over powering where you will itch.</li>
            <li>I was wanting a bronzing tanning lotion that would quickly build up my tan, and I&#x27;m super pleased with my Risque Ritual!  </li>
            <li>If you love a strong tingle with a good bronzer to even out the redness that the tingle will initially give your skin, you will LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells great, like apples, barely any after tan odor.</li>
            <li>Great tingle, is intense the first time you try it</li>
            <li>Which is fine.</li>
            <li>and the bottle is also very pretty!</li>
            <li>and after two times of using this lotion, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a tingle, apply lightly to legs, arms.  </li>
            <li>Great tingler for a deep tan!  </li>
            <li>It has great bronzer and just enough tingler.</li>
            <li>It also has a light bronzer in it as well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tingling lotion.</li>
            <li>Authentic, fast Shipping, Brand new, Good quality lotion .</li>
            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE LOTION!</li>
            <li>I normally spend 22 minutes in the deluxe bed.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>and this made my tan deeper, richer, and keeps me beautifully golden even longer!</li>
            <li>Def worth the money !</li>
            <li>does have tingle and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I first tried it out at my tanning spa and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>HOT HOT!!!</li>
            <li>People tell me how i have such a nice color already :)</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tingle lotion!</li>
            <li>Yes you can most certainly feel the tingle</li>
            <li>and u will be bright red the hole time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a beautiful dark tab after ONE use.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it on my legs because the tingle is so intense that if I put it on all over</li>
            <li>No bad after tan order .</li>
            <li>The lotion smells great and has a nice tingle factor to it, not too strong, not too weak, just right.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you&#x27;ve never used a tingle I&#x27;d start with something lower as this tingle is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>However this is a great tingle if you dont want anything extreme.</li>
            <li>The tingler is perfect to not to much and not to little.</li>
            <li>For a tingle this seemed mild to me.</li>
            <li>but it was mild.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product produces a very hot tingle.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent; however, I get a GREAT bronze tan when I use this product, so I can put up with the smell.</li>
            <li>but I seen we got a new one tried it and totally love it.</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;In blonde and pretty fair.  </li>
            <li>Dont&#x27; be fooled into paying the higher price!    </li>
            <li>Australian Gold is stepping up their products for sure!</li>
            <li>and with amazons prices its a real bargain!!</li>
            <li>Not only do you get amazing color</li>
            <li>Smells great like green apples .</li>
            <li>Basically its worth it and buy it</li>
            <li>so many tanning lotions and this one by far has done what it says its suppose to.</li>
            <li>bronzer left my skin nice and tabbed without a orange tinge.  </li>
            <li>I only wanted a packet and not a bottle to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li>You get a powerful tingling effect.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right ONE</li>
            <li>but my family could smell it right away.</li>
            <li>This is a great first tingle for new tingle users, but make sure you have a good base tan before you use it.</li>
            <li>The first day I felt the heat from it and felt like I had the flu..</li>
            <li>The bottle is really pretty with the diamonds on it.</li>
            <li>and it looked really funny.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.....</li>
            <li>I only gave this a 4 out of 5 because i was expecting a stronger tingle, but regardless im still satisfied</li>
            <li>and you just run in for a tan at the salon or gym because it warms ya up fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>which is why I bought the tingle in the first place.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because the tingle is not as hot as everyone says.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin soft and has a great scent that doesn&#x27;t scream knock ya down like a lot of others.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin super soft and not all sticky feeling too!</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon &amp; I test out pretty much every lotion that comes out</li>
            <li>Its leaves me looking so much darker then when I first walked into the salon.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different tingle lotions, this one is by far the BEST.  </li>
            <li>More than half off what I paid at the gym the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li>just kind feels like a sunburn after for a little awhile.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion, because my skin looks really tan with beutifull tone.</li>
            <li>Newbies need to start with a warming lotion, not an intense tingle.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would really boost my color since it had a tingle...</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really boost too much at all.</li>
            <li>I expected more</li>
            <li>This product is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>but nothing intense.</li>
            <li>This stuff is intense.</li>
            <li>To start off with, I bought this lotion unsure of I really wanted or needed a tingle.</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is great, it smells like the enchanted apples from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so i really can&#x27;t tell you much about this</li>
            <li>and it even had a free after tan sample tapped to the back!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s thick and rubs in nice and drys right away.</li>
            <li>it just leaves me smooth and super dark.  </li>
            <li>I used the real stuff first to compare and it is the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>This lotion brought my tan to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>and I was super red when I got out of the bed, but</li>
            <li>highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>The tingle is extreme SUPER HOT after I tan.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the smell and the silky feel are great.</li>
            <li>and you definitely do turn very red, but after a few hours you get a great brown color.</li>
            <li>The first time I used a tingle (not this one), I applied way too much and left feeling</li>
            <li>Expecially during the winter because its cold outside and your nice and warm.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like to use tinglers.</li>
            <li>You get dark, \\&quot;vacation\\&quot; looking results super fast!</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it out right away with regular delivery</li>
            <li>it really give you that dark, rich tan and lets face it, it is ALOT cheaper on here than the price they try to charge you at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>You should probably start out with a milder tingle if you are a new tanner or if you have never used tingle lotions.</li>
            <li>On any item page, below where you see \\&quot;in stock\\&quot;, sometimes you will see \\&quot;x amount of new items\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps anyone that is new to using a tingle.</li>
            <li>It was brand new-</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used an entire sample packet.  </li>
            <li>and I had gotten many compliments the next day saying I looked really dark and how tan I was.</li>
            <li>I didnt really feel hot in the tanning bed (the fan was on high), but when i got out of the bed i began to feel just a little burnt.</li>
            <li>Then about 20 mintues later i felt the burning a little more.</li>
            <li>I am blonde haired and blue eyed with fair, semi-sensitive skin that is somewhat hard to tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a frequent tanner now for over five years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 2 weeks or so, and I&#x27;ve gotten SO much darker.</li>
            <li>Not half full or previously opened.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that hot.</li>
            <li>I was shocked by how good my skin smelt after one tan in an intense bed for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It appears as a blushy tan at first (a little red depending on how much you applied).  </li>
            <li>The rest of my body is pretty dark and it even made the rest of me darker.</li>
            <li>This lotion doesnt do that, you do turn red but its all over its not uneven or embarrassing .</li>
            <li>WOW was I tan the next day!</li>
            <li>you will be straight red all over and look burnt its extreamly uncomfortable but the color you get when the red fades is worth it at first</li>
            <li>Color is amazing, I actually have to lay off a few days because I&#x27;m already to dark!!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes me much darker than any other stuff.  </li>
            <li>Works just as expected and makes you super dark after just a couple tans.</li>
            <li>gets you dark fast</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It reddens the skin without creating blotches, and it smells soo good.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as hundred dollar tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Like the tingle, feels like a mild sunburn, but disappears after a couple hours and turns into a nice tan!!!!</li>
            <li> It alo smells great amd goes on smooth,wish it was more inside.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very nice hot tingle and a beautiful color .</li>
            <li> Love this product and the results!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite indoor tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> this is a great tanning lotion i enjoy the results and have had people ask me what i&#x27;m using  and recomend this product</li>
            <li> You get amazing results that don&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> You come out with really nice color.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice color.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Tingly and after tan fragrance smell is nice.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tingle I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say Risque Ritual works MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> I love Love LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very light to me</li>
            <li> I payed 80 dollars for it at a tanning place, im glad i found it on here</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is cute too.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would not be able to handle the tingle in the lotion.</li>
            <li> the better the tan.</li>
            <li> no one tans to get an ok color</li>
            <li> but it still goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this seller.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle factor plus bronzer.</li>
            <li> and thats what is important!</li>
            <li> Ha! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of my skin was ok.  </li>
            <li> Oh my god I love this tingle lotion.</li>
            <li> Between both these are my two favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, smell etc..</li>
            <li> after awhile though, works best alternating as most lotions or mixed with a stronger tingle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is thicker, but that just means its more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the tingle.</li>
            <li> I have worked on the tanning industry for 7 years and this is on of my favorite bronzing tingles.</li>
            <li> Overall, PERFECT lotion!!</li>
            <li> Very nice all-around tingle tan cream for the price and for the outcome.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found a Lotion I LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought two more bottles after tanning</li>
            <li> Use caution if you are sensitive to this type of tanning product but if used right you will get great color!</li>
            <li> Good Lotion, not as much tingle as I would like.  </li>
            <li> and this really is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Yes this has a strong tingle.</li>
            <li> This tingle is NOT so strong.</li>
            <li> Tingle is strong but not over powering where you will itch.</li>
            <li> I was wanting a bronzing tanning lotion that would quickly build up my tan, and I&#x27;m super pleased with my Risque Ritual!  </li>
            <li> If you love a strong tingle with a good bronzer to even out the redness that the tingle will initially give your skin, you will LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great, like apples, barely any after tan odor.</li>
            <li> Great tingle, is intense the first time you try it</li>
            <li> Which is fine.</li>
            <li> and the bottle is also very pretty!</li>
            <li> and after two times of using this lotion, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a tingle, apply lightly to legs, arms.  </li>
            <li> Great tingler for a deep tan!  </li>
            <li> It has great bronzer and just enough tingler.</li>
            <li> It also has a light bronzer in it as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tingling lotion.</li>
            <li> Authentic, fast Shipping, Brand new, Good quality lotion .</li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE LOTION!</li>
            <li> I normally spend 22 minutes in the deluxe bed.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> and this made my tan deeper, richer, and keeps me beautifully golden even longer!</li>
            <li> Def worth the money !</li>
            <li> does have tingle and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I first tried it out at my tanning spa and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> HOT HOT!!!</li>
            <li> People tell me how i have such a nice color already :)</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tingle lotion!</li>
            <li> Yes you can most certainly feel the tingle</li>
            <li> and u will be bright red the hole time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a beautiful dark tab after ONE use.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it on my legs because the tingle is so intense that if I put it on all over</li>
            <li> No bad after tan order .</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and has a nice tingle factor to it, not too strong, not too weak, just right.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you&#x27;ve never used a tingle I&#x27;d start with something lower as this tingle is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> However this is a great tingle if you dont want anything extreme.</li>
            <li> The tingler is perfect to not to much and not to little.</li>
            <li> For a tingle this seemed mild to me.</li>
            <li> but it was mild.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product produces a very hot tingle.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent; however, I get a GREAT bronze tan when I use this product, so I can put up with the smell.</li>
            <li> but I seen we got a new one tried it and totally love it.</li>
            <li> use!&lt;br /&gt;In blonde and pretty fair.  </li>
            <li> Dont&#x27; be fooled into paying the higher price!    </li>
            <li> Australian Gold is stepping up their products for sure!</li>
            <li> and with amazons prices its a real bargain!!</li>
            <li> Not only do you get amazing color</li>
            <li> Smells great like green apples .</li>
            <li> Basically its worth it and buy it</li>
            <li> so many tanning lotions and this one by far has done what it says its suppose to.</li>
            <li> bronzer left my skin nice and tabbed without a orange tinge.  </li>
            <li> I only wanted a packet and not a bottle to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li> You get a powerful tingling effect.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right ONE</li>
            <li> but my family could smell it right away.</li>
            <li> This is a great first tingle for new tingle users, but make sure you have a good base tan before you use it.</li>
            <li> The first day I felt the heat from it and felt like I had the flu..</li>
            <li> The bottle is really pretty with the diamonds on it.</li>
            <li> and it looked really funny.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.....</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 4 out of 5 because i was expecting a stronger tingle, but regardless im still satisfied</li>
            <li> and you just run in for a tan at the salon or gym because it warms ya up fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> which is why I bought the tingle in the first place.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because the tingle is not as hot as everyone says.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin soft and has a great scent that doesn&#x27;t scream knock ya down like a lot of others.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin super soft and not all sticky feeling too!</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon &amp; I test out pretty much every lotion that comes out</li>
            <li> Its leaves me looking so much darker then when I first walked into the salon.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different tingle lotions, this one is by far the BEST.  </li>
            <li> More than half off what I paid at the gym the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li> just kind feels like a sunburn after for a little awhile.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, because my skin looks really tan with beutifull tone.</li>
            <li> Newbies need to start with a warming lotion, not an intense tingle.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would really boost my color since it had a tingle...</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really boost too much at all.</li>
            <li> I expected more</li>
            <li> This product is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> but nothing intense.</li>
            <li> This stuff is intense.</li>
            <li> To start off with, I bought this lotion unsure of I really wanted or needed a tingle.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is great, it smells like the enchanted apples from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so i really can&#x27;t tell you much about this</li>
            <li> and it even had a free after tan sample tapped to the back!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s thick and rubs in nice and drys right away.</li>
            <li> it just leaves me smooth and super dark.  </li>
            <li> I used the real stuff first to compare and it is the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> This lotion brought my tan to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> and I was super red when I got out of the bed, but</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li> The tingle is extreme SUPER HOT after I tan.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the smell and the silky feel are great.</li>
            <li> and you definitely do turn very red, but after a few hours you get a great brown color.</li>
            <li> The first time I used a tingle (not this one), I applied way too much and left feeling</li>
            <li> Expecially during the winter because its cold outside and your nice and warm.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t like to use tinglers.</li>
            <li> You get dark, \\&quot;vacation\\&quot; looking results super fast!</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it out right away with regular delivery</li>
            <li> it really give you that dark, rich tan and lets face it, it is ALOT cheaper on here than the price they try to charge you at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> You should probably start out with a milder tingle if you are a new tanner or if you have never used tingle lotions.</li>
            <li> On any item page, below where you see \\&quot;in stock\\&quot;, sometimes you will see \\&quot;x amount of new items\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps anyone that is new to using a tingle.</li>
            <li> It was brand new-</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used an entire sample packet.  </li>
            <li> and I had gotten many compliments the next day saying I looked really dark and how tan I was.</li>
            <li> I didnt really feel hot in the tanning bed (the fan was on high), but when i got out of the bed i began to feel just a little burnt.</li>
            <li> Then about 20 mintues later i felt the burning a little more.</li>
            <li> I am blonde haired and blue eyed with fair, semi-sensitive skin that is somewhat hard to tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a frequent tanner now for over five years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 2 weeks or so, and I&#x27;ve gotten SO much darker.</li>
            <li> Not half full or previously opened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that hot.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by how good my skin smelt after one tan in an intense bed for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It appears as a blushy tan at first (a little red depending on how much you applied).  </li>
            <li> The rest of my body is pretty dark and it even made the rest of me darker.</li>
            <li> This lotion doesnt do that, you do turn red but its all over its not uneven or embarrassing .</li>
            <li> WOW was I tan the next day!</li>
            <li> you will be straight red all over and look burnt its extreamly uncomfortable but the color you get when the red fades is worth it at first</li>
            <li> Color is amazing, I actually have to lay off a few days because I&#x27;m already to dark!!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me much darker than any other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Works just as expected and makes you super dark after just a couple tans.</li>
            <li> gets you dark fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was scepticle because my salon had it on sale and usually use more expensive, intense tingle lotions.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad that people give great products like this poor reviews when the product only did what it was supposed to do and the user was not being responsible.</li>
            <li> Expect to be very red right after and tired.</li>
            <li> I alternate with other stuff but keep coming back to this</li>
            <li> Even better when it&#x27;s cold out</li>
            <li> my lotion from now on I will def buy this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Plus you don&#x27;t experience that strange after odor from some of the tingles.  </li>
            <li> However for some who haven&#x27;t used them I would start with something a little less intense.</li>
            <li> If you are pale white you might not want to use this product, get a base first, but it works fast if you can handle the heat ;)</li>
            <li> This recent session, I used only half a sample packet.  </li>
            <li> I usually choose Bombshell and decided to try a new tingle.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to tingle, you may want to start with a small amount on your legs</li>
            <li> keeps my skin so moisturized all day long!</li>
            <li> It feels soft and clean on the skin and does not smell bad.  </li>
            <li> I am a tough cridict and do not give positive reviews for nothing.  </li>
            <li> With this, I did only half the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using Black by designer skin.</li>
            <li> A little red afterwards but goes away after an hour.</li>
            <li> It is a tingler, so you will probably be red for a few hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I order this one it had plastic wrapping (which I&#x27;ve never gotten on my other tanning lotions)</li>
            <li> I was already dark, but ha plataued with my other lotions.</li>
            <li> I have over a dozen lotions that I rotate and when I hit a wall, this one breaks through and gets me dark.</li>
            <li> B002WVGBEO 2010 Australian Gold Risque Ritual Tanning Lotion xtreme Tingle and 10th Dimension Bronzer with StimuTan Heat Tinge 40 Complex 10 oz]]    </li>
            <li> Leaves you dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it is what my tanning salon sales, but for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Since I found this product, I tan less often and for less time.  </li>
            <li> Its easily half the price of the lotions that I use.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit thicker then some lotions out there</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t been tanning in a week, I wanted to be a few shades darker for the weekend.</li>
            <li> I tan year round</li>
            <li> (Everyday)</li>
            <li> All year round.</li>
            <li> and you stay red for a couple hours, but it made my arms at least 4 shades darker after one use!!</li>
            <li> I felt no tingle and very little heat.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt have that nasty after odor most lotions have</li>
            <li> , i think it smells like a green apple smell!</li>
            <li> The next day the tone had turned to brown, not that fake orange color.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply this 15 minutes before tanning</li>
            <li> It smells like green apples!</li>
            <li> (that usually run around $80), and</li>
            <li> I have a hard to tan skin.</li>
            <li> I just have a hard time tanning my arms for some reason.</li>
            <li> I would even suggest this lotion to guys because the sent is so subtle.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Then after I used it again several times and the heat wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I do have a base tan and need a tingle to get a dark color, however this lotion provided me with additional tanning results in just one tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used bombshell and the lotions I was getting were FAKE!</li>
            <li> I hate that orange fake</li>
            <li> like I had a bad sunburn, chills and all.  </li>
            <li> i gave this product a bad review</li>
            <li> you know how your body or skin feels when your sick with the flu, well that is how I felt.</li>
            <li> Didnt increase on color and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Had a horrible reaction</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this lotion, because my skin looks really tan with beutifull tone. However after I apply this lotion, my skin is extremly red for a while. I would rather recommended to someone with darker texture.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. The lotion smells great and has a nice tingle factor to it, not too strong, not too weak, just right. I bought this lotion because it is what my tanning salon sales, but for less than half the price. I would definately buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;-Michelle</li>
            <li> didnt work for me  would not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is simply amazinggg. gets you dark fast and it doesnt have that nasty after odor most lotions have, i think it smells like a green apple smell! it makes your skin super soft and not all sticky feeling too! I payed 80 dollars for it at a tanning place, im glad i found it on here (: I dont think I could ever use anything different.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for awhile now.  I have used tingle and bronzing lotions.  I usually choose Bombshell and decided to try a new tingle.  I have never used australian gold products before but I had heard good things.  I saw a review for this lotion on youtube and decided I would try it.  Boy am I glad I did.  I love this lotion.  The smell is so different than any lotion I have ever used.  I would even suggest this lotion to guys because the sent is so subtle.  It gets me the darkest I have ever been.  The tingle is extreme SUPER HOT after I tan.  It is a lot hotter than bombshell and the best thing...NO AFTER SMELL...it just leaves me smooth and super dark.  Def. my lotion from now on I will def buy this for a long time.  The bottle is cute too.</li>
            <li> Yes this has a strong tingle. But that is what it says on the bottle. You should probably start out with a milder tingle if you are a new tanner or if you have never used tingle lotions. It is too bad that people give great products like this poor reviews when the product only did what it was supposed to do and the user was not being responsible. This is one of my &#x27;go to&#x27; products. I have over a dozen lotions that I rotate and when I hit a wall, this one breaks through and gets me dark. Newbies need to start with a warming lotion, not an intense tingle.</li>

[[ASIN:B002WVGBEO 2010 Australian Gold Risque Ritual Tanning Lotion xtreme Tingle and 10th Dimension Bronzer with StimuTan Heat Tinge 40 Complex 10 oz]]    I&#x27;ve tried several different tingles now and I have to say this is the best of   the best.  The first time I used it, I used an entire sample packet.  Boy did I turn red lol.  A little goes a long way.  I normally spend 22 minutes in the deluxe bed.  With this, I did only half the time.  This recent session, I used only half a sample packet.  You come out with really nice color.  It appears as a blushy tan at first (a little red depending on how much you applied).  The next day the tone had turned to brown, not that fake orange color.  Since I found this product, I tan less often and for less time.  Plus you don&#x27;t experience that strange after odor from some of the tingles.  Tingles are recommended for experienced tanners.  If you&#x27;ve never used a tingle, apply lightly to legs, arms.  Never apply it to your face and I&#x27;ve been advised not to apply it to your chest.  If you&#x27;re new to tingle, you may want to start with a small amount on your legs so you&#x27;ll know what sensation to expect.  The first time I used a tingle (not this one), I applied way too much and left feeling like I had a bad sunburn, chills and all.  Live and learn.  I hope this helps anyone that is new to using a tingle.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon &amp; I test out pretty much every lotion that comes out I have a hard to tan skin. I havent used a tingle in years but I seen we got a new one tried it and totally love it. Expecially during the winter because its cold outside and your nice and warm. It works great!! all the way a five star lotion!</li>
            <li> After the reviews of this lotion and youtube reviews I went ahead and bought this lotion. I thought that it would really boost my color since it had a tingle... it didn&#x27;t really boost too much at all. The first day I felt the heat from it and felt like I had the flu..you know how your body or skin feels when your sick with the flu, well that is how I felt. Then after I used it again several times and the heat wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Didnt increase on color and was disappointed. So not one I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a frequent tanner now for over five years and I have tried probably over 50 different kinds of lotion. I&#x27;ve recently been using Black by designer skin. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the smell and the silky feel are great. I just have a hard time tanning my arms for some reason. Since I haven&#x27;t been tanning in a week, I wanted to be a few shades darker for the weekend. Normally I don&#x27;t like to use tinglers. However, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Let me tell you, this lotion rocks!!! Yes you can most certainly feel the tingle and you stay red for a couple hours, but it made my arms at least 4 shades darker after one use!! The rest of my body is pretty dark and it even made the rest of me darker. The bottle is really pretty with the diamonds on it. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the after smell. But hey, thats all tinglers! I cannot wait to buy a bottle. Its easily half the price of the lotions that I use. Seriously, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  I usually apply this 15 minutes before tanning and I get the best color ever.  Great tingle, is intense the first time you try it and you definitely do turn very red, but after a few hours you get a great brown color.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing this product. I was worried that I would not be able to handle the tingle in the lotion. I have used it three times. Twice in the tanning bed and once outside. Anyone can handle the tingle. It&#x27;s really not that hot. It does give color. I gave a three star rating because I have been told the hotter the tingle the better the tan.I expected more but I look forward to trying Roar tingle lotion. I have seen the results on others myself and the color it gives is awesome. Lets face it no one tans to get an ok color we want awesome color.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tingle lotion! Its leaves me looking so much darker then when I first walked into the salon. The results last for quite a while! The smell is entrancing and had no after funk scent. It is a little bit thicker then some lotions out there but it still goes on smooth! keeps my skin so moisturized all day long! I love Love LOVE this stuff! and the bottle is also very pretty! I will definitely be buying this product again and again! Happy Tanning!</li>
            <li> I was wanting a bronzing tanning lotion that would quickly build up my tan, and I&#x27;m super pleased with my Risque Ritual!  It reddens the skin without creating blotches, and it smells soo good.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about going in public after hitting the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Had a horrible reaction</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!! I use to use Roar but it always gave me red patches all over especially on my neck and it looked really funny. This lotion doesnt do that, you do turn red but its all over its not uneven or embarrassing . Color is amazing, I actually have to lay off a few days because I&#x27;m already to dark!! The tingler is perfect to not to much and not to little. Basically its worth it and buy it you wont regret it!! I have been tanning for years and have tried hundreds of lotions and this really is the best so far. Australian Gold is stepping up their products for sure!</li>
            <li> I have used a few different tingle lotions, this one is by far the BEST.  I do not encourage it for beginner tanners though.  This lotion brought my tan to a whole new level.  You will be red immediately after use/tanning but it turns into a deep bronze tan. Not orangy.  It feels soft and clean on the skin and does not smell bad.  As always DO NOT USE on your face!    Happy Tanning!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever tried. The only one I use!</li>
            <li> I love the tingle!! This stuff makes me much darker than any other stuff.  I like the smell too, it smells like pears.</li>
            <li> Tingle is almost nothing. The smell is fab!! The 10th dimension bronzers are outstanding!! Gorgeous color. Deep RED brown.Not a speck of orange. No staining hands or clothes. Best color in a bronzer yet.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tingle I have ever used.  It has no stinky smell to it and you can definitely feel the heat!!  I have been purchasing it at the salon for $75.00.  This product is the real thing.  The seller shipped it out right away with regular delivery I had it it in 4 days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tinglers before but none like this it kicks ur ass insted of being blotchy you will be straight red all over and look burnt its extreamly uncomfortable but the color you get when the red fades is worth it at first i gave this product a bad review but after geting used to it id defenitly buy it again  WARNING thought it will burn and sting for about 3hrs and u will be bright red the hole time!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! it really give you that dark, rich tan and lets face it, it is ALOT cheaper on here than the price they try to charge you at the tanning salon. I will continue to always buy my tanning lotion from Amazon~!</li>
            <li> Love the product one if the best tingles out there!! Smells great before and after tanning. Only issue was my sparkles on the lid were detached upon arrival, that didn&#x27;t take away from the actual product thought</li>
            <li> This lotion will definitely take you to the next level. Not only do you get amazing color but you will smell great before and after. This product is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this seller. The items are what they say they are. Not half full or previously opened. It was brand new- never used. I love the tingle factor plus bronzer. It&#x27;s like you get the both of both worlds. I love It!!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.....Like the tingle, feels like a mild sunburn, but disappears after a couple hours and turns into a nice tan!!!!</li>
            <li> For a tingle this seemed mild to me. Which is fine. It smells like green apples! I put this on and went on the strongest bed at my tanning salon. I didnt really feel hot in the tanning bed (the fan was on high), but when i got out of the bed i began to feel just a little burnt. Then about 20 mintues later i felt the burning a little more. This tingle is NOT so strong. Ive tried bombshell by designer skin and that was a lot stronger. However this is a great tingle if you dont want anything extreme. It gave me a nice color. Ive only used it twice now and i am happy with it. People tell me how i have such a nice color already :) I only gave this a 4 out of 5 because i was expecting a stronger tingle, but regardless im still satisfied and thats what is important!</li>
            <li> Great tingler for a deep tan!  Smells nice, not overpowering.  Use caution if you are sensitive to this type of tanning product but if used right you will get great color!</li>
            <li> Love this product and the results!</li>
            <li> If you love a strong tingle with a good bronzer to even out the redness that the tingle will initially give your skin, you will LOVE this stuff. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Of course, if you&#x27;ve never used a tingle I&#x27;d start with something lower as this tingle is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE LOTION! Authentic, fast Shipping, Brand new, Good quality lotion . Leaves a very nice hot tingle and a beautiful color . Smells great like green apples . No bad after tan order . Will definitely recommend to a friend/new tingler users AND  will repurchase !</li>
            <li> Great tingler!! I tan year round and this made my tan deeper, richer, and keeps me beautifully golden even longer! It also makes my skin soft and has a great scent that doesn&#x27;t scream knock ya down like a lot of others. Great price too! More than half off what I paid at the gym the first time I tried it! Even better when it&#x27;s cold out and you just run in for a tan at the salon or gym because it warms ya up fast! HOT HOT!!! So, if ya steam or sauna too, do it BEFORE you tan! Whew! Ha! :)</li>
            <li> I tan as often as I can (Everyday) All year round. I FINALLY found a Lotion I LOVE!!! It has great bronzer and just enough tingler. I have boughten so many tanning lotions and this one by far has done what it says its suppose to. I will never trade nor use anything else. Yes it is a tingler. I&#x27;m use to them so therefore it didn&#x27;t bother me. However for some who haven&#x27;t used them I would start with something a little less intense. I noticed an instant tan as soon as I step out of the bed. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scepticle because my salon had it on sale and usually use more expensive, intense tingle lotions.  This lotion however,  exceeded my expectations.  I loved it so much I bought two more bottles after tanning once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a beautiful dark tab after ONE use.  That&#x27;s right ONE use!&lt;br /&gt;In blonde and pretty fair.  I do have a base tan and need a tingle to get a dark color, however this lotion provided me with additional tanning results in just one tan.&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer left my skin nice and tabbed without a orange tinge.  I was very happy about this.  I hate that orange fake color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of my skin was ok.  I was shocked by how good my skin smelt after one tan in an intense bed for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lotion.  I am a tough cridict and do not give positive reviews for nothing.  Trust me,  try this lotion.  You&#x27;ll be impressed.....</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail today. Ordered from eBay cause I only wanted a packet and not a bottle to see if I liked it. It smells to me like a lemony virus fruit. Very light to me but my family could smell it right away. It&#x27;s an off white color and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s thick and rubs in nice and drys right away. When I was in the tanning bed I felt no tingle and very little heat. I used a level 4 12 minute bed. When I got out i was red and inwas also sweating. I did begin to feel the heat but it was mild. I&#x27;m used to a tingle so it may just be me. It lasted for maybe an hour and when the heat was wearing off I felt some tingle but nothing intense.</li>
            <li> Tingly and after tan fragrance smell is nice.</li>
            <li> this is a great tanning lotion i enjoy the results and have had people ask me what i&#x27;m using  and recomend this product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried the lotion yet, but the bottle is EXTREMELY cheap and thin. I don&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff works,and well but eventually stops the darker you get. It alo smells great amd goes on smooth,wish it was more inside.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for. Works just as expected and makes you super dark after just a couple tans. This is my favorite indoor tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Oh my god I love this tingle lotion. It works great on me I use this and Ruby all the time. Between both these are my two favorite.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!! You get dark, \\&quot;vacation\\&quot; looking results super fast! It is a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; lotion. You  walk out of the tanning bed with results after one session.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as hundred dollar tanning lotions. On my third bottle. I alternate with other stuff but keep coming back to this and with amazons prices its a real bargain!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Introduced to friends and they ordered it as well. Best tanning lotion ever</li>
            <li> Love the texture, smell etc.. after awhile though, works best alternating as most lotions or mixed with a stronger tingle.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product produces a very hot tingle. I am blonde haired and blue eyed with fair, semi-sensitive skin that is somewhat hard to tan which is why I bought the tingle in the first place. I mostly use it on my legs because the tingle is so intense that if I put it on all over it&#x27;s too overwhelming. It also has a light bronzer in it as well. Very nice all-around tingle tan cream for the price and for the outcome. Also, the smell is very nice and I tanned beautifully with it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, like apples, barely any after tan odor. I used the real stuff first to compare and it is the same exact thing. This is a great first tingle for new tingle users, but make sure you have a good base tan before you use it. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Only lotion I use!! You get amazing results that don&#x27;t fade. Tingle is strong but not over powering where you will itch. A little red afterwards but goes away after an hour.</li>
            <li> This stuff is intense. Took about 3 times tanning to see a great effect for me. Expect to be very red right after and tired. If you are pale white you might not want to use this product, get a base first, but it works fast if you can handle the heat ;) just kind feels like a sunburn after for a little awhile.</li>
            <li> To start off with, I bought this lotion unsure of I really wanted or needed a tingle. I was already dark, but ha plataued with my other lotions. So I decided to try this one. I must say it is AMAZING! It Definetly took my tan to the next level and I had gotten many compliments the next day saying I looked really dark and how tan I was. The smell of the lotion is great, it smells like the enchanted apples from Victoria&#x27;s Secret. The lotion itself is thicker, but that just means its more moisturizing. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from it. I felt like I was frying and I was super red when I got out of the bed, but WOW was I tan the next day! I highly recommend this product! Great lotion ! Def worth the money !</li>
            <li> Good Lotion, not as much tingle as I would like.  I wanted a hotter tingle but it is a great smelling lotion that goes on well does have tingle and is well worth the price! Great bargain!!!!!! In salons, this lotion sells for $80</li>
            <li> Fantastic tingling lotion. Only for experience tanners. You get a powerful tingling effect. Leaves you dark. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> this was for a friend so i really can&#x27;t tell you much about this</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.  I first tried it out at my tanning spa and fell in love with it.  I&#x27;ve used Designer Skin products (that usually run around $80), and I can honestly say Risque Ritual works MUCH better.  It is a tingler, so you will probably be red for a few hours afterwards.  The only downfall is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the scent; however, I get a GREAT bronze tan when I use this product, so I can put up with the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Love the tingle. It works folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an olive complexion (I&#x27;m caucasion though) and after two times of using this lotion, I noticed a huge difference. After a month, going three times a week, using Risque Ritual, I&#x27;m a bronzed goddess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not streaky. Not orange. Bronze!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a strong tingle and produces EXCELLENT color. I have worked on the tanning industry for 7 years and this is on of my favorite bronzing tingles.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion has been the best ever!! I&#x27;ve only used it 2 weeks or so, and I&#x27;ve gotten SO much darker. I used bombshell and the lotions I was getting were FAKE! When I order this one it had plastic wrapping (which I&#x27;ve never gotten on my other tanning lotions) and it even had a free after tan sample tapped to the back! The reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because the tingle is not as hot as everyone says. Overall, PERFECT lotion!!</li>
