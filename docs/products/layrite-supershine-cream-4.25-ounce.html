            <li>this product works great in all styles.</li>
            <li>The shine on this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li>I hope all these great reviews are not manufactured by the company.</li>
            <li>Awesome shine, great hold, way easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>If you want a pleasant odor on your hear, you&#x27;d need yet another product.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff washes out good</li>
            <li>In a good way.</li>
            <li>Holds great and gives my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Good shine.</li>
            <li>Good hold.</li>
            <li>but I feel I must do so for this product, because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Layrite is a good product.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and I can style it as needed throughout the day, but the hold isn&#x27;t as good as I want.</li>
            <li>I found this conclusion surprising, since I took a chance on this product.</li>
            <li>Good product though.</li>
            <li>Out of all these brand names I would have to say that Layrite super shine is the best.</li>
            <li>however, the hold is great, and the shine is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Water-soluble and very effective, excellent for that classic &amp;#34;gentleman&#x27;s cut&amp;#34</li>
            <li>sheen is excellent and lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>it holds great and rubs in easy.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth easy to apply!!!</li>
            <li>; that&#x27;s become popular once again.</li>
            <li>Washes out nicely, too.</li>
            <li>How do i put this nicely ....</li>
            <li>to be honest you cant even smell it in your hair.</li>
            <li>I think the super hold is amazing and has a good scent on it.</li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, that&#x27;s apparently a heckuva lot to ask for, because I&#x27;ve never found the perfect combo in one</li>
            <li>Good daily stuff for hair smells great</li>
            <li>It works great, but doesn&#x27;t seem to really hold all day.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the magic of lanolin.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donwnside</li>
            <li>Probably great for someone with straight hair.</li>
            <li>Have used so many hair products that I have lost count.</li>
            <li>One final thing is that it works best if your hair is of medium length or longer.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is made more for an over shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I thought pomade would be a better choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original is like a pomade, nice and &amp;#34;gel-like.&amp;#34; It goes in the hair like the label says, like a wax/gel hybrid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be able to successfully use it, you need a strong pomade first, then add this product for the shine, and finalize with a freeze spray.</li>
            <li>but the shine wasn&#x27;t the best and seemed greasy after a long time.</li>
            <li>Working it into dry hair is a challenge and best done with care, like all water based pomades.  </li>
            <li>shine for those 360 wavers out there like myself and no build up like most products washes out easy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all these years I&#x27;ve finally found my ideal hair product.</li>
            <li>its easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li>Residue on the hands is easy to rinse off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Supershine applies easily and washes out easily too.</li>
            <li>Love the brand but this stuff just gave me hair the shine without a super hold.  </li>
            <li>The shine is OUTSTANDING; as good as Brylcreem with a MUCH stronger hold (which is why I tried it in the first place).  </li>
            <li>but this stuff has a light to meadium hold, super shine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited that I can easily find this product through amazon.  </li>
            <li>Might be good for blondes and light brown soft hair.</li>
            <li>Emphasis on using it lightly.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT pomade; I deduct one star ONLY because of the smell (plastic/glue smell; I hear they are working to improve it).  </li>
            <li>I have coarse, wavy/curly hair, and this pomade looks great in it.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and washes out pretty cleanly in just warm water (I rarely use shampoo because it&#x27;s so drying).</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this but never had a chance.</li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;m THAT interested in this product to go thru this again.</li>
            <li>Original all the way.</li>
            <li>Well I have not tried the original layrite</li>
            <li>i have used original layrite and wasnt a fan.</li>
            <li>Yes it smells like a light bandade smell (4 stars) but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended that you use this as a light top coat with another pomade, especially one with a pleasant scent (e.g. Admiral, Layrite original, etc).</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because it really is SUPER shiny.</li>
            <li>Layrite does it right!</li>
            <li>Another thing is the smell; there isn&#x27;t really much of one at all, which I love.</li>
            <li>The shine is really nice, but it weighs the hair down a lot more, and doesn&#x27;t style as easily.</li>
            <li>Love this product will buy more in the future!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an opaque, almost flesh-colored sticky substance, unlike the Vaseline looking pomade I have from Lucky</li>
            <li>so I have to use this along with Super Hold but otherwise 5 Stars all the way....</li>
            <li>This was the first wax I ever used that was light weight but made my hair piecy yet manageable.</li>
            <li>Long lasting hold throughout the day, lay&#x27;s hair down perfectly and great</li>
            <li>If your hair is straight and easy to control, this product would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more hold than my medium Lucky 13 pomade, but isn&#x27;t nearly as shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a super hold - this is not the right stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other pomades and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>But it is very much worth it because all you need to style your hair is a finger-tip</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also nice is, the hold is definitely there, but the hair doesn&#x27;t harden or go shell-like.</li>
            <li>and if this makes you feel like your hair fall out, you best shave your head and get out of the game.</li>
            <li>Holds all day, high shine and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>it that much to ask for (1) a good hold, but not stiff or dry (2) a great sheen (3) no or minimal smell (4) easy to wash out?</li>
            <li>Tried many different hair creams and pomade from Brylcream to Murrays, suavecito, Crew,and Groom and clean.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good like the other lay-rites.</li>
            <li>Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
            <li>And it washes right out with water and shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely good for dapper gentlemen&#x27;s everyday use or for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Its been great so far and seems like it&#x27;ll go a long way.</li>
            <li>Great product but not better than Suavecito for wavy hair in my experience.  </li>
            <li>After realizing that I needed to look a little more respectable in job interviews in and after college</li>
            <li>This is a very light pomade and does only what it says, shines.</li>
            <li>Product seems fine but who knows how old it is.  </li>
            <li>Good if you use a little with another product.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>You might even want to blow-dry it first, although I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is the first pomade that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>The blonde spot on my hair popped out more from this stuff</li>
            <li>Bumble n bumble Sumotech smells better and stronger hold even if hard to apply its better than this product.</li>
            <li>I like the sharp, spicy smell of my Lucky 13 better, but it clashes with my perfume sometimes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more and I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who what&#x27;s to get into pomades.</li>
            <li>washes out pretty well, leaves my hair a touch dry, but most of the water based pomades do that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to smooth down a stray tuft.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is in applying it to damp hair right after a shower; moisture seems to degrade it pretty quickly, so if you&#x27;re going for a really shiny Don Draper slicked-back look, make sure your hair is pretty dry first.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li>it gets very sticky when you rub it between your palms, and on damp hair, it isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to comb in, but once it&#x27;s in, this is the easiest pomade I&#x27;ve ever styled.</li>
            <li>you use too much, you end up looking like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in ages.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger after applied.</li>
            <li>The pomades they make wash out really well even after holding my hair in a side pompadour style haircut ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>(For real, this product gets ladies&#x27; attention)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shine, but not great hold.</li>
            <li>Not the strongest hold but very shinny finish nonetheless.</li>
            <li>you really have to know your hair and and how to use this product.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much besides that</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews I thought I had finally found something to tame my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Let me explain: I&#x27;ve been searching for practically all my adult life for the right hair product, and I must have tried every gel (hello &#x27;80s), paste, wax and pomade out there.</li>
            <li>The description says &amp;#34;High Hold&amp;#34;, I find it more like medium and less strong than let&#x27;s say Medium Hold American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is claimed that this is the same formula as the original, just with added shine.</li>
            <li>The jar arrive with a large black X on the top of the lid like it is either a sample or expired.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble ensuring that I look as put together at the end of a 14 hour day as I did first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Brush to get the general style right, then use a comb to create the parting.</li>
            <li>The super shine definitely lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>I use savecito and a little of this super shine layrite and BANG!!</li>
            <li>I do a low-pomp usually, and have very fine straight hair, and this gets it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The high shine is sticky, goopy like a putty, and it&#x27;s stickier and heavier in the hair.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too greasy, my only complaint is it could smell better.</li>
            <li>Once you get your hair coated, it combs just fine (at least on my straight, fine hair), just again take it slow and easy with the comb.  </li>
            <li>I switched barbers after we moved to a new city, and he turned me on to Layrite products.</li>
            <li>On dry hair, I would call the hold pretty strong, even though the jar says &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; I have used American Crew &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; pomade, and the Layrite has a MUCH stronger hold than the American Crew.  </li>
            <li>Actually had better hold then I expected</li>
            <li>I started searching around the World Wide Web to find styling tips and the right products for me at a price that was reasonable...</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, was that it didn&#x27;t exactly rinse off of my hands, but needed soap to get it off.</li>
            <li>then this in combination with the superhold or regular pomade is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it as if I was using regular Layrite and wouldnt have that hold</li>
            <li>The product worked well on my hair and worked as expected, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the sickly sweet Orangesicle chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty short haircut, old fashioned &amp;#34;short back and sides&amp;#34; style, and I like a crisp part.</li>
            <li>The pomade is easy to wash out of your hair, and stays firm all day.</li>
            <li>I have a job that requires a hat, but only outdoors, so I&#x27;m constantly doing quick fixes on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Smooth a little with my hands, and done.</li>
            <li>my hair, I&#x27;ve started pairing this with their regular pomade, in order to give it a little more rigidity without making my hair</li>
            <li>However, I realized that if I just used a tiny amount, it still held in place and was really shiny and soft, as well.</li>
            <li>: Smells like lanolin (a natural byproduct of wool processing).</li>
            <li>Guys with short or spiky hair might not get as much benefit.</li>
            <li>It washes out with NO trouble using JUST water.  </li>
            <li>Con: It washes out with NO trouble using JUST water.</li>
            <li>I find it too oily, smells like old cooking oil, and it doesn&#x27;t hold as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practically scentless and surprisingly soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the whole Layrite pomade line.</li>
            <li>and I would constantly be combing throughout the day like a real greaser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is by far my fav.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;This is really just for extra shine.</li>
            <li>After a few hours hair is starting to escape and you need to either add some more and or reconvene your hair.</li>
            <li>Great for the wet look and a little goes along way to shine up the due.</li>
            <li>They recommend you apply to dry hair – I usually towel dry but never blow dry, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Just go slow and easy when applying.</li>
            <li>Although I wanted a heavy product, Layrite super shine didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>Feels like Murray&#x27;s or any other old style pomade and last ALL day, yet it washes right out with one wash unlike Murrays.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my dad and it made his hair super curly which is odd!</li>
            <li>Layrite Super Shine leaves my hair well groomed without looking stiff as a board.</li>
            <li>I used to use Monkey Brains, but they stopped making it, so after trying original Layrite, and Suavacito, and quite a few available at most standard drugstores (I&#x27;m sad to say, including got2Be, crew, etc.)I tried this, and I&#x27;m home!</li>
            <li>A little harder to wash out than hair gel, but still comes out easily.</li>
            <li>That said, I spent much time trying to find a product that could tame my curly hair in just the right way.</li>
            <li>Once rubbed in, I use a brush to get started, and it&#x27;s a little tuggy at first – that would be my only gripe, but it&#x27;s so insignificant</li>
            <li>still use it sometimes, I mean its not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li>Does have a super shine but not enough hold for my hair which is thick and curly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good product though.</li>
            <li> Out of all these brand names I would have to say that Layrite super shine is the best.</li>
            <li> however, the hold is great, and the shine is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Water-soluble and very effective, excellent for that classic &amp;#34;gentleman&#x27;s cut&amp;#34</li>
            <li> sheen is excellent and lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li> it holds great and rubs in easy.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth easy to apply!!!</li>
            <li> ; that&#x27;s become popular once again.</li>
            <li> Washes out nicely, too.</li>
            <li> How do i put this nicely ....</li>
            <li> to be honest you cant even smell it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I think the super hold is amazing and has a good scent on it.</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, that&#x27;s apparently a heckuva lot to ask for, because I&#x27;ve never found the perfect combo in one</li>
            <li> Good daily stuff for hair smells great</li>
            <li> It works great, but doesn&#x27;t seem to really hold all day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the magic of lanolin.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donwnside</li>
            <li> Probably great for someone with straight hair.</li>
            <li> Have used so many hair products that I have lost count.</li>
            <li> One final thing is that it works best if your hair is of medium length or longer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is made more for an over shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I thought pomade would be a better choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original is like a pomade, nice and &amp;#34;gel-like.&amp;#34; It goes in the hair like the label says, like a wax/gel hybrid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be able to successfully use it, you need a strong pomade first, then add this product for the shine, and finalize with a freeze spray.</li>
            <li> but the shine wasn&#x27;t the best and seemed greasy after a long time.</li>
            <li> Working it into dry hair is a challenge and best done with care, like all water based pomades.  </li>
            <li> shine for those 360 wavers out there like myself and no build up like most products washes out easy...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all these years I&#x27;ve finally found my ideal hair product.</li>
            <li> its easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> Residue on the hands is easy to rinse off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Supershine applies easily and washes out easily too.</li>
            <li> Love the brand but this stuff just gave me hair the shine without a super hold.  </li>
            <li> The shine is OUTSTANDING; as good as Brylcreem with a MUCH stronger hold (which is why I tried it in the first place).  </li>
            <li> but this stuff has a light to meadium hold, super shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited that I can easily find this product through amazon.  </li>
            <li> Might be good for blondes and light brown soft hair.</li>
            <li> Emphasis on using it lightly.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT pomade; I deduct one star ONLY because of the smell (plastic/glue smell; I hear they are working to improve it).  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy/curly hair, and this pomade looks great in it.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and washes out pretty cleanly in just warm water (I rarely use shampoo because it&#x27;s so drying).</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this but never had a chance.</li>
            <li> sure if I&#x27;m THAT interested in this product to go thru this again.</li>
            <li> Original all the way.</li>
            <li> Well I have not tried the original layrite</li>
            <li> i have used original layrite and wasnt a fan.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells like a light bandade smell (4 stars) but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended that you use this as a light top coat with another pomade, especially one with a pleasant scent (e.g. Admiral, Layrite original, etc).</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because it really is SUPER shiny.</li>
            <li> Layrite does it right!</li>
            <li> Another thing is the smell; there isn&#x27;t really much of one at all, which I love.</li>
            <li> The shine is really nice, but it weighs the hair down a lot more, and doesn&#x27;t style as easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy more in the future!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an opaque, almost flesh-colored sticky substance, unlike the Vaseline looking pomade I have from Lucky</li>
            <li> so I have to use this along with Super Hold but otherwise 5 Stars all the way....</li>
            <li> This was the first wax I ever used that was light weight but made my hair piecy yet manageable.</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold throughout the day, lay&#x27;s hair down perfectly and great</li>
            <li> If your hair is straight and easy to control, this product would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more hold than my medium Lucky 13 pomade, but isn&#x27;t nearly as shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a super hold - this is not the right stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other pomades and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> But it is very much worth it because all you need to style your hair is a finger-tip</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s also nice is, the hold is definitely there, but the hair doesn&#x27;t harden or go shell-like.</li>
            <li> and if this makes you feel like your hair fall out, you best shave your head and get out of the game.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, high shine and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> it that much to ask for (1) a good hold, but not stiff or dry (2) a great sheen (3) no or minimal smell (4) easy to wash out?</li>
            <li> Tried many different hair creams and pomade from Brylcream to Murrays, suavecito, Crew,and Groom and clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good like the other lay-rites.</li>
            <li> Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
            <li> And it washes right out with water and shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely good for dapper gentlemen&#x27;s everyday use or for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Its been great so far and seems like it&#x27;ll go a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product but not better than Suavecito for wavy hair in my experience.  </li>
            <li> After realizing that I needed to look a little more respectable in job interviews in and after college</li>
            <li> This is a very light pomade and does only what it says, shines.</li>
            <li> Product seems fine but who knows how old it is.  </li>
            <li> Good if you use a little with another product.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> You might even want to blow-dry it first, although I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the first pomade that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The blonde spot on my hair popped out more from this stuff</li>
            <li> Bumble n bumble Sumotech smells better and stronger hold even if hard to apply its better than this product.</li>
            <li> I like the sharp, spicy smell of my Lucky 13 better, but it clashes with my perfume sometimes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more and I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who what&#x27;s to get into pomades.</li>
            <li> washes out pretty well, leaves my hair a touch dry, but most of the water based pomades do that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to smooth down a stray tuft.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is in applying it to damp hair right after a shower; moisture seems to degrade it pretty quickly, so if you&#x27;re going for a really shiny Don Draper slicked-back look, make sure your hair is pretty dry first.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li> it gets very sticky when you rub it between your palms, and on damp hair, it isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to comb in, but once it&#x27;s in, this is the easiest pomade I&#x27;ve ever styled.</li>
            <li> you use too much, you end up looking like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in ages.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger after applied.</li>
            <li> The pomades they make wash out really well even after holding my hair in a side pompadour style haircut ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> (For real, this product gets ladies&#x27; attention)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great shine, but not great hold.</li>
            <li> Not the strongest hold but very shinny finish nonetheless.</li>
            <li> you really have to know your hair and and how to use this product.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much besides that</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews I thought I had finally found something to tame my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Let me explain: I&#x27;ve been searching for practically all my adult life for the right hair product, and I must have tried every gel (hello &#x27;80s), paste, wax and pomade out there.</li>
            <li> The description says &amp;#34;High Hold&amp;#34;, I find it more like medium and less strong than let&#x27;s say Medium Hold American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is claimed that this is the same formula as the original, just with added shine.</li>
            <li> The jar arrive with a large black X on the top of the lid like it is either a sample or expired.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble ensuring that I look as put together at the end of a 14 hour day as I did first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Brush to get the general style right, then use a comb to create the parting.</li>
            <li> The super shine definitely lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> I use savecito and a little of this super shine layrite and BANG!!</li>
            <li> I do a low-pomp usually, and have very fine straight hair, and this gets it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The high shine is sticky, goopy like a putty, and it&#x27;s stickier and heavier in the hair.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too greasy, my only complaint is it could smell better.</li>
            <li> Once you get your hair coated, it combs just fine (at least on my straight, fine hair), just again take it slow and easy with the comb.  </li>
            <li> I switched barbers after we moved to a new city, and he turned me on to Layrite products.</li>
            <li> On dry hair, I would call the hold pretty strong, even though the jar says &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; I have used American Crew &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; pomade, and the Layrite has a MUCH stronger hold than the American Crew.  </li>
            <li> Actually had better hold then I expected</li>
            <li> I started searching around the World Wide Web to find styling tips and the right products for me at a price that was reasonable...</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, was that it didn&#x27;t exactly rinse off of my hands, but needed soap to get it off.</li>
            <li> then this in combination with the superhold or regular pomade is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it as if I was using regular Layrite and wouldnt have that hold</li>
            <li> The product worked well on my hair and worked as expected, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the sickly sweet Orangesicle chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty short haircut, old fashioned &amp;#34;short back and sides&amp;#34; style, and I like a crisp part.</li>
            <li> The pomade is easy to wash out of your hair, and stays firm all day.</li>
            <li> I have a job that requires a hat, but only outdoors, so I&#x27;m constantly doing quick fixes on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Smooth a little with my hands, and done.</li>
            <li> my hair, I&#x27;ve started pairing this with their regular pomade, in order to give it a little more rigidity without making my hair</li>
            <li> However, I realized that if I just used a tiny amount, it still held in place and was really shiny and soft, as well.</li>
            <li> : Smells like lanolin (a natural byproduct of wool processing).</li>
            <li> Guys with short or spiky hair might not get as much benefit.</li>
            <li> It washes out with NO trouble using JUST water.  </li>
            <li> Con: It washes out with NO trouble using JUST water.</li>
            <li> I find it too oily, smells like old cooking oil, and it doesn&#x27;t hold as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically scentless and surprisingly soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the whole Layrite pomade line.</li>
            <li> and I would constantly be combing throughout the day like a real greaser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is by far my fav.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;This is really just for extra shine.</li>
            <li> After a few hours hair is starting to escape and you need to either add some more and or reconvene your hair.</li>
            <li> Great for the wet look and a little goes along way to shine up the due.</li>
            <li> They recommend you apply to dry hair – I usually towel dry but never blow dry, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Just go slow and easy when applying.</li>
            <li> Although I wanted a heavy product, Layrite super shine didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Feels like Murray&#x27;s or any other old style pomade and last ALL day, yet it washes right out with one wash unlike Murrays.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dad and it made his hair super curly which is odd!</li>
            <li> Layrite Super Shine leaves my hair well groomed without looking stiff as a board.</li>
            <li> I used to use Monkey Brains, but they stopped making it, so after trying original Layrite, and Suavacito, and quite a few available at most standard drugstores (I&#x27;m sad to say, including got2Be, crew, etc.)I tried this, and I&#x27;m home!</li>
            <li> A little harder to wash out than hair gel, but still comes out easily.</li>
            <li> That said, I spent much time trying to find a product that could tame my curly hair in just the right way.</li>
            <li> Once rubbed in, I use a brush to get started, and it&#x27;s a little tuggy at first – that would be my only gripe, but it&#x27;s so insignificant</li>
            <li> still use it sometimes, I mean its not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li> Does have a super shine but not enough hold for my hair which is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I went and saw my barber and He told me that first you want to use a little bit less of the regular/strong hold Layrite and then style your hair like you would, wait for it to slightly dry and then apply a little bit of the Super Shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommended, worth the price, buy this pomade, you wont be sorry...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a proper replacement to Crew&#x27;s Grooming Cream for a long while</li>
            <li> and it held all day, but it also weighed it down and never dried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was opened or just been in stock for too long</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> i dont know what i would do without you, considering i swore away bees wax long ago and nothing else hold or washes out like layrite.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> The pomade is a gummy like texture that leaves your hair shiny all day long.</li>
            <li> the only down side is the plastic smell, which is really not much of a big deal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly dry or harden, like suavacito or monkey brains, but stays workable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews (too lazy really)</li>
            <li> This pomade is odd to say the least, no scent to speak of, and when you scoop it out, it&#x27;s a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li> If you need to touch up your hair, just wet your comb and rake it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;super shine&amp;#34; is way too heavy, and i have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Just makes it look wet.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s not my favorite, but I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected based on other&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> I still use Brylcreem if I know I might get wet; may try some other oil-based pomades as well just to avoid this.  </li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, you need to know how to use it i.e. use it in _addition_ to other products.  </li>
            <li> like their other pomade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pomade works wonders with my other layrite products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to send an email but the address wasn&#x27;t active</li>
            <li> Good shine but terrible smell</li>
            <li> Its definitely not fir thick hair</li>
            <li> Go slow, or leave your hair towel-dry-damp to make it a lot easier (although dampness &#x3D; less final hold).  </li>
            <li> I mowed the lawn, drove to the grocery with the windows down, worked in the hot-ass attic, and this held up and held shape.</li>
            <li> The sheen tends to fade a bit toward the end of the day, but you can revive that some by smoothing down with damp</li>
            <li> So STOP SEARCHING FOE OTHER POMADES!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product from other stores but they came out dried out.  </li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying i have tried a few other companies and compared my results to theirs.</li>
            <li> , my hair didn&#x27;t look as shiny as my friends hair that is jet black.</li>
            <li> most other water based pomades i have used just dry up throughout the day and end up looking stupid, but this pomade will blow you away!</li>
            <li> Super shine smells bad in your hair all day</li>
            <li> Some pomades can be a little funky, and this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The hair feels a little tacky, but not sticky or goopy.</li>
            <li> This, I found a little upsetting.</li>
            <li> Unless you have really thin hair, this should not be the only pomade you use if you&#x27;re goal is height.</li>
            <li> I wanted to stray from hair gel because it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> This pomade holds well, but never gets stiff and &amp;#34;plastick-y&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Controls flyaway hair but not strong hold.</li>
            <li> I understand this is supershine, but on the product description it stays will tame curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair thick and coarse but can be tamed with other products but not this one sadly.</li>
            <li> For all that, I find it too expensive; you can get the desired outcome following the above formula with less expensive products.</li>
            <li> Personally it sucks and is too heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> i have a small pomp and sometime go for the side part.</li>
            <li> I put this on after a base of superhold, gives me exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> but they were dry and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, hard to control, and wavy.</li>
            <li> No nice scent.</li>
            <li> The least they (or the vendor) could do is exchange</li>
            <li> murrays sucks, grants medium hold, and suavecito,</li>
            <li> hair is thick and wavy do not get this alone</li>
            <li> it has a lot of &#x27;sheen&#x27; (shine) that stays looking slick all day!</li>
            <li> Very small matter</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> sorry Donnie</li>
            <li> it smells bad , like plastic</li>
            <li> oh it smells bad...</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> not to mention it looks bad ass!</li>

            <li> Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product from other stores but they came out dried out.  I don&#x27;t know if it was opened or just been in stock for too long but they were dry and difficult to manage.  These product is great on the hair and worked as advertised.  It arrived earlier than expected and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Unless you have really thin hair, this should not be the only pomade you use if you&#x27;re goal is height. This is a very light pomade and does only what it says, shines.</li>
            <li> Good stuff washes out good I&#x27;ll use it again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this product. I ordered this for my dad and it made his hair super curly which is odd!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good like the other lay-rites. I did get compliments on my shiny hair though.</li>
            <li> Controls flyaway hair but not strong hold. My hair thick and coarse but can be tamed with other products but not this one sadly. I didn&#x27;t like muddy greasiness of product. No nice scent. Bumble n bumble Sumotech smells better and stronger hold even if hard to apply its better than this product. Sad. Was hoping it&#x27;d be great after reading reviews. Might be good for blondes and light brown soft hair.</li>
            <li> The product worked well on my hair and worked as expected, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the sickly sweet Orangesicle chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected based on other&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> Love the brand but this stuff just gave me hair the shine without a super hold.  If you want a super hold - this is not the right stuff.</li>
            <li> Good daily stuff for hair smells great</li>
            <li> Actually had better hold then I expected but the shine wasn&#x27;t the best and seemed greasy after a long time. Good if you use a little with another product.</li>
            <li> It works great, but doesn&#x27;t seem to really hold all day. After a few hours hair is starting to escape and you need to either add some more and or reconvene your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got short hair and use this basically like wax. Its been great so far and seems like it&#x27;ll go a long way. Smells like a cross between plastic and Starburst. In a good way.</li>
            <li> Great hold. Great shine. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the smell. Smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I used to use Monkey Brains, but they stopped making it, so after trying original Layrite, and Suavacito, and quite a few available at most standard drugstores (I&#x27;m sad to say, including got2Be, crew, etc.)I tried this, and I&#x27;m home! This pomade is odd to say the least, no scent to speak of, and when you scoop it out, it&#x27;s a very creamy texture. it gets very sticky when you rub it between your palms, and on damp hair, it isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to comb in, but once it&#x27;s in, this is the easiest pomade I&#x27;ve ever styled. I do a low-pomp usually, and have very fine straight hair, and this gets it. It doesn&#x27;t exactly dry or harden, like suavacito or monkey brains, but stays workable. Even after three re-combings, it stays shiny and holds well. I mowed the lawn, drove to the grocery with the windows down, worked in the hot-ass attic, and this held up and held shape. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, was that it didn&#x27;t exactly rinse off of my hands, but needed soap to get it off. but that seems to be the only downside. washes out pretty well, leaves my hair a touch dry, but most of the water based pomades do that. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good shine but terrible smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited that I can easily find this product through amazon.  If you&#x27;re like me and your hair when you wake up in the morning resembles a brillo pad and you don&#x27;t like it looking that way then this in combination with the superhold or regular pomade is exactly what you need. its easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth easy to apply!!! Love this product will buy more in the future!!!! Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Best shine ever. That&#x27;s the magic of lanolin. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donwnside: Smells like lanolin (a natural byproduct of wool processing). Highly recommended that you use this as a light top coat with another pomade, especially one with a pleasant scent (e.g. Admiral, Layrite original, etc). Emphasis on using it lightly.</li>
            <li> i dont know what i would do without you, considering i swore away bees wax long ago and nothing else hold or washes out like layrite.&lt;br /&gt;thank guys.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Feels like Murray&#x27;s or any other old style pomade and last ALL day, yet it washes right out with one wash unlike Murrays. Really good stuff!</li>
            <li> Does have a super shine but not enough hold for my hair which is thick and curly. Probably great for someone with straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an opaque, almost flesh-colored sticky substance, unlike the Vaseline looking pomade I have from Lucky 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more hold than my medium Lucky 13 pomade, but isn&#x27;t nearly as shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much, you end up looking like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is no big deal. I like the sharp, spicy smell of my Lucky 13 better, but it clashes with my perfume sometimes. Overall it&#x27;s not my favorite, but I don&#x27;t hate it. The plus side is, it&#x27;s going to last me FOREVER. The jar ain&#x27;t nothing to sneeze at.</li>
            <li> Have used so many hair products that I have lost count. Layrite Super Shine leaves my hair well groomed without looking stiff as a board. The shine that this product provides is great too. If they improve the smell I would give it 10 stars.</li>
            <li> Its definitely not fir thick hair and I didnt like the smell.</li>
            <li> The product has worked for me as advertised.</li>
            <li> Water-soluble and very effective, excellent for that classic &amp;#34;gentleman&#x27;s cut&amp;#34; that&#x27;s become popular once again. And it washes right out with water and shampoo. The only issue I have is in applying it to damp hair right after a shower; moisture seems to degrade it pretty quickly, so if you&#x27;re going for a really shiny Don Draper slicked-back look, make sure your hair is pretty dry first. You might even want to blow-dry it first, although I don&#x27;t. I tend to prefer a moderate amount of slickness, so it works out for my taste. Another thing is the smell; there isn&#x27;t really much of one at all, which I love. Some pomades can be a little funky, and this one isn&#x27;t. One final thing is that it works best if your hair is of medium length or longer. Guys with short or spiky hair might not get as much benefit.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT pomade; I deduct one star ONLY because of the smell (plastic/glue smell; I hear they are working to improve it).  The smell does not last though so don&#x27;t worry.  Working it into dry hair is a challenge and best done with care, like all water based pomades.  Go slow, or leave your hair towel-dry-damp to make it a lot easier (although dampness &#x3D; less final hold).  Once you get your hair coated, it combs just fine (at least on my straight, fine hair), just again take it slow and easy with the comb.  On dry hair, I would call the hold pretty strong, even though the jar says &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; I have used American Crew &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; pomade, and the Layrite has a MUCH stronger hold than the American Crew.  The shine is OUTSTANDING; as good as Brylcreem with a MUCH stronger hold (which is why I tried it in the first place).  Another pro:  It washes out with NO trouble using JUST water.  Con: It washes out with NO trouble using JUST water. If you get caught in the rain, you&#x27;re done for.  I still use Brylcreem if I know I might get wet; may try some other oil-based pomades as well just to avoid this.  Bottom Line:  Awesome shine, great hold, way easy to wash out. Just go slow and easy when applying.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Holds all day, high shine and washes out easily. I&#x27;ve used many other pomades and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Holds great and gives my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> This was the first wax I ever used that was light weight but made my hair piecy yet manageable.</li>
            <li> Perfect hold awesome shine. Doesn&#x27;t smell that great but the scent doesn&#x27;t really linger after applied. I will definitely be buying more and I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who what&#x27;s to get into pomades.</li>
            <li> I returned this canister was cracked all across the bottom. I never even opened to test how this product worked. I was excited to try this but never had a chance. Why doesn&#x27;t Amazon make it easier to exchange a product. Now I need to order the product again. The least they (or the vendor) could do is exchange the damaged product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;m THAT interested in this product to go thru this again.</li>
            <li> I styled my hair with this and it held all day, but it also weighed it down and never dried.</li>
            <li> It is claimed that this is the same formula as the original, just with added shine. NOT the case! The texture is entirely different, and it lays entirely different in the hair, too. The original is like a pomade, nice and &amp;#34;gel-like.&amp;#34; It goes in the hair like the label says, like a wax/gel hybrid. The high shine is sticky, goopy like a putty, and it&#x27;s stickier and heavier in the hair. The shine is really nice, but it weighs the hair down a lot more, and doesn&#x27;t style as easily. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this one again. Original all the way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is made more for an over shine. Personally it sucks and is too heavy on your hair. I think the super hold is amazing and has a good scent on it. Super shine smells bad in your hair all day</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, you need to know how to use it i.e. use it in _addition_ to other products.  I find it too oily, smells like old cooking oil, and it doesn&#x27;t hold as advertised.  The description says &amp;#34;High Hold&amp;#34;, I find it more like medium and less strong than let&#x27;s say Medium Hold American Crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be able to successfully use it, you need a strong pomade first, then add this product for the shine, and finalize with a freeze spray. If you want a pleasant odor on your hear, you&#x27;d need yet another product.  For all that, I find it too expensive; you can get the desired outcome following the above formula with less expensive products.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected, transaction seamless.</li>
            <li> After realizing that I needed to look a little more respectable in job interviews in and after college I started searching around the World Wide Web to find styling tips and the right products for me at a price that was reasonable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  That said, I spent much time trying to find a product that could tame my curly hair in just the right way. That is when I found Layrite&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;  Layrite does it right! The pomades they make wash out really well even after holding my hair in a side pompadour style haircut ALL DAY. The product even SMELLS GREAT. I always get complimented by my girl because of the way it looks and smells. (For real, this product gets ladies&#x27; attention)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you are worried about the price, let me tell you, I felt the same way. But it is very much worth it because all you need to style your hair is a finger-tip scoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: love it. So STOP SEARCHING FOE OTHER POMADES!</li>
            <li> I know this product and it is very good. The jar arrive with a large black X on the top of the lid like it is either a sample or expired.  Product seems fine but who knows how old it is.  Buying from Amazon third party sellers is like shopping a garage sale.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Great shine, but not great hold.</li>
            <li> The hold is awesome, the smell...not so good.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good shine. Good hold.</li>
            <li> I put this on after a base of superhold, gives me exactly what I want. Not too strong, not too greasy, my only complaint is it could smell better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews (too lazy really) but I feel I must do so for this product, because it&#x27;s so good. Let me explain: I&#x27;ve been searching for practically all my adult life for the right hair product, and I must have tried every gel (hello &#x27;80s), paste, wax and pomade out there. Never been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it that much to ask for (1) a good hold, but not stiff or dry (2) a great sheen (3) no or minimal smell (4) easy to wash out? Well, let me tell you, that&#x27;s apparently a heckuva lot to ask for, because I&#x27;ve never found the perfect combo in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is perfect. It&#x27;s practically scentless and surprisingly soft and creamy. Goes on easily and washes out pretty cleanly in just warm water (I rarely use shampoo because it&#x27;s so drying). They recommend you apply to dry hair – I usually towel dry but never blow dry, and it works great. I have a pretty short haircut, old fashioned &amp;#34;short back and sides&amp;#34; style, and I like a crisp part. Once rubbed in, I use a brush to get started, and it&#x27;s a little tuggy at first – that would be my only gripe, but it&#x27;s so insignificant, I wouldn&#x27;t even call it that. Brush to get the general style right, then use a comb to create the parting. Smooth a little with my hands, and done. Residue on the hands is easy to rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheen is excellent and lasts pretty well. What&#x27;s also nice is, the hold is definitely there, but the hair doesn&#x27;t harden or go shell-like. You can run your fingers through your hair or adjust it during the day. The hair feels a little tacky, but not sticky or goopy. It&#x27;s easy to smooth down a stray tuft. The sheen tends to fade a bit toward the end of the day, but you can revive that some by smoothing down with damp hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all these years I&#x27;ve finally found my ideal hair product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the whole Layrite pomade line. I switched barbers after we moved to a new city, and he turned me on to Layrite products. The super shine definitely lives up to its name. The pomade is a gummy like texture that leaves your hair shiny all day long. If you need to touch up your hair, just wet your comb and rake it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely good for dapper gentlemen&#x27;s everyday use or for special occasions. I have coarse, wavy/curly hair, and this pomade looks great in it.</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold throughout the day, lay&#x27;s hair down perfectly and great shine for those 360 wavers out there like myself and no build up like most products washes out easy...so over all a good product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a seriously great product. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because it really is SUPER shiny. I have blonde hair and I don&#x27;t want it to look greasy. However, I realized that if I just used a tiny amount, it still held in place and was really shiny and soft, as well. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Well I have not tried the original layrite but this stuff has a light to meadium hold, super shine! Great for the wet look and a little goes along way to shine up the due. Yes it smells like a light bandade smell (4 stars) but goes away quickly. So shine vs scent? I use savecito and a little of this super shine layrite and BANG!! Washes out nicely, too. On shine there&#x27;s no competition!</li>
            <li> This is the first pomade that I&#x27;ve used so my review might not be spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Layrite is a good product. My hair is thick, hard to control, and wavy. I wanted to stray from hair gel because it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as I wanted it to be. I had stray hairs all over the place so I thought pomade would be a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Layrite Supershine applies easily and washes out easily too. A little harder to wash out than hair gel, but still comes out easily. Although I wanted a heavy product, Layrite super shine didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. I like that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and I can style it as needed throughout the day, but the hold isn&#x27;t as good as I want. If your hair is straight and easy to control, this product would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given a 4 star review but the seller didn&#x27;t satisfy me. The container/tub of Layrite was cracked on the side. Very small matter but I wanted to tell this family ran business about it. I didn&#x27;t expect anything, I just wanted to let them know. They sent me a copy paste email telling about their family run business and if I had any issues, email or call them. I didn&#x27;t want to call them, because that seems kin I aggressive. I wanted to send an email but the address wasn&#x27;t active and it said that in the copy/paste email they sent. This, I found a little upsetting. The product was unharmed, but they need to update their contact info.</li>
            <li> Great product but not better than Suavecito for wavy hair in my experience.  Shine doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Not the strongest hold but very shinny finish nonetheless. And even though it might have not been tested on animals it still contains animal products (i.e. lanolin, beeswax). In my opinion that is not cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> Tried many different hair creams and pomade from Brylcream to Murrays, suavecito, Crew,and Groom and clean. Out of all these brand names I would have to say that Layrite super shine is the best. I found this conclusion surprising, since I took a chance on this product. however, the hold is great, and the shine is fantastic! The pomade is easy to wash out of your hair, and stays firm all day. the only down side is the plastic smell, which is really not much of a big deal. Buy this pomade! You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is too greasy for me.  This one sits in the cabinet.  I like Imperial, Suavecito, and JS Sloan over this.</li>
            <li> you really have to know your hair and and how to use this product. The first time I used it as if I was using regular Layrite and wouldnt have that hold and I would constantly be combing throughout the day like a real greaser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I went and saw my barber and He told me that first you want to use a little bit less of the regular/strong hold Layrite and then style your hair like you would, wait for it to slightly dry and then apply a little bit of the Super Shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it sometimes, I mean its not a bad product at all. Just know how to use it.</li>
            <li> The blonde spot on my hair popped out more from this stuff but it didn&#x27;t do much besides that, my hair didn&#x27;t look as shiny as my friends hair that is jet black. Good product though.</li>
            <li> How do i put this nicely ....it smells bad , like plastic and it dont \\&quot;layrite\\&quot; gives you the murrys greased up feel made MY HAIR fall out this product is not for me. i will stick to the OG layrite and the rest of there products but this one gets an f from me sorry Donnie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a proper replacement to Crew&#x27;s Grooming Cream for a long while and I think this is the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a great job of providing hold that is neither shiny or &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; like their other pomade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, I&#x27;ve started pairing this with their regular pomade, in order to give it a little more rigidity without making my hair crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This product has been perfect for me.  I have a job that requires a hat, but only outdoors, so I&#x27;m constantly doing quick fixes on my hair.  This pomade holds well, but never gets stiff and &amp;#34;plastick-y&amp;#34;.  I have no trouble ensuring that I look as put together at the end of a 14 hour day as I did first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> one of the best pomades on the market and it smells great...I have very thick hair so I have to use this along with Super Hold but otherwise 5 Stars all the way....</li>
            <li> i like the regular version of this product... the &amp;#34;super shine&amp;#34; is way too heavy, and i have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying i have tried a few other companies and compared my results to theirs. i have used original layrite and wasnt a fan. murrays sucks, grants medium hold, and suavecito, oh and dax short and neat. this is by far my fav. i have a small pomp and sometime go for the side part. this product works great in all styles. most other water based pomades i have used just dry up throughout the day and end up looking stupid, but this pomade will blow you away! it has a lot of &#x27;sheen&#x27; (shine) that stays looking slick all day! it holds great and rubs in easy. not to mention it looks bad ass! alright so another person leaving a review was like oh it smells bad... whatever, get over it. to be honest you cant even smell it in your hair. and if this makes you feel like your hair fall out, you best shave your head and get out of the game. highly recommended, worth the price, buy this pomade, you wont be sorry...</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed with this product. After reading all the great reviews I thought I had finally found something to tame my curly hair. The shine on this stuff is really great. But that&#x27;s it. No hold whatsoever. I understand this is supershine, but on the product description it stays will tame curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t. Just makes it look wet. That&#x27;s it. I ordered the superhold so hopefully that will work. I hope all these great reviews are not manufactured by the company.</li>
            <li> This pomade works wonders with my other layrite products.&lt;br /&gt;If hair is thick and wavy do not get this alone you will need the extra hold or the regular one.&lt;br /&gt;This is really just for extra shine.</li>
    </ol>
