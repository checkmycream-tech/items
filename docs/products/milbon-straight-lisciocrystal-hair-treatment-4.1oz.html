            <li>did not know it is Japanese products!!!Japanese products are the best!!!!</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love it thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li>I came home and ordered it right away and loved it ever since</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the most amazing effective hair straightening product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It works best when I apply it to damp/towel-dry hair, then blow dry.</li>
            <li>my hair looks shinny, healthy, smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t make the hair greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Manageable, smooth and ends look</li>
            <li>I like how light this is when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Right now I swear by this !</li>
            <li>I love all the Milbon products as this company really understands hair.</li>
            <li>Appy on damp hair ends after washing before Blow drying and hair looks bouncy silky and straight and fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I thought that would be too much and make my hair greasy, but it is just right!</li>
            <li>This product is really first class.  </li>
            <li>I use this all the time and it really helps my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>I first learned about this product from my hair stylist, she used it on me during my appoint and my hair has never looked so silky [without the greasy feeling]</li>
            <li>Adds shine, bounce and it really does help you hair to be super straight and sleek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything.</li>
            <li>Thanks, I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asian with straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>can be used alone and works very well alone.  </li>
            <li>It has a very watery consistency, and absorbs into the hair fast.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very shiny</li>
            <li>and really helped detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t so much soak in and treat the hair as evaporate off the hair</li>
            <li>it appears to be very oily...</li>
            <li>Works to keep my fly-a-ways under control when wearing my hair naturally curly or the curly out in the humid environment when wearing my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and it has a soft pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I have curly, frizy hair and live in a high humid area.</li>
            <li>apply only about 1-1 1/2 pumps in wet hair and blow dry smell is awesome and give me shine and helps my hair stay straight as well as protect from heat and help my ends to not snap as much when round brushing my 3c curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is a nice treatment, but very expensive, especially considering that it&#x27;s mostly mid-grade silicones.</li>
            <li>I apply right after washing my hair and let it air dry just a bit and right before it becomes completely dry, I blow-dry it.  </li>
            <li>This is normally only found in very high end salons</li>
            <li>makes my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Milbon Straight Lisciocrystal for several years.</li>
            <li>This helps make it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how soft and bouncy my hair is.</li>
            <li>The inphenom conditioner is my preferred product from the line so far.</li>
            <li>I only used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li>after I blow dry my hair I put a few more drops on my hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lighter and less oily, but there is a fragrance that I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the few things I really cannot live without.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you are sensitive to scents!</li>
            <li>It really smooths it down!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this serum a little goes a long way and it has a soft pleasant scent.  It is pricey but does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Milbon Straight Lisciocrystal for several years. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it. I have curly, frizy hair and live in a high humid area. This helps make it soft and shiny. I use it when my hair is damp and then again before I flat iron it. It&#x27;s great to use between hair straightening treatments. I tried switching to various Argan oil products but keep coming back to this because it&#x27;s not as heavy and doesn&#x27;t smell like Argan oil.  This is normally only found in very high end salons so I was happy to find it on Amazon and will buy again from this seller because I no longer go to the salon where I found Milbon products.</li>
            <li> This product is really first class.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t make the hair greasy at all.  I put it on when hair is damp and&lt;br /&gt;then blowdry.  The result shiny, silky manageable hair.  Thanks, I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it really helps my frizzy hair! My hair dresser recommended it and I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 years.  Very pleased.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is shinbied and this product smoothes my hair like nothing else and gives it great shine. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have yet to find a better product.</li>
            <li> Use this product before blow drying, and prepare to be amazed! Adds shine, bounce and it really does help you hair to be super straight and sleek. I use this product because I have thermally reconditioned hair. But anyone desiring straight locks will not be disappointed! Added bonus, this stuff smells amazing! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the most amazing effective hair straightening product I have ever used. Appy on damp hair ends after washing before Blow drying and hair looks bouncy silky and straight and fabulous. I just absolutely love it thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  can be used alone and works very well alone.  went to the carribean for easter break &amp; usually my hair can get frizzy, it did not I would have to say it was because of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Leaves my hair shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> After using the Elujuda oil, I wanted to try something different for my hair.. This project works okay, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. It has a very watery consistency, and absorbs into the hair fast.</li>
            <li> I love all the Milbon products as this company really understands hair. This is another product from them that I love. Makes hair manageable.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product in my hair the last time I visited my salon.  I loved it and went to Amazon get a better bargain than the salon. It helps to tame the frizz and gives me an overall sleek look. It works best when I apply it to damp/towel-dry hair, then blow dry. I also LOVE the smell. It is a very light scent and makes me feel like I was at the salon. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy, either. I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive products for my hair, but this one is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My hair Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product in the hair salon cuz&#x27; i asked to guy for a product that would prevent split ends. I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful product for 4 years already. I just put a few drops on my palms and passed it through my ends when hair is half dry. IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. I&#x27;m asian with straight and fine hair. Hair looks healthy and without frizz. Manageable, smooth and ends look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few things I really cannot live without. I even put small amounts in traveling bottles when I&#x27;m not home. i&#x27;ve tried a lot of pharmacy brands serums but none do the same job. GREAT PRODUCT! So happy this was invented &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Amazing hair product. I only used it for the first time last night and I can&#x27;t believe how soft and bouncy my hair is. I had a keratin treatment 2 months ago and my hair needed a little help since some of the treatment is wearing off. I also swam in a pool and I think it did some damage to my hair. I will order this product again and recommend it to others. It is well worth the money. If my hair looks good I feel good.</li>
            <li> I like how light this is when you put it on.  Gives you shine without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very shiny but it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to blow-dry your hair with!  It really smooths it down!  I apply right after washing my hair and let it air dry just a bit and right before it becomes completely dry, I blow-dry it.  Great for fine hair, too.</li>
            <li> Right now I swear by this ! I wash my hair apply only about 1-1 1/2 pumps in wet hair and blow dry smell is awesome and give me shine and helps my hair stay straight as well as protect from heat and help my ends to not snap as much when round brushing my 3c curly hair.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product from my hair stylist, she used it on me during my appoint and my hair has never looked so silky [without the greasy feeling] I came home and ordered it right away and loved it ever since</li>
            <li> and really helped detangle my hair.  Unfortunately, the scent was so strong, that this product gave me terrible migraines and I am not able to use it.  Be careful if you are sensitive to scents!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the advice of someone who uses it often, since she has curly hair.  I have some curl just on the ends, made worse by high humidity where I live.  Anyway, I think this product probably does some good, and I have seen ok results.</li>
            <li> This is a nice treatment, but very expensive, especially considering that it&#x27;s mostly mid-grade silicones. It doesn&#x27;t so much soak in and treat the hair as evaporate off the hair so it&#x27;s not overly greasy. I like it much more than Moroccan oil, it&#x27;s lighter and less oily, but there is a fragrance that I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything. This was recommended to me by my japanese hair dresser who switched away from the Kerastase line. When I pump it in my had it appears to be very oily... but as soon as I put it in my hair, it vanishes...almost as if I had never put anything in. Later in the day is sleeks down but I can&#x27;t tell if its the oil or my conditioner. The inphenom conditioner is my preferred product from the line so far. Of the hair oils I&#x27;ve tried Biosilk, Chi, Argan, Kerastase, Almond, Coconut, Herstyler... I could barely noticed a difference or change in my hair although it didn&#x27;t make my hair worse. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but will not repurchase. My roommate uses it too, she seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Works to keep my fly-a-ways under control when wearing my hair naturally curly or the curly out in the humid environment when wearing my hair straight.  It says to use 2 pumps and I thought that would be too much and make my hair greasy, but it is just right!</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing.  Makes my frizzy hair look nice and the scent is wonderful, too.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference after I put it on my hair.  my hair looks shinny, healthy, smooth and manageable.  I put about 6 to 10 drops on my hair.  before I blow dry my hair I put a few drops. after I blow dry my hair I put a few more drops on my hair. I had used a lot of product before. but this is the best.  I will only use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product!I will buy it again.My Japanese hair stylist recommends to use this and he uses for his salon. I love it!!I did not know it is Japanese products!!!Japanese products are the best!!!!</li>
