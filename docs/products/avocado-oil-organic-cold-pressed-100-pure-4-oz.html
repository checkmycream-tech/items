            <li>I&#x27;m about to create a hot oil treatment with this oil as well!</li>

            <li>So far I am satisfied with both service and results from the oil.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I add it to my face moisturizer (just a drop) in the palm of my hand with the moisturizer, and it really makes a difference in clearing up any blemishes quickly.  </li>
            <li>very fast drying.</li>
            <li>Ok so it smells like raw avocado (pear where I am from :-)).</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty</li>
            <li>This vendor would be the first time I&#x27;m purchasing from them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these oils are the real deal!</li>
            <li>My first time ordering this product</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using oils on my face.</li>
            <li>I use it differently than most people probably in the fact that I use it as a soothing rub for my arthritic hands and knees and feet.</li>
            <li>I really like the suppleness my skin has after using this!</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but if you use too much it will dry it out more.</li>
            <li>and so my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture it has.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing to the hair.  </li>
            <li>The quality is really good , I just hope they start using better bottles, since the current ones are very weak.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Luckily I have good genes and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, crows feet, etc., but this product does seal in moisture which I need during this ridiculously cold winter.</li>
            <li>Glad they offered this little size to check it out.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a pure product!</li>
            <li>I had a very fast delivery and the bottle it came in was simple and neat.</li>
            <li>so i guess my question is are these the exact same oils am i being scamed.</li>
            <li>and It has made my skin do a complete 180(: Will forever buy avocado oil!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Makes your shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair and it is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am a natural oil fanactic</li>
            <li>I like that nutty aroma and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>( I barely know what it means, but it must be a country thing!)</li>
            <li>The oil is virtually scent free so is a great base for adding other essential oils.</li>
            <li>But that being said, sometimes I&#x27;ll get a little spray bottle pour in a little water, some aloe juice and top it off with the avocado oil</li>
            <li>Now I want to make one thing perfectly clear, I don&#x27;t discriminate when it comes to my hair and trying different products,( I actually use aloe Vera juice on my hair!)</li>

            <li> and I find that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to put oil on my sometimes oily skin</li>

            <li> Add to your other products, lotions, shampoos, conditioners, etc.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils to get all around benefits.</li>
            <li> Please if you are going to do the review yourself and post it on the site at least make it less obvious.</li>
            <li> The previous review is soooo written by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected this to taste and smell like, but it&#x27;s a little bland for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I find this to be my little hidden treasure!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my skin and it works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got myself a little hair cocktail!</li>
            <li> not sure if this is the problem</li>
            <li> Small size of 4 oz.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, there let me wipe this cream cheese off my mouth.</li>

            <li> The previous review is soooo written by the manufacturer. Please if you are going to do the review yourself and post it on the site at least make it less obvious. lol.</li>
            <li> Terrible!Had me breaking out!!</li>
            <li> My afro 4c hair loves this oil. Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil in conjunction with Rose hip oil as a nightly moisturizer and it&#x27;s fantastic! I only apply 3 drops but it soaks into my skin like butter. So light weight yet effective. Luckily I have good genes and don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, crows feet, etc., but this product does seal in moisture which I need during this ridiculously cold winter. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great addition to lotion and hair products . Leaves the hair moisturizer. Add to your current products it adds additional moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this. It is so great for your skin. Perfect for winter time when the face gets more dry.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described. Shipping was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thought the product would be greener in color, but it&#x27;s fine doesnt matter really.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I cannot say enough good things about this or the shipper.  Every Dr Adorable product I have received has been sealed, in excellent condition and is of quality.</li>

            <li> Seems fine. Received on time. Small size of 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Great product thanks it does what I intended and looking forward to different uses for this product. yay yay yay</li>
            <li> mixed with other oils for my hair, see hair growth, and leaves soft and shiny! great for skin and hair!</li>
            <li> Ok I know avocados are good to eat I eat them as if they&#x27;re going out of style. See I get some cream cheese and, oh wait this isn&#x27;t that kind of review. I&#x27;m sorry, there let me wipe this cream cheese off my mouth. Ok how come no one told me about this glorious, amazingly perfect oil?! Lol! Not only does my skin look gorgeous but so does my hair! Now I want to make one thing perfectly clear, I don&#x27;t discriminate when it comes to my hair and trying different products,( I actually use aloe Vera juice on my hair!) But as my father in law from Tennessee use to say, \\&quot;well, I&#x27;ll tell you what\\&quot;( I barely know what it means, but it must be a country thing!) Lol! Avocado oil is the stuff!&lt;br /&gt; All I do is put it on my hair and let it do it&#x27;s thing! It feels really light and silky and It brings my hair to life by making it shiny and glossy(is glossy still a word? ) Now of course, even though the avocado oil is light it still is an oil and it should be used sparingly in your hair. But that being said, sometimes I&#x27;ll get a little spray bottle pour in a little water, some aloe juice and top it off with the avocado oil and I&#x27;ve got myself a little hair cocktail! And guess what amazon sells all of the things I use including the bottle, but not the water (they tell me it&#x27;s free) lol!</li>
            <li> This oil is great! I had a very fast delivery and the bottle it came in was simple and neat. This vendor would be the first time I&#x27;m purchasing from them. So far I am satisfied with both service and results from the oil. I use it on my hair and skin, mostly on my face and under arms it is said that jojoba oil is good in preventing acne and so far it has for me</li>
            <li> i got two different bottles of two different oils and i think it wierd they both dont smell like any thing and they look exacally the same so i guess my question is are these the exact same oils am i being scamed. the other one i got was castor oil it seems for sure that one would have a smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected this to taste and smell like, but it&#x27;s a little bland for my tastes. I will probably use it for homemade beauty products, as it&#x27;s good quality. I prefer the hemp seed or olive/coconut oils for consumption... It arrived quickly and as promised. Glad they offered this little size to check it out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these oils are the real deal! Will not buy again</li>
            <li> My first time ordering this product and I really like it! The oil is virtually scent free so is a great base for adding other essential oils.</li>
            <li> Ok so it smells like raw avocado (pear where I am from :-)). It keeps my hair moisturized....finally something that does that and so my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much.</li>
            <li> Makes your shiny and soft.  I only been using it for a week.  So far I love it.  Will do a updated in 3 more weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of Dr.&#x27;s Adorable oil. The quality is really good , I just hope they start using better bottles, since the current ones are very weak.</li>
            <li> Add to your other products, lotions, shampoos, conditioners, etc.  I add it to my face moisturizer (just a drop) in the palm of my hand with the moisturizer, and it really makes a difference in clearing up any blemishes quickly.  I also use it with my leave in hair conditioner and my hair looks and feels thicker, perhaps it&#x27;s because it seems to have stopped the breakage problem I was having.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair and it is so soft and manageable. Wished I ordered the bigger bottle. I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. I use it everyday on my skin and it works. Highly recommend . It is inexpensive</li>
            <li> Love this as a moisturizer! I find this to be my little hidden treasure! I have combination oily/dry skin and eczema on my arms and It has made my skin do a complete 180(: Will forever buy avocado oil!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using oils on my face. I&#x27;ve definantly notice a smoother and softer texture to my skin!</li>
            <li> The oil is basically odorless and spreads easily. I really like the texture it has. Nice amount provided as well.</li>
            <li> Instead of Avocado oil I have a Argan oil. I wish they were careful when placing the items for orders accordingly</li>
            <li> I read about this stuff for a while. Works great on damaged skin. Sunburn, scars, etc. very fast drying.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very good and pure.  I use it differently than most people probably in the fact that I use it as a soothing rub for my arthritic hands and knees and feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added this to my skin care regimen and love it! I&#x27;m about to create a hot oil treatment with this oil as well! Can&#x27;t wait! Excellent quality and mixes well with lotions and other oils!</li>
            <li> I really like the suppleness my skin has after using this! I mix it with other oils to get all around benefits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is organic oil. It had no smell at all. I ordered two other types of oils from this seller and they all looked the same. I said it before and I&#x27;m saying it again, I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> love using this oil it does wonders for my skin and hair im so glad i was able to find this product</li>
            <li> I am a natural oil fanactic so I love this oil. Very light not heavy at all. I use with my Rosemary essential oil.</li>
            <li> Great face moisturizer but if you use too much it will dry it out more. The dispenser leaks too so be careful sitting it on your bed or letting it sit on its side. I also use it on my hair but not by itself so I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s solo benefits.</li>
            <li> it served its purpose</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> A great quality jojoba oil a lot in the bottle.This is always good more for my hair. I use it every day to help my hair grow I&#x27;m waiting for excellent results . Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help my kids eczema problems but now I am using it. I like that nutty aroma and makes my skin soft. I ordered more of unrefined  8 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. It arrived quickly and I am very happy with it. This is a tiny bottle and I find that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works great on your face to remove wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing to the hair.  Have already repurchased.</li>
            <li> Arrived ontime. Good product. I would purchse again from Dr.Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;I found the ordering process easy and processional without issues.</li>
