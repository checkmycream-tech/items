    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so she&#x27;s very happy with her eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Great for just eye liner, BUT you can also do designs with it!</li>
            <li>This liner is perfect for that.</li>
            <li>IT IS THE BEST EYE LINER I EVER</li>
            <li>All of my friends are in awe by the activities I can do without altering my perfect liner whether it&#x27;s sweat in the Charleston humidity or, as I mentioned, swim in the ocean.  </li>

            <li>This one is perfect.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt (in my opinion) that Maybeliine is the best producer of eye makeup, not just in this price range, but across the board.  </li>

            <li>This is an EXCELLENT liquid liner if you have the time and doesn&#x27;t have to rush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect eyeliner though.</li>
            <li>Very good but doesn&#x27;t for a lot of hours it cracks after a while.</li>
            <li>Its very good.</li>
            <li>Ultraliner is actually great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a great thickness.</li>
            <li>Looks great and stays on well.</li>

            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and can&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li>My favorite waterproof eyeliner!!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not too experienced with it, but I can&#x27;t get it to look good.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with cooking oil (the perfect makeup remover also for a pittance...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade which is good</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Cannot always find&lt;br /&gt;in retail stores so am delighted to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is good.</li>
            <li>Its a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Good formula for eyeliner.</li>
            <li>really good make up remover to take this off, or else you&#x27;ll end up loosing some eyelashes.</li>
            <li>you are planning to purchase this, you should be fairly good with a brush.  </li>
            <li>I loved this line, it does start to crack and come off throughout the day sometimes</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Dries fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It stays all day without smearing and easy to take off at night!!</li>
            <li>Women must know and appreciate this wonderful eyeliner and snatch it right when it is delivered to the stores.    </li>
            <li>The brush is the perfect width, and it holds the exact amount of liner needed.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, thank you so much!</li>
            <li>but I would buy it again unless I found a store that sells my favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my FAVORITE eyeliner EVER!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product for drugstore makeup.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t peel or flake unless you&#x27;re too generous with it, and it has amazing staying power.  </li>
            <li>do have to say it can get kind of clumpy, but that is fix-able.</li>
            <li>It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed.  </li>
            <li>Nice tube and applicator</li>
            <li>Ugh i cant believe there are so many good reviews for this p.o.s liner.</li>
            <li>This is the one makeup product that I own that</li>
            <li>This was nice if I needed to smudge or fix it, but it also made me keep me eyes</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled that I found it on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Some of the cons people write about this I kind of find as a pro.</li>
            <li>But it applies nice.</li>
            <li>So it took me a while to decide how well I liked this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice, waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>However, it is certainly kind of waterproof formula, althought it tends to flake, so you have to retouch this.</li>
            <li>It has a some kind of thickener that turns it into a glue rubber like texture but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years, and it&#x27;s the absolute best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.</li>
            <li>It flakes off on its own.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and great line - great for running to work,</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>It has very strong fumes which burned my eye</li>
            <li>The style of the brush makes it very easy to apply, and once it&#x27;s applied it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>and she loved it, cheap and it does stay on all day without peeling.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and my eyes some times water and this eyeliner is the best I&#x27;ve used so far and doesn&#x27;t come off until I wash it off before sleeping.</li>
            <li>Can be applied easily in a very fine outline or thicker</li>
            <li>This is very good quality and the package came completely how it looks.</li>
            <li>I LOVE brushes, and prefer them over felt tips</li>
            <li>my favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to keep makeup for more than a year, but</li>
            <li>Still, I would invest in a better product.</li>
            <li>Many eyeliners boast that they stay on all day and are waterproof but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>You can find Ultra Liner mostly any department or pharmacy type store and online here.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>

            <li>but now it&#x27;s better.</li>

            <li>You should, its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still my favorite eyeliner.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>wished the product was better.</li>
            <li>I have switched to Stilla all day wear eye liner which is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I moved t another country and they just sell my favorite liquid eyeliner in my country</li>
            <li>It will give your that sexy kitten eye look.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I LOVE this drug store liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>ordered 5 and will prob order more</li>
            <li>This is a favorite of mine, have been using it for 20 years.</li>
            <li>Cat eyes are my every day look and this liquid eyeliner does a competent job.</li>
            <li>and I even sure if I do not wash it away before the night it will going</li>
            <li>A much better buy for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but I would not purchase this eye liner again.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>BUT, make sure you have</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love</li>
            <li>i will never use another liquid liner on my top lid.</li>
            <li>Not so satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The price is ok but the quality changed.</li>
            <li>whatever it is, I love it.  </li>
            <li>A liner I love is *</li>
            <li>I really really really really!!!!</li>
            <li>Best use is in the first week but starts to thicken up after that, it is still usable for the duration of the bottle but not as smooth as went first opened.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, gives me a fine line, its an art to use this eyeliner, its fantastic!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It also gives you the cateye look.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, if I hadn&#x27;t reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line.</li>
            <li>I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it.</li>
            <li>it is good eyeliner but very smual</li>
            <li>The brush makes my eyeliner very precise and clean.</li>
            <li>, it comes off easily when I wash my face with Cetaphil at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Stays on until I take it off - goes on easy and can withstand my sweaty workouts!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>The applicator actually gives you control of your lines and it goes on smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>eye makeup remover or just baby oil seems to do the trick just fine.</li>
            <li>The color is great though, nice and dark.</li>
            <li>I bought this after I purchased a very fine tip that required too many passes to make a decent line.</li>
            <li>A great product for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I notice it works fabulous for designs on my eyes..</li>
            <li>Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready.  </li>
            <li>From department store brands to cheap pharmacy brands, to korean brands.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth more than $8</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and precisely, and stays on until you decide to take it off, be it with makeup remover or cleanser.  </li>
            <li>the actually pen is great</li>
            <li>I also bought e.l.f. brand because it was incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>For my daily use, it works great.</li>
            <li>It stays agains tears and light rain though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner ever since I got a free sample.</li>
            <li>I bothered to see if this was available on Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning planning to wash it off and reapply, but it was so perfect even after a night&#x27;s sleep that I kept it on and wore it the whole day without issue.</li>
            <li>The end of the brush isn&#x27;t as fine as I expected, but great liner nonetheless.</li>
            <li>You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup.  </li>
            <li>This liner is super fantastic.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner was great, just took quite a while to dry.</li>
            <li>I heard that this eyeliner had super staying power, and it was super cheap, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply as the brush easily paints on straight, also sweat proof.</li>
            <li>I order in bulk because I love it so much, I have been using this eyeliner for years</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing appealing about this line.</li>
            <li>Line isn&#x27;t full, flakes off after about one hour</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase though</li>
            <li>start to peel off, but it also is pretty easy to take off once you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bold black though perfect for goths, rockabilly&#x27;s or anyone who wants to do the cat eye look.</li>
            <li>This is great for me because I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was</li>
            <li>Love the new feature inside the opening, which keeps all but the liquid that&#x27;s on your brush, off the wand!</li>
            <li>Works fine, it is what I wanted and came exactly  as it said it would.</li>
            <li>when you first apply it seems fine, although the applicator has NO precision.</li>
            <li>It is also not glue consistency, like the korean ones, and it&#x27;s nice and smooth and extra black.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve probably tried 20 different eyeliners but this is my favorite</li>
            <li>Drys quick.  </li>
            <li>Also the liner dries super quick so if you are like me and it takes you awhile to put on your liquid liner you may want to stay away from this product.</li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re considering this eyeliner, make sure you&#x27;re comfortable using these kinds of brushes because if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand it will not be pretty.  </li>
            <li>The black is a great color.  </li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of applying it, you will have long lasting, awesomely lined eyes.</li>
            <li>it pretty much just ok</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t make the line too think &amp; you will have perfect long lasting outlines every time.</li>
            <li>I really like how it lasts awhile but can be easily removed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is kind of clumpy during application and dries kind of slowly.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found it on Amazon, because all the local drug stores (no matter whether  in CA or OR, where I spend most of my time) seem to run out of this particular product first!    </li>
            <li>I have such an unsteady hand, and I can usually not apply any kind of eyeliner for the life of me, but somehow even I can apply this evenly!</li>
            <li>I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away.  </li>
            <li>This stays on and looks great, is easy to apply, dries quickly (other brands stay wet and smear ready for 3 and more times longer than Maybelline does).</li>
            <li>If you are indeed comfortable with it, this gives you the most precise lines and the truest black ever.</li>
            <li>It was my first time with liquid and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but I found that for me this kind tends to dry and flake off.</li>
            <li>For those who have no hand eye coordination or can&#x27;t draw a straight line to save their life I&#x27;d suggest not buying eye liner at all since you guys always blame the product instead of your own inability to properly apply the product.</li>
            <li>For less than $6 it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of it.  </li>
            <li>Well turns out amazon has them for much cheaper, so I just stocked up for myself and my mom for the whole year!!</li>
            <li>The liner was a bit liquidy first</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, I forgot to take it off before bed.</li>
            <li>and it comes along if you try to apply more in the blank spaces</li>
            <li>Have used this product for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>Better than similar products&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for the waterproof factor and since it is the first liquid eyeliner i ever owned 13 years ago.</li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted over 2 years.</li>
            <li>I use this eyeliner after I use pencil eyeliner to give it more color and lasting power.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it, much better value than stores.</li>
            <li>When I use it, I put eyeshadow on first, then line my lids.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely my go-to liner. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn&#x27;t give you racoon</li>
            <li>have Asian eyes which means my eyes are more prone to smudges and to so called raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like them better and find that the liner last longer (both on my face and in the bottle).</li>
            <li>I actually like it the most out of all of my liquid liners.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it looks nice a little streaky, but a good black, as soon as it drys (so about a min after application)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good black (dark) and was delivered early and in good condition.</li>
            <li>That makes it kind of hard to put the lid completely on; however, that&#x27;s definitely not something that has deterred me from continuing to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li>I live in AZ and we have very HOT summers, it holds no problem and no smudging.</li>
            <li>I like a dramatic yet natural look, and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It comes of easily at night with regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Flaked and easily removed with a cotton swab dipped only in water.</li>
            <li>You put it on once in the morning, and it comes off easily in the shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To start off with, it has a really deep, strong color that doesn&#x27;t fade, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even used liquid liner in twelve years until the last week and first try made a very even and precise line.</li>
            <li>It might be great for someone with steady hands and experience, but not good for me.</li>
            <li>It is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While it does go on very well, it sometimes flakes off.</li>
            <li>Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering.</li>
            <li>Dries out really really fast, it cracks, &amp; it peels.</li>
            <li>I bought this a my local drug store because it was cheap and the liner pencils just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>However, it is very waterproof and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very waterproof</li>
            <li>Stays on well, however, it ended up in the trash because the brush is incredibly flimsy, making it extremely difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>clumped up too much and pieces would go in my eyes after a while.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast.</li>
            <li>because it really is my fault that I do not like this.</li>
            <li>You really have to scrub.</li>
            <li>Line is stay on your eyelids for whole day</li>
            <li>This stuff stays on very well through tears and rain.</li>
            <li>like to wear it for my nights out, and it lasts the whole night and beyond!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I actually really like it for cats eye.</li>
            <li>No one wants an eyeliner that disapears after 20 min of wearing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now, but only because it&#x27;s the only thing I own at the moment.</li>
            <li>The brush is far shorter than most liquid eyeliner brushes and only one coat is needed.</li>
            <li>almost shut for a few minutes so it didn&#x27;t smudge on its own.</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect for a winged effect or just a basic thin line.  </li>
            <li>It is  easy to use and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it does take on a very shiny appearance after a very long time on the lids (say, 12 hours), and can peel off very easily if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>The only good things I can say about it are the brush is thin and the product goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in order to use exactly the right amount of liquid, i dab it on my upper eyelid and use an eyeliner brush to draw it out over the lash line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the formula is, but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove.  </li>
            <li>i cant remember, but years of not good enough whatever bs products later, i am back...and you are the BEST AFTER ALL.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>I bought this having high hopes..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For a bargain shopper or even as a spare for those who don&#x27;t mind shelling out their life savings got one tenth of an ounce of eyeliner, i would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner for at least 2 years and it works amazingly well every time.</li>
            <li>It did not glide on smoothly, like expected.</li>
            <li>Great product in an expensive price.</li>
            <li>one complaint is that after awhile, excess eyeliner kind of builds up around the edge of the tube.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to wash off either</li>
            <li>I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right.  </li>
            <li>At two of my jobs, I have super long shifts where I can&#x27;t touch up my face.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner fits the bill for me - it allows you to put on a very thin, even line that looks great even without eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I love the soft tip applicator and the long last formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am hoping I just needed a new bottle</li>
            <li>One quick stroke and a thick enough non-smudgable, really waterproof and stays in place, easily removed with soap.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Easy to apply ad long lasting</li>
            <li>while it applies really well, and it&#x27;s a very dark rich color; it&#x27;s starts to peel and flake within an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of years and I love it.</li>
            <li>This went on strong but dried crusty and flaky.</li>
            <li>The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.&lt;br /&gt;*It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel wet on your eye</li>
            <li>After moving to NY from SF - I&#x27;ve had to spend as much as $10-$12 for this eyeliner depending on what store is actually selling it and is conveniently near me since I don&#x27;t drive in NY.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend much, but needs a basic eyeliner.</li>
            <li>When applied, it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li>It glides on and drys fast especially when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li>it is no where near waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it was old, I dont know.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this eyeliner for years and was pleasantly surprised that it is still around.</li>
            <li>It has a soft tip</li>
            <li>But out of all the liners I&#x27;ve worn, this is the longest wearing one by far.</li>
            <li>I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD.</li>
            <li>and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been my favorite eye liner for the past 7 years!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is really affordable and really reliable.</li>
            <li>Lines well, super dark and not clumpy, and lasts for &amp;#62;12 hours every time I apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I should keep buying new bottles every so many weeks without using up the old ones because I think being exposed to too much air breaks down its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>as great as the expensive premium makeup brands!</li>
            <li>It dries too quickly for me and going over, even slightly, removes it or makes it clump up.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of drugstore eyeliners waterproof and regular and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, the tip is too small to draw a smooth line</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and it really is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Brush is great for control and easily can switch from thin to thick lines with a little practice.</li>
            <li>I switch to the new one without finishing the last one.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I bought a new bottle recently</li>
            <li>This is the only eyeliner that will stay put on my asian eyelid the whole day without smudging.</li>
            <li>and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it</li>
            <li>Very long lasting, does not smear or smudge even when it is hot out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a hard time doing the quick swipe across the eyelid and typically do short strokes from corner of the eye out, but you need to be fast with this one.</li>
            <li>The brush is thin so you can get a very precise line.</li>
            <li>It does require some practice to put on just right, but once I got it, I never want to go back to other eye liners.    </li>
            <li>I can swim in the ocean and the liner barely changes.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried somewhere near 20 or 25 different liquid eyeliners.  </li>
            <li>Like, several years old.</li>
            <li>you can apply light or thick.</li>
            <li>I tried this because honestly it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, but I found the brush applicator to be a DISASTER to apply, it went all over my eye except where I was aiming it to go,</li>
            <li>I have been using this eyeliner for years because it doesn&#x27;t flake and the black is very intense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dark, and can&#x27;t be altered at all (smudged with fingers to get the right look).</li>
            <li>so it is not that easy to apply ( at least for someone that does not wear make up too regularly).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried as of late.</li>
            <li>but if you are a seasoned liquid eyeliner user you shouldn&#x27;t have to much trouble with it.</li>
            <li>My main problem with this eyeliner is that the tube gets extremely clumped up.</li>
            <li>color is so rich, black, and dark.  </li>
            <li>It goes on shiny but then dries matte, and it creates a very sharp edge that really cannot be smudged out, so only buy this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the high end department store brands as well as several other drug store brands</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly but then comes off little by little</li>
            <li>I found this product to be effective, but it&#x27;s hard to remove and goes on really thick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is an EXCELLENT liquid liner if you have the time and doesn&#x27;t have to rush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect eyeliner though.</li>
            <li> Very good but doesn&#x27;t for a lot of hours it cracks after a while.</li>

            <li> Ultraliner is actually great.  </li>

            <li> LOVE this product and can&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> My favorite waterproof eyeliner!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not too experienced with it, but I can&#x27;t get it to look good.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with cooking oil (the perfect makeup remover also for a pittance...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade which is good</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Cannot always find&lt;br /&gt;in retail stores so am delighted to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is good.</li>
            <li> Its a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Good formula for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> really good make up remover to take this off, or else you&#x27;ll end up loosing some eyelashes.</li>
            <li> you are planning to purchase this, you should be fairly good with a brush.  </li>
            <li> I loved this line, it does start to crack and come off throughout the day sometimes</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Dries fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It stays all day without smearing and easy to take off at night!!</li>
            <li> Women must know and appreciate this wonderful eyeliner and snatch it right when it is delivered to the stores.    </li>
            <li> The brush is the perfect width, and it holds the exact amount of liner needed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> but I would buy it again unless I found a store that sells my favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my FAVORITE eyeliner EVER!  </li>
            <li> Amazing product for drugstore makeup.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t peel or flake unless you&#x27;re too generous with it, and it has amazing staying power.  </li>
            <li> do have to say it can get kind of clumpy, but that is fix-able.</li>
            <li> It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed.  </li>
            <li> Nice tube and applicator</li>
            <li> Ugh i cant believe there are so many good reviews for this p.o.s liner.</li>
            <li> This is the one makeup product that I own that</li>
            <li> This was nice if I needed to smudge or fix it, but it also made me keep me eyes</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled that I found it on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some of the cons people write about this I kind of find as a pro.</li>
            <li> But it applies nice.</li>
            <li> So it took me a while to decide how well I liked this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice, waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> However, it is certainly kind of waterproof formula, althought it tends to flake, so you have to retouch this.</li>
            <li> It has a some kind of thickener that turns it into a glue rubber like texture but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years, and it&#x27;s the absolute best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.</li>
            <li> It flakes off on its own.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and great line - great for running to work,</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> It has very strong fumes which burned my eye</li>
            <li> The style of the brush makes it very easy to apply, and once it&#x27;s applied it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> and she loved it, cheap and it does stay on all day without peeling.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes some times water and this eyeliner is the best I&#x27;ve used so far and doesn&#x27;t come off until I wash it off before sleeping.</li>
            <li> Can be applied easily in a very fine outline or thicker</li>
            <li> This is very good quality and the package came completely how it looks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE brushes, and prefer them over felt tips</li>
            <li> my favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to keep makeup for more than a year, but</li>
            <li> Still, I would invest in a better product.</li>
            <li> Many eyeliners boast that they stay on all day and are waterproof but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> You can find Ultra Liner mostly any department or pharmacy type store and online here.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>

            <li> You should, its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still my favorite eyeliner.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> wished the product was better.</li>
            <li> I have switched to Stilla all day wear eye liner which is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I moved t another country and they just sell my favorite liquid eyeliner in my country</li>
            <li> It will give your that sexy kitten eye look.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I LOVE this drug store liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> ordered 5 and will prob order more</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine, have been using it for 20 years.</li>
            <li> Cat eyes are my every day look and this liquid eyeliner does a competent job.</li>
            <li> and I even sure if I do not wash it away before the night it will going</li>
            <li> A much better buy for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but I would not purchase this eye liner again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> BUT, make sure you have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love</li>
            <li> i will never use another liquid liner on my top lid.</li>
            <li> Not so satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The price is ok but the quality changed.</li>
            <li> whatever it is, I love it.  </li>
            <li> A liner I love is *</li>
            <li> I really really really really!!!!</li>
            <li> Best use is in the first week but starts to thicken up after that, it is still usable for the duration of the bottle but not as smooth as went first opened.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, gives me a fine line, its an art to use this eyeliner, its fantastic!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It also gives you the cateye look.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, if I hadn&#x27;t reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line.</li>
            <li> I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it.</li>
            <li> it is good eyeliner but very smual</li>
            <li> The brush makes my eyeliner very precise and clean.</li>
            <li> , it comes off easily when I wash my face with Cetaphil at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Stays on until I take it off - goes on easy and can withstand my sweaty workouts!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Only good thing is it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> The applicator actually gives you control of your lines and it goes on smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> eye makeup remover or just baby oil seems to do the trick just fine.</li>
            <li> The color is great though, nice and dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I purchased a very fine tip that required too many passes to make a decent line.</li>
            <li> A great product for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I notice it works fabulous for designs on my eyes..</li>
            <li> Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready.  </li>
            <li> From department store brands to cheap pharmacy brands, to korean brands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth more than $8</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and precisely, and stays on until you decide to take it off, be it with makeup remover or cleanser.  </li>
            <li> the actually pen is great</li>
            <li> I also bought e.l.f. brand because it was incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li> The color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> For my daily use, it works great.</li>
            <li> It stays agains tears and light rain though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner ever since I got a free sample.</li>
            <li> I bothered to see if this was available on Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning planning to wash it off and reapply, but it was so perfect even after a night&#x27;s sleep that I kept it on and wore it the whole day without issue.</li>
            <li> The end of the brush isn&#x27;t as fine as I expected, but great liner nonetheless.</li>
            <li> You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup.  </li>
            <li> This liner is super fantastic.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was great, just took quite a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I heard that this eyeliner had super staying power, and it was super cheap, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply as the brush easily paints on straight, also sweat proof.</li>
            <li> I order in bulk because I love it so much, I have been using this eyeliner for years</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing appealing about this line.</li>
            <li> Line isn&#x27;t full, flakes off after about one hour</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase though</li>
            <li> start to peel off, but it also is pretty easy to take off once you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bold black though perfect for goths, rockabilly&#x27;s or anyone who wants to do the cat eye look.</li>
            <li> This is great for me because I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was</li>
            <li> Love the new feature inside the opening, which keeps all but the liquid that&#x27;s on your brush, off the wand!</li>
            <li> Works fine, it is what I wanted and came exactly  as it said it would.</li>
            <li> when you first apply it seems fine, although the applicator has NO precision.</li>
            <li> It is also not glue consistency, like the korean ones, and it&#x27;s nice and smooth and extra black.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve probably tried 20 different eyeliners but this is my favorite</li>
            <li> Drys quick.  </li>
            <li> Also the liner dries super quick so if you are like me and it takes you awhile to put on your liquid liner you may want to stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re considering this eyeliner, make sure you&#x27;re comfortable using these kinds of brushes because if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand it will not be pretty.  </li>
            <li> The black is a great color.  </li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of applying it, you will have long lasting, awesomely lined eyes.</li>
            <li> it pretty much just ok</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t make the line too think &amp; you will have perfect long lasting outlines every time.</li>
            <li> I really like how it lasts awhile but can be easily removed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is kind of clumpy during application and dries kind of slowly.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it on Amazon, because all the local drug stores (no matter whether  in CA or OR, where I spend most of my time) seem to run out of this particular product first!    </li>
            <li> I have such an unsteady hand, and I can usually not apply any kind of eyeliner for the life of me, but somehow even I can apply this evenly!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away.  </li>
            <li> This stays on and looks great, is easy to apply, dries quickly (other brands stay wet and smear ready for 3 and more times longer than Maybelline does).</li>
            <li> If you are indeed comfortable with it, this gives you the most precise lines and the truest black ever.</li>
            <li> It was my first time with liquid and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but I found that for me this kind tends to dry and flake off.</li>
            <li> For those who have no hand eye coordination or can&#x27;t draw a straight line to save their life I&#x27;d suggest not buying eye liner at all since you guys always blame the product instead of your own inability to properly apply the product.</li>
            <li> For less than $6 it is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much of it.  </li>
            <li> Well turns out amazon has them for much cheaper, so I just stocked up for myself and my mom for the whole year!!</li>
            <li> The liner was a bit liquidy first</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, I forgot to take it off before bed.</li>
            <li> and it comes along if you try to apply more in the blank spaces</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> Better than similar products&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for the waterproof factor and since it is the first liquid eyeliner i ever owned 13 years ago.</li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted over 2 years.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner after I use pencil eyeliner to give it more color and lasting power.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, much better value than stores.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I put eyeshadow on first, then line my lids.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely my go-to liner. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn&#x27;t give you racoon</li>
            <li> have Asian eyes which means my eyes are more prone to smudges and to so called raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> I like them better and find that the liner last longer (both on my face and in the bottle).</li>
            <li> I actually like it the most out of all of my liquid liners.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it looks nice a little streaky, but a good black, as soon as it drys (so about a min after application)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good black (dark) and was delivered early and in good condition.</li>
            <li> That makes it kind of hard to put the lid completely on; however, that&#x27;s definitely not something that has deterred me from continuing to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and we have very HOT summers, it holds no problem and no smudging.</li>
            <li> I like a dramatic yet natural look, and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It comes of easily at night with regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Flaked and easily removed with a cotton swab dipped only in water.</li>
            <li> You put it on once in the morning, and it comes off easily in the shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To start off with, it has a really deep, strong color that doesn&#x27;t fade, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used liquid liner in twelve years until the last week and first try made a very even and precise line.</li>
            <li> It might be great for someone with steady hands and experience, but not good for me.</li>
            <li> It is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While it does go on very well, it sometimes flakes off.</li>
            <li> Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering.</li>
            <li> Dries out really really fast, it cracks, &amp; it peels.</li>
            <li> I bought this a my local drug store because it was cheap and the liner pencils just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> However, it is very waterproof and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very waterproof</li>
            <li> Stays on well, however, it ended up in the trash because the brush is incredibly flimsy, making it extremely difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> clumped up too much and pieces would go in my eyes after a while.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast.</li>
            <li> because it really is my fault that I do not like this.</li>
            <li> You really have to scrub.</li>
            <li> Line is stay on your eyelids for whole day</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on very well through tears and rain.</li>
            <li> like to wear it for my nights out, and it lasts the whole night and beyond!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually really like it for cats eye.</li>
            <li> No one wants an eyeliner that disapears after 20 min of wearing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now, but only because it&#x27;s the only thing I own at the moment.</li>
            <li> The brush is far shorter than most liquid eyeliner brushes and only one coat is needed.</li>
            <li> almost shut for a few minutes so it didn&#x27;t smudge on its own.</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect for a winged effect or just a basic thin line.  </li>
            <li> It is  easy to use and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it does take on a very shiny appearance after a very long time on the lids (say, 12 hours), and can peel off very easily if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> The only good things I can say about it are the brush is thin and the product goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in order to use exactly the right amount of liquid, i dab it on my upper eyelid and use an eyeliner brush to draw it out over the lash line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the formula is, but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove.  </li>
            <li> i cant remember, but years of not good enough whatever bs products later, i am back...and you are the BEST AFTER ALL.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> I bought this having high hopes..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For a bargain shopper or even as a spare for those who don&#x27;t mind shelling out their life savings got one tenth of an ounce of eyeliner, i would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner for at least 2 years and it works amazingly well every time.</li>
            <li> It did not glide on smoothly, like expected.</li>
            <li> Great product in an expensive price.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that after awhile, excess eyeliner kind of builds up around the edge of the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to wash off either</li>
            <li> I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right.  </li>
            <li> At two of my jobs, I have super long shifts where I can&#x27;t touch up my face.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner fits the bill for me - it allows you to put on a very thin, even line that looks great even without eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I love the soft tip applicator and the long last formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I am hoping I just needed a new bottle</li>
            <li> One quick stroke and a thick enough non-smudgable, really waterproof and stays in place, easily removed with soap.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Easy to apply ad long lasting</li>
            <li> while it applies really well, and it&#x27;s a very dark rich color; it&#x27;s starts to peel and flake within an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of years and I love it.</li>
            <li> This went on strong but dried crusty and flaky.</li>
            <li> The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.&lt;br /&gt;*It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel wet on your eye</li>
            <li> After moving to NY from SF - I&#x27;ve had to spend as much as $10-$12 for this eyeliner depending on what store is actually selling it and is conveniently near me since I don&#x27;t drive in NY.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend much, but needs a basic eyeliner.</li>
            <li> When applied, it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> It glides on and drys fast especially when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li> it is no where near waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it was old, I dont know.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years and was pleasantly surprised that it is still around.</li>
            <li> It has a soft tip</li>
            <li> But out of all the liners I&#x27;ve worn, this is the longest wearing one by far.</li>
            <li> I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD.</li>
            <li> and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been my favorite eye liner for the past 7 years!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is really affordable and really reliable.</li>
            <li> Lines well, super dark and not clumpy, and lasts for &amp;#62;12 hours every time I apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I should keep buying new bottles every so many weeks without using up the old ones because I think being exposed to too much air breaks down its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> as great as the expensive premium makeup brands!</li>
            <li> It dries too quickly for me and going over, even slightly, removes it or makes it clump up.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of drugstore eyeliners waterproof and regular and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, the tip is too small to draw a smooth line</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and it really is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Brush is great for control and easily can switch from thin to thick lines with a little practice.</li>
            <li> I switch to the new one without finishing the last one.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I bought a new bottle recently</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner that will stay put on my asian eyelid the whole day without smudging.</li>
            <li> and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it</li>
            <li> Very long lasting, does not smear or smudge even when it is hot out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a hard time doing the quick swipe across the eyelid and typically do short strokes from corner of the eye out, but you need to be fast with this one.</li>
            <li> The brush is thin so you can get a very precise line.</li>
            <li> It does require some practice to put on just right, but once I got it, I never want to go back to other eye liners.    </li>
            <li> I can swim in the ocean and the liner barely changes.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried somewhere near 20 or 25 different liquid eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> Like, several years old.</li>
            <li> you can apply light or thick.</li>
            <li> I tried this because honestly it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, but I found the brush applicator to be a DISASTER to apply, it went all over my eye except where I was aiming it to go,</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years because it doesn&#x27;t flake and the black is very intense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark, and can&#x27;t be altered at all (smudged with fingers to get the right look).</li>
            <li> so it is not that easy to apply ( at least for someone that does not wear make up too regularly).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried as of late.</li>
            <li> but if you are a seasoned liquid eyeliner user you shouldn&#x27;t have to much trouble with it.</li>
            <li> My main problem with this eyeliner is that the tube gets extremely clumped up.</li>
            <li> color is so rich, black, and dark.  </li>
            <li> It goes on shiny but then dries matte, and it creates a very sharp edge that really cannot be smudged out, so only buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the high end department store brands as well as several other drug store brands</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly but then comes off little by little</li>
            <li> I found this product to be effective, but it&#x27;s hard to remove and goes on really thick.</li>
            <li> So I ordered her a new one in her shade and ordered myself one in black</li>
            <li> Pens are obviously easier but don&#x27;t last as long!</li>
            <li> believe it or not, because of its slightly thick paste texture, it helps create eye lid lines and make my eyes more sharp less puffy.  </li>
            <li> I know will last all day long.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m noticing that it peels and doesn&#x27;t last as long as it did.  </li>
            <li> this also help it last an incredibly long time.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup person, I need products that are extremely easy to apply and are difficult to screw up.</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect, use it for a thin line or build it up for a thick dramatic line.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily eyelids and this is the only eyeliner I use after trying so many brands (and expensive ones!)</li>
            <li> And i don&#x27;t mean a little bit of fallout i mean, peeling in strips, catching in your eyelashes sort of peeling and flaking, especially if you have naturally long lashes.</li>
            <li> I refuse to spend $20+ for a small amount of high end product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place.</li>
            <li> It smells bad, and the brush is kind of gloppy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner a long time and it still works.  </li>
            <li> I am now queen of the cat eye and get compliments all day long.</li>
            <li> Stays put all day long, no smudging or smearing.</li>
            <li> I have used it for long time.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wear it for long hours at all.</li>
            <li> The wand is a bit long for my taste, but I have gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, maybe that&#x27;s the reason this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t stay all day long.</li>
            <li> The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time</li>
            <li> I could actually see the black flecks on the white of my eye.</li>
            <li> From pencil liners to liquids to mascara and shadows--all of it--Maybelline is head and shoulders above every other manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (liner did not touch actual eye, only area around it) and within a few hours it began flaking off INTO my eye.</li>
            <li> I have to wipe off clumps before I use it every single time.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is that it takes sometime  to dry.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is completely water proof in a no-primer use condition.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve caked on some black stuff above my eyes</li>
            <li> The felt pen type seem to dry out quicker and they come off the face easier and to me are harder to apply.</li>
            <li> I use Cold&#x27;s Cream to take it off, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Ultraliner is actually one of the few exceptions.  </li>
            <li> It did not really budge with water either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it a couple tries, and every time it starts to flake within a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush is advertised as tapered but it&#x27;s not as tapered as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I&#x27;ve had to do with other liners.  </li>
            <li> Over all I do like it but in the last few years something has changed either with my skin or the product and it is flaking on the inside portion of my eye by the time it dries.</li>
            <li> its s weird texture and does not look right.</li>
            <li> The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one thing is that it is NOT waterproof as other&#x27;s have stated.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands</li>
            <li> i just bought it at walmart because i didnt want to splurge an extra 5 bucks to get my usual physicians formula eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I would recommend extremely if you&#x27;re wearing makeup while swimming or in water.</li>
            <li> This product works as straws in other reviews.</li>
            <li> No hot weather affecting it even if you become sweating all over...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and I&#x27;d reccommend it to try, but I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again; I would probably try other liners before coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> (I think that&#x27;s the reason), but it&#x27;s not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned one before, and it was so runny and hard to apply that I never used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear eyeliner for 12 hours a day, but this is something you might want to consider if you&#x27;re looking for something that allows you really long wear.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I take it off, it doesn&#x27;t want to come off--even when I use makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof...flakes off after a few hours of wear even if you did not get it wet.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the mess it seems to leave.</li>
            <li> No matter on eyeshadow, on bare lid, with or without primer, thick or thin, it last about an hour before it flakes off.</li>
            <li> I have the black and the brown.</li>
            <li> I wish i could give it less than 1 star.</li>
            <li> On my oily eyelids (I know I know, they say I am blessed because oily eyelids &#x3D; less wrinkles), but when one ends up with raccoon eyes over and over after trying gazillion eyeliners, one tends to forget the blessings.    </li>
            <li> HOWEVER - less than two hours after putting it on, it is flaking</li>
            <li> There is always black flakes all around my daughter&#x27;s bathroom sink from this eye liner</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it became chunky and dry just after a few months of using unlike some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t mess with it)</li>
            <li> used to get them when the pharmacy had sales, but they have been harder to get in person, and usually can find just 1 at a time which isn&#x27;t helpful when you want to get a BOGO promotion.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the Maybelline New York Ultra- Liner.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the base of the bottle sometimes gets mucked up and you have to clean it up a bit</li>
            <li> Yes it does crack a little though.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the formula turns a little clumpy once applied.</li>
            <li> goopy!&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat difficult to make super thin line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark and doesn&#x27;t require any layering.</li>
            <li> Very thick brush that gets too much access, so you will have to thin it before applying.  </li>
            <li> Before, things would get messy.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this liner all the time, maybe for a few years.  </li>
            <li> use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it peeling/flaking off.</li>
            <li> It lasts but it does crack after a few hours for me.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t accidentally pull up chunks of dried liner with the wand.</li>
            <li> Chips after a few hours wear.  </li>
            <li> It was waterproof but it would flake off throughout wear creating an uneven line with visible gaps.</li>
            <li> and I always have trouble with smearing or fading eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It gets clumpy after a few days..</li>
            <li> The brush was choppy and the product flaked off.</li>
            <li> Odd, I know!  </li>
            <li> As long as you apply it in 2 thin coats (if you are too heavy handed it can peel off)</li>
            <li> I normally use a blow dryer on a cold setting to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> The thin brush takes a bit of getting used to but not too long.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a brush so for beginners its hard not to mess up.  </li>
            <li> but this is a total fail.</li>
            <li> Only thing I felt uncomfortable with was that I noticed a tear in the product packaging.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure why).</li>
            <li> Does the job just a bit too small for my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what every ones problem of complaining about the brush unless you have no hands or parkinsons and can&#x27;t hold your hand steady its virtually impossible to get this all over your eye.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately on Halloween we had a bit of an accident with her liner, I used it over Halloween make-up and it destroyed the brush and what product was left in the container.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for beginners; if you make a mistake it is difficult to correct without removing all the eyeliner entirely.</li>
            <li> Maybelline I am really sad that your product that I have been wearing for 40 yrs is now not the same.</li>
            <li> It also cracks if you don&#x27;t let it dry before you open your eyes, though that&#x27;s probably just a bad habit of mine.</li>
            <li> Another con is that the bottle itself gets very messy around the rim of the container.</li>
            <li> its like a long thin nail polish brush tip at the end, I had no control over the brush because of that!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super dramatic dark line</li>
            <li> Also, if it gets on your skin or you make a mistake, it&#x27;s really hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t that hard to get off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Not even after a hard gym workout.  </li>
            <li> Some people said it was hard to get off....</li>
            <li> I workout hard in it, sweat in it, cry in it, get caught in the rain in it</li>
            <li> The wand makes it so hard to apply to the lid.</li>
            <li> I started experimenting with makeup late and eye liner has always been my enemy.</li>
            <li> At least it was inexpensive</li>
            <li> t stay for another day at least...</li>
            <li> If you put it on too thick though, it does crack some.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s bound to happen with any liquid liner if you put it on too thickly.</li>
            <li> Also, as somebody else already mentioned - take care not to put it on too thick, it will then flake (well, any make up when piled up too thickly will flake.    </li>
            <li> Any other eyeliner rubs off on my whole eye and it looks terrible by the time I get off work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done cheetah, zebra, words, and other random designs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> but you will know what I mean when you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive liners that were just terrible.  </li>
            <li> My only caution is do not confuse the Line Works liner with this - they are not the same and the Line Works is terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids.  </li>
            <li> This gross stuff flakes so bad and peels off like its glue.</li>
            <li> I bought three different bottles, thinking I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I purchased 2 and both was dried up.</li>
            <li> I tried a thin line, tried a thick line, and tried the dotting along the eyelash line....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an eye liner with a brush anymore!</li>
            <li> this stuff reminds me of when i was in highschool very hard to find waterproff liner of this quality anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner for years (gel is my preference), but this stuff was awful especially once it dried.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not attractive.</li>
            <li> and I have never had a problem with this product irritating me.  </li>
            <li> Thin brush tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my eyeliner, if this product disappears my life will grow cold, dark, sad and smudgey...</li>
            <li> It creates a dramatic effect and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> Possibly this stuff could work if you have bad botox and are unable to move your eyes- otherwise, every blink, every eye turn, every lowered eyelid will produce a falling flake!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deffinately not the worse brand, but it was difficult to apply evenly with the brush.</li>
            <li> Dumb mistake!</li>
            <li> It is very bad, and crack when dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it just randomly</li>
            <li> This stuff is definately waterproof, in fact I had an incredibly difficult time getting it off.  </li>
            <li> I think they may have changed the formula sadly.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not perfect either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It is somewhat difficult to remove at night.  </li>
            <li> I am the ultimate Maybelline fan girl but this liquid liner was just terrible.</li>
            <li> not good!!!!</li>
            <li> It dried into this plastic strip on my eye, and it just felt awful.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t recommend using on the lower lash line/waterline, it made my eyes water like crazy.  </li>
            <li> waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was even snowing and blowing in my face making my eyes water really bad, but when I looked the eyeliner did not run and was still on.  </li>
            <li> but the peeling is really bad.</li>
            <li> I feel bad giving</li>
            <li> But this wasnt working out for me :(</li>
            <li> Weird!!</li>
            <li> THIS EYELINER PEELSSSSSS which I really hate.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with Amazon for stocking product that passed it&#x27;s date for use.</li>
            <li> The brush for this eyeliner is horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst.</li>
            <li> This was the worst thing I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> This is awful stuff...  </li>
            <li> this eyeliner is horrible.</li>
            <li> That is horrible to think you also are trying to cheat the consumer.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my go-to eyeliner. The brush makes my eyeliner very precise and clean. It lasts all day, and it is water proof. I like it a lot. It is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say it can get kind of clumpy, but that is fix-able. No biggie. It also cracks if you don&#x27;t let it dry before you open your eyes, though that&#x27;s probably just a bad habit of mine. Other than that, this is really affordable and really reliable. I would recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend much, but needs a basic eyeliner.</li>
            <li> why did i ever leave you...??? i cant remember, but years of not good enough whatever bs products later, i am back...and you are the BEST AFTER ALL.&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> While it does go on very well, it sometimes flakes off. My main problem with this eyeliner is that the tube gets extremely clumped up. I have to wipe off clumps before I use it every single time.</li>
            <li> The brush for this eyeliner is horrible. I LOVE brushes, and prefer them over felt tips but this is the exception. The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft. It&#x27;s hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place. Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering. I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was but this is a total fail.</li>
            <li> I bought this having high hopes.. after using it a couple times i do not use it as liner anymore. Dries out really really fast, it cracks, &amp; it peels. I notice it works fabulous for designs on my eyes..like drawing lightning bolts &amp; leopard spots..etc. I recommend to buy it for drawing designs on ur eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Local stores aren&#x27;t keeping up on their stock, so I bought it here. Love the new feature inside the opening, which keeps all but the liquid that&#x27;s on your brush, off the wand! Before, things would get messy. Definitely waterproof, have cried through movies and taken showers with it, and I have contacts. It WILL come off with lots of water if you rub it, though.</li>
            <li> my favorite eyeliner.  I am 61 and it still goes on like a charm.</li>
            <li> Ok, I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to keep makeup for more than a year, but whatever. I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner for at least 2 years and it works amazingly well every time. Lines well, super dark and not clumpy, and lasts for &amp;#62;12 hours every time I apply. Amazing product for drugstore makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this a my local drug store because it was cheap and the liner pencils just don&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now, but only because it&#x27;s the only thing I own at the moment. I found this product to be effective, but it&#x27;s hard to remove and goes on really thick. Also, if it gets on your skin or you make a mistake, it&#x27;s really hard to get off. When applied, it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all. It looks like I&#x27;ve caked on some black stuff above my eyes and it&#x27;s not attractive. Another con is that the bottle itself gets very messy around the rim of the container. Grr..  However, it is very waterproof and stays on all day. (if you don&#x27;t mess with it) Also, it doesn&#x27;t look like it but there&#x27;s a lot of product in there! It&#x27;s lasted for a long time. Still, I would invest in a better product.</li>
            <li> Many eyeliners boast that they stay on all day and are waterproof but they aren&#x27;t.  Ultraliner is actually one of the few exceptions.  Don&#x27;t spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good.  Ultraliner is actually great.  I&#x27;m not sure what the formula is, but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove.  It was even snowing and blowing in my face making my eyes water really bad, but when I looked the eyeliner did not run and was still on.  I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away.  It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed.  If you try to rub it, it won&#x27;t come off.  It did not really budge with water either.  Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready.  It does not run in your eye and I noticed unlike some eyeliners that get all over your lower lashes causing marks under your eye, Ultra Liner does not do that.  I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner a long time and it still works.  You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup.  I&#x27;ve had more expensive liners that were just terrible.  You can find Ultra Liner mostly any department or pharmacy type store and online here.  My only caution is do not confuse the Line Works liner with this - they are not the same and the Line Works is terrible.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my gf and she loved it, cheap and it does stay on all day without peeling. It&#x27;s not hard to wash off either so she&#x27;s very happy with her eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Gift to a teenager. She loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of years and I love it. Put it on at 6am and it is on until 11pm. Great for just eye liner, BUT you can also do designs with it! I&#x27;ve done cheetah, zebra, words, and other random designs. I&#x27;ve never had it just randomly start to peel off, but it also is pretty easy to take off once you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing is that it is NOT waterproof as other&#x27;s have stated. But it does not smear and it has never peeled, cracked, or irritated my eyes/skin.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. I have been using it for years now. I&#x27;m a liquid liner kinda girl and I do a cat eye on a daily basis. This liner is perfect for that. It&#x27;s the easiest to apply out of all the liners I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot! I&#x27;ve tried the high end department store brands as well as several other drug store brands and I always come back to this one!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.  IT IS THE BEST EYE LINER I EVER USED.</li>
            <li> I order in bulk because I love it so much, I have been using this eyeliner for years</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite eyeliner for about 15 years now. I have tried them all. From department store brands to cheap pharmacy brands, to korean brands. This is the only eyeliner that will stay put on my asian eyelid the whole day without smudging. It is also not glue consistency, like the korean ones, and it&#x27;s nice and smooth and extra black.&lt;br /&gt;I used to get them when the pharmacy had sales, but they have been harder to get in person, and usually can find just 1 at a time which isn&#x27;t helpful when you want to get a BOGO promotion. Well turns out amazon has them for much cheaper, so I just stocked up for myself and my mom for the whole year!!</li>
            <li> Nice tube and applicator but I found that for me this kind tends to dry and flake off.</li>
            <li> This is my go to liquid liner for years now.  I can swim in the ocean and the liner barely changes.  All of my friends are in awe by the activities I can do without altering my perfect liner whether it&#x27;s sweat in the Charleston humidity or, as I mentioned, swim in the ocean.  Absolutely worth more than $8 but I recommend buying on Amazon rather than a drugstore to reap some discounts!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and I like the results.  It was my first time with liquid and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and I love it.</li>
            <li> The worst. THIS EYELINER PEELSSSSSS which I really hate. It doesn&#x27;t fade which is good but the peeling is really bad.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but I end up coming back to this product. It glides on and drys fast especially when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li> Ugh i cant believe there are so many good reviews for this p.o.s liner. i just bought it at walmart because i didnt want to splurge an extra 5 bucks to get my usual physicians formula eyeliner. Dumb mistake! This gross stuff flakes so bad and peels off like its glue. There is absolutely nothing appealing about this line.</li>
            <li> Only thing I felt uncomfortable with was that I noticed a tear in the product packaging. The liner was a bit liquidy first but now it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I started experimenting with makeup late and eye liner has always been my enemy. It smudges, wears, off, etc. Well let me tell you this eye liner changed my life! I am now queen of the cat eye and get compliments all day long. The applicator actually gives you control of your lines and it goes on smooth and beautiful. it dries, I do two coats for maximum staying power and then I don&#x27;t have to touch it for the rest of the day. This stuff has lasted me through 14 hour days! I cannot recommend it enough. I have the black and the brown.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve probably tried 20 different eyeliners but this is my favorite and it actually stays on! Any other eyeliner rubs off on my whole eye and it looks terrible by the time I get off work! I really really really really!!!! Like this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried somewhere near 20 or 25 different liquid eyeliners.  They all either flake, rub off, aren&#x27;t pigmented, or irritate the eyes.  Except for this one.  It goes on smoothly and precisely, and stays on until you decide to take it off, be it with makeup remover or cleanser.  This stuff lasts through swimming, tears, and parties.  And it&#x27;s only about $6!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I like it because it does not run. It is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to eyeliner for many years. It continues to be the best one out there.</li>
            <li> while it applies really well, and it&#x27;s a very dark rich color; it&#x27;s starts to peel and flake within an hour or so. And i don&#x27;t mean a little bit of fallout i mean, peeling in strips, catching in your eyelashes sort of peeling and flaking, especially if you have naturally long lashes.</li>
            <li> This liner is super fantastic. At two of my jobs, I have super long shifts where I can&#x27;t touch up my face. With this stuff, I don&#x27;t even have to! Also, it&#x27;s very waterproof but it isn&#x27;t that hard to get off at the end of the day. I can cry or go swimming with the stuff and it doesn&#x27;t budge. If you put it on too thick though, it does crack some. However, that&#x27;s bound to happen with any liquid liner if you put it on too thickly.</li>
            <li> PRICE BETTER THAN RETAIL</li>
            <li> I love this liquid liner. I&#x27;ve only owned one before, and it was so runny and hard to apply that I never used it. I forget what brand that was. This one is perfect. The brush is the perfect width, and it holds the exact amount of liner needed. This stuff is not runny, and it dries almost instantly once applied. There is just enough time for me to wipe off my mistakes. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s ON though. The first time I wore it, I forgot to take it off before bed. I woke up the next morning planning to wash it off and reapply, but it was so perfect even after a night&#x27;s sleep that I kept it on and wore it the whole day without issue. I use Cold&#x27;s Cream to take it off, and it works just fine. I have such an unsteady hand, and I can usually not apply any kind of eyeliner for the life of me, but somehow even I can apply this evenly! I recommend this to anyone who has struggled with eyeliner or liquid liners before.</li>
            <li> Stays put all day long, no smudging or smearing.</li>
            <li> I have the oiliest skin and this is the only eyeliner that I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Not even after a hard gym workout.  I love the soft tip applicator and the long last formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it comes off easily when I wash my face with Cetaphil at the end of the day.  This is the one makeup product that I own that I know will last all day long.  Thinking about buying this?  You should, its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still my favorite eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple high-end liners and still, nothing compares to this one.  I hope they never get rid of this one!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply ad long lasting</li>
            <li> This eyeliner. No matter on eyeshadow, on bare lid, with or without primer, thick or thin, it last about an hour before it flakes off. When you first put it on it looks nice a little streaky, but a good black, as soon as it drys (so about a min after application) its s weird texture and does not look right. It clumps on your lashes and its a pain (literally) to get of. The only plus is that when you want it gone it peels off with ease. The applicator is a brush so for beginners its hard not to mess up.  I have used a lot of drugstore eyeliners waterproof and regular and this is by far my least favorite. I wish i could give it less than 1 star. Save your money elf products have worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used it for long time.  It is  easy to use and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> There is no doubt (in my opinion) that Maybeliine is the best producer of eye makeup, not just in this price range, but across the board.  From pencil liners to liquids to mascara and shadows--all of it--Maybelline is head and shoulders above every other manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This waterproof eyeliner stays put for hours.  HOWEVER, it does take on a very shiny appearance after a very long time on the lids (say, 12 hours), and can peel off very easily if you&#x27;re not careful.  I don&#x27;t usually wear eyeliner for 12 hours a day, but this is something you might want to consider if you&#x27;re looking for something that allows you really long wear.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have always had oily eyelids and this is the only eyeliner I use after trying so many brands (and expensive ones!) this actually lasts all day for me and i never have to use primers anymore or eyeshadow just to try and keep it on! It comes of easily at night with regular makeup remover. The thin brush takes a bit of getting used to but not too long. Pens are obviously easier but don&#x27;t last as long!</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts all day long. The only things are: it only flakes off with rubbing, so taking it off is tricky with or without eye-makeup remover, and sometimes it clumps on the brush (I&#x27;m not sure why). I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definately waterproof, in fact I had an incredibly difficult time getting it off.  It&#x27;s deffinately not the worse brand, but it was difficult to apply evenly with the brush.</li>
            <li> does not last and it runs out, it&#x27;s sticky and it comes along if you try to apply more in the blank spaces, wish I wouldn&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> This was the worst thing I have ever purchased. it is no where near waterproof. it flakes up and dries out before you even leave the house. the actually pen is great wished the product was better. waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this liner all the time, maybe for a few years.  Now I&#x27;m noticing that it peels and doesn&#x27;t last as long as it did.  I think they may have changed the formula sadly.</li>
            <li> Stays on well, however, it ended up in the trash because the brush is incredibly flimsy, making it extremely difficult to apply. At least it was inexpensive but I guess this is an example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my eyeliner, if this product disappears my life will grow cold, dark, sad and smudgey... Tricky for beginners but once you get the hang of applying it, you will have long lasting, awesomely lined eyes. It has awesome staying power. It is a bold black though perfect for goths, rockabilly&#x27;s or anyone who wants to do the cat eye look.</li>
            <li> this stuff reminds me of when i was in highschool very hard to find waterproff liner of this quality anymore</li>
            <li> I heard that this eyeliner had super staying power, and it was super cheap, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awful. It smells bad, and the brush is kind of gloppy. I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner for years (gel is my preference), but this stuff was awful especially once it dried. It dried into this plastic strip on my eye, and it just felt awful.</li>
            <li> The wand is short, the entire product is short. I must have missed the size description. Does the job just a bit too small for my needs.</li>
            <li> A great product for such a cheap price.  I went swimming in this and had no problem- the only thing is that while it doesn&#x27;t come off in the pool, it also doesn&#x27;t come off in the shower.  I HAVE to use an eye makeup remover after showering to get this off.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I refuse to spend $20+ for a small amount of high end product. This works just as well. I went swimming with this on and it did not flake or smear. You get a TON of product for the price. I&#x27;ve had this over a year...use it almost everyday and it&#x27;s still going strong. Some people said it was hard to get off....eye makeup remover or just baby oil seems to do the trick just fine. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very good but doesn&#x27;t for a lot of hours it cracks after a while. Very thick brush that gets too much access, so you will have to thin it before applying.  I would recommend extremely if you&#x27;re wearing makeup while swimming or in water.</li>
            <li> Peels off after 1 hour of application. You can&#x27;t wear it for long hours at all. I have switched to Stilla all day wear eye liner which is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof but I would buy it again unless I found a store that sells my favorite liquid eyeliner! I moved t another country and they just sell my favorite liquid eyeliner in my country</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years and love it. Better than similar products&lt;br /&gt; much more expensive. Can be applied easily in a very fine outline or thicker&lt;br /&gt;line, whichever you prefer. It lasts without clumping or cracking. Cannot always find&lt;br /&gt;in retail stores so am delighted to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This liquid liner is the best liner for a smokey eye. It will give your that sexy kitten eye look.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, the tip is too small to draw a smooth line</li>
            <li> This is awful stuff...  It has very strong fumes which burned my eye (liner did not touch actual eye, only area around it) and within a few hours it began flaking off INTO my eye. I could actually see the black flecks on the white of my eye. When it didn&#x27;t flake into my eye, it flaked onto my cheeks. Possibly this stuff could work if you have bad botox and are unable to move your eyes- otherwise, every blink, every eye turn, every lowered eyelid will produce a falling flake!  I tried a thin line, tried a thick line, and tried the dotting along the eyelash line.... Every method produced falling into my eye flakes!</li>
            <li> It did not glide on smoothly, like expected. Maybe it was expired?</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my FAVORITE eyeliner EVER!  It lasts ALL DAY!  The only time I apply 2x in a day is when I want to go with a thicker line in the evening if I&#x27;m going out!  I LOVE LOVE this product and can&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what every ones problem of complaining about the brush unless you have no hands or parkinsons and can&#x27;t hold your hand steady its virtually impossible to get this all over your eye. The brush is far shorter than most liquid eyeliner brushes and only one coat is needed. I haven&#x27;t even used liquid liner in twelve years until the last week and first try made a very even and precise line. I bought this for the waterproof factor and since it is the first liquid eyeliner i ever owned 13 years ago. I also bought e.l.f. brand because it was incredibly cheap. For $8.99 at CVS you get 0.25 oz of product compared to almays 0.10 oz for $8.49 (not waterproof), CGs 0.08 oz at $8.99 (not waterproof), L&#x27;oreals 0.08 at $9.99 (not waterproof) and e.l.f.s 0.10 for $3.49-$7.99 (not waterproof). For a bargain shopper or even as a spare for those who don&#x27;t mind shelling out their life savings got one tenth of an ounce of eyeliner, i would highly recommend this product.  For those who have no hand eye coordination or can&#x27;t draw a straight line to save their life I&#x27;d suggest not buying eye liner at all since you guys always blame the product instead of your own inability to properly apply the product. http://instagram.com/p/qE7J5sQ8PP/ a picture comparing the two products.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was great, just took quite a while to dry. This was nice if I needed to smudge or fix it, but it also made me keep me eyes almost shut for a few minutes so it didn&#x27;t smudge on its own.</li>
            <li> This liner doesn&#x27;t have any room for error. Maybe I&#x27;m not too experienced with it, but I can&#x27;t get it to look good. It&#x27;s very dark, and can&#x27;t be altered at all (smudged with fingers to get the right look). It might be great for someone with steady hands and experience, but not good for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this drug store liquid liner.  I never owned it for myself until now, I kept poaching my mom&#x27;s.  Unfortunately on Halloween we had a bit of an accident with her liner, I used it over Halloween make-up and it destroyed the brush and what product was left in the container.  So I ordered her a new one in her shade and ordered myself one in black and I absolutely love it.  The brush is perfect for a winged effect or just a basic thin line.  However I don&#x27;t recommend using on the lower lash line/waterline, it made my eyes water like crazy.  Instead you could use a pencil and maybe use this as a filler if you wanted to use it on the lower lash/waterline.</li>
            <li> My favorite waterproof eyeliner!! Stays on until I take it off - goes on easy and can withstand my sweaty workouts!&lt;br /&gt;Just as great as the expensive premium makeup brands!</li>
            <li> clumped up too much and pieces would go in my eyes after a while.  Did not go on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was old, I dont know.  But this wasnt working out for me :(</li>
            <li> The end of the brush isn&#x27;t as fine as I expected, but great liner nonetheless.</li>
            <li> it pretty much just ok</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have never had a problem with this product irritating me.  Odd, I know!  The black is a great color.  Only down fall is that it takes sometime  to dry.  I normally use a blow dryer on a cold setting to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is good. It lasts a long time and it really is waterproof. The brush is thin so you can get a very precise line. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for beginners; if you make a mistake it is difficult to correct without removing all the eyeliner entirely. It dries fast. The color is fantastic. It&#x27;s very dark and doesn&#x27;t require any layering.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof...flakes off after a few hours of wear even if you did not get it wet. Only good thing is it goes on nicely. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, gives me a fine line, its an art to use this eyeliner, its fantastic!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It also gives you the cateye look.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. I workout hard in it, sweat in it, cry in it, get caught in the rain in it and it stays put at all times, until I choose to take it off. It comes off easily with cooking oil (the perfect makeup remover also for a pittance... I use peanut oil but canola does the job, too). I have ultra oily eyelids and nothing else stays on all day (yes, and I did say I took it off with cooking oil so go figure..). Forget pencils (gone in an hour), non waterproof eyeliner (phfffft), gels (poof), and anything else. This stays on and looks great, is easy to apply, dries quickly (other brands stay wet and smear ready for 3 and more times longer than Maybelline does). The brush is perfect, use it for a thin line or build it up for a thick dramatic line. Go out and get some now, this instant!</li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted over 2 years. I switch to the new one without finishing the last one. I use this product daily. Without the primer on the eye lid, it does get peeled off later during the day when my eye lid get oily. Not sure if it is completely water proof in a no-primer use condition. For my daily use, it works great.</li>
            <li> ES DE PESIMA CALIDAD CUANDO LO APLICAS EN EL CONTORNO DE LOS OJOS, DESPUES DE SECARSE EMPIEZA A PARTIRSE Y SE SALE SE DESPRENDE DE LA PIEL ES MALO</li>
            <li> I feel bad giving this two stars- because it really is my fault that I do not like this. I have a hard time doing the quick swipe across the eyelid and typically do short strokes from corner of the eye out, but you need to be fast with this one. It dries too quickly for me and going over, even slightly, removes it or makes it clump up.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner after I use pencil eyeliner to give it more color and lasting power. I bought the brown liquid eyeliner. Its very good.</li>
            <li> Great made line!  Drys quick.  Try not to blink because it sometimes goes to the bottom lashes as well.  Perfect for me and my &amp;#34;big eyelids&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used it for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Locally they have stopped selling this and I was thrilled that I found it on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 5 and will prob order more so I never run out again.&lt;br /&gt;You put it on and it STAYS until you take it off.&lt;br /&gt;NO smears or raccoon eyes with the WATERPROOF.</li>
            <li> Its a good eyeliner. It does flake off and crinkle. But it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> On my oily eyelids (I know I know, they say I am blessed because oily eyelids &#x3D; less wrinkles), but when one ends up with raccoon eyes over and over after trying gazillion eyeliners, one tends to forget the blessings.    Glad to have found it on Amazon, because all the local drug stores (no matter whether  in CA or OR, where I spend most of my time) seem to run out of this particular product first!    Women must know and appreciate this wonderful eyeliner and snatch it right when it is delivered to the stores.    It does require some practice to put on just right, but once I got it, I never want to go back to other eye liners.    Also, as somebody else already mentioned - take care not to put it on too thick, it will then flake (well, any make up when piled up too thickly will flake.    The only con that I can think of is that it thickens up before I can use all of it, but this seems to be the case with my mascaras too.  Maybe I do not use it often enough?</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine, have been using it for 20 years. Easy to apply. Please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> The only good things I can say about it are the brush is thin and the product goes on easily.  HOWEVER - less than two hours after putting it on, it is flaking and then it starts peeling off in chunks.  I do not put a lot on, and only one layer.  I&#x27;ve given it a couple tries, and every time it starts to flake within a couple hours.  It&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality and the package came completely how it looks. I would definitely recommend it, much better value than stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years and was pleasantly surprised that it is still around. When I use it, I put eyeshadow on first, then line my lids. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it peeling/flaking off. My only complaint is that when I take it off, it doesn&#x27;t want to come off--even when I use makeup remover. You really have to scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since January 2012 and it&#x27;s honestly the best liquid eyeliner ever.  It won&#x27;t peel or flake unless you&#x27;re too generous with it, and it has amazing staying power.  I cried my eyes out wearing this stuff, and it wouldn&#x27;t budge!  I wear contacts and this product has never caused me any irritation whatsoever.  However if you&#x27;re considering this eyeliner, make sure you&#x27;re comfortable using these kinds of brushes because if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand it will not be pretty.  If you are indeed comfortable with it, this gives you the most precise lines and the truest black ever. I adore this eyeliner :D</li>
            <li> Flaked and easily removed with a cotton swab dipped only in water.</li>
            <li> For less than $6 it is a pretty good product. It has a soft tip so it is not that easy to apply ( at least for someone that does not wear make up too regularly). The color is great though, nice and dark. My biggest complaint is that it became chunky and dry just after a few months of using unlike some other products I&#x27;ve used. Not a bad purchase though</li>
            <li> My teen daughter swears by it. It creates a dramatic effect and stays on for hours. My only complaint is the mess it seems to leave. There is always black flakes all around my daughter&#x27;s bathroom sink from this eye liner but I&#x27;ve yet to figure out why.</li>
            <li> This product works as straws in other reviews. Just don&#x27;t make the line too think &amp; you will have perfect long lasting outlines every time.</li>
            <li> This is the only liquid eyeliner that can withstand my oily eyelids all day without degenerating into a pool of guck. Cat eyes are my every day look and this liquid eyeliner does a competent job. But, it&#x27;s not perfect either. I&#x27;m not sure if I should keep buying new bottles every so many weeks without using up the old ones because I think being exposed to too much air breaks down its effectiveness. Rather than getting smudgy on my lids, it starts flaking, so I look like I have chipped paint. Not good. But out of all the liners I&#x27;ve worn, this is the longest wearing one by far.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I even had... Line is stay on your eyelids for whole day and I even sure if I do not wash it away before the night it will going t stay for another day at least... You can swim or d whatever you need it still will be here... No hot weather affecting it even if you become sweating all over...</li>
            <li> It is very bad, and crack when dry</li>
            <li> It lasts but it does crack after a few hours for me. I like that it finishes matte instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> Some of the cons people write about this I kind of find as a pro. Yes it does crack a little though. But it applies nice. I really like how it lasts awhile but can be easily removed. Basically peels off. So if your looking for something that inks to you instead of being able.to peel it off after it dries then this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner specifically because I was going to find out the sex of my baby and I knew I was going to cry. I&#x27;m no stranger to dropping money on eyeliner but nothing I had was waterproof. This stuff stays on very well through tears and rain. My only complaint is that the base of the bottle sometimes gets mucked up and you have to clean it up a bit so you don&#x27;t accidentally pull up chunks of dried liner with the wand. It&#x27;s excellent for its price and I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Works fine, it is what I wanted and came exactly  as it said it would. Thank you very much. Lori</li>
            <li> I bought this after I purchased a very fine tip that required too many passes to make a decent line. This is perfect!! One quick stroke and a thick enough non-smudgable, really waterproof and stays in place, easily removed with soap. A much better buy for me.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this liquid liner again.  I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right.  I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner.  If you do not like how you applied the line, it will flake off, yes, peel, and flake off, and you will need to start again.  But, once you get it how you want, it does stay.  I would not buy this liquid liner again though.</li>
            <li> Chips after a few hours wear.  It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but I would not purchase this eye liner again.</li>
            <li> It says waterproof, but don&#x27;t think you can swim with it.  It stays agains tears and light rain though. I have been using this eyeliner for years because it doesn&#x27;t flake and the black is very intense.  You don&#x27;t need very much of it.  Won&#x27;t smear to your upper eyelid or underneath.  It also doesn&#x27;t collect in the corner of your eye. Good formula for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. BUT, make sure you have really good make up remover to take this off, or else you&#x27;ll end up loosing some eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So it took me a while to decide how well I liked this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off with, it has a really deep, strong color that doesn&#x27;t fade, so that was a plus. The consistency of the eyeliner itself isn&#x27;t too liquidy or goopy... it&#x27;s a great thickness. I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where things were iffy: after a couple of hours, the eyeliner would crack. It wouldn&#x27;t smudge or bleed. It would CRACK. By the end of the day, if I hadn&#x27;t reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line. I didn&#x27;t need a makeup remover wipe to take it off, I could practically peel it off. Weird!! Was it my eye? Was it the liner? I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD. Like, several years old. I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it. It wasn&#x27;t until I bought a new bottle recently that I figured this out. The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is advertised as tapered but it&#x27;s not as tapered as I would have expected. It still has bristles; it isn&#x27;t a triangular foam brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried as of late. This is definitely my go-to product and has become my daily liner.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup person, I need products that are extremely easy to apply and are difficult to screw up. This eyeliner fits the bill for me - it allows you to put on a very thin, even line that looks great even without eye shadow. It goes on shiny but then dries matte, and it creates a very sharp edge that really cannot be smudged out, so only buy this if you like that look. Sometimes in the inside corner of my eyes it will crack and the line will have gaps that I need to go fill in again. When you wash it off it comes off in strips (I guess that is the waterproof part) and I normally only get about 50% off at night and have to finish the job in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this liner for over a month now and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to wear it for my nights out, and it lasts the whole night and beyond!&lt;br /&gt;I even cried my eyes out one time and this eyeliner stood the test of tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning to purchase this, you should be fairly good with a brush.  The wand is a bit long for my taste, but I have gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my go-to liner. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Very long lasting, does not smear or smudge even when it is hot out.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is kind of clumpy during application and dries kind of slowly.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is horrible. when you first apply it seems fine, although the applicator has NO precision. The liner itself dries and cracks.Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner ever since I got a free sample. Looks great and stays on well.</li>
            <li> I give this product between 3.75 and 4.0 stars.  There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Long lasting.  It stays on all day, from morning until night&lt;br /&gt;*No flaking, peeling, fading, or smudging.  It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn&#x27;t give you racoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;*The color is so rich, black, and dark.  The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.&lt;br /&gt;*It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel wet on your eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*It is somewhat difficult to remove at night.  I use makeup remover and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it completely.&lt;br /&gt;*It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids.  I have to screw the cap on, shake it, and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look I&#x27;m going for.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it&#x27;s waterproof (I think that&#x27;s the reason), but it&#x27;s not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I&#x27;ve had to do with other liners.  It&#x27;s affordable and I&#x27;d reccommend it to try, but I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again; I would probably try other liners before coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I am the ultimate Maybelline fan girl but this liquid liner was just terrible. The wand makes it so hard to apply to the lid. I was not impressed with the Maybelline New York Ultra- Liner. Maybe if Maybeliine re-released this with a felt tip I would try again. Also the liner dries super quick so if you are like me and it takes you awhile to put on your liquid liner you may want to stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent waterproof liner. i have used it for 6 years now. i will never use another liquid liner on my top lid. it survives the gym, sweating, and swimming. in order to use exactly the right amount of liquid, i dab it on my upper eyelid and use an eyeliner brush to draw it out over the lash line. this also help it last an incredibly long time.</li>
            <li> Nice, waterproof eyeliner. Easy to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: FORMULA HAS BEEN CHANGED. Now the product is watery and lacks pigment. This used to be my HG eyeliner. I bought three different bottles, thinking I got a bad batch. Wrote the company and yep, the formula has changed. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I use nothing but this eyeliner. It stays on all day. you can apply light or thick. I like a dramatic yet natural look, and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply as the brush easily paints on straight, also sweat proof. The one downfall is that when it dries, it itches a tiny bit, tempting you to rub your eyes.</li>
            <li> This went on strong but dried crusty and flaky. It was waterproof but it would flake off throughout wear creating an uneven line with visible gaps.</li>
            <li> I like it it is good eyeliner but very smual</li>
            <li> I never thought that Amazon Prime would touch upon all aspects of shopping for me. After moving to NY from SF - I&#x27;ve had to spend as much as $10-$12 for this eyeliner depending on what store is actually selling it and is conveniently near me since I don&#x27;t drive in NY.  Thank goodness I bothered to see if this was available on Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my favorite eye liner for the past 7 years! It only comes of when I want it too!</li>
            <li> Not so satisfied with this product. Don&#x27;t like the brush. Sometimes, the formula turns a little clumpy once applied. However, it is certainly kind of waterproof formula, althought it tends to flake, so you have to retouch this. My skin is oily, maybe that&#x27;s the reason this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t stay all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. Unfortunately I purchased 2 and both was dried up. No liquid whatsoever. Very disappointed with Amazon for stocking product that passed it&#x27;s date for use.</li>
            <li> Maybelline I am really sad that your product that I have been wearing for 40 yrs is now not the same.That is horrible to think you also are trying to cheat the consumer.This waterproof eyeliner would always stay on all day.Now it seems to peel and not adhere to my eyelid like before.Please put whatever you took out back.If not I will have to try others.The price is ok but the quality changed.I hope they listen.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner regardless of price!!&lt;br /&gt;I have Asian eyes which means my eyes are more prone to smudges and to so called raccoon eyes.  I have used a lot of eyeliners including a lot of more expensive ones but I can honestly say this is the best eyeliner ever used.  It just stays until I wash my face at night.  It has a some kind of thickener that turns it into a glue rubber like texture but whatever it is, I love it.  believe it or not, because of its slightly thick paste texture, it helps create eye lid lines and make my eyes more sharp less puffy.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain but you will know what I mean when you use it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST STUFF!  You put it on once in the morning, and it comes off easily in the shower the next morning.  But it stays on all day without flaking or smearing.  This is great for me because I have extremely oily skin and I always have trouble with smearing or fading eyeliner.  Not with this one though!</li>
            <li> I tried this because honestly it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, but I found the brush applicator to be a DISASTER to apply, it went all over my eye except where I was aiming it to go, not good!!!! its like a long thin nail polish brush tip at the end, I had no control over the brush because of that! this is a disaster in a bottle for me</li>
            <li> I loved this line, it does start to crack and come off throughout the day sometimes, I am hoping I just needed a new bottle</li>
            <li> Line isn&#x27;t full, flakes off after about one hour</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years, and it&#x27;s the absolute best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. I&#x27;ve even gotten several of my friends hooked on it! The style of the brush makes it very easy to apply, and once it&#x27;s applied it stays on all day. I put mine on before work at 8, and it stays on until whenever I decide to take it off later that evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that after awhile, excess eyeliner kind of builds up around the edge of the tube. That makes it kind of hard to put the lid completely on; however, that&#x27;s definitely not something that has deterred me from continuing to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Smudge-proof, but over time starts to flake off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an eye liner with a brush anymore! I like them better and find that the liner last longer (both on my face and in the bottle). The felt pen type seem to dry out quicker and they come off the face easier and to me are harder to apply. It&#x27;s a good black (dark) and was delivered early and in good condition.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product.  I am very happy with this liquid eye-liner.  It stays all day without smearing and easy to take off at night!!</li>
            <li> Item just as described</li>
            <li> Thin brush tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Stays on forever&lt;br /&gt;Super dramatic dark line&lt;br /&gt;Dries fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the quality and price though!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very goopy!&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat difficult to make super thin line (unless you take your time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to think I&#x27;m an expert with liquid eyeliner. Used it my entire makeup career. This is an EXCELLENT liquid liner if you have the time and doesn&#x27;t have to rush! A liner I love is *2 Faced - 3 Way Liner*. Super easy to use and great line - great for running to work, but that&#x27;s $32, compared to this $6 drug-store brand.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply it in 2 thin coats (if you are too heavy handed it can peel off) It WONT. BUDGE. It&#x27;s almost like liquid latex. I actually really like it for cats eye. I actually like it the most out of all of my liquid liners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 years now. Over all I do like it but in the last few years something has changed either with my skin or the product and it is flaking on the inside portion of my eye by the time it dries. It is however waterproof and sweat proof and has a deep color. I live in AZ and we have very HOT summers, it holds no problem and no smudging. Best use is in the first week but starts to thicken up after that, it is still usable for the duration of the bottle but not as smooth as went first opened. I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect eyeliner though. Brush is great for control and easily can switch from thin to thick lines with a little practice. Multiple coats will give it a thicker look but if you are a seasoned liquid eyeliner user you shouldn&#x27;t have to much trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I tried several brands already, all faking in the afternoon. I have used this for a week. It is \\&quot;water/oil proof.\\&quot; Great product in an expensive price. Great.</li>
            <li> It flakes off on its own. No one wants an eyeliner that disapears after 20 min of wearing it. It goes on smoothly but then comes off little by little</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes some times water and this eyeliner is the best I&#x27;ve used so far and doesn&#x27;t come off until I wash it off before sleeping.</li>
            <li> It gets clumpy after a few days..</li>
            <li> The brush tip is too short and can make for a heavier application. It&#x27;s not water proof, sweat and tears wash away the line</li>
            <li> This was absolutely horrible. The brush was choppy and the product flaked off. It lasted maybe five hours tops. Bought it at my local drugstore. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
