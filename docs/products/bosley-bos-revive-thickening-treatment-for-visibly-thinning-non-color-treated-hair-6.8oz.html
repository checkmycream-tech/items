            <li>This Bosley hair thickening foam, as i call it, is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this product as Nioxin is not as easy to get.</li>
            <li>It is an easy to apply foam, that dissolves into the hair.  </li>
            <li>I like how it thickens my fine hair.</li>
            <li>i opened the bottle and notice that it wasnt filled up all the way</li>
            <li>but my lady friend is having fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how good it works considering it does not cost very much!</li>
            <li>its more of a sensation than an actual burn, but i personally liked it</li>
            <li>Most of the new hair is coming in my original color.  </li>
            <li>I am glad amazon offers such good deals also.</li>
            <li>This product uses natural non-harmful chemicals that are meant to provide a clean and healthy scalp.  </li>
            <li>For old guys like me with thinning hair, this seems to keep the hair full and healthy.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is golden.</li>
            <li>It makes your fingers a bit sticky, but rinses right off.  </li>

            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>The product really does work.</li>
            <li>Products like gel, moose, and hair spray very often damage hair.</li>
            <li>So even if it doesn&#x27;t restore thinning hair well, its still way better for your hair than other hair products.  </li>

            <li>wow I will always buy this product .thank</li>
            <li>a) Natural.</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to control hair without those products so the thickening treatment provides a good alternative.</li>
            <li>There are many different causes of hair loss so this may not work for every single person but even if it doesn&#x27;t I would still recommend use of this item for a few reasons.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ive been using bosley for while.i like the product but i dont like it when someone steals my money. i bought this product 1 month ago. i went to go and use it today cause i just finished the rest of my other bottle. i opened the bottle and notice that it wasnt filled up all the way so i decided to weigh it and it came out less than what the bottle says and i thought buying from the salon was expensive, but at least they wont cheat you.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for years with great results. I thought I would try this product as Nioxin is not as easy to get. There is no comparison. THe Nioxin product adds body and makes the hair much more manageable. Back to Nioxin.</li>
            <li> I use this as conditioner.  For old guys like me with thinning hair, this seems to keep the hair full and healthy.  I used this product for 6 - 7 years and have very healthy hair</li>
            <li> I use all the Bosley Revive for non color-treated hair products and love all of them, including this one. I have shoulder length hair and use it around the base layers of my hair to make my whole head of hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> This really works.  My hair is coming back in in some areas and I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 months now.  Most of the new hair is coming in my original color.  Not silver.  It gives my hair great body and the appearance of much thicker hair.  I had 4 sets of samples from my hairdresser then I purchased the starter kit from Amazon.  I shampoo about 3 times a week and am almost done with the starter kit.  I have already ordered and received the larger bottles of shampoo and conditioner and the mouse.  Love it.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good Product at a Good Price</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to have more body and bounce when I use this.  I use it with the shampoo and conditioner and it is a wonderful trio of products. I am glad amazon offers such good deals also.</li>
            <li> Best price, super shipping, not sure how it is working on me but my lady friend is having fantastic results.</li>
            <li> This Bosley hair thickening foam, as i call it, is pretty good. If you want thicker hair use this and a Bosley shampoo, for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Thickings hair,&lt;br /&gt;Smells good,&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Itches head ( for some),&lt;br /&gt;Not seeing hair growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an okay product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Buy oil for your scalp, eat healthy, and eat vitamins.</li>
            <li> Along with Revive shampoo and conditioner has given me noticeably thicker hair within a few months!</li>
            <li> I use the Bosley Revive System with Shampoo, Conditioner and Thickening treatment. It has made a noticible difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely find less hair on the floor while using this.</li>
            <li> Magic thickening foam this stuff is golden. I am so so happy I bought this. It makes my hair nice n thick. I use it with the shampoo. The 2 together my hair is nice n thick n full what a huge difference I never thought it would work. wow I will always buy this product .thank god for this!</li>
            <li> Slowed down hair loss</li>
            <li> All the Bosley products I have used are top of the line. You do notice a difference in hair thickness and texture after a couple weeks of consistent use. It seems to help promote new hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and fresh. The first few times it burned a little bit..its more of a sensation than an actual burn, but i personally liked it (i felt it was working). My hair did get a little bit thicker with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You should definetly use it with the Bosley shampoo and conditioner if thats the brand you go with for your hairloss products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year.  I like how it thickens my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is growing back. The product really does work.</li>
            <li> been using this twice a day for months now with no difference. doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great along with the Revive shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair. I stopped using it for awhile and noticed my hair thinning again a little...started back up and my hair is looking great. Bosley is great product!</li>
            <li> This treatment is helping in a very short time.  It is an easy to apply foam, that dissolves into the hair.  It is virtually no aroma.  It makes your fingers a bit sticky, but rinses right off.  I had tried the Rogaine, but it made my scalp itch.  I couldn&#x27;t stand the itching.  This is working even better.  Beside it helping my thin hair, it leaves my hair (although there is not that much of it :D) quite manageable.  I have had thin hair all my life.  Now that I am older, it is even worse.  This product has helped a lot!  I am surprised at how good it works considering it does not cost very much!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have now used this for more than six months and I am very pleased!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product works well, I did see a difference when I used.  I recommend this if your hair is a little thin or you just want a fuller look.  Product is light and isn&#x27;t thick like gels and as stated works well..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those with thinning hair. Although it may be my imagination, I honestly feel like this product has worked well for me. There are many different causes of hair loss so this may not work for every single person but even if it doesn&#x27;t I would still recommend use of this item for a few reasons.  a) Natural. This product uses natural non-harmful chemicals that are meant to provide a clean and healthy scalp.  b) Better than gel. Products like gel, moose, and hair spray very often damage hair. It can be difficult to control hair without those products so the thickening treatment provides a good alternative. It is a thickening treatment that actually provides a pretty decent amount of hold to keep hair in place and shaped nicely. This has worked well for me (I have short hair) and completely replaced my use of gel and hairspray. So even if it doesn&#x27;t restore thinning hair well, its still way better for your hair than other hair products.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has thinning hair, even just to try it out. You can also get a smaller sample version if you purchase the starter set with the shampoo and conditioner (which I also recommend).</li>
            <li> I WOULDN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE. I have been using these products for over a year and plan to continue until the Lord takes me home.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 6 months and I think my hair has not thinned anymore.  Will try for another 6 months to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> Great product great service</li>
            <li> This product helps my hair to feel and look thicker, it adds more body and texture to my thinning hair. I&#x27;ve used this product for 4 1/2 months. It was recommended by my new hair stylist and I purchased a starter kit of the products from her. Decided to see if I could the Bosley products for a lower price and did through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product, I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of hair thickener there is..... NONE of them have worked.  The Bosley stuff actually works.  I&#x27;m shocked.  My wife even noticed it and I already have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes... I&#x27;ve already re ordered.  Word of advice.. this isn&#x27;t a wonder drug... it takes 2-3 months (hair has to grow in...) to see any results and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  Point is to get it on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. He has been really happy with the results and we both feel like we can see a visible difference. We&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
            <li> This product work really good with the Bosley shampoo and Conditioner. I can see the new little hairs growing on my scalp, nice scent and adds body and volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> Will not buy it again. It does not thicken.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year now. I can say that I have seen a little regrowth and it does thicken my hair a bit. I feel that it has slowed down my thinning hair, but it did not reverse my balding. I can&#x27;t use the stuff like rogaine or the medicated one from bosley, because I get an allergic reaction to them.</li>
