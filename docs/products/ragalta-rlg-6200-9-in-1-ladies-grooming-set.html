            <li>It&#x27;s compact and the bag is nice to keep everything together and organized.</li>
            <li>The company was great and sent me a replacement right away.  </li>

            <li>I love my mini clippers they work magic on all my body parts that need it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>muneco love that.</li>
            <li>I LOVE tgis mini razor.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have known better</li>
            <li>I notice that is a good size that fits into the palm of my hands just right.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever \\&quot;Lady\\&quot; trimmer and for the most part it is a good one.</li>
            <li>it was really cheap.</li>
            <li>This shaver fell apart the first time i used it, even the power button.it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The battery last for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I should have known better and invest a little more money but get better quality.</li>
            <li>make sure you have good batteries while trimming, that slow blade will pinch you.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t use it until my other one stopped working - this one is so much better, I love it.  </li>
            <li>The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I use the trimmer first then tweeze for.</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughters birthday the first time she want to use it the switch broke.</li>
            <li>Now my girlfriend keeps her funny places clean and soft...</li>
            <li>It does not come with batteries but comes with a little pouch to hold everything which is nice.</li>
            <li>besides that its a nice little machine</li>
            <li>Didnt really care for this trimmer...</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>Overall, I give it 4 stars because it gets the job done and its small, convenient and inexpensive but the added pieces are not so great.</li>
            <li>I tend to grow hair quickly and cannot keep up by only tweezing.</li>
            <li>I put brand new batteries in it and it does not work.</li>
            <li>The actual trimmer works pretty well.</li>
            <li>, I chose this one specifically for the trimmer, so the extra stuff is an added bonus (even if they don&#x27;t work very well).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does very well shaving in all areas, however it does grab a little bit</li>

            <li> It is a little noisy, sounds about as loud as an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it its cheap too, not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Be careful they are fragile</li>

            <li> It is small and has a few different attachments for trimming different lengths but they don&#x27;t trim so well with them on</li>
            <li> The blades were not that sharp and pulled the hair in some areas.</li>
            <li> The little guides are pretty useless because they don&#x27;t stay on the &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; you choose.  </li>
            <li> Lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li> It does grab a little, but all the trimmers I&#x27;ve tried do.</li>

            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> This thing is awful and isnt worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I used 3 times and then it was broken.</li>
            <li> There is also an eyebrow trimmer attachment but have not tried it because I am too afraid I&#x27;ll shave off all of my eyebrows.</li>

            <li> this thing is awesome,lots of power,does a great job,too.just love it.sharp and fast as can be,for the price,i more than got a good bargain for it.</li>
            <li> I love my mini clippers they work magic on all my body parts that need it.  I notice that is a good size that fits into the palm of my hands just right.  They are wonderful.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is so convenient and you could take it along in your bag and use it whenever you want to</li>
            <li> Now my girlfriend keeps her funny places clean and soft... muneco love that. the product was delivered according to the agreed conditions and at the time indicated</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t work at all.  The company was great and sent me a replacement right away.  The little guides are pretty useless because they don&#x27;t stay on the &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; you choose.  The actual trimmer works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again.  It has everything you need to keep neat and tidy.  It&#x27;s compact and the bag is nice to keep everything together and organized.</li>
            <li> I tend to grow hair quickly and cannot keep up by only tweezing. I use the trimmer first then tweeze for. Facial hair</li>
            <li> Junk &amp; broke within a few days</li>
            <li> Didnt really care for this trimmer... It didnt do anything 99% of the time</li>
            <li> I LOVE tgis mini razor. It does very well shaving in all areas, however it does grab a little bit but otherwise i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first ever \\&quot;Lady\\&quot; trimmer and for the most part it is a good one. It was inexpensive and shipped fast. It is small and has a few different attachments for trimming different lengths but they don&#x27;t trim so well with them on so i just go close with the trimmer alone. There is also an eyebrow trimmer attachment but have not tried it because I am too afraid I&#x27;ll shave off all of my eyebrows. There is also a shaver for a complete shave, or at least its supposed to be but it doesn&#x27;t work very well but it isn&#x27;t what i bought it for anyway, I chose this one specifically for the trimmer, so the extra stuff is an added bonus (even if they don&#x27;t work very well). It does not come with batteries but comes with a little pouch to hold everything which is nice. It is a little noisy, sounds about as loud as an electric toothbrush. Overall, I give it 4 stars because it gets the job done and its small, convenient and inexpensive but the added pieces are not so great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it until my other one stopped working - this one is so much better, I love it.  there are a variety of attachments which make it easier to do what you need to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, but this one works very well. It does grab a little, but all the trimmers I&#x27;ve tried do.</li>
            <li> This thing is awful and isnt worth the money I paid for it. I guess I should have known better it was really cheap. Doesnt work at all</li>
            <li> This shaver fell apart the first time i used it, even the power button.it is very cheaply made. Dont buy it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I can shave without the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;now i can look fabolous with out the side effects</li>
            <li> I was using my boyfriends and when I saw this one in purple I had to have it.  Be careful they are fragile</li>
            <li> The battery last for a good amount of time. The blades were not that sharp and pulled the hair in some areas.</li>
            <li> Out of the box this thing was junk, it turned on but didn&#x27;t cut any hair with out pinching and pulling.</li>
            <li> make sure you have good batteries while trimming, that slow blade will pinch you. besides that its a nice little machine</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughters birthday the first time she want to use it the switch broke. she just turned 14.</li>
            <li> Bought this product since it had a really good price. I used 3 times and then it was broken. Lasted less than a month. I should have known better and invest a little more money but get better quality.</li>
            <li> I put brand new batteries in it and it does not work. don&#x27;t buy it its cheap too, not happy at all!</li>
            <li> not the greatest... doesnt cut very good. used it once and that was it. probably wont use it again. waste of money</li>
